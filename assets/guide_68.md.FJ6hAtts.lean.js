The village sits in a hilly region of Palermo's hinterland, from the Sicilian capital. History The first inhabited centre in the area lies on top of the adjacent Mount Jato, dating back to prehistoric times, with influence of Greek culture from the 6th century BC.http://www.archinst.uzh.ch/Ietas.htm (German) Known under the name of Iaitas in Greek sources and Ietas in Latin, this ancient village lived its most flourishing period in its history from the age of Islamic domination of Sicily to the Hohenstaufen one (c. 975-1246), when it was an important stronghold. It is believed that the last remnants of the original Muslim stronghold were demolished in 1246 by the troops of Frederick II of Sicily. The modern village was founded in 1779 at the foot of Mount Jato. It was known simply as San Giuseppe, until 1864 when the suffix Jato was added to differentiate it from San Giuseppe Vesuviano, near Naples. San Giuseppe Jato is the birthplace of Giovanni Brusca, a notorious mafioso who, in 1996, was arrested for the assassination of Judge Giovanni Falcone, a prominent Sicilian anti-mafia campaigner. Economy Like many villages and towns in the north of Sicily, its inhabitants rely on the production of corn, olives and grapes for their livelihood. Each September the village holds a Festival of Grapes and Wine where these commodities and other agricultural produce is displayed. The area around San Giuseppe Jato is also known for its beef cattle breeding and as a centre for woodturning and iron works. In media The movie Sicilian Ghost Story tells the real story of 11-year-old Giuseppe Di Mateo's 1993 kidnapping, strangling and disposal in an acid vat after 779 days in captivity on 11 January 1996 in San Giuseppe Jato by Sicilian Mafia boss Giovanni Brusca in retaliation for Giuseppe's father Santino Di Matteo's turning state witness (\\"pentito\\") in the case of anti-Mafia Judge Giovanni Falcone's murder.

Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between deciding and choosing. Deciding is a computational activity, something that can ultimately be programmed. It is the capacity to choose that ultimately makes us human. Choice, however, is the product of judgment, not calculation. Comprehensive human judgment is able to include non-mathematical factors such as emotions. Judgment can compare apples and oranges, and can do so without quantifying each fruit type and then reductively quantifying each to factors necessary for mathematical comparison.

There are both black and brown button spiders in Southern Africa. Six Latrodectus species can be found in Southern Africa; five of them are native, one is possibly imported. Venom All species of Latrodectus are venomous to humans, and their bite constitutes a medical emergency. Envenomation by these spiders can be fatal to children and ill or infirm adults. Ordinarily, the body mass of a healthy adult is sufficient to dilute the venom to less than a fatal concentration. In most species, only the female spider is capable of effectively delivering the venom to humans as the males have much smaller chelicerae. Although rarely fatal, the symptoms of the bite are often incredibly painful and medical attention is recommended following any Latrodectus species bite, as complications relating to the bite can arise. Treatment of bites is usually supportive, administering opiates for pain and benzodiazepines for spasms. An antidote is available in South Africa for the bites of both L. indistinctus and L. geometricus, however it is only used for severe cases of envenomation due to its potentially severe side effects.http://ewhighered.mcgraw- hill.com/sites/dl/free/0071437630/358186/goldfrank_toxicology_chap115a.pdf Individuals who are allergic to the venom may also require epinephrine (adrenaline) or diphenhydramine to treat subsequent anaphylaxis. Button spider species The species are informally divided into two groups, based on their colour: The black button spiders are black or brown in colour (and generally adorned with red dorsal markings), and include the following species: * L. cinctus (east coast button spider) * L. indistinctus (west coast button spider) * L. karooensis (Karoo button spider) * L. renivulvatus (inland button spider) All of these spiders are native to Southern Africa. The brown button spiders are lighter in color than the black button spiders and have a red hourglass marking under the abdomen (not above); there are two brown button species: * L. geometricus (brown button spider) * L. rhodesienses (Zimbabwe button spider) L. geometricus is found in many parts of the world (including in the United States where it is known as the brown widow spider); it is unknown where this species' origins are. L. rhodesienses is native to Africa. Both brown button species have the famed hourglass markings of the black widow from other countries on their abdomens, but are generally lighter in color. The brown button spiders' venom is less toxic to humans than the venom of the black buttons.

Today the preserved corpse is a tourist attraction.  Background  Kahlbutz was born in Kampehl, Brandenburg. According to local legend, \\"Knight Kalebuz,\\" as he was known, frequently exercised the right of droit du seigneur. He had eleven children of his own and at least thirty other illegitimate children. While exercising this \\"right\\" in July 1690, he chose the bride of a shepherd from B√ºckwitz. She refused him and because of the laws governing the right of first night, he murdered the shepherd. Although there were no witnesses, the shepherd's bride, Maria Leppin, accused Kahlbutz of the murder and took him to court in Dreetz (Brandenburg). As an aristocrat he had special rights and could swear an oath of innocence before the court in order to free himself. Kahlbutz did this and was immediately acquitted. Kahlbutz died in Kampehl at the age of 52 and was laid to rest in a double coffin in the family tomb. In 1783 the last of the von Kahlbutz line died. While the church of Kampehl was being renovated in 1794 the coffins in the church were going to be buried in the cemetery like all the other coffins. When the coffins were opened it was discovered that all of the corpses except that of the Knight Kahlbutz had decayed.  Legend  The local populace quickly found an explanation for the Mummy of the Knight of Kahlbutz. They said that it was God's punishment for the murder of the shepherd. It had been said that Kahlbutz had sworn before the court, \\"It was not I, otherwise after my death my body will not decay\\".  Natural mummification  Mummy of Christian Friedrich von Kahlbutz Christian Friedrich von Kahlbutz, detail Several tests have been done on the mummy of the knight to figure out why a body that apparently was not embalmed has not undergone the natural decay process. In the 1890s, Rudolf Virchow and Ferdinand Sauerbruch tested the mummy as did Charit√©, the largest university hospital in Europe, but all without success. It remains a mystery as to why Kahlbutz's corpse has not decayed, but there are a few other similar cases where the natural decay process has not affected the individual. The natural decay process of a corpse can be stopped or retarded under certain circumstances, in which the corpse becomes leathery. Air conditions surrounding the body as well as the condition of the ground in which it is buried are most often contributing factors. Absolute dryness, local radioactivity, or other ground factors such as acidity or salts. Also hermetically sealed coffins without steadily moving air can contribute. Likewise, a small ingestion of poisonous medicines, i.e. very small quantities innocuous to an individual, during one's lifetime can aid in the mummification process after death. These kinds of substances are not readily detectable long after death though since the fat and water in the corpse changes and evaporates over time. Today it is accepted that Kahlbutz suffered from some kind of illness, which caused an emaciation of his body. Possible diseases that he suffered from are cancer, muscular dystrophy, and tuberculosis. There is evidence that he did in fact suffer from the latter. According to several sources, Kahlbutz suffocated on his own blood, which suggests that shortly before his death he lost a great deal of blood. After his death he was buried in an oak double coffin. Bodily decay may have been prevented by the fact that prior to being hermetically sealed in the coffin, he had lost a great deal of blood, in combination with the lack of soil containing decay-accelerating materials.

Description  Redlichia has a rather flat and thinly calcified dorsal exoskeleton of inverted egg- shaped outline, about 1¬Ω√ó longer than wide, measured across the base of the genal spines and disregarding the spine on the 11th segment of the articulated middle part of the body (or thorax). The headshield (or cephalon) is semicircular, about ‚Öì√ó as long as the body, with clear genal spines that are a smooth continuation of the border, that extend backward and outward and curving to be near parallel near their tips, which typically extend to the backhalf of the articulated middle part of the body (or thorax). The thorax consists of 11-17 segments, with the 11th from the front bearing a backward directed spine on the midline.  Taxonomy  Redlich originally named the genus Hoeferia in 1899. It turned out however, that this name was already given to an arcid bivalve by Bittner in 1894, rendering it an unavailable junior homonym.

As a powerful consort kin, he dominated government in the 150s together with his sister, Empress Liang Na. After his sister's death, Liang Ji was overthrown in a coup d'etat by Emperor Huan, with the support of the eunuch faction, in 159. The Liang clan and the clan of his wife, Sun Shou (Â≠´Â£Ω), were slaughtered.  Family background and early career  Liang Ji was the oldest son of Liang Shang () -- an honest official who was also the Marquess of Chengshi, being the grandson of a brother of Consort Liang, the mother of Emperor He. His younger sister, Liang Na, became Emperor Shun's consort in 128, and was created empress in 132. After Empress Liang became empress, Emperor Shun entrusted her father Liang Shang with great power. In 133, Emperor Shun offered to create Liang Ji a marquess, but Liang Shang humbly declined that honor on his son's behalf. In 135, Emperor Shun made Liang Shang Grand Marshal (), over his own repeated objection. Liang Shang was a mild-mannered and honest man, although lacking in abilities. He did, however, trust other capable and honest officials, and during his term of office, the political scene was a lot cleaner than before. It was probably during this time that Liang Ji married his wife, Sun Shou. She was often described by traditional historians as a temptress who was able to induce Liang to be devoted to her sexually (although somewhat contradictorily, the traditional historians also described both heterosexual and homosexual affairs for Liang Ji, including one with his servant Qin Gong (), who was described as having a m√©nage √† trois-type relationship with both Liang and Sun), and she was described to have invented a good number of sexually explicit clothing items. In 136, because both his father and his brother-in- law trusted him, Liang Ji was made the mayor of the capital Luoyang. However, what neither of them knew was that Liang Ji was violent, corrupt, and treacherous. On one occasion, one of Liang Shang's trusted advisors, L√º Fang (), the magistrate for Luoyang County (one of the subdivisions of the Luoyang municipality of which Liang Ji was mayor) warned Liang Shang about Liang Ji's corruption, and Liang Shang rebuked his son. Liang Ji then sent assassins out and killed L√º, but appeared to be so mournful about it that he recommended L√º's brother L√º Yu () to succeed L√º Fang and permitted L√º Yu to arrest and execute all who were suspected in the assassination, leading to the death of hundreds of people.  As Grand Marshal under Emperor Shun  In 141, Liang Shang died. Liang Ji inherited his march. Later that year, Emperor Shun made him Grand Marshal, succeeding his father, and made his younger brother Liang Buyi () -- an honest and humble man, relative to his brother‚Äîmayor of Luoyang. As Grand Marshal, Liang Ji gradually eliminated the opposition and consolidated his power, often through violent, illicit, or treacherous means. For example, in 142, because he was criticized by the lower-level official Zhang Gang (), he intentionally made Zhang the governor of Guanglin Commandery, at that time overrun by agrarian rebels, believing that Zhang would surely be killed by these rebels. (However, Zhang was eventually able to convince these rebels to surrender, and governed the commandery with efficiency and honesty.)  As Grand Marshal under Emperors Chong and Zhi  Emperor Shun died in 144. His infant son Liu Bing (), by Consort Yu, became emperor (as Emperor Chong), and Empress Liang became empress dowager and regent. Empress Dowager Liang appeared to be diligent in governing over the empire, and she trusted several key officials with integrity to advise her on important affairs. However, she also trusted her brother Liang Ji greatly, and Liang Ji used her position to further consolidate his own. However, she was willing to go against his advice on a number of occasions, and she, for example, protected the honest official Li Gu () against Liang Ji's demands to execute Li, in 145. In 145, the young Emperor Chong died, and in an effort to be open to people, Empress Dowager Liang announced his death openly immediately. She summoned the young emperor's third cousins Liu Suan (), the Prince of Qinghe, and Liu Zuan (), the son of Liu Hong () the Prince of Le'an, to the capital Luoyang, to be examined as potential successors. Prince Suan was probably an adult, and was described as solemn and proper, and the key officials largely favored him. However, Liang Ji wanted a young emperor whom he could control, so he convinced Empress Dowager Liang to make the seven- year-old Liu Zuan emperor (as Emperor Zhi). Empress Dowager Liang continued to serve as regent. In 146, after the young Emperor Zhi showed signs that he was already cognizant of Liang Ji's corruption and offended Liang Ji by openly calling him \\"an arrogant general,\\" Liang Ji had him poisoned, apparently without Empress Dowager Liang's knowledge. The key officials again largely favored Prince Suan as successor, but Liang Ji again vetoed their wishes, and instead persuaded Empress Dowager Liang to make the 14-year-old Liu Zhi (), the Marquess of Liwu, who was betrothed to Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji's sister Liang N√ºying, emperor (as Emperor Huan). Empress Dowager Liang continued to serve as regent.  As Grand Marshal under Emperor Huan  It was really during Emperor Huan's reign that Liang Ji exercised near absolute power. He tried to ensure that power by also establishing relationships with Emperor Huan's trusted eunuchs, often presenting them with great gifts, but also making show of force to anyone (eunuchs or non-eunuch officials) that he could cause the death of anyone he wanted to kill. In 147, for example, in conjunction with eunuchs Tang Heng () and Zuo Guan (), he falsely accused Li Gu and Prince Suan of a conspiracy to start a military rebellion. Prince Suan was demoted to be Marquess of Weishi, and he committed suicide. Li, and another key official who opposed Liang Ji, Du Qiao (), were executed. Also in 147, Emperor Huan married Liang Ji's sister Liang N√ºying and created her empress. In 150, Empress Dowager Liang died, shortly after she announced that she was returning imperial powers to Emperor Huan. However, Liang Ji remained in effective control of the government‚Äîperhaps even more so than before, with his sister now no longer curbing his power. His wife Sun was created the Lady of Xiangcheng, with a march rivaling his own large one. Both of them built luxurious mansions with huge gardens in the rear, and collected innumerable precious items. Liang, further, forced commoners into slavery, and also falsely accused a large number of rich people of crimes, in order to execute them and confiscate their properties. In 151, Liang made a critical error that nearly caused him great harm‚Äîhe, in contravention to imperial regulations not to bring weapons into the imperial meeting hall, strided in with his sword. The imperial secretary Zhang Ling () rebuked him and moved to impeach him, and while Liang, who was actually still in control of the government, was not impeached, he was greatly embarrassed and penalized by surrendering one year's worth of salary. Because Zhang had been recommended by his brother Liang Buyi, Liang Ji became suspicious of his brother and removed him as the mayor of Luoyang‚Äîgiving that post to his own son, the 15-year-old Liang Yin (), who was utterly incompetent. Liang Ji further expelled Liang Buyi's friends out of the government. Liang Ji, apparently unsatisfied with his nearly limitless position, took a number of actions that were directly analogous to what Wang Mang did prior to his usurpation of the Han throne‚Äîincluding ordering officials to recommend to Emperor Huan to enlarge his march to be as large as the Duke of Zhou; to grant him special dispensation, unprecedented since Xiao He, to walk slowly into the imperial meeting hall (by Han regulations, officials were required to trot into the imperial meeting hall), to carry his sword into the meeting hall, to keep his shoes on, and to have the master of ceremonies refer to him only by rank and title, not by name; to grant him rewards as great as those granted to Huo Guang; and for him to be seated above all other imperial officials. This brought expectation that Liang might be interested in usurping the throne eventually. All who dared to criticize him invited certain death.  Loss of power and death  In 159, Liang Ji's sister Empress Liang N√ºying died‚Äîwhich, oddly enough, set in motion a chain of events that would end Liang Ji's power. Liang, in order to continue to control Emperor Huan, had adopted his wife's beautiful cousin (the stepdaughter of her uncle Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÁ¥Ä‚Äînote different character despite same pronunciation)), Deng Mengn√º, as his own daughter, changing her family name to Liang. He and Sun gave Liang Mengn√º to Emperor Huan as an imperial consort, and, after Empress Liang's death, hoped to have her eventually created empress. To completely control her, Liang Ji planned to have her mother, Lady Xuan (), killed, and in fact sent assassins against her, but the assassination was foiled by the powerful eunuch Yuan She (), a neighbor of Lady Xuan. Lady Xuan reported the assassination attempt to Emperor Huan, who was greatly angered. He entered into a conspiracy with eunuchs Tang Heng, Zuo Guan, Shan Chao (), Xu Huang (), and Ju Yuan () to overthrow Liang‚Äîsealing the oath by biting open Shan's arm and swearing by his blood. Liang Ji had some suspicions about what Emperor Huan and the eunuchs were up to, and he investigated. The five eunuchs quickly reacted. They had Emperor Huan openly announce that he was taking back power from Liang Ji and mobilize the imperial guards to guard the palace against a counterattack by Liang, and then surrounded Liang's house and forced him to surrender. Liang and Sun were unable to respond and committed suicide. The entire Liang and Sun clans (except for Liang Ji's brothers Liang Buyi and Liang Meng (), who had already died) were arrested and slaughtered. A large number of officials were executed or deposed for close association with Liang‚Äîso many that the government was almost unable to function for some time. Liang and Sun's properties were confiscated by the imperial treasury, which allowed the taxes to be reduced by 50% for one year. The people greatly celebrated Liang Ji's death.

History The bay was first explored and given the name Tumby Bay by Matthew Flinders in 1802, after a parish in Lincolnshire, England. In 1840 Governor Gawler renamed the bay Harvey('s) Bay after one other district's early settlers. Then on 15 November 1900 the town of Tumby was proclaimed by Governor Tennyson, and the name of the bay itself reverted to Tumby Bay. On 14 June 1984 the town officially became known as Tumby Bay. The earliest settlers to the district arrived in the 1840s, and farmed the area with wheat and sheep predominantly. The town soon grew into an important grain storage and loading point, with a jetty constructed in 1874, only the second to be built on the Eyre Peninsula. This provided a much needed outlet for the copper ore which was coming from the Burrowing Mine. The original jetty was taken down in 1999 due to safety concerns, but the other newer jetty is still in use. The town's first school was opened in 1881 as 'Tumby', and the district's first hospital opened in 1913. Tumby Bay hosted the popular event Triple J's One Night Stand on 2 April 2011, featuring the bands Birds of Tokyo, Art vs. Science and The Jezabels and locally \\"Unearthed\\" musician Joshy Willo. The town's population swelled from 1,000 to over 12,000 for the event.Print Email Share Tumby Bay to rock for One Night Stand The historic Tumby Bay Hotel in North Terrace is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Geography The Tumby Bay hotelTumby Bay lies on the large, sheltered bay of the same name on the western side of Spencer Gulf. Much of the land surrounding Tumby Bay is used for agriculture. The coast is predominantly white, sandy beaches, on which the town itself is situated, as well as towering cliffs to the south. Inside the bay, Tumby Island is the only island but further offshore lie the Sir Joseph Banks Group, a small archipelago that is easily accessed by boat from Tumby Bay. Like much of coastal South Australia, Tumby Bay experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm to hot summers and moderately wet winters. Economy Since it was first settled, Tumby Bay has predominantly been an agriculturally driven town, with cereal crops, sheep and beef commonly farmed. As with many towns on the Eyre Peninsula, Tumby Bay also has a well-established professional fishing industry. Tumby Bay Foreshore Park with mural = Tourism = Tumby Bay is a popular holiday destination during the summer months. One of the major drawcards to the area is its fishing, with a wide array of fish species available, including King George Whiting and Snapper. Fishing can be enjoyed from the town jetty, the surrounding beach and rock areas, as well as from a boat, which allows access to the Sir Joseph Banks Group. In 2001, a marina was constructed to allow easy all weather boat launching for a range of boat sizes, as well as opening up new real estate options. The safe, calm waters and the white sand of the bay lend themselves to a variety of watersports including swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving and water skiing for those with access to a boat. The town has a caravan park and a number of hotels and apartments offering tourist accommodation. The township affords easy access to a variety of facilities and shops.  Scuba diving  The ecological communities on and around the pylons supporting the Tumby Bay jetty make for an interesting and easy shore dive. Visiting divers must bring their own equipment, as no dive shop exists in the town. Alternatively, equipment can be hired from dive shops in Port Lincoln (45 km south-west) or Whyalla (221 km north-east). Community Anglican church, Tumby Bay Tumby Bay had a town population of 1228 in the 2001 census, with the vast majority being Australian born. Of those that immigrated (about 100 people), most are from the United Kingdom, with others coming from a variety of European countries, the United States and New Zealand. The 2001 census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that the main religion followed in Tumby Bay was Christianity, with the Anglican, Catholic, and Uniting denominations having the strongest followings. The overall religious affiliations are summed up in the chart, derived from the census data. There are a number of churches in the town, including Anglican, Uniting, Church of Christ and Lutheran Churches. There are also a large number of sporting groups in the town, including football, cricket, netball, basketball, tennis, bowls and golf clubs, with most of the clubs competing in local leagues. The Tumby Bay Area School provides education for students from Reception through to Year 12. A public library is located on the school grounds. A hospital is also in place to serve the health needs of the town. The region's history is celebrated by a National Trust Museum which is staffed by volunteers. Social historian and Tumby Bay resident Eric Kotz has also published two books about life in the region. Media The town was briefly the home to a newspaper, the Western People and Tumby Bay Times (19 June - 3 July 1912), which was printed locally by Walter Augustine Wade. Government Tumby Bay is encompassed in the District Council of Tumby Bay local government area with the current mayor being Sam Telfer. The town is also incorporated in the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Flinders and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Grey.  Transport  Tumby Bay is normally reached by private car via the Lincoln Highway that runs along the east coastline of the Eyre Peninsula. Although the town does have a sealed airfield, it is not usually used for private flights, but for the Flying Doctor and crop spraying aircraft. The town is serviced daily by Stateliner coaches. = Port and Rail = Land has been purchased north east of Tumby Bay for the purposes of developing a bulk commodities export port. The site has been referred to as Sheep Hill, and the project now bears the name of Port Spencer. Centrex Metals Ltd is the project proponent. The site is located immediately north of Lipson Cove. The proposed port (if approved) will be capable of loading Capesize ships (either directly or by transshipment) for export of iron ore and potentially, grain. A potential rail connection to the Eyre Peninsula Railway at Ungarra, away, has been discarded in preference for a slurry pipeline for iron ore transport.

The Loop Current is an extension of the western boundary current of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre.Perez-Brunius, Paula; Candela, Julio; Garcia- Carrillo, Paula; Furey, Heather; Bower, Amy; Hamilton, Peter; and Leben, Robert. (March 2018). \\"Dominant Circulation Patterns of the Deep Gulf of Mexico.\\" Journal of Physical Oceanography. American Meteorological Society. 48(3):511. https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0140.1 AMS website Retrieved 27 August 2018. Serving as the dominant circulation feature in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Loop Currents transports between 23 and 27 sverdrups and reaches maximum flow speeds of from 1.5 to 1.8 meters/second. A related feature is an area of warm water with an \\"eddy\\" or \\"Loop Current ring\\" that separates from the Loop Current, somewhat randomly every 3 to 17 months. Swirling at 1.8 to 2 meters/second, these rings drift to the west at speeds of 2 to 5 kilometers/day and have a lifespan of up to a year before they bump into the coast of Texas or Mexico. These eddies are composed of warm Caribbean waters and possess physical properties that isolate the masses from surrounding Gulf Common Waters. The rings can measure 200 to 400 kilometers in diameter and extend down to a depth of 1000 meters. Effect on tropical cyclones Around 1970, it was believed that the Loop Current exhibited an annual cycle in which the Loop feature extended farther to the north during the summer. Further study over the past few decades, however, has shown that the extension to the north (and the shedding of eddies) does not have a significant annual cycle, but does vacillate in the north-south and east-west directions on an inter-annual basis. The Loop Current and its eddies may be detected by measuring sea surface level. Sea surface level of both the eddies and the Loop on September 21, 2005 was up to 60 cm (24 in) higher than surrounding water, indicating a deep area of warm water beneath them. On that day, Hurricane Rita passed over the Loop current and intensified into a Category 5 storm with the help of the warm water. In the Gulf of Mexico, the deepest areas of warm water are associated with the Loop Current and the rings of current that have separated from the Loop Current are commonly called Loop Current eddies. The warm waters of the Loop Current and its associated eddies provide more energy to hurricanes and allow them to intensify. As hurricanes pass over warm areas of the Gulf of Mexico, they convert the ocean's heat into storm energy. As this energy is removed from the seas, a wake of colder water can be detected along the hurricane's path. This is because heat is withdrawn from the ocean mixed layer in a number of ways. For instance, sensible and latent heat are lost directly to the tropical cyclone across the air-sea interface. Also, the horizontal divergence of wind-driven mixed layer currents results in the upwelling of colder thermocline water. Finally, the turbulent entrainment of colder thermocline waters caused by wind stirring also results in the cooling of the surface waters. These are the reasons that the depth of the ocean mixed layer is more important in hurricane deepening than sea surface temperature. A thin veneer of warm surface waters will be more susceptible to hurricane induced cooling than waters with a larger mixed layer and deeper thermocline. Furthermore, models suggest that cyclones are more likely to reach a larger fraction of their maximum potential intensity over warm oceanic features where the 26 ¬∞C isotherm extends beyond 100 meters. An example of how deep warm water, including the Loop Current, can allow a hurricane to strengthen, if other conditions are also favorable, is Hurricane Camille, which made landfall on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in August 1969. Camille formed in the deep warm waters of the Caribbean, which enabled it to rapidly intensify into a category 3 hurricane in one day. It rounded the western tip of Cuba, and its path took it directly over the Loop Current, all the way north towards the coast, during which time the rapid intensification continued. Camille became a category 5 hurricane, with an intensity rarely seen, and extremely high winds that were maintained until landfall ( sustained winds were estimated to have occurred in a very small area to the right of the eye). In 1980, Hurricane Allen strengthened to a category 5 hurricane while moving over the Loop Current, but it weakened before landfall in Texas. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita both greatly increased in strength when they passed over the warmer waters of the Loop Current. Hurricane Wilma of 2005 was expected to make its Florida landfall as a category 2 hurricane, but after encountering the southeastern portion of the Loop Current, it reached the Florida coast as a category 3 instead. While not as infamous as Katrina, Hurricane Opal most definitively illustrates the deepening abilities of a warm core ring. After crossing the Yucatan peninsula, Opal reentered the Gulf of Mexico and passed over an eddy shed by the Loop Current. Within a fourteen-hour period, sea surface pressure dropped from 965 to 916 hectaPasals, surface winds increased from 35 to 60 meters/second, and the storm condensed from a radius of 40 kilometers to 25 kilometers. Prior to the storm, the 20 ¬∞C isotherm was located at a depth between 175 and 200 meters, but was found 50 meters shallower after the storm had passed. While the majority of this hurricane induced cooling of the mixed layer was attributed to upwelling (due to Ekman divergence), another 2000 to 3000 watts/meter squared were estimated to be lost through heat flux at the air-water interface of the storm's core. Furthermore, buoy-derived sea surface temperature readings recorded temperature dropping 2¬∞ to 3 ¬∞C as Opal passed over Gulf Common Waters, but only 0.5¬∞ to 1 ¬∞C as the storm encountered the more massive ocean mixed layer associated with the warm core eddy. In 2008, Hurricane Gustav transited the Loop Current, but due to the current's temperature (then only in the high 80's-degrees-F) and truncated size (extending only halfway from Cuba to Louisiana, with cooler water in-between its tip and the Louisiana coast) the storm remained a category 3 hurricane instead of increasing strength as it passed over the current. Hurricane Ivan rode the Loop Current twice in 2004. =Process= Hurricane strengthening and weakening is the product of extensive thermodynamic interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. Generally speaking, the evolution of a hurricane's intensity is determined by three factors. First, the initial intensity of a tropical cyclone is a predominant factor and its strength will be reflected throughout the storm's life. Second, the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere through which the cyclone moves will affects its ability to strengthen, as strong horizontal winds will disperse internal circulation and prevent the vertical stacking of energy within the storm. The third component affecting hurricane intensity is the heat exchange between the upper layer of ocean waters and the core of the storm. For this reason, a major focus of hurricane research has been sea surface temperature prior to a storm. However, recent studies have revealed that surface temperature is less important in hurricane deepening than the depth of the ocean mixed layer. In fact, a hurricane's sea level pressure has been shown to be more closely correlated with the 26 ¬∞C isotherm depth (and oceanic heat content) than the sea surface temperature. Storms passing over the Loop Current or warm core eddies have access to more tepid water, and therefore the higher energy content of the heated molecules. Once Hurricane Rita left the Loop Current and passed over cooler water, it declined in strength, but the main factor in this weakening was an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) occurring at that time. The ERC and other atmospheric factors are why Rita did not reintensify when subsequently passing over the eddy vortex. Also of note: tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes gain strength from, but are not steered by, the temperature of the water. They are steered by the atmosphere, and the atmospheric level involved in steering a hurricane is different at different intensities (i.e., it relates to the minimum pressure of the hurricane). Sea level and sea temperature Sea level is relatively easy to measure accurately using radars from satellites. Sea temperature below the surface is not as easy to measure widely, but can be inferred from the sea level since warmer water expands and thus (all other factors, such as water depth, being equal) a vertical column of water will rise slightly higher when warmed. Thus sea level is often used as a proxy for deep sea temperatures. NOAA's National Data Buoy Center maintains a large number of data buoys in the Gulf of Mexico, some of which measure sea temperature one meter below the surface.  Biology  The Loop Current and Loop Current Eddies affect biological communities within the Gulf of Mexico. In general, however, it is not the warm-core Loop Current and eddies themselves that affect these communities. Instead, it is the smaller cold-core features known as Frontal Eddies that form around the boundary of the Loop Current and Loop Current Eddies, which affect biological communities in the Gulf. Loop Current Frontal Eddies are cold-core, counter-clockwise rotating (cyclonic) eddies that form on or near the boundary of the Loop Current. LCFEs range from about 80 km to 120 km in diameter. These cold features are smaller than the warm-core eddies shed from the Loop Current. Multiple studies have shown differences in biological communities inside versus outside of the various features in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher standing stocks of zooplankton and micronekton were found in cold-core features than in both the Loop Current and the Loop Current Eddies. However, no difference in the abundance of euphausiids, planktonic shrimp-like marine crustaceans, was found between areas of upwelling and warm-core eddies, but in 2004 the hyperiid abundance was found to be lower within Loop Current Eddies as opposed to outside. Concurrently, it was found that nutrient (nitrate) levels were low above 100 meters within warm-core eddies, while nitrate levels were high within cold features. Low standing stock of chlorophyll, primary production, and zooplankton biomass was found to be low in LCEs. Low chlorophyll concentrations and primary production are likely a result of low nutrients levels, as many planktonic species require nitrate and other nutrients to survive. In turn, low primary production could be one cause of heterotrophic (organism-eating, as opposed to photosynthetic) species abundances being low inside the Loop Current and Loop Current Eddies. Alternatively, temperature may play a role for low abundances of both communities: Atlantic Blue Fin Tuna have developed behavioral patterns of avoiding the high temperatures associated with warm-core features, such as the Loop Current and Loop Current Eddies, in the Gulf of Mexico. It is possible, also, that planktonic species likewise avoid the higher temperatures in these features.

Kelly was a participant in the first Lambeth Conference, which was a crucial step in the creation of the Anglican Communion. He was also Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church from 1901 to 1904. Early life and education St. Nicholas-Bishop's Court circa 1860, when Kelly took over as vicar. Kelly received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts from the University of Cambridge, studying at Clare Hall (later renamed Clare College shortly after Kelly's graduation). However, Clare was in a period of academic decline during Kelly's time there. In 1855, at the age of 23, Kelly was made deacon of the Anglican Church. A year later, in 1856, he was ordained priest. Kelly became curate of Abington, Northamptonshire, but left England for the Isle of Man, to serve as a domestic chaplain for Bishop of Sodor and Man, Horatio Powys. In 1860, upon the death of Joseph Brown, Kelly became registrar and vicar of the Kirkmichael parish on the Isle of Man, while continuing as chaplain to Powys. Kelly was the second vicar, after Brown, in the new (1858) parish church, St. Nicholas-Bishop's Court. Life in Newfoundland In 1839 the Anglican Church had founded the See of Newfoundland, its second bishop, Edward Feild, appealed in 1864 for additional clergy to minister in the diocese, thus offering Kelly an opportunity in North America which he quickly seized, leaving the Isle of Man two years before it achieved Home Rule. In June, Kelly found himself appointed incumbent of the cathedral in St. John's, Newfoundland, and archdeacon. 1867 was a momentous year for Kelly. His ministry had proven a success, and Feild named Kelly his assistant bishop. Charles Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, performed the ceremony of consecration on 16 August. Kelly, thirty-five years old, received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Cambridge University, and attended the first Pan-Anglican conference of British, colonial and foreign bishops conference in Lambeth. The conference had been lobbied for by, among others, the Canadian synod, but much of the agenda focused on the controversy over John William Colenso, a missionary to the Zulu. Eleven advisory resolutions regarding colonial district administration were nevertheless passed. The Anglican diocese of Newfoundland also included the island of Bermuda. Kelly and Feild travelled aboard the diocesan ship The Star, and both nearly died in 1871 in a sailing accident that destroyed the ship. This was not the last occasion in which sea travel proved a hardship to Kelly; he became seriously ill in 1874 when travelling to coastal communities on Newfoundland and Labrador. Kelly's logs of his travels on The Star have been published as Journal of a visitation by the Right Reverend J. B. K. Kelly, DD, coadjutor bishop of Newfoundland, in the church ship Star, July‚ÄìOctober, 1869, (London, 1870), and The voyage the churchship Star, 1870 (St.John's, 1973). Cathedral of St. John the Baptist after the Great Fire of 1892 Kelly's trips did not distract him from projects at home. On 9 October 1871, he married Louisa Bliss, daughter of William Blowers Bliss, a prominent judge from Nova Scotia. Kelly took on leadership of the completion of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (not to be confused with the Basilica of St. John The Baptist). The Cathedral's nave, finished in 1850, had been serving as the entire church. The cathedral was finished in 1885, but burned down in the Great Fire of 1892. Kelly organized its reconstruction. The Cathedral bears a memorial window dedicated to his memory. Kelly became diocesan bishop in 1876, after Feild's death. His understandable aversion to sea travel, however, led him to resign the position in 1877 after a fruitless search for a coadjutor who could relieve him of its necessity. Return to the United Kingdom In 1877 Kelly returned to his country of birth, where he became vicar of Kirkby, Lancashire from 1877 to 1880, Bishop-commissary for the Bishop of Chester (1879-1884) and Archdeacon of Macclesfield from 1880 to 1884. He later became Provost of Inverness Cathedral and Assistant Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness in 1885, becoming diocesan bishop in 1886 after Robert Eden. In 1901, he was unanimously elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church and served in that capacity for three years until his retirement. He died in Inverness in 1907.

Arriving in Australia in 1838, he rose swiftly in colonial society. In retribution for the murder of a fellow pastoralist and for the killing of livestock, he led many of the Gippsland massacres of 1840‚Äì1850, which killed or drove away the region's Aboriginal population, in particular the Gunai people.Gardner, P.D.. (2001) , Gippsland massacres: the destruction of the Gunai tribes, 1800‚Äì1860, Ngarak Press, Essay, Victoria Early life Angus McMillan was born in Glen Brittle, Isle of Skye, Scotland, the fourth son of Ewan McMillan. After an early life of hardship and deprivation, he migrated to Australia in 1838. Under the initial employ of Captain Lachlan Macalister, he gained experience of Australian pastoralism on the Monaro, New South Wales before moving to manage the Currawang station near Delegate. The Gippsland massacres McMillan led a number of Gippsland massacres. The massacres were a series of mass murders of Gunai/Kurnai people committed by European pastoralists and squatters between 1800 and 1860.Gardner, P.D.. (2001) , Gippsland massacres: the destruction of the Kurnai tribes, 1800-1860, Ngarak Press, Essay, Victoria Increasing European settlement in Gippsland dispossessed the indigenous Kurnai people, who were progressively forced off their land to make way for pastoral activities. Relations between Europeans and the Kurnai reached their nadir in 1843 when McMillan's colleague Macalister was killed by an Aboriginal man. Historian Paul Bartrop states that McMillan retaliated by organising an armed assault on the Kurnai, including the massacre of between 60 and 150 Aboriginal people at Warrigal Creek. Notoriously, McMillan kept a hessian bag of human skulls for some time after the event. \\"Australia To Remove Tributes To Scot Who Massacred Aboriginals\\" The Scotsman http://www.scotsman.com/news/australia-to-remove-tributes-to-scot-who- massacred-aboriginals-1-4232527 Exploration Memorial cairn at Iguana Creek on the Dargo Road, listing dates of McMillan's major expeditions By the late 1830s, wealthy landholders in New South Wales had become interested in the Gippsland region of Victoria and funded exploration of the region. Macalister knew the early settlers in the high country of Gippsland around Benambra and Omeo as they too were from the Monaro. He put forward McMillan as a candidate to further explore the plains of Gippsland proper nearer to the coast. A second interest sent Polish scientist-explorer Count Paul Strzelecki to also explore Gippsland. =Expedition to Omeo= On 28 May 1839 McMillan travelled south on his first exploration of the Gippsland plains, accompanied by Jimmy Gabber, an elder of the Monaro people. The expedition was unsuccessful; in a letter to colonial administrator Charles La Trobe, McMillan reported that six days after leaving Currawong, Gabber declined to go further for fear of encountering the Kurnai people, Gippsland's indigenous inhabitants. McMillan refused to turn back, whereupon Gabber waited for a quiet moment and attempted to kill McMillan with a club.Correspondence, Angus McMillan to Charles La Trobe. Cited in Gardner 1990, p. IX Gabber retreated when McMillan raised his pistol, but still refused to go on. McMillan therefore continued alone, heading west towards Buchan and Omeo.Gardner 1990, p. IX, p. 17 No significant agricultural lands or watercourses were discovered along McMillan's path, and neither did he encounter the region's indigenous inhabitants. After two weeks in Omeo, McMillan returned northeast across the plains to Currawong.Gardner 1990, P. 17 =Expedition to Sale= Despite the apparent failure of this first expedition, Macalister remained optimistic about pastoral opportunities in Gippsland. At Macalister's urging McMillan commenced a second expedition in December 1839, moving southwest by west across the plains towards the existing settlement of Sale. On his return to Currawang in early 1840, he reported to Macalister that he crossed several watercourses draining toward the east, each surrounded by fine potential grazing land. McMillan had named them as the Nicholson, the Mitchell, the Avon and Macalister rivers. He had also promptly contacted colonial officials, to register claims along the Avon River for cattle stations in his own and Macalister's names. = Subsequent expeditions = McMillan completed several more expeditions over the following two years. While he was not necessarily the first to visit many locations, his explorations were the most important in terms of European settlement of Gippsland proper. In 1841, on the final of his early expeditions, he located a suitable port for the region, at present day Port Albert. The route established then by McMillan varies substantially from the current major north‚Äìsouth route through Gippsland today. McMillan travelled further west along the ranges than the current Great Alpine Road. This route follows the Great Alpine Road south through the Tambo Valley to Bruthen, then West to Bairnsdale and Sale along the Princes Highway, then south from Sale to Port Albert. For several decades, Gippsland operated essentially on this north‚Äìsouth axis, following this route from Benambra and Omeo to Port Albert, but, in the 1860s, a road was opened from Melbourne to the east, and this was followed a couple of decades later by a rail line. These developments, along with development of significant east‚Äìwest shipping on the Gippsland Lakes at the time, reoriented travel and transport to the simpler east‚Äìwest axis, and demoted the Benambra and Omeo regions to a side branch of this main route. Later life \\"Bushy Park,\\" McMillan's home along the Avon River. Relocated to Old Gippstown in 1969 His explorations at an end, McMillan established himself as an independent squatter on land along the Avon River which he named \\"Bushy Park.\\" Development was slow, with an 1845 census of the region showing only six acres under cultivation and livestock comprising 600 head of cattle and six horses. McMillan persisted, and, by the 1856 census, he was recorded as the owner of 150,000 acres, upon which he ran the region's second-largest holding of sheep and third-largest of cattle. In the same year, \\"Bushy Park\\" itself was recorded as an eight-room home attached to a four-room cottage, adjacent to a stable, wool store, barn, a worker's hut and a six-acre orchard.Gardner 1990, p.62 In 1857, McMillan married a local woman, Christina MacDougald. They had two sons. From October 1859 to November 1860, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly for South Gippsland, less than a decade after Victoria was first declared a separate colony. His properties had generated substantial wealth, but by 1861 a series of poor financial decisions coupled with devastating bushfires, had left him in debt. The bulk of his Gippsland properties were sold and by the end of the year his only holding was the land immediately surrounding his Bushy Park home. In need of money, in 1864 McMillan acceded to a request from the Victorian Government to lead a team of men into Gippsland's alpine region with the aim of mapping and clearing tracks to support local mining operations. Within six months McMillan and his men had constructed more than of track through rugged terrain near Omeo and Dargo. It was to be McMillan's last expedition; in May 1865 he was clearing a track near Dargo when a pack-horse slipped and fell, crushing him beneath it. McMillan was carried to the public house in Iguana Creek, suffering serious internal injuries. He died on 18 May and was buried in the public cemetery in Sale. Legacy McMillan's death left his wife and sons destitute, until a public outcry at their plight forced the Victorian Government to come to their aid with a gratuity of ¬£2000. His feats as an explorer were the subject of public testimonials. McMillan's Bushy Park homestead was preserved, and was relocated to Old Gippstown in Moe, Victoria, in 1969.Australian Heritage Moe-Yallourn Retrieved on 10 September 2012 Nineteen monuments honouring McMillian exist in Gippsland, including at Wellington, Heyfield, Yarram, Omeo and Lucknow. After considering 240 community submissions in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, which included about half in favour of removing two stone cairns dedicated to McMillan on land owned by the Wellington Shire Council, the Council voted against the move on 17 June 2020.

Found Magazine Davy Rothbart's magazine Found is dedicated to discarded notes, letters, flyers, photos, lists, and drawings found and sent in by readers. The magazine spawned a best- selling book, Found: The Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World, published in April 2004. A second collection was published in May 2006, a third in May 2009. The magazine is published annually and co-edited by Rothbart's friend Sarah Locke. Rothbart, a former Chicago Bulls ticket scalper, often tours the country to share finds and invite others to share their finds with him. His brother, musician Peter Rothbart, often accompanies him on these tours. In 2004, as he was on a nationwide tour to promote the Found book, he appeared twice on the television program the Late Show with David Letterman on CBS. He has since been featured on 20/20, MSNBC, and Last Call with Carson Daly, among other national TV and radio shows, and been profiled in The New Yorker and The New York Times. Rothbart has toured the U.S. relentlessly with his live spoken-word show, reading from Found Magazine and his own books of stories and essays, appearing in all 50 states and over 200 cities; The Los Angeles Times calls him \\"an utterly engaging performer.\\" In the fall of 2014, Found The Musical opened off-Broadway at David Mamet and William H. Macy's Atlantic Theater Company in New York City for a 12-week run. The play, written by Lee Overtree and Hunter Bell, with songs by Eli Bolin and additional materials by the Story Pirates, starred Broadway vet Nick Blaemire as Davy, with Betsy Morgan, Barrett Wilbert Weed, Community's Danny Pudi, and Daniel Everidge, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, including a \\"Critic's Pick\\" from Christopher Isherwood of The New York Times. A new production is planned for Fall of 2016, according to producers Victoria Lang, Eva Price, and Jamie Salka. Writing and Journalism The Lone Surfer of Montana, Kansas, a collection of Rothbart's short stories, was published in August 2005 by Simon & Schuster. A shorter version of the same book was previously self-published by Rothbart's own production company, 21 Balloons Productions (named after Rothbart's favorite book, The 21 Balloons, by William P√®ne du Bois). An Italian edition, Il Surfista Solitario del Montana, was published in 2007 by Coniglio Editore. Actor Steve Buscemi optioned three stories from the book for film adaption, to be developed by Olive Productions; Buscemi has written the screenplay and plans to direct. In September 2012, Rothbart's book of personal essays, My Heart Is An Idiot, was released by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book, which details Rothbart's lost loves and longtime life on the road, quickly garnered widespread praise, including positive reviews from The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, and The New York Times Book Review, among many others. Upon the book's publication, Rothbart began a massive 79-city North American tour. My Heart Is An Idiot was named one of the Best Books of 2012 by NPR's Morning Edition, Amazon.com, Vanity Fair, and The Huffington Post. The paperback version was released by Picador in September 2013. In Italy, the book was published by Baldini & Castoldi in 2014 as Il Cuore √® Idiota. When Fred Rogers of the PBS television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood died in February 2003, The New York Times ran an Op-Ed by Rothbart about his childhood encounters with Rogers similar to his story on This American Life. Rothbart's other work on This American Life includes stories about his deaf mother, Barbara Brodsky, a channeler and meditation teacher; a longtime friend seeking advice about an unplanned pregnancy; and his Chicago ticket scalping career.

There are two common methods of solar desalination. Either using the direct heat from the sun or using electricity generated by solar cells to power a membrane process. Methods The status of renewable-powered desalination technologies. In the direct method, a solar collector is coupled with a distilling mechanism and the process is carried out in one simple cycle. Solar stills of this type are described in survival guides, provided in marine survival kits, and employed in many small desalination and distillation plants. Water production by direct method solar distillation is proportional to the area of the solar surface and incidence angle and has an average estimated value of .Kalogirou, S. (2009). Solar energy engineering: Processes and systems. Burlington, MA: Elsevier/Academic Press. Because of this proportionality and the relatively high cost of property and material for construction direct method distillation tends to favor plants with production capacities less than . Indirect solar desalination employs two separate systems; a solar collection array, consisting of photovoltaic and/or fluid-based thermal collectors, and a separate conventional desalination plant. Production by indirect method is dependent on the efficiency of the plant and the cost per unit produced is generally reduced by an increase in scale. Many different plant arrangements have been theoretically analyzed, experimentally tested and in some cases installed. They include but are not limited to multiple-effect humidification (MEH), multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), multiple-effect distillation (MED), multiple-effect boiling (MEB), humidification‚Äìdehumidification (HDH), reverse osmosis (RO), and freeze-effect distillation.

History Methods of solar distillation have been employed by humankind for thousands of years. From early Greek mariners to Persian alchemists, this basic technology has been utilized to produce both freshwater and medicinal distillates. Solar stills were in fact the first method used on a large scale to process contaminated water and convert it to a potable form. In 1870 the first US patent was granted for a solar distillation device to Norman Wheeler and Walton Evans.Wheeler, N., Evans, W., (1870) Improvements in Evaporating and Distilling by Solar Heat. http://www.google.com/patents/US102633 Two years later in Las Salinas, Chile, Charles Wilson, a Swedish engineer, began building a direct method solar powered distillation plant to supply freshwater to workers at a saltpeter and silver mine. It operated continuously for 40 years and produced an average of 22.7 m3 of distilled water a day using the effluent from mining operations as its feed water.Delyannis, E. (2003). Historic background of desalination and renewable energies, Solar Energy, 75(5), 357-366. Solar desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater in the modern United States extends back to the early 1950s when Congress passed the Conversion of Saline Water Act, which led to the establishment of the Office of Saline Water (OSW) in 1955. The OSW's main function was to administer funds for research and development of desalination projects.National Archives, https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/380.html One of the five demonstration plants constructed was located in Daytona Beach, Florida and devoted to exploring methods of solar distillation. Many of the projects were aimed at solving water scarcity issues in remote desert and coastal communities. In the 1960s and 1970s several modern solar distillations plants were constructed on the Greek isles with capacities ranging from 2000 to 8500 m3/day. In 1984 a MED plant was constructed in Abu-Dhabi with a capacity of 120 m3/day and is still in operation. In Italy, an open source design called \\"the Eliodomestico\\" by Gabriele Diamanti was developed for personal use at the building materials price of $50.http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/EHE/HTML_KAG/Kimweb/files/SolarStill%20Project.pdf Of the estimated 22 million m3 of freshwater being produced a day through desalination processes worldwide, less than 1% is made using solar energy. The prevailing methods of desalination, MSF and RO, are energy-intensive and rely heavily on fossil fuels. Because of inexpensive methods of freshwater delivery and abundant low cost energy resources, solar distillation has, up to this point, been viewed as cost-prohibitive and impractical. It is estimated that desalination plants powered by conventional fuels consume the equivalent of 203 million tons of fuel a year. With the approach (or passage) of peak oil production, fossil fuel prices will continue to increase as those resources decline; as a result solar energy will become a more attractive alternative for achieving the world's desalination needs. Types of solar desalination There are two primary means of achieving desalination using solar energy, through a phase change by thermal input, or in a single phase through mechanical separation. Phase change (or multi-phase) can be accomplished by either direct or indirect solar distillation. Single phase desalination is predominantly accomplished in a solar-powered desalination unit, which uses photovoltaic cells that produce electricity to drive pumps, although there are experimental methods being researched using solar thermal collection to provide this mechanical energy.  Multi-phase desalination. Direct methods  Direct methods for multi-phase solar desalination are those which use the sun's thermal energy collected to heat the sea water and produce the vaporization needed for this 2-phase separation. Such methods are relatively simple and require little space so they are normally used on small production systems. However, they have a low production rate due to low operating temperature and pressure, so they are useful on places where the demand of freshwater is below 200 m3/day. = Single-effect solar still = This is a simple device that works using the same natural process of natural rainfall production. A transparent cover encloses a pan where saline water is placed. The latter traps solar energy within the enclosure, heating up the seawater and evaporating it. Condensation is produced on the inner face of the sloping transparent cover, and all the salts, inorganic and organic components and microbes are left behind. The direct method that a solar still uses has a low productivity, achieving values of 4-5 L/m2/day and efficiency of 30-40%. Several methods have been studied to improve this technology. The basin type is the most commonly used, but there are other kind of improvements: Efficiency can be improved by up to 45% by using a double slope or with an additional condenser. In a wick still, feed water flows slowly through a porous radiation-absorbing pad. This requires less volume of water to be heated and it easier to change the angle towards the sun which speeds up its use and higher temperatures can be achieved. A diffusion still It is composed of two parts, one hot storage tank coupled to the solar collector, and the distillation unit. Heating is produced by the thermal diffusion between those two units. Increasing the internal temperature by using another external energy source can improve productivity. This is the only active method commented, those above are all passive devices.  Multi-phase desalination. Indirect methods Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF)= Multi-stage flash distillation is one of the predominant conventional phase-change methods of achieving desalination. It accounts for roughly 45% of the total world desalination capacity and 93% of all thermal methods. In Margarita de Savoya, Italy there is a 50‚Äì60 m3/day MSF plant with a salinity gradient solar pond providing its thermal energy and storage capacity. In El Paso, Texas there is a similar project in operation that produces 19 m3/day. In Kuwait a MSF facility has been built using parabolic trough collectors to provide the necessary solar thermal energy to produce 100 m3 of fresh water a day. And in Northern China there is an experimental, automatic, unmanned operation that uses 80 m2 of vacuum tube solar collectors coupled with a 1 kW wind turbine (to drive several small pumps) to produce 0.8 m3/day. Production data shows that MSF solar distillation has an output capacity of 6‚Äì60 L/m2/day versus the 3-4 L/m2/day standard output of a solar still. MSF experience very poor efficiency during start-up or low energy periods. In order to achieve the highest efficiency MSF requires carefully controlled pressure drops across each stage and a steady energy input. As a result, solar applications require some form of thermal energy storage to deal with cloud interference, varying solar patterns, night time operation, and seasonal changes in ambient air temperature. As thermal energy storage capacity increases a more continuous process can be achieved and production rates approach maximum efficiency. = Freezing = Although it has only been used on demonstration projects, this indirect method based on crystallization of the saline water has the advantage of the low energy required. Since the latent heat of fusion of water is 6,01 kJ/mole and the latent heat of vaporization at 100 ¬∞C is 40,66 kJ/mole, it should be cheaper in terms of energy cost. Furthermore, the corrosion risk is lower too. There is although a disadvantage related with the difficulties of mechanically moving mixtures of ice and liquid. It has not been commercialized yet due to cost and difficulties with refrigeration systems. The most studied way of using this process is the refrigeration freezing. A refrigeration cycle is used to cool the water stream to form ice, and after that those crystals are separated and melted to obtain fresh water. There are some recent examples of this solar powered processes: the unit constructed in Saudi Arabia by Chicago Bridege and Iron Inc. in the late 1980s, which was shut down for its inefficiency. Nevertheless, there is a recent study for the saline groundwater concluding that a plant capable of producing 1 million gal/day would produce water at a cost of $1.30/1000 gallons. Being this true, it would be a cost- competitive device with the reverse osmosis ones.  Problems with thermal systems  There are two inherent design problems facing any thermal solar desalination project. Firstly, the system's efficiency is governed by preferably high heat and mass transfer rates during evaporation and condensation. The surfaces have to be properly designed within the contradictory objectives of heat transfer efficiency, economy, and reliability. Secondly, the heat of condensation is valuable because it takes large amounts of solar energy to evaporate water and generate saturated, vapor-laden hot air. This energy is, by definition, transferred to the condenser's surface during condensation. With most forms of solar stills, this heat of condensation is ejected from the system as waste heat. The challenge still existing in the field today, is to achieve the optimum temperature difference between the solar-generated vapor and the seawater-cooled condenser, maximal reuse of the energy of condensation, and minimizing the asset investment. = Solutions for thermal systems = Efficient desalination systems use heat recovery to allow the same heat input to provide several times the water than a simple evaporative process such as solar stills. One solution to the barrier presented by the high level of solar energy required in solar desalination efforts is to reduce the pressure within the reservoir. This can be accomplished using a vacuum pump, and significantly decreases the temperature of heat energy required for desalination. For example, water at a pressure of 0.1 atmospheres boils at rather than . Large scale Solar Desalination using Multi Effect Humidification = Solar humidification‚Äìdehumidification = The solar humidification‚Äìdehumidification (HDH) process (also called the multiple-effect humidification‚Äìdehumidification process, solar multistage condensation evaporation cycle (SMCEC) or multiple- effect humidification (MEH)The MEH-method (in German with english abstract): Solar Desalination using the MEH method, Diss. Technical University of Munich) is a technique that mimics the natural water cycle on a shorter time frame by evaporating and condensing water to separate it from other substances. The driving force in this process is thermal solar energy to produce water vapor which is later condensed in a separate chamber. In sophisticated systems, waste heat is minimized by collecting the heat from the condensing water vapor and pre-heating the incoming water source.A scheme for large scale desalination of sea water by solar energy This system is effective for small- to mid- scale desalination systems in remote locations because of the relative inexpensiveness of solar thermal collectors. Single-phase solar desalination In indirect, or single phase, solar-powered desalination, two different technological systems are combined: a solar energy collection system (e.g. through the use of photovoltaic panels) and a proven desalination system such as reverse osmosis (RO), are combined. The main single-phase processes, or membrane processes, consist of Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Electrodialysis (ED). Single phase solar desalination is predominantly accomplished by the use of photovoltaic cells that produce electricity to drive pumps used for reverse osmosis desalination. Nowadays there are over 15,000 desalination plants around the world, of these plants almost 70% of them use RO method, which makes RO processes responsible for 44% of desalination production capacity internationally. However, alternative experimental methods are being researched, which use solar thermal collection to provide mechanical energy to drive the reverse osmosis process. =Solar-powered reverse osmosis= In reverse osmosis desalination systems, seawater pressure is raised above the natural osmotic pressure, forcing pure water through membrane pores to the fresh water side. Reverse osmosis (RO) is the most common desalination process in terms of installed capacity due to its superior energy efficiency compared to thermal desalination systems, despite requiring extensive water pre- treatment. Furthermore, part of the consumed mechanical energy can be reclaimed from the concentrated brine effluent with an energy recovery device. Solar-powered RO desalination is common in demonstration plants due to the modularity and scalability of both photovoltaic (PV) and RO systems. A detailed economic analysis and a thorough optimisation strategy of PV powered RO desalination were carried out with favorable results reported. Economic and reliability considerations are the main challenges to improving PV powered RO desalination systems. However, the quickly dropping PV panel costs are making solar-powered desalination ever more feasible. This type of systems (PV-RO) convert solar radiation into direct-current (DC) electricity, which will feed the RO unit. While the intermittent nature of sunlight and its variable intensity throughout the day makes PV efficiency prediction difficult and desalination during night time challenging, several solutions exist. For example, batteries, which provide the energy required for desalination in non- sunlight hours can be used to store solar energy in daytime. Apart from the use of conventional batteries, alternative methods for solar energy storage exist. For example, thermal energy storage systems solve this storage problem and ensure constant performance even during non-sunlight hours and cloudy days, improving overall efficiency.Low temperature desalination using solar collectors augmented by thermal energy storage Nevertheless, it is valid to pointed out some pros and cons regarding the use of batteries in a PV-RO system. In one hand, as mentioned above, the use of batteries is a solution that targets the uniformity operation of the system, maintaining the desired set point along the variation of sunlight during the day, as a buffer. Studies have indicates that intermittent operations can increase biofouling. Still, the use of batteries has some drawbacks as the price. Batteries are expensive and they increase the investment amount and maintenance of a PV-RO plant, due to the periodic maintenance required by batteries. Also, when electrical energy from the PV is converted to chemical energy in the battery and send to the pumps of the RO system, energy is lost. Hence, the use of batteries could decrease the efficiency of the plant. Reported average cost of seawater desalination with RO is 0.56 USD/m3, while, using renewable energy sources, that cost could increase up to 16 USD/m3. Although the costs for using renewable energy sources are greater, the perspectives of using them in desalination systems are increasing, due to the environmental concerns and future availability of fossil fuels. Furthermore, economic analysis of PV-RO small scale units shows that it could be a solution for remote areas supply of fresh water, competing with the conventional desalination methods. = Solar- powered Electrodialysis = Both Electrodialysis (ED) and Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) are based on the principle of selective ions transport through ion exchange membranes (IEMs) due either to the influence of concentration difference (RED) or electrical potential (ED). In Electrodialysis (ED) an electrical force is applied to the electrodes; the cations travel toward the cathode and anions travel toward the anode. The exchange membranes only allow the passage of its permeable type (cation or anion), hence with this arrangement, diluted and concentrated salt solutions are placed in the space between the membranes (channels). The configuration of this stack could be either horizontally or vertically, and the feed water passes in parallel through all the cells, providing a continuous flow of permeate and brine. Although this is a well-known process Electrodialysis is not commercially suited for seawater desalination, it can be used only for brackish water (TDS < 1000 ppm) and due to the complexity for modeling ion transport phenomena in the channels, the process perform could be affected considering the non-ideal behavior presented by the exchange membranes. The basic ED process could be modified and turn into RED, which operates in almost the same way of ED, except by the fact that the polarity of the electrodes changes periodically reversing the flow through the membranes. Due to that the deposition of colloidal substances is very difficult which makes this a self- cleaning process, almost eliminating the need for chemical pre-treatment, also making this type of treatment economically attractive process for brackish water. The use ED systems is not new, it has been used since 1954 and RED was developed in the '70s. Today these processes are used over 1100 plants worldwide and also PV-ED process. The main advantages for using PV technology in desalination plants is due to the possibility to build small-scale plants, which are suitable for remote areas and without fossil fuel availability, there are some interesting reported examples of PV-ED use, one of them is in Japan, on Oshima Island (Nagasaki), operating since 1986 with 390 PV panels producing 10 m3/day with a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) about 400 ppm.

The series was brought to the ABC by filmmaker Michael Rubbo, and was based on the Canadian television series ' (1988‚Äì1999). Both seasons were hosted by Richard Fidler, a former member of the Doug Anthony All Stars comedy group. Premise For each series, eight \\"racers\\" were selected from video auditions from the Australian general public. The only stipulation for the video auditions was a lead in of ten seconds of black. John Safran submitted his audition with ten seconds of yellow. The successful applicants undertook a brief course in documentary film-making, before deciding on an itinerary for their journey around the world. They were then given a digital video camera, and sent to their first destination. Over the next 100 days, the racers were required to devise, arrange and film a series of ten four-minute documentary films, as well as a stand-by documentary and five \\"postcards\\". This gave them ten days to travel to their next destination, film the video, and send it back to the ABC in Sydney with detailed editing instructions. The series was broadcast as a weekly half-hour program, with four films shown per episode. Each film was then judged by a panel of three media and film experts including David Caesar, Sarah Macdonald, Tony Squires and Sigrid Thornton, as well as being put to a popular viewer vote. Points were deducted for late submissions. =Racers in the first series (1997)= * Ben Davies from Sydney * Bentley Dean from Sydney * Scott Herford from Sydney * Daniel Marsden from Brisbane * Olivia Rousset from Perth * Claudia Rowe from Melbourne * John Safran from Melbourne * Kim Traill from Melbourne, Victoria Olivia Rousset was the winner of the first series. =Racers in the second series (1998)= * Cate Anderson from Kangaroo Valley, New South Wales * Rachel Bannikoff from Canberra * Tim Bryson from Adelaide * Sheona McKenna from Melbourne * David Shankey from Brisbane * John Thiris from Sydney * Catherine Turner from Sydney * Tony Wilson from Melbourne Tony Wilson was the winner of the second series. After the Race Although receiving fairly high ratings for its timeslot, Race Around the World was a considerable logistical and financial drain on the publicly funded ABC. In 2000, the series was scaled down into a local version restricted to the Australian continent, entitled Race Around Oz. A youth- oriented program titled Race Around the Corner was produced by ABC Children's Unit with students (14‚Äì16 years of age) making low-budget local productions in the same style as Race Around the World. Host Richard Fidler undertook a few more television hosting gigs, including the short-lived ABC art and culture chat program Vulture. He then became a radio presenter and host of the popular Conversations radio show and podcast. Most of the racers from the series went on to pursue careers in media and film-making: * Perhaps the biggest success story amongst the racers has been that of the controversial John Safran. Safran actually came last on the first series (won by Olivia Rousset), despite winning the popular vote. The reason for this was that Safran had been disqualified from one round after submitting a film in which he had covertly filmed priests giving confession in Rio de Janeiro. Safran went on to produce and present several television programs: John Safran's Music Jamboree and John Safran vs God for SBS; and John Safran's Race Relations for the ABC. * Olivia Rousset, Bentley Dean and Kim Traill have worked as reporters for the SBS program Dateline. Traill's book Red Square Blues: A Beginner's Guide to the Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union was published by Harper Collins in September 2009. * Catherine Turner was a reporter with Al Jazeera, and later Channel 7. * Bentley Dean was nominated for an Academy Award for Tanna. * Scott Herford has produced three Australian independent feature films. * Like John Safran, Tony Wilson went on to host the breakfast show on Melbourne radio station 3RRR, and has written a novel called Players (). * Ben Davies is the creator and producer of the Network Ten observational documentary series Bondi Rescue.

Condor Airlines introduced flights between Frankfurt and Windhoek since November 2014. Since 2016, Qatar Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines have started flying to Windhoek. Eurowings, the low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa, commenced a bi-weekly service from Cologne/Bonn in July 2017. However, in a bid to streamline its long haul operation for the 2019-season, the airline has decided to end both the Cologne/Bonn and Munich routes to Windhoek. In recent schedule updates however, Eurowings have decided to introduce flights from Frankfurt, Germany's largest airport, to Windhoek. Commencing in late October 2019, the airbus A330-200 would start operating this route. As of October 2017, around 315 flights depart and land at HKIA weekly. In August 2017 Air Namibia was granted 5th freedom rights to operate cargo and traffic between Windhoek, Lagos, Nigeria and Accra, Ghana. These destinations were cancelled by the airline in May, 2019. Westair Aviation has commenced scheduled flights April 1, 2018 from Windhoek-Eros. In March 2018, Ethiopian Airlines introduced Africa's first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to Namibia. Due to flight performance and headwinds, Airlink in March 2019 has decided to re-direct its technical fuel-stop in Windhoek to Walvis Bay Airport, a move which would accommodate more passengers on the final leg to Saint Helena Airport.

Expansion Merce Rhino Fire Engine, Hosea Kutako International Airport The Namibia Airports Company (NAC) is in the planning stages of constructing a new airport complete with aerodrome classification of category 4F (of the International Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aerodrome Reference Code in terms of Annex 14 of ICAO). This new development would render the airport to accommodate multiple wide-bodied code F aircraft. This project would require a new runway, including taxiways/ aprons. The NAC envisages a newly constructed terminal building that would include separate VIP check-in/ ancillary facilities. A new traffic control tower and fire station would complete the project. In November 2017, the Namibian Government and the Vice Minister of China, Qian Keming, signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement, which will see China offer around 30 million U.S. dollars for part of the N$900m/78 km dual carriageway between the airport and Windhoek. In May 2018 a spokesperson for Namibia Airports Company announced that the arrivals- and check-in hall, the luggage handling area, the security screening point will be temporarily improved. With airport traffic increasing, the need for a new terminal, runway and apron has been prioritised. In September 2019 a local building contractor, Nexus Building Contractor, initiated the Congestion Alleviation project. This N$250 million project targets to double the handling capacity to accommodate increased passenger numbers up until 2030. The project also includes the construction of a new arrival hall, expansion or the current departure hall and increasing the security screening points.

At that time, it was simply called by the presenter's name, Gideon Coe. The presenters have been Janice Long (11 March 2002 ‚Äì 1 July 2004), Jane Gazzo (5 July 2004 ‚Äì 29 September 2005 - see Jane Gazzo's Dream Ticket), Nemone (3 October 2005 ‚Äì 10 August 2006).

The show played current music as well as music from the BBC music session and live performance archives, up to forty years in the past. Some archival music chosen also included classic sessions done for BBC's John Peel, a pioneer in getting new and alternative music recorded and aired. Sundry live reports were filed from journalists and correspondents at the best of the evening's concerts in and about England and elsewhere worldwide. Sometimes, actual radio show listeners have reported on concerts. One featured segment of the show was The Headline Set wherein a musical artist is featured, very often from a significant live performance. Another segment, which climaxes in the end of the show, was the Head to Head. Two closely matched musical artists and a representative song from each, are announced at the beginning of the show, and then listeners, as was mentioned with the interactive listening aspect, are to communicate to the show live, by email, text message, on the website, which of the two artists and respective song they want played out at the end of the show. The choice is purely the up to the listeners. Innovations with this show include the interplay of several new technological forces being applied to radio. Another challenging thematic innovation of the show was the blending and balancing of current popular music, classic session and performance music from the BBC archives, and new music.

The variable type consists of close binary stars having active chromospheres which can cause large stellar spots. These spots are believed to cause variations in their observed luminosity. Systems can exhibit variations on timescales of years due to variation in the spot surface coverage fraction, as well as periodic variations which are, in general, close to the orbital period of the binary system. Some systems exhibit variations in luminosity due to their being eclipsing binaries. Typical brightness fluctuation is around 0.2 magnitudes. They take their name from the star RS Canum Venaticorum (abbreviated RS CVn). Otto Struve (1946) first called attention to the group, but it was Oliver (1974) who was the first to formally propose a set of observational characteristics to define the RS CVn criteria. The working definition, as it is used today, was that set down by Hall (1976).Berdyugina 2.4 RS CVn stars The RS CVn systems are divided into five separate subgroups: *Regular systems. Orbital periods are between 1 and 14 days. The hotter component is of the spectral type F or G and luminosity class V or IV. Strong Ca II H and K emission is seen outside eclipse. *Short period systems. Components are detached and orbital periods are less than 1 day. The hotter component is of the spectral type F or G and luminosity class V or IV. Ca II H and K emission is displayed in one or both components. * Long period systems. Orbital periods is greater than 14 days. Either component is of the spectral type G through K and luminosity class II through IV. Strong Ca II H and K emission is seen outside eclipse. *Flare star systems. In this case the hotter component is of the spectral type dKe or dMe, where the emission refers to strong Ca II H and K. * V471 Tau type systems. The hotter component is a white dwarf. The cooler component, spectral class G through K, displays strong Ca II H and K emission. The light curves of RS CVn type systems show a peculiar semiperiodic structure outside eclipse. This structure has been referred to as a distortion wave in the light curve. Eaton and Hall (1979) determined that the simplest mechanism for the creation of the distortion wave was \\"starspots\\", which, in analogy to sunspots, are large, cool active regions on the photosphere. Such spots have since been observed indirectlyCameron Eclipse movies showing spots in XY Ursae Majoris binary on many systems. Chromospheric activity is signaled by the presence of emission cores in the Ca II H and K resonance lines. Balmer emission, or HŒ±, is also associated with active chromospheres. X-ray emission is known as a tracer for active coronal regions, and ultraviolet (UV) emission and flaring are, by solar analogy, known to be associated with stellar active and transition regions. These areas on the Sun are associated with intense magnetic fields, and sunspot activity is enhanced in and around these magnetically active regions. Some RS CVn type star are known X-ray and radio emitters. The radio emission is nonthermal in origin (gyrosynchrotron) and is one of the few direct indicators of magnetic fields. The X-ray luminosities are on the order of Lx >> 1024 watts. This emission has been interpreted, in solar analogy, as being caused by a hot, T ~ 107 K, corona. Another subgroup of RS CVns is known to have infrared excess emission, seen by the Spitzer Space Telescope Matranga, M., Drake, J.J., Kashyap, V.L., Marengo, M., & Kuchner, M.J. 2010, Astrophysical Journal NotesReferences * (explains how Doppler imaging works) * =Further reading= *Eaton,J.A. and Hall,D.S. 1979, Astrophys.

He is the bass guitarist of the rock band X Japan. He joined the group in 1992 when ex-bassist Taiji Sawada left the band. Heath stayed with X Japan until the band's dissolution in 1997 and reunited with the band from 2007 onward. After X Japan's breakup he focused on his solo career. In 2000, he founded Dope HEADz with fellow X Japan guitarist Pata and former Spread Beaver percussionist/programmer I.N.A. The group ceased activity after its second album in 2002. His stage name comes from his nickname \\"Hi-chan\\", which he adopted before 1986. Career1986‚Äì2006: Early bands, X Japan, solo career and other work= Heath at X Japan's concert at Madison Square Garden, 2014. Heath's first known band was the heavy metal group Paranoia which he joined in 1986 as bassist, after their vocalist Nov moved on to the popular thrash metal band Aion. They released one album in 1987 before splitting up, and in 1988 he joined Sweet Beet as vocalist for a year. In 1990 he moved to Tokyo and got introduced to hide of X through a mutual friend, visiting their Nippon Budokan concert. In 1991 he played at Extasy Records' Extasy Summit '91 with a band called Majestic Isabelle. In April 1992 he joined Sweet Death, whom he had previously played with in 1990. Sweet Death was a band produced by Extasy Records, that same year the band's new leader Kiyoshi (who years later joined Spread Beaver), decided to change their name to Media Youth. Heath did not stay with them long, because in May hide invited him to join X Japan after a rehearsal with the band. In June he left Media Youth and on August 24, 1992, at a press conference in New York at Rockefeller Center, it was announced that he had joined X. His first concert with them was the October 1992 Extasy Summit, and the following year they released Art of Life, which topped the Oricon chart. However, that year the members of X Japan took a break to start solo projects. Dahlia, which would become the band's last album, was released on November 4, 1996, and once again, it reached the number one spot. In September 1997, it was announced that X Japan would disband. They performed their farewell show, aptly titled \\"The Last Live\\", at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997. In 1995, Heath released his first solo album, Heath, and his second, Gang Age Cubist, in 1998. For the 1999 hide tribute album, Tribute Spirits, Heath teamed up with X Japan guitarist Pata and former Spread Beaver percussionist/programmer I.N.A. to cover the song \\"Celebration\\". He reunited with them in 2000 when they formed Dope HEADz, adding vocalist Jo:Ya. They released two singles and an album in 2002 when they recruited new singer Shame and released Planet of Dope, but ceased activity soon after its release. Heath at Lollapalooza in 2010 On December 29, 2003, he announced a new project called Rats, but after the release of their re-recording of Heath's \\"Traitor\\", the project was ended on August 29, 2004. That same year he formed a band called Lynx, with Der Zibet vocalist Issay, but they did not release any recordings. In 2005, Heath restarted his solo activities after a seven-year hiatus. =2007‚Äìpresent: X Japan reunion= Heath playing alongside Pata in New York, 2014. According to a report by the newspaper Sponichi, X Japan vocalist Toshi visited drummer Yoshiki in Los Angeles in November 2006 to work on a song as a tribute to hide. In March 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a \\"new project\\" would commence soon. Rumors of a X Japan reunion subsequently began, and in June Yoshiki was reported as having expressed interest in a tour and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata regarding their participation. On October 22, 2007, X Japan announced their reunion and released the Saw IV theme song, \\"I.V.\\". In 2010, they went on their first North American tour from September 25 to October 10. Their first world tour began with four gigs in Europe from June 28 to July 4, 2011, and was resumed from September to October with five shows in South America and five in Asia. In response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11, Heath supported X Japan vocalist Toshi in eight concerts throughout western Japan. All of the shows were acoustic in support of nationwide power conservation efforts and also featured Luna Sea's Shinya and the Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa. All proceeds were donated to the Japanese Red Cross to aid the victims. Equipment Heath's bass guitars at X Japan's S√£o Paulo concert in 2011 Heath uses Fernandes bass guitars; currently using his signature model FJB-115H. He also had a signature model with Burny, produced by Fernandes, the DB-85H. When he first joined X Japan he used a Burny WB-X and then a Burny EB-X from 1993 until getting a signature model.

Early life Born in Evansville, Indiana, Mary was the daughter of prominent Fendrich Cigar Company president John H. Fendrich (1867‚Äì1952) and Nettie Buttriss Fendrich (1875‚Äì1975). The Fendrich family was among Evansville's most prominent Catholic families; Mary attended Catholic schools for her education. Marriage and family Mary met Tony Hulman in the early 1920s; by most accounts, the rather headstrong young lady wasn't terribly impressed by Hulman. Not one to be deterred, however, Hulman eventually won her over, and on October 6, 1926, the couple were wed in a lavish ceremony in Evansville. The couple settled in Terre Haute, Indiana following their honeymoon in Europe. Tony Hulman became sales manager of Hulman & Co., while Mary set up housekeeping in their stately new home in the city's fashionable Farrington's Grove neighborhood. On December 26, 1934, the couple's only surviving child, Mary (better known today as Mari Hulman George), was born. While she is the Hulmans' only surviving child, Mari was not the couple's first. A daughter, whom they had also named Mary, was born in Evansville in 1930, but this child died shortly after her birth. Details of the cause of the newborn's death are sketchy at best some 75 years later, but what little information is available seems to indicate that the child suffered from an enlarged liver. A sporting life Like her husband, Mary Hulman was quite sports-minded. An avid golfer, she fit in well with her husband, who also enjoyed the occasional round on the links. Somewhat surprisingly for a woman of her social standing, she also enjoyed shooting skeet competitively and was considered an excellent shot. When Tony purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1945, Mary wondered if he had made a wise purchase, but as a supportive wife, she concurred with Tony's decision and chose to play an active role each year at the race. Drivers and fans alike absolutely loved her. In the early 1970s, the Hulmans would, as noted patrons of sports in the Terre Haute area, donate land and a \\"challenge grant\\" of $2.5M (25% of the estimated construction cost) for the construction of Indiana State University's Hulman Center arena and the city of Terre Haute's public Hulman Links golf course. Philanthropy While husband Tony carried on with his many business interests, Mary became a major contributor to art museums and schools; the Sheldon Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute and the Indianapolis Museum of Art were high on her list, along with Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College and other institutions of higher learning. Later life When Tony Hulman died on October 27, 1977, many wondered what role Mary would choose for herself. With such a large empire to oversee, the possibilities were many, but some felt that she would turn over day to day control to others. But that wasn't Mary's way. Picking up the reins with both hands, she became the chairman of both the Speedway and Hulman & Co., which surprised some observers. At the 1978 Indianapolis 500, she even took over Tony's traditional role, delivering for the first time the famous call of \\"Gentlemen, start your engines!\\" She would continue to give the command (with few exceptions, when daughter Mari delivered it) through 1996. By the mid-1980s, the family's many properties and businesses that Tony had accumulated, plus some acquired in the years following his death, had made Mary Fendrich Hulman a very wealthy woman. In 1986, Forbes magazine named her to the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, worth nearly $180 million at that time. With her vast financial wealth, Mary continued her long-standing tradition of giving generously to her favorite institutions and charities in her later years. As her health declined in the 1990s, Mary gradually relinquished her roles within the family business to her daughter and grandchildren and finally moved from the family's longtime Terre Haute home to Marquette Manor Retirement Community in Indianapolis where she could receive the health care that she needed. Death Mary Fendrich Hulman died from complications due to emphysema on April 10, 1998, at the age of 93. Following her funeral in the same church where Tony Hulman's funeral was held just over 20 years earlier, she was buried by his side in Terre Haute's Calvary Cemetery.

It produces automatic electric guns or AEGs, and a small number of GBB (Gas Blowback) pistols. Designed to resemble real firearms, these replicas fire 6mm plastic BBs at safe velocities. Within the airsoft community, Classic Army is often abbreviated as simply \\"CA.\\" Classic Army AEG's are characterized by their many metal parts and realism, in that most parts that are metal on the real-steel counterpart are also metal on the replica (although they are usually not cross-compatible). These metal components usually include the frame and body, as well as the firing mechanism (called a \\"gearbox\\"). CA replicas also feature pre-upgraded internals such as metal bushings and polycarbonate pistons. As with most AEGs, Classic Army replicas use rechargeable batteries (either NiMH, NiCd)or more recently LiPo.

Originally, Dostoevsky had created the work under the title \\"Discord\\". Themes The novel chronicles the life of 19-year-old intellectual, Arkady Dolgoruky, illegitimate child of the controversial and womanizing landowner Versilov. A focus of the novel is the recurring conflict between father and son, particularly in ideology, which represents the battles between the conventional \\"old\\" way of thinking in the 1840s and the new nihilistic point of view of the youth of 1860s Russia. The young of Arkady's time embraced a very negative opinion of Russian culture in contrast to Western or European culture. Another main theme is Arkady's development and utilization of his \\"idea\\" in his life, mainly a form of rebellion against society (and his father) through the rejection of attending a university, and the making of money and living independently, onto the eventual aim of becoming excessively wealthy and powerful. The question of emancipation or what to do with the newly freed serfs in the face of the corrupting influence of the West looms over the novel. Arkady's mother is a former serf and Versilov is a landowner and understanding their relationship is ultimately at the center of Arkady's quest to find out who Versilov is and what he did to his mother. Answering the question of emancipation, in Dostoevsky's novel, has to do with how to educate the serfs and address the damage of Petrine reforms in order to construct a new Russian identity. The novel was written and serially published while Leo Tolstoy was publishing Anna Karenina. Dostoevsky's novel about the \\"accidental family\\" stands in contrast to Tolstoy's novel about the aristocratic Russian family. Characters *Arkady Makarovich Dolgoruky is the protagonist of the novel. He took the name Dolgoruky from his aged adoptive father, even though he is the illegitimate son of the dissipated landowner Versilov. Arkady's dream is to \\"become a Rothschild\\" (i.e. become fabulously wealthy like a member of the famed Rothschild family). In his quest for wealth Arkady becomes entangled with socialist conspirators and a young widow, whose future is somehow dependent on a document that Arkady has sewn into his jacket. *Makar Ivanovich Dolgoruky is an aging peasant and Arkady's legal father. He is formerly a serf of the Versilov estate. He is a respected wandering religious pilgrim who takes the role of the \\"holy fool\\" in Dostoevsky's works. At his death, he professes a love for God and Christianly virtues. *Andrei Petrovich Versilov is Arkady's biological father and a dissipated landowner. Scandals swirl around him, including a history with a mentally unstable girl and rumors of being a Catholic. At one point, Versilov and Arkady are competing for the affections of the same young woman. *Katerina Nikolaevna Akhmakova is a young widow and romantic interest of both Versilov and Arkady. A letter sewn to Arkady's jacket could have dire consequences for her future. *Monsieur Touchard was Arkady's old school teacher. His strict nature and disrespect of Arkady made a deep impression on the protagonist. *Sofya Andreevna Dolgoruky is Arkady's mother. She was a serf on Versilov's estate before emancipation and married to Makar Ivanovich. She became Versilov's mistress but remained married to Makar Ivanovich.

These are necessary for most optimization problems which use search algorithms, because those algorithms are mainly deterministic and iterative, and they need to start somewhere. One common type of application is nonlinear regression. Use The quality of the initial values can have a considerable impact on the success or lack of such of the search algorithm. This is because the fitness function or objective function (in many cases a sum of squared errors (SSE)) can have difficult shapes. In some parts of the search region, the function may increase exponentially, in others quadratically, and there may be regions where the function asymptotes to a plateau. Starting values that fall in an exponential region can lead to algorithm failure because of arithmetic overflow. Starting values that fall in the asymptotic plateau region can lead to algorithm failure because of \\"dithering\\". Deterministic search algorithms may use a slope function to go to a minimum. If the slope is very small, then underflow errors can cause the algorithm to wander, seemingly aimlessly; this is dithering. Finding value Guess values can be determined a number of ways. Guessing is one of them. If one is familiar with the type of problem, then this is an educated guess or guesstimate. Other techniques include linearization, solving simultaneous equations, reducing dimensions, treating the problem as a time series, converting the problem to a (hopefully) linear differential equation, and using mean values. Further methods for determining starting values and optimal values in their own right come from stochastic methods, the most commonly known of these being evolutionary algorithms and particularly genetic algorithms.

The film is directed by Clive Donner, who had been an editor of the 1951 film Scrooge, and stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. It was filmed in the historic medieval county town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire. Plot The film closely follows the structure of Charles Dickens' original book, with some changes to the story's detail. On Christmas Eve, 1843 London, Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly corn trader, does not share the merriment of Christmas. Scrooge declines his nephew Fred Hollywell's invitation for Christmas dinner and reluctantly accepts his loyal employee Bob Cratchit's request to have Christmas off since there will be no business for Scrooge during the day. As he leaves for the stock exchange, Scrooge encounters Bob's ill son Tiny Tim waiting across from Scrooge's office. After initially mistaking Tim for a beggar, Scrooge assures him that he will have a long wait for his father in the cold before leaving. In the stock exchange, Scrooge charges three other businessmen 5% extra for corn because they failed to meet his demands the day before, much to their dismay. Scrooge then refuses to give a donation to two gentlemen collecting money for charity, Mr. Poole and Mr. Hacking. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley, who warns him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned to the same afterlife as his, carrying heavy chains forged from his own greedy ways. He informs Scrooge that three spirits will visit him that night. At one o'clock, the Ghost of Christmas Past visits Scrooge and takes him back in time to his unhappy childhood and early adult life. They visit Scrooge's time as a boarding school student, abandoned there by his father who wanted nothing to do with him after Scrooge's mother died in childbirth. He sees his grim father Silas, who gets him an apprenticeship with Fezziwig, and his older sister Fan, who has since died. Eventually becoming successful in and business, Scrooge becomes engaged to a woman named Belle. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge that Belle left him when he chose his wealth over her. Finally, the spirit shows Scrooge a now- married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Angered, Scrooge extinguishes the spirit with its cap and finds himself back in his bedroom. At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Bob's house, learning his family is surprisingly content with their small dinner. Scrooge takes pity on Tim after the spirit comments that he will not survive until next Christmas. The spirit then takes Scrooge to Fred's house for the Christmas party that Scrooge had earlier declined to attend, where Fred states that he continues to pursue a relationship with Scrooge for the sake of his late mother, Fan, who Scrooge loved deeply, and Scrooge is touched by this and admits that Fred is right. Scrooge and the spirit then go to a desolate street where he shows Scrooge two hideous children named Ignorance and Want and warns Scrooge to beware of them before he disappears. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appears to Scrooge, and takes him into the future. Scrooge witnesses the businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. Scrooge recognizes several of his stolen possessions being traded to a fence named Old Joe. The spirit transports Scrooge to Bob's residence where he learns Tim had died. Scrooge is then escorted to a cemetery, where the spirit points out his own grave, revealing Scrooge was the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge vows to change his ways and begs to be spared. Awakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge finds the ghosts had visited him all in one night. Gleeful at having survived the spirits, Scrooge anonymously sends the Cratchits a large, prize-winning turkey for dinner. He then ventures out into the city to spread happiness among the citizens of London. Scrooge finds the charity workers he encountered before and much to their elation, Scrooge agrees to make a large donation. Scrooge also accepts Fred's Christmas invitation after reconciling with him. The following day, he gives Cratchit a raise and becomes like \\"a second father\\" to Tim, who escapes death. A changed man, Scrooge now treats everyone with kindness, generosity, and compassion; he now embodies the spirit of Christmas. Cast Tombstone from the graveyard scene.

It originally aired on the American television network CBS on 17 December 1984, and was released theatrically in Great Britain. The U.S. debut was sponsored by IBM, which purchased all of the commercial spots for the two-hour premiere. The film brought in a 20.7/30 rating/share, winning its time slot and ranking No. 10 for the week. The film was marketed with the tagline \\"A new powerful presentation of the most loved ghost story of all time!\\" Scott was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special for his portrayal of Scrooge. The movie has run in syndication on local American channels since it debuted in 1984, earning a loyal fanbase, but was not released on VHS until 1989 (in the UK) and to DVD in 1999. This was because Scott himself (and later his estate through Baxter Healthcare, to whom the Scott family donated their copyright) owned the rights to this film. On 25 November 2007, it returned to national television on AMC for the first time since its debut, and the network continues to broadcast it each December under license from the Scott estate and 20th Century Fox (the latter's distribution rights the result of their owning the video rights). In 2009, the Hallmark Channel also ran the movie soon after Thanksgiving. It remains among the most beloved of the several adaptations of A Christmas Carol. In 2009, the film was re-released on DVD by Fox, with updated box art but the same menu and features as the previous DVD release. Fox released it on Blu-ray in December 2010. Critical response Novelist and essayist Louis Bayard, writing for Salon.com, described this adaptation as \\"the definitive version of a beloved literary classic\\", praising its fidelity to Dickens' original story, the strength of the supporting cast, and especially Scott's performance as Scrooge.

The northwest corner of the town borders on the grounds of the Crestwood Country Club. The Crestwood golf course opened in 1958.Crestwood Gold Course History ;In 1905 Chicopee was described: Chicopee lies southwest of Pittsburg, and about the same distance as Frontenac on the northeast. Here is another mining village, of about one thousand population. The street cars from Pittsburg reach this town, and the Missouri Pacific and Santa Fe Railroads pass through this place. Several stores, a postoffice, boarding houses and other conveniences accommodate the people. Most of the inhabitants are of foreign birth, the Italian race predominating. The people are nearly all coal miners, and work for the several coal companies operating about Chicopee. They have good schools, which are well attended, and the children of these foreign born people are quick to get learning, and soon become excellent business men and women. ;In 1912 Chicopee was described: As one of the principal towns of Crawford county, is located in Baker township, 13 miles southeast of Girard, the county seat, and 4 miles southwest of Pittsburg. It is in the coal fields, and the chief occupation of the people is mining and shipping coal, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and the Missouri Pacific railroads (now abandoned before 2007) furnishing excellent transportation facilities. The town has a money order postoffice, telegraph and telephone facilities, Catholic and Protestant churches, good public schools, some well stocked stores, and in 1910 reported a population of 955.

The name comes from the archetype for this category of variable star system, BY Draconis. They exhibit variations in their luminosity due to rotation of the star coupled with starspots, and other chromospheric activity. Resultant brightness fluctuations are generally less than 0.5 magnitudes. Light curves of BY Draconis variables are quasiperiodic. The period is close to the star's mean rotational rate. The light curve is irregular over the duration of the period and it changes slightly in shape from one period to the next. For the star BY Draconis the shape of the light curve over a period remained similar for a month. Nearby K and M stars that are BY Draconis variables include Barnard's Star, Kapteyn's Star, 61 Cygni, Ross 248, Lacaille 8760, Lalande 21185, and Luyten 726-8. Ross 248 is the first discovered BY Draconis variable, the variability having been identified by Gerald Edward Kron in 1950. The variability of BY Draconis itself was discovered in 1966 and studied in detail by Pavel Fedorovich Chugainov over the period 1973‚Äì1976. Some of these stars may exhibit flares, resulting in additional variations of the UV Ceti type. Likewise, the spectra of BY Draconis variables (particularly in their H and K lines) are similar to RS CVn stars, which are another class of variable stars that have active chromospheres.

It is west-southwest of Carlisle. Historically a part of Cumberland, Crofton was one of three small townships in the centre of the former Parish of Thursby. It was originally called Croft-town, derived from the word Croft, as the town standing upon the Crofts. Notable landmarks were Crofton Place, the seat of Sir Wastel Brisco, Bart. It also became a surname to John Crofton. Although Crofton Hall was demolished in approximately 1955‚Äì1956, some of the estate buildings remain, and the gateway and pond are notable remnants. Crofton Estate was taken over by the Land Settlement Association a government initiative to get poorer people involved in agriculture and horticultural production. The LSA estate was composed of Bank End, East Park, West Park, Shaw Wood and Whinnow Land Settlement Small Holdings. The LSA was disbanded in 1974 and some small holders were left destitute, others continued to farm the land as private owners. The LSA small holders were from a variety of backgrounds and places, Irish, Polish, Scottish, Cumbrian and other parts of England. The stables of the Brisco estate house were used as the LSA headquarters. The lake has recently been reinstated after decades of neglect.

Early life Dupain received his first camera as a gift in 1924, spurring his interest in photography. He later joined the Photographic Society of NSW, where he was taught by Justin Newlan; after completing his tertiary studies, he worked for Cecil Bostock in Sydney. CareerEarly years= Sunbaker Max Dupain, 1975 silver gelatin print from original 1937 negative By 1934 Max Dupain had struck out on his own and opened a studio in Bond Street, Sydney. In 1937, while on the south coast of New South Wales, he photographed the head and shoulders of an English friend, Harold Salvage, lying on the sand at Culburra Beach. But it was not until the 1970s that the photograph began to receive wide recognition. A print of the photograph was purchased in 1976 by the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra and by the 1990s it had cemented its place as an iconic image of Australia. An early vintage print of the original version of the Sunbaker is contained an album of photographs donated to the State Library of New South Wales by Dupain's friend, the architect Chris Vandyke. =Later years= Adelaide street scene by Dupain (1946) During World War II Dupain served with the Royal Australian Air Force in both Darwin and Papua New Guinea helping to create camouflage. The war affected Dupain and his photography, by creating in him a greater awareness of truth in documentary. In 1947, these feelings were reinforced when he read a book Grierson on Documentary which defined the need for photography without pretence. The catchcry was \\"the creative treatment of actuality\\". Dupain was keen to restart the studio with this new perspective and abandon what he called the \\"cosmetic lie of fashion photography or advertising illustration\\". Refusing to return to the \\"cosmetic lie\\" of advertising, Dupain said: > \\"Modern photography must do more than entertain, it must incite thought and > by its clear statements of actuality, cultivate a sympathetic understanding > of men and women and the life they live and create.\\" Dupain's documentary work of this period is exemplified in his photograph \\"Meat Queue\\". He used a more naturalistic style of photography, \\"capturing a moment of everyday interaction [rather than] attempting any social comment\\". Dupain also worked extensively for the University of New South Wales and CSR Limited and made many trips to the interior and coast of northern Australia. However, apart from his war service he rarely left Australia, the first time not until 1978, when he was 67, and even then it was to photograph the new Australian Embassy in Paris, designed by his longtime friend and associate Harry Seidler.Richard Yallop, \\"The pleasures of Dupain\\", The Weekend Australian, 23‚Äì24 September 2000 He wrote, \\"I find that my whole life, if it is going to be of any consequence in photography, has to be devoted to that place where I have been born, reared and worked, thought, philosophised and made pictures to the best of my ability. And that's all I need\\".Sebastian Smee, \\"On the beach\\", Good Weekend magazine, Sydney Morning Herald, 21 October 2000 In the 1950s the advent of the new consumerism meant that there was plenty of promotional photography for advertising and he attracted clients from magazines, advertising agencies and industrial firms. In between this he devoted time to pursue his love of architecture, and began architectural photography, which he continued most of his life. The State Library of New South Wales holds the most significant archive of Max Dupain's work. In June 2016 it was announced that the State Library now holds the entire photographic collection of Max Dupain (1911‚Äì1992). This now adds the Max Dupain Exhibition Archive of 28,000 negatives including the Sunbaker and Bondi, 1939, as well as lesser-known photographs such as his fantastic record of Penrith in Sydney's west in 1948. These images join existing collections of Dupain's commercial and architectural photography, studio portraits, and his record of the Ballet Russes. Dupain continued working until his death in 1992. Personal life In 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, Dupain married Olive Cotton (also a photographer) but they divorced soon after. A decade later, Dupain married Diana Illingworth and subsequently they had a daughter Danina and a son Rex, who also became a photographer.

He died on February 22, 2000. Dual method of the Old Form of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan Tchoung Ta-tchen developed his own form based on the Yang style of t'ai chi ch'uan. As a young man Tchoung studied his family's style of t'ai chi ch'uan and tui na (massage). He also was a track athlete. He became a professional soldier and Army officer. In 1943, he studied qigong and t'ai chi ch'uan with Abbott Hui Kung, at the Omei Monastery in Sichuan province. He learned baguazhang and I-ch'uan from his friend Wang Shu Chin and Xingyiquan from his friend Yuan Tao. Tchoung studied with Shi Tiao Mei who was a student of Tian Shaolin. Tian was a disciple of Yang Chien-hou. Tchoung Ta-tchen also studied with Hsiung Yang-ho, who was one of the few disciples of Yang Shao-hou. Hsiung also taught Tchoung's friend Liang Tsung-tsai. Tchoung and Liang were workout partners. Tchoung was also a pushing hands partner of Cheng Man-ch'ing. Liang was Cheng's teaching assistant in Taiwan but had several other teachers as well. Kuo Lien Ying was another of Tchoung's practice partners. Tchoung was a member of the Taiwan-based Chinese Tai Chi Ch'uan Association. The CTCCA was a multi style group of t'ai chi ch'uan masters. The CTCCA made Tchoung a delegate and he traveled to Africa to teach President Bongo of Gabon t'ai chi ch'uan. Tchoung then traveled to South Africa where he taught for some time. Eventually he moved to Vancouver BC, Canada. He taught in Vancouver and Seattle, Washington. Continued teaching of his system His students who continue to teach his system include Andrew Dale, Harvey Kurland, Tim Glasheen, Peter Dickson, Laurens Lee, and Donald Scott. Tchoung Ta-chen taught his evolving version of t'ai chi ch'uan in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Seattle, Washington. His primary school was in Vancouver's Chinatown. He became a popular t'ai chi ch'uan teacher in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. =Public ceremony in 1986= Tchoung officially authorized a few of his advanced students to teach his system. In a public ceremony in 1986 Tchoung said only five students in the USA could teach his system at that time. Those were Carey Brooks, Andrew Dale, David Harris, Harvey Kurland and Don Scott. There are several teachers of his system who are currently teaching, including the following direct students in the United States: Andrew Dale, David Harris, Don Scott in Seattle, Washington and Harvey Kurland in Riverside, California. Several of his students are teaching in Canada, including Tim Glasheen in Vancouver, BC, Peter Dickson in Terrace, BC, John Camp in White Rock, BC, and Eric Eastman in Nelson, BC, Canada. Most of Tchoung's official students pictures can be found in Tchoung's text (Tchoung 1995).  Philosophy  According to Kurland, \\"Tchoung's philosophy was to teach his students everything he could. Not hold back, as many teachers did. That is the reason so many students left their previous schools to study with him. He tells his students from the beginning that he can teach them the method, but it is up to them as to what they do with it. That is if they do not train hard, they will not achieve their potential. He says there are no magical secret, just hard training and coaching. He saw that there was a decay in t'ai-chi ch'uan quality in China and the world. That is the art was becoming conceptually a calisthenics exercise or performance art, and the old martial value and traditional method was being lost.\\" \\"Tchoung felt the previous generation's skill being lost or watered down was due to the concept of always holding a little back from the student (as well as intentional persecuting of the art and modernizing it on the mainland). So every generation lost a little more, so now even the top names were merely shells of the older art, very few had any real skill.\\" References * Black Belt Magazine, \\"The Web of Tai Chi Chuan\\", July, 1988, 104‚Äì108. * Tchoung Ta-tchen, The Annotated and Theoretical T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Vancouver BC, 1995.

It is also used as a construction method for building a sorting network. The algorithm was devised by Ken Batcher. The resulting sorting networks consist of O(n\\\\log^2(n)) comparators and have a delay of O(\\\\log^2(n)), where n is the number of items to be sorted.Bitonic sorting network for n not a power of 2 A sorted sequence is a monotonically non-decreasing (or non-increasing) sequence. A bitonic sequence is a sequence with x_0 \\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq x_k \\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq x_{n-1} for some k, 0 \\\\leq k < n, or a circular shift of such a sequence.  Complexity  Let p = \\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 n \\\\rfloor and q = \\\\lceil \\\\log_2 n \\\\rceil. It is obvious from the construction algorithm that the number of rounds of parallel comparisons is given by q(q+1)/2. It follows that the number of comparators c is bounded 2 ^{p-1} \\\\cdot p (p+1) /2 \\\\leq c \\\\leq \\\\lfloor {n/2} \\\\rfloor \\\\cdot q (q+1) /2 (which establishes an exact value for c when n is a power of 2).  How the algorithm works  The following is a bitonic sorting network with 16 inputs: Diagram of the bitonic sorting network with 16 inputs and arrows The 16 numbers enter as the inputs at the left end, slide along each of the 16 horizontal wires, and exit at the outputs at the right end. The network is designed to sort the elements, with the largest number at the bottom. The arrows are comparators. Whenever two numbers reach the two ends of an arrow, they are compared to ensure that the arrow points toward the larger number. If they are out of order, they are swapped. The colored boxes are just for illustration and have no effect on the algorithm. Every red box has the same structure: each input in the top half is compared to the corresponding input in the bottom half, with all arrows pointing down (dark red) or all up (light red). If the inputs happen to form a bitonic sequence (a single nondecreasing sequence followed by a single nonincreasing one or vice versa), then the output will form two bitonic sequences. The top half of the output will be bitonic, and the bottom half will be bitonic, with every element of the top half less than or equal to every element of the bottom half (for dark red) or vice versa (for light red). This theorem is not obvious, but can be verified by carefully considering all the cases of how the various inputs might compare, using the zero-one principle, where a bitonic sequence is a sequence of 0s and 1s that contains no more than two \\"10\\" or \\"01\\" subsequences. The red boxes combine to form blue and green boxes. Every such box has the same structure: a red box is applied to the entire input sequence, then to each half of the result, then to each half of each of those results, and so on. All arrows point down (blue) or all point up (green). This structure is known as a butterfly network. If the input to this box happens to be bitonic, then the output will be completely sorted in increasing order (blue) or decreasing order (green). If a number enters the blue or green box, then the first red box will sort it into the correct half of the list. It will then pass through a smaller red box that sorts it into the correct quarter of the list within that half. This continues until it is sorted into exactly the correct position. Therefore, the output of the green or blue box will be completely sorted. The green and blue boxes combine to form the entire sorting network. For any arbitrary sequence of inputs, it will sort them correctly, with the largest at the bottom. The output of each green or blue box will be a sorted sequence, so the output of each pair of adjacent lists will be bitonic, because the top one is blue and the bottom one is green. Each column of blue and green boxes takes N sorted sequences and concatenates them in pairs to form N/2 bitonic sequences, which are then sorted by the boxes in that column to form N/2 sorted sequences. This process starts with each input considered to be a sorted list of one element, and continues through all the columns until the last merges them into a single, sorted list. Because the last stage was blue, this final list will have the largest element at the bottom. = Alternative representation = Each green box performs the same operation as a blue box, but with the sort in the opposite direction. So, each green box could be replaced by a blue box followed by a crossover where all the wires move to the opposite position. This would allow all the arrows to point the same direction, but would prevent the horizontal lines from being straight. However, a similar crossover could be placed to the right of the bottom half of the outputs from any red block, and the sort would still work correctly, because the reverse of a bitonic sequence is still bitonic. If a red box then has a crossover before and after it, it can be rearranged internally so the two crossovers cancel, so the wires become straight again. Therefore, the following diagram is equivalent to the one above, where each green box has become a blue plus a crossover, and each orange box is a red box that absorbed two such crossovers: Diagram of the bitonic sorting network with 16 inputs (and no arrows) The arrowheads are not drawn, because every comparator sorts in the same direction. The blue and red blocks perform the same operations as before. The orange blocks are equivalent to red blocks where the sequence order is reversed for the bottom half of its inputs and the bottom half of its outputs.

They were responsible for the original Romanesque-Byzantine east end and crossing of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York, and for the original Astor Court buildings of the Bronx Zoo, which formed a complete ensemble reflecting the aesthetic of the City Beautiful movement. Heins & LaFarge provided the architecture and details for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the first precursor to the New York City Subway. Early career The two young men met at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and trained together in the Boston offices of Henry Hobson Richardson. Heins married LaFarge's aunt Aim√©e La Farge (youngest sister of John La Farge), who was only two years older than her nephew.LaFarge, John, S.J. The Manner Is Ordinary. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1954, p.9. In 1886, they opened their office. Heins was the man on the site; LaFarge was the principal designer. Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York Interior view of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York In 1888, a design competition for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the most prominent project of its kind in the US, was entered by 68 architectural firms, and won in 1891 by Heins & LaFarge, with an eclectic design, based on Romanesque forms but with many Byzantine and Gothic elements, dominated by a massive spired tower over the crossing. The cornerstone was laid December 27, 1892, but unexpectedly, massive excavation was required before bedrock was hit. Heins & LaFarge completed the east end and the crossing, temporarily roofed by Rafael Guastavino with a tiled dome (still standing). The Chapel of St. Columba was consecrated in 1911, but the death of Heins ended the contract with Heins & LaFarge. Some of the Cathedral trustees did not care for the original Romaneque-Byzantine design, preferring something more purely Gothic, and consequently they removed the project from LaFarge, the surviving architect of the team.LaFarge, John, S.J. The Manner Is Ordinary. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1954, pp. 389-91. They hired a new architect Ralph Adams Cram, whose nave and west front would be continued in French Gothic style. Enoch Grand Lodge, Brooklyn The other prime commission in New York City was the Fourth Presbyterian Church (1893-94), now Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, at West End Avenue and West 91st Street on the Upper West Side, a tribute to their joint master. The rusticated masonry fa√ßade with a sparing use of Venetian Gothic and Richardsonian Romanesque details and the square corner bell tower with a crenellated parapet embellished with gargoyle gutter- spouts reveal Richardson's training. The fine stained glass may be from Tiffany studios, or may be by John La Farge, the architect's father, which would make them even rarer. The domed crossing of St. Matthew the Apostle, Washington DC, 1893 An exercise in a somewhat subdued Richardsonian manner, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn, is Heins & LaFarge's Reformed Episcopal Church of the Reconciliation (1890), now the Most Worshipful Enoch Grand Lodge of the Order of Masons. It too has a corner tower that is octagonal and embedded in the volume of the church in a most Richardsonian manner, though the materials used are tame, brick, now painted, rather than Richardsonian rustication. In Washington DC, the church, now Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, was begun in 1893, to designs of LaFarge. It is a brick structure of an abbreviated Latin cross floorplan with such a prominent crossing dome, raised on an octagonal drum lit by ranges of arch-headed windows, that has something of the aspect of a centrally-planned Greek cross. The interior is rich with frescoes and mosaics and inlaid marble floors in full American Renaissance manner. The first mass was celebrated on June 2, 1895, and the completed church was dedicated in 1913. The firm designed other Catholic Churches, including the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, Providence, RI, and Holy Trinity Church, West Point, NY. La Farge has been called \\"America's leading church architect\\".Clarke, T. Emigr√©s in the Wilderness. New York: Macmillan, 1941, p.178. Mid career In 1899, Heins was appointed New York State architect by Governor Theodore Roosevelt, and he designed interiors for the first buildings at the State University of New York, Albany: the Auditorium and the Science and Administration Buildings.State University of New York campus buildings. He held that position until his death in 1907. While serving in that capacity his office designed the Flushing Armory, Geneva Armory, Gloversville Armory, Medina Armory, Main Street Armory in Rochester, Oneonta Armory and Oswego Armory. LaFarge, a fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), often served on advisory committees for the schools of architecture at Columbia University, M.I.T. and Princeton University, and also as trustee and secretary for the American Academy in Rome. Roosevelt was also a prime mover behind the creation of the New York Zoological Society, for whom the partners designed the original nucleus of buildings (1899-1910, now called the Astor Court) as a series of pavilions symmetrically grouped round the large sea lion pool, all in a sturdy brick and limestone Roman Ionic and Doric, with the heads of elephants and rhinos, lions and zebras projecting festively from panels and friezes. The central Administration Building (1910), offering an arched passageway to the zoo's outdoor spaces, has complicated domed spaces formed of Guastavino tile. University commissions were also in their oeuvre. At Yale University, their rusticated Richardsonian Romanesque design for a chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, also known as the Delta Psi fraternity, stood from 1894 to 1913. Their ornamental iron gates were re-used in the 1913 successor by Charles C. Haight.Original building described in and pictured at: Later building with re-used gates at In 1899, Heins & LaFarge built the Houghton Memorial Chapel at Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts, Richardsonian in its recessed entrance, dominating central tower and interpenetrating Romanesque massing. Also in 1899, at the United States Military Academy, West Point, they erected the Roman Catholic chapel of the Most Holy Trinity, also hearkening back to their Richardson apprenticeship with an essay in rusticated granite, with a battlemented corner tower and a heavy arcaded porch. It was enlarged in 1959. End of career In 1903 Heins & LaFarge were commissioned to design the Municipal Building for Washington DC. In 1904 they were commissioned to design the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St James in Seattle by Bishop Edward J. O‚ÄôDea, whose diocese had purchased property on Seattle‚Äôs First Hill and demanded a cathedral ‚Äúthat must surpass anything in the West.‚Äù The Italian quattrocento design features tall, paired campanili at the west end and a central dome. The firm sent two young architects, W. Marbury Somervell and Joseph S. Cot√©, to oversee construction on the site, who went on to establish a thriving architectural practice in Seattle. The cornerstone ceremony took place on November 12, 1905. The cathedral was completed in 1907 and solemnly dedicated on December 22, 1907. Unhappily, under the weight of two feet of wet snow the dome collapsed on the afternoon of February 2, 1916, dropping 400 tons of masonry eighty feet into the empty cathedral, shattering every window and leaving a gaping hole that exposed it to the elements. The cathedral reopened on March 18, 1917, but with a flat roof over the crossing. The central repositioning of the altar in response to reforms of the Second Vatican Council has finally brought it into the position envisaged by the architects. IRT Control house at Bowling Green, 1905 Beginning in 1901, Heins & LaFarge designed subway stations and buildings for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company under the direction of the chief engineer, William Barclay Parsons. When the Interborough Rapid Transit's original line opened on October 27, 1904, its showpiece station was City Hall, designed by Heins & LaFarge using uninterrupted sweeping Guastavino-tiled arches and vaults which incorporated shaped skylights and mosaics and polychrome terracotta panels. Throughout the original stations the polychrome faience panels (from Grueby Faience Company, Boston, and Atlantic Terra Cotta Company of Staten Island and New Jersey) were designed by the firm, using several tile patterns. The partners' control house for the IRT is at Bowling Green station under Manhattan's Bowling Green at the corner of the Battery in the Dutch Renaissance manner reminiscent of New Amsterdam. A few Heins & LaFarge subway entrances survive, including the one at 72nd Street and Broadway. After Heins died in 1907, LaFarge decided to pursue a solo practice and in 1908 was replaced as architect in charge of the IRT project by Squire J.

It is the second part of the 10th episode of the third season, and the second half of the 50th episode overall. The episode was written by Aaron Springer, C. H. Greenblatt, and Kent Osborne, and the animation was directed by Frank Weiss. Springer and Greenblatt also served as storyboard directors, and Caleb Meurer served as storyboard artist. The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 10, 2002. The series follows the adventures and endeavours of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob is depicted as a trainee in an industrial training video for new employees of the Krusty Krab restaurant. The video details the beginnings of the restaurant, its various implements, and what it takes to become a good Krusty Krab employee. \\"Krusty Krab Training Video\\" received critical acclaim from online critics, who praised its originality and meta-humour for being a parody of industrial videos. Plot The episode is formatted as an industrial training video, with the narrator (Steve Kehela) beginning by congratulating the newly hired employee of the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob asks if he can now make a Krabby Patty burger, with the narrator rebuffing his question for now, and first shares how the restaurant was not always the success it is at present. The narrator briefly tells about its owner, Mr. Krabs, who suffered from a long depression after \\"the war\\" before deciding to acquire a bankrupt retirement home and turn it into a restaurant. In present day, the restaurant has since tried to modernize itself and maintain customer satisfaction by acquiring the \\"latest\\" fast food technology, such as the spatula and the cash register among others. For the restaurant's employees, the narrator differentiates the characteristics of a potentially good employee and a bad employee through the examples of SpongeBob and Squidward respectively. SpongeBob repeats his question from earlier, to which the narrator replies that he must first know about the acronym \\"P.O.O.P.\\" (short for \\"People Order Our Patties\\") before he can make Krabby Patties. Other matters discussed by the narrator include personal hygiene, the work station, and how to interact with the manager Mr. Krabs, all while SpongeBob impatiently awaits the chance to make a Krabby Patty. With the narrator finished telling SpongeBob about all the basics of being an employee, he asks if SpongeBob is ready to prepare a Krabby Patty. As SpongeBob vigorously answers yes, the narrator is about to tell the burger's secret formula before the training video abruptly cuts to the credits. Release \\"Krusty Krab Training Video\\" originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 10, 2002. For home media, the episode was first made available as part of the SpongeBob SquarePants DVD release titled \\"SpongeBob SquarePants: Sponge for Hire\\" on November 2, 2004.

The species name hodsonae originates from Debra Hodson, the wife of a researcher. Two fairly intact specimens were found by amateur fossil hunters in 1983 (1981 by some sources) in the Haile limestone mines in Alachua County, Florida. In 1994, the fossils were examined, and it was decided that the cats were of an entirely new genus.Cookie-Cutter Cat Not as Cute as the Name Sounds, Wired The fossils were of Irvingtonian age (1.8 to 0.3 Ma).Paleobiology Database: Xenosmilus, Age range and collections Because the skeletons were found beside each other, some suspect Xenosmilus was a social mammal. Found alongside the two skeletons were dozens of peccary bones. It seems likely, with their muscular builds, that X. hodsonae preyed upon peccaries. It has also been theorized by some to have hunted via a \\"bite and retreat\\" strategy using its teeth to inflict deep wounds because of the way its canines and incisors could operate as a unit during a bite, leading to Xenosmilus bearing the occasional moniker of \\"cookie-cutter cat\\". Xenosmilus and Glyptodon Physically, the cat measured between long with a highly muscular body and probably weighed around , making it similar in size to the fellow machairodonts Machairodus horribilis and Amphimachiarodus kabir. Only Smilodon populator was noticeably larger amongst the saber-toothed cats. Before their discovery, all known saber- toothed cats fell into two general categories. Dirk toothed cats had long upper canines and stout legs. Scimitar toothed cats had only mildly elongated canines, and long legs. Xenosmilus broke these groupings by possessing both stout muscular legs and body, and short broad upper canines.A more fearsome saber-toothed cat, ScienceNews, October 20, 2008 Unlike most other saber- toothed cats, all of Xenosmilus's teeth were serrated, not just its fangs and incisors. The way its top teeth were lined up also allowed Xenosmilus to concentrate its bite force on two teeth at a time.

Their early garage incarnation was a lot easier to classify and won fans easily, but the band evolved away from these roots from the late 1980s into more cerebral and accomplished directions. They released four studio albums, Where Particular People Congregate (1988), Destroyer of Worlds (1990), Reap (1992), and Burn (1994) before they disbanded in 1999. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane described the group as \\"one of the first Australian bands of the 1980s to play wild, 1960s-inspired garage-punk\\". History The Bo-Weevils formed early in 1985 in Melbourne with the line up of Steve Anderson on guitar; Ian Hill on vocals, keyboards, and guitar (ex-Fizzpops, Crackajacks, Olympic Sideburns, Big Fans of Jesus); Mark Jenkinson on drums and Neil Rogers on bass guitar. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane described the group as \\"one of the first Australian bands of the 1980s to play wild, 1960s-inspired garage-punk\\". The group's work including \\"Lies\\", which appeared in August 1986 on Kavern 7 record label's extended play, The Bo-Weevils, and \\"That Girl\\" from their single in November, represent their \\"garage-punk roots\\". In September that year they recorded a performance at The Tote Hotel, which was issued as Garage Twangin' Retard Rabble Sounds, on cassette later that year. In April 1987 Anderson was replaced by Nino Spadaro on guitar and vocals; and Hill was replaced by Davern White on keyboards, guitar, and vocals (ex-Undecided). The band issued their next EP, The Vortex Took Them, in March 1988. Their debut studio album, Where Particular People Congregate, appeared in March 1989 on Mr. Spaceman Records. It was co-produced by the band with Kaj Dahlstrom and recorded the previous year in August and September. It was followed by Destroyer of Worlds on Rubber Records in May 1990. McFarlane noted the group were now \\"stretching out under the influence of Green on Red, the Rain Parade and other roots-rock influenced contemporary American outfits\\". The Bo-Weevils next albums, Reap (October 1992) and Burn (November 1995), were \\"straight- ahead, guitar rock releases\\". After the appearance of a compilation album, Trapped in the Garage (December 1996), Hill rejoined the group for a tour early the next year to promote it. In March 1999 The Bo-Weevils undertook their farewell tour and issued another compilation, Get On Down. They had a cult following in Australia and Europe during the late 1980s to mid 1990s, and performed local shows as well as tours to Sydney, Adelaide and Wellington. Elements of their sound are similar to other contemporary Australian bands, Died Pretty, Hoodoo Gurus, The Stems and The Church as well as American group, The Dream Syndicate. In 2007 Off the Hip Records issued a 2√ó CD compilation album, The Bo-Weevils Anthology. Afterwards Rogers and White were members of A.1 Mining Company. Hill, Jenkinson and Spadaro formed The Fizzleheads. Rogers has worked as a DJ on Melbourne radio station, 3RRR since 1983. He was later the manager for Cosmic Psychos. In 2008 he was described as a 'doyen' of Australian radio by music journalist, Patrick Donovan of The Age, for his 25 years of hosting The Australian Mood. He plays exclusively Australian acts, and the program's opening theme is \\"a wild, one-chord exploration that goes on forever\\" according to Chris Hollow of Sand Pebbles, and was originally recorded by The Bo-Weevils.

Regression analysis seeks to find the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Certain widely used methods of regression, such as ordinary least squares, have favourable properties if their underlying assumptions are true, but can give misleading results if those assumptions are not true; thus ordinary least squares is said to be not robust to violations of its assumptions. Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process. In particular, least squares estimates for regression models are highly sensitive to outliers. While there is no precise definition of an outlier, outliers are observations that do not follow the pattern of the other observations. This is not normally a problem if the outlier is simply an extreme observation drawn from the tail of a normal distribution, but if the outlier results from non-normal measurement error or some other violation of standard ordinary least squares assumptions, then it compromises the validity of the regression results if a non-robust regression technique is used.  Applications  Heteroscedastic errors = One instance in which robust estimation should be considered is when there is a strong suspicion of heteroscedasticity. In the homoscedastic model, it is assumed that the variance of the error term is constant for all values of x. Heteroscedasticity allows the variance to be dependent on x, which is more accurate for many real scenarios. For example, the variance of expenditure is often larger for individuals with higher income than for individuals with lower incomes. Software packages usually default to a homoscedastic model, even though such a model may be less accurate than a heteroscedastic model. One simple approach (Tofallis, 2008) is to apply least squares to percentage errors, as this reduces the influence of the larger values of the dependent variable compared to ordinary least squares. = Presence of outliers = Another common situation in which robust estimation is used occurs when the data contain outliers. In the presence of outliers that do not come from the same data-generating process as the rest of the data, least squares estimation is inefficient and can be biased. Because the least squares predictions are dragged towards the outliers, and because the variance of the estimates is artificially inflated, the result is that outliers can be masked. (In many situations, including some areas of geostatistics and medical statistics, it is precisely the outliers that are of interest.) Although it is sometimes claimed that least squares (or classical statistical methods in general) are robust, they are only robust in the sense that the type I error rate does not increase under violations of the model. In fact, the type I error rate tends to be lower than the nominal level when outliers are present, and there is often a dramatic increase in the type II error rate. The reduction of the type I error rate has been labelled as the conservatism of classical methods.  History and unpopularity of robust regression  Despite their superior performance over least squares estimation in many situations, robust methods for regression are still not widely used. Several reasons may help explain their unpopularity (Hampel et al. 1986, 2005). One possible reason is that there are several competing methods and the field got off to many false starts. Also, computation of robust estimates is much more computationally intensive than least squares estimation; in recent years, however, this objection has become less relevant, as computing power has increased greatly. Another reason may be that some popular statistical software packages failed to implement the methods (Stromberg, 2004). The belief of many statisticians that classical methods are robust may be another reason. Although uptake of robust methods has been slow, modern mainstream statistics text books often include discussion of these methods (for example, the books by Seber and Lee, and by Faraway; for a good general description of how the various robust regression methods developed from one another see Andersen's book). Also, modern statistical software packages such as R, Statsmodels, Stata and S-PLUS include considerable functionality for robust estimation (see, for example, the books by Venables and Ripley, and by Maronna et al.).  Methods for robust regression  Least squares alternatives = The simplest methods of estimating parameters in a regression model that are less sensitive to outliers than the least squares estimates, is to use least absolute deviations. Even then, gross outliers can still have a considerable impact on the model, motivating research into even more robust approaches. In 1964, Huber introduced M-estimation for regression. The M in M-estimation stands for \\"maximum likelihood type\\". The method is robust to outliers in the response variable, but turned out not to be resistant to outliers in the explanatory variables (leverage points). In fact, when there are outliers in the explanatory variables, the method has no advantage over least squares. In the 1980s, several alternatives to M-estimation were proposed as attempts to overcome the lack of resistance. See the book by Rousseeuw and Leroy for a very practical review. Least trimmed squares (LTS) is a viable alternative and is currently (2007) the preferred choice of Rousseeuw and Ryan (1997, 2008). The Theil‚ÄìSen estimator has a lower breakdown point than LTS but is statistically efficient and popular. Another proposed solution was S-estimation. This method finds a line (plane or hyperplane) that minimizes a robust estimate of the scale (from which the method gets the S in its name) of the residuals. This method is highly resistant to leverage points and is robust to outliers in the response. However, this method was also found to be inefficient. MM-estimation attempts to retain the robustness and resistance of S-estimation, whilst gaining the efficiency of M-estimation. The method proceeds by finding a highly robust and resistant S-estimate that minimizes an M-estimate of the scale of the residuals (the first M in the method's name). The estimated scale is then held constant whilst a close by M-estimate of the parameters is located (the second M). = Parametric alternatives = Another approach to robust estimation of regression models is to replace the normal distribution with a heavy-tailed distribution. A t-distribution with 4‚Äì6 degrees of freedom has been reported to be a good choice in various practical situations. Bayesian robust regression, being fully parametric, relies heavily on such distributions. Under the assumption of t-distributed residuals, the distribution is a location-scale family. That is, x \\\\leftarrow (x-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma. The degrees of freedom of the t-distribution is sometimes called the kurtosis parameter. Lange, Little and Taylor (1989) discuss this model in some depth from a non-Bayesian point of view. A Bayesian account appears in Gelman et al. (2003). An alternative parametric approach is to assume that the residuals follow a mixture of normal distributions; in particular, a contaminated normal distribution in which the majority of observations are from a specified normal distribution, but a small proportion are from a normal distribution with much higher variance. That is, residuals have probability 1-\\\\varepsilon of coming from a normal distribution with variance \\\\sigma^2, where \\\\varepsilon is small, and probability \\\\varepsilon of coming from a normal distribution with variance c\\\\sigma^2 for some c > 1: :e_i \\\\sim (1 - \\\\varepsilon) N(0, \\\\sigma^2) + \\\\varepsilon N(0, c\\\\sigma^2). Typically, \\\\varepsilon < 0.1. This is sometimes called the \\\\varepsilon-contamination model. Parametric approaches have the advantage that likelihood theory provides an \\"off-the-shelf\\" approach to inference (although for mixture models such as the \\\\varepsilon-contamination model, the usual regularity conditions might not apply), and it is possible to build simulation models from the fit. However, such parametric models still assume that the underlying model is literally true. As such, they do not account for skewed residual distributions or finite observation precisions. = Unit weights = Another robust method is the use of unit weights (Wainer & Thissen, 1976), a method that can be applied when there are multiple predictors of a single outcome. Ernest Burgess (1928) used unit weights to predict success on parole. He scored 21 positive factors as present (e.g., \\"no prior arrest\\" = 1) or absent (\\"prior arrest\\" = 0), then summed to yield a predictor score, which was shown to be a useful predictor of parole success. Samuel S. Wilks (1938) showed that nearly all sets of regression weights sum to composites that are very highly correlated with one another, including unit weights, a result referred to as Wilk's theorem (Ree, Carretta, & Earles, 1998). Robyn Dawes (1979) examined decision making in applied settings, showing that simple models with unit weights often outperformed human experts. Bobko, Roth, and Buster (2007) reviewed the literature on unit weights and concluded that decades of empirical studies show that unit weights perform similar to ordinary regression weights on cross validation.  Example: BUPA liver data  The BUPA liver data have been studied by various authors, including Breiman (2001). The data can be found at the classic data sets page, and there is some discussion in the article on the Box‚ÄìCox transformation. A plot of the logs of ALT versus the logs of Œ≥GT appears below. The two regression lines are those estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and by robust MM-estimation. The analysis was performed in R using software made available by Venables and Ripley (2002). :Image:OLSandMM.JPG The two regression lines appear to be very similar (and this is not unusual in a data set of this size). However, the advantage of the robust approach comes to light when the estimates of residual scale are considered. For ordinary least squares, the estimate of scale is 0.420, compared to 0.373 for the robust method. Thus, the relative efficiency of ordinary least squares to MM- estimation in this example is 1.266. This inefficiency leads to loss of power in hypothesis tests and to unnecessarily wide confidence intervals on estimated parameters. = Outlier detection = Another consequence of the inefficiency of the ordinary least squares fit is that several outliers are masked because the estimate of residual scale is inflated, the scaled residuals are pushed closer to zero than when a more appropriate estimate of scale is used. The plots of the scaled residuals from the two models appear below. The variable on the x axis is just the observation number as it appeared in the data set. Rousseeuw and Leroy (1986) contains many such plots. :Image:ResidualPlots.JPG The horizontal reference lines are at 2 and ‚àí2, so that any observed scaled residual beyond these boundaries can be considered to be an outlier. Clearly, the least squares method leads to many interesting observations being masked. Whilst in one or two dimensions outlier detection using classical methods can be performed manually, with large data sets and in high dimensions the problem of masking can make identification of many outliers impossible. Robust methods automatically detect these observations, offering a serious advantage over classical methods when outliers are present.

Biography  Coming from a noble Ukrainian family, Bogdanovich studied in the Moscow University until 1761. His literary career started two years later with editing a literary journal. In 1766, he joined the Russian embassy in Dresden as a secretary. Three years later, he was back in Saint Petersburg, where he edited the only regular official newspaper, the Vedomosti, between 1775 and 1782. In 1788, Bogdanovich was appointed Director of State Archives, a post which he treated as a sinecure, translating Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau at loose hours. It was in 1778 that Bogdanovich brought out his only work of lasting fame, Dushenka. This long poem, resembling a mock epic, was a reworking of La Fontaine's Psyche, a subject originating from Apuleius but ingeniously stylized by Bogdanovich as a Russian folk tale. The definitive edition followed in 1783 and instantly became popular for its mildly scurrilous passages. La Fontaine's conventional heroine was presented by Bogdanovich as \\"a living, modern girl from a gentry family of the middling sort\\".Charles Moser. The Cambridge History of Russian Literature. Cambridge University Press, 1992. . Page 83. Following the publication, Bogdanovich was recognized as the foremost Russian practitioner of light poetry and gained admission into the literary circle of Princess Dashkova, while Catherine II of Russia engaged him to write several comedies for her Hermitage Theatre. An English translation can be found in the anthology The Literature of Eighteenth-Century Russia.The Literature of Eighteenth-Century Russia, Vol. II, edited and translated by Harold B Segel, E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc., 1967.  Assessment  One of Tolstoy's Neoclassical illustrations to Dushenka (1820-33). By 1841, Bogdanovich's chef d'oeuvre went through 15 editions. Today, it is remembered primarily for Fyodor Tolstoy's Neoclassical illustrations and citations in Pushkin's works such as Eugene Onegin. Indeed, Dushenka was a major influence on young Pushkin, who avidly read the poem during his Lyceum years but later discarded Bogdanovich's verse as immature. Nabokov summed up contemporary opinion about Dushenka in the following dictum: \\"The airiness of its tetrametric passages and its glancing mother-of-pearl wit are foregleams of young Pushkin's art; it is a significant stage in the development of Russian poetry; its naive colloquial melodies also influenced Pushkin's direct predecessors, Karamzin, Batyushkov, and Zhukovski.Vladimir Nabokov.

The major part of this chapter recalls Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman at the well. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 54 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 75 (AD 175-225) *Papyrus 66 (c. 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Bezae (c. 400) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; complete) *Papyrus 63 (c. 500; extant verses 9-10)  Jesus leaves Judea (4:1‚Äì3) The Pharisees learn that Jesus is baptizing more people than John the Baptist. notes that \\"... in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples\\", although clearly suggests that Jesus himself was baptizing - \\"that man who was with you (John the Baptist) on the other side of the Jordan\\". Jesus ('the Lord' in the Textus Receptus and the Westcott-Hort translation) learns this, leaves Judea, and sets off to return to Galilee. Swedish-based commentator Ren√© Kieffer notes that \\"his departure seems to be the consequence of the Pharisees' negative reaction to his success in Judea, but that reason remains unsatisfactory, because the Pharisees also had some influence in Galilee.Kieffer, R., John, in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J. (2001), The Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 967 In Eugene H. Peterson's paraphrase, The Message, the proposed text states that \\"Jesus realized that the Pharisees were keeping count of the baptisms that he and John performed (although his disciples, not Jesus, did the actual baptizing).. They had posted the score that Jesus was ahead, turning him and John into rivals in the eyes of the people.\\" : The Message records that in order to reach Galilee it was necessary to pass through Samaria, although an alternative route through Peraea on the eastern side of the Jordan could have been taken.Pulpit Commentary on John 4, accessed 23 February 2016 Josephus spoke of this as the customary way of the Galileans going up during the feasts at Jerusalem.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xx. 6, ¬ß 1 H. W. Watkins, in the 19th-century Anglican bishop Charles Ellicott's commentaries, notes that the Pharisees \\"took the longer road through Peraea, to avoid contact with the country and people of Samaria\\". Watkins suggests that the necessity to travel through Samaria was not a matter of geographical necessity but arose from Jesus' purpose, to proclaim \\"the principles of true religion and worship ... for all nations\\".Watkins, H. W., Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers on John 4, accessed 23 February 2016 Jesus then goes to the Samarian town of Sychar, and rests after his journey at Jacob's Well, while His disciples go into the town to buy food. The gospel notes that it was \\"about the sixth hour\\" i.e. around noon (according to Jewish reckoning), or in the evening (according to Roman Samaritan woman (4:4‚Äì26) Christ and the Samaritan Woman at the Well by Angelica Kauffman, 1796. While Jesus is waiting for his disciples to return, a Samaritan woman comes to the well and Jesus asks her for a drink. The woman is surprised and says that Samaritans and Jews do not associate. Jesus responds that if she really knew who he was, she would have asked and he would have given her \\"living water,\\" an ambiguous metaphor that has both a figurative and a literal meaning.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 66; Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3: 217), 10-11. \\"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\\" The woman asks for this \\"water\\" and Jesus tells her to go and find her husband and bring him back. The woman states she has no husband, and Jesus says that in fact she has had five husbands and is now living with a man who is not her husband. She then perceives that he is a prophet. Jesus then teaches her about worshipping God, how it has been done in the past, at certain locations, and how it will be done properly in the future. \\"Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth.\\" The woman then says that the messiah will come and explain all. Jesus declares that he is the messiah: \\"I who speak to you am He‚Äù (). Several commentators have noted the openness of Jesus' self-revelation to the Samaritan woman, in contrast to his more reserved communication with the Jews: to the Jews \\"the Messiah was a conquering king, who would help them to ride on the necks of their enemies, and pay back their persecutions and oppressions\\" and therefore Jesus' claim to be the Messiah necessarily risked a political interpretation: in \\"when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone\\". But \\"to this Samaritan woman - speaking, I suppose, the conceptions of her race - the Messiah was One who was to \\"tell us all things\\" about the worship of God.Alexander MacLaren, MacLaren's Expositions of Holy Scripture on John 4, accessed 27 February 2016 Evangelization of the Samaritans (4:27‚Äì42) Jesus' disciples return to meet him at the well, and the woman returns to town, tells people that Jesus knew all about her, and wonders if he is the Messiah. The people decide to go and see for themselves. The disciples meanwhile try to give Jesus some food but he refuses, saying that his food \\"... is to do the will of HIM who sent me and to finish his work\\". Jesus comments on two sayings which would have been well-known to his hearers: \\"There are still four months and then comes the harvest\\" () and \\"One sows and another reaps\\" (). Many of the Samaritan people from town come and Jesus talks with them and they persuade him to stay for two days, teaching them. His words convince them that he is \\"the Messiah, the Savior of the world\\". Lutheran theologian Hermann Olshausen described this incident as \\"further remarkable, as a rare instance of the Lord's ministry producing an awakening on a large scale\\".Quoted in Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on John 4, accessed 28 February 2016 The writer of the Acts of the Apostles noted that the commission given by Jesus to the apostles included preaching the gospel in Samaria (Acts 1:8) and Philip the Evangelist is seen preaching the Christ (or Messiah) in that region (). The narrative in Acts continues, saying that \\"when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit\\" (). Jesus returns to Galilee (4:43‚Äì45) Jesus then travels back to Galilee, resuming the journey commenced in verse 3, where the people \\"welcome\\" or \\"receive\\" him () with \\"open arms\\".See The Living Bible's paraphrase for John 4:45 notes that many Galileans had also recently been to Jerusalem for the Passover and had seen the signs which Jesus performed there.See and The royal official's son (4:46‚Äì54) In Galilee, Jesus returns to Cana,See John chapter 2 where a certain nobleman or royal official (, tis basilikos) from Capernaum asks him to heal his sick son. The King James Version describes the man as a \\"nobleman\\"; the Geneva Bible has \\"a certain ruler\\" and refers to Herod's court; the New Century Version has \\"one of the king's important officers\\"; and the Aramaic Bible in Plain English has \\"a servant of a certain King\\". Alfred Plummer, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, rejects the term \\"nobleman\\" as \\"inaccurate - the word has nothing to do with birth\\".Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on John 4, accessed 1 March 2016 Chuza, King Herod's steward (whose wife was Joanna, one of Jesus' disciples mentioned in and ) and Manaen (a teacher and prophet in Antioch, mentioned in Acts 13:1, who had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch) have both been identified as possibly being referred to in this section.Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary on John 4, accessed 1 March 2016 Jesus seems annoyed because people only seem to believe in him if he performs miracles (, sƒìmeia kai terata, \\"signs and wonders\\"). Plummer notes the contrast with \\"the ready belief of the Samaritans\\". Nevertheless, Jesus says the boy will be healed. The official goes back home to find his boy well again. According to John, this is Jesus' second sign or miracle (after the Marriage in Cana).

The through-holes are of various shapes and sizes and are used to hold, support or back up a hot bar of metal for further shaping. Operations performed on a swage block include but are not limited to bending, cutting, punching and forming. The sides are scalloped to present formed shapes for forging operations. Shapes are for example the curve of a wheel, which could be used to finish a wheel rim, using a suitable hammer. Other shapes, such as the half hexagon, can be used with a matching top swage to form a hexagonal cross-section on a bar. The various shapes around the edge of the swage block all have corresponding shapes in the form of top swages to shape iron bar into various sections. The image shows a 15-inch, square swage block with various semi-circular, hexagonal, and square shapes around its perimeter along with a selection of through-holes. There are two general types of swage block: Industrial, as described above, and artistic. Artist Blacksmiths sometimes require a tool that will allow metal to be formed in ways that an anvil or traditional industrial swage block will not allow, a special Artists' block is then often used. As with industrial swage blocks, artistic blocks come in many shapes and sizes; common features are hemispherical and ovoid depressions, asymmetrical curves and non-standard angled planes (i.e. not 45 or 90 degrees). In addition, individual blocks may contain unique features of specific use or relevance to a particular smith or branch of the blacksmithing craft.

Neutrino Neutrinos are elementary particles first detected in the 1950s, long after their theoretical prediction by theorist Wolfgang Pauli. Neutrinos (or anti-neutrinos) are created during certain nuclear reactions, where protons are transformed into neutrons and vice versa. Neutrinos do not interact with matter via either the electromagnetic, the strong nuclear, or gravitational forces, since they are electrically neutral leptons and their rest mass is very small. They interact with the nucleons (neutrons and protons) only via weak nuclear interactions. Since they do not interact with matter via the electromagnetic or gravitational forces, it is extremely difficult to detect them. Since their mass is very small (less than 14 eV) they travel with speeds that are very close to the speed of light in vacuum. NESTOR Telescope Because neutrinos are very weakly interacting, neutrino detectors must be very large in order to detect a significant number of neutrinos. After completion, NESTOR will consist of a large number of glass balls (the \\"eyes\\") containing photomultiplier tubes. The \\"eyes\\" are connected with star-shaped titanium frames. Many frames compose a NESTOR tower. The whole construction is placed at the bottom of the sea to reduce noise from cosmic radiation (depth 4000m). The detectors are connected with the terminal station through a 31-km-long deep-sea, optic fiber cable for data collection. Pylos was selected for the installation of the telescope for several reasons. It combines deep water with close proximity to the shore, a convenient combination for the installation of the NESTOR towers and the communication and power supply cables. It is also located in an anti-diametric point with respect to the DUMAND neutrino telescope in the Pacific ocean and therefore, it is possible to compare observations and study correlations between the observed neutrino. Original surveys of the seafloor were conducted in 1989, 1991, 1992 and scientific conferences of the NESTOR Collaboration were held in the 1990s. In March 2003, the NESTOR prototype was lowered to the depth of 3800 meters some 30 kilometers off the coast of Greece. The prototype's results were published in 2005. The spokesperson for the project is Leonidas Resvanis from University of Athens. In 2014 the project was still applying funding to build the actual telescope. The NESTOR collaboration is now (2018) part of the KM3NeT-collaboration. As such, they are not developing the NESTOR telescope anymore as its own instance, but Km3Net has a planned telescope site off the coast of Pylos (which can thus be seen as a continuation of the NESTOR project to build an underwater telescope off the coast of Pylos). https://fskbhe1.puk.ac.za/people/mboett/SAGAMMA/HEASA2018/presentations/Kouchner.pdf  See also  *Project DUMAND *ANTARES ReferencesFurther reading * * External links * Official Webpage * XIX International Conference on Neutrino Physics & Astrophysics Category:Neutrino observatories Category:Neutrino astronomy Category:Particle experiments ","title":"NESTOR Project"},{"id":"2713378","text":"2K is an American video game publisher based in Novato, California. 2K was founded under Take-Two Interactive in January 2005 through the 2K Games and 2K Sports labels, following Take-Two Interactive's acquisition of Visual Concepts that same month.

The following day Take-Two Interactive established the 2K publishing label, consisting of the sub-labels 2K Games and 2K Sports, with the latter focusing on sports games. Several of Take-Two Interactive's development studios‚ÄîVisual Concepts, Kush Games, Indie Built, Venom Games, PopTop Software, and Frog City Software‚Äîbecame studios of 2K, and Take-Two Licensing was merged into the new label. On January 21, 2006, a fire heavily damaged the administration and marketing portions of 2K's offices. In June 2007 2K announced that they had closed their offices in New York City and would move to a new location on the West Coast, namely Novato, California. On September 10, 2007, Take-Two Interactive announced that they had struck a partnership with Nickelodeon on publishing games based on their licenses. Alongside this announcement, Take-Two Interactive introduced a third 2K label, 2K Play, to focus on casual games. Through this opening, 2K absorbed all assets of Take-Two Interactive's budget-range publisher Global Star Software, including the game Carnival Games, the studio Cat Daddy Games, and games based on Deal or No Deal. On May 4, 2017, 2K's co-founder and until-then president, Christoph Hartmann, announced that he had stepped down from his position. Hartmann had worked for Take-Two Interactive for roughly 20 years, but did not state a reason for his departure. He later joined Amazon Game Studios in August 2018. He was succeeded by previous chief operating officer (COO) David Ismailer later in May 2017. The role of COO was filled by Phil Dixon, formerly of Betfair, in November 2017, and Melissa Bell was hired as senior vice president and head of global marketing in April 2018. On September 25, 2018, 2K announced 2K Foundations, a program that would \\"support underserved communities across the nation by refurbishing basketball courts in neighborhoods that need them the most\\". Microsoft will also partner with 2K to establish Xbox One S gaming-stations at these courts. 2K Foundations planned to refurbish 12 basketball courts in several cities across the United States (including Cincinnati, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Cleveland) within its first year.

Early life and education Joseph-Octave Plessis, Kelly's mentor, in 1806, the year he ordained Kelly Kelly's success had humble beginnings. He was born in Quebec City, Quebec, to a carter, John Kelly, and Marguerite Migneron. If Joseph-Octave Plessis had not encountered him on the street and sent him to primary school, Kelly might have lived an unremarkable life. As it happened, Kelly, after that schooling, and reaching the age of 14, was sent to the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, where his \\"very great application in all things\\" could be demonstrated. Elected prefect of the Congr√©gation de la Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie-Immacul√©e in 1802, Kelly was assisted by Jacques Labrie and future Lower Canada Rebellion leader Louis- Joseph Papineau. Plessis had also furthered his own career, becoming coadjutor bishop of Quebec. In 1803, Kelly had a chance to repay Plessis' investment in him, becoming Plessis' assistant secretary. Two years later, when Plessis was made bishop, Kelly served as diocesan secretary. The next year, 1806, Kelly left his mentor, and Quebec City, to work under Fran√ßois Cherrier, Vicar General at Saint-Denis, a town south of Montreal (and, coincidentally, where Kelly's former assistant Papineau would win a major Rebel victory three decades later). Cherrier was also impressed by Kelly, describing him as \\"his charming lieutenant vicar\\". On 9 November 1806, Plessis ordained his proteg√©e as a full Catholic priest. Priesthood Kelly's life as a priest was by no means carefree. He spent much of his life as a priest in difficult areas. In Plessis' opinion, hardship postings helped develop character and maturity in the cadre of young priests he had recruited. =Madawaska= Madawaska county in New Brunswick, Canada Kelly found himself (and four of his sisters, whom he brought with him) on a mission to Madawaska, New Brunswick, in 1808. Madawaska was both a very large area for one priest, and involved in a territory dispute (see Republic of Madawaska). Kelly arrived in the small community of Saint- Basile, New Brunswick. Saint-Basile had come to Plessis' attention; \\"[its] church is in ruins, that the presbytery is badly maintained, that the tithes are paid negligently, [and] that luxury, entertainment, and licentiousness reign\\". Kelly quickly came to blame alcohol. \\"Even my sexton wants to become an innkeeper, and we already have nine!\\", Kelly complained. In spite of his efforts, Kelly failed to rebuild the church or presbytery. He was also responsible for the Saint John valley, which demanded his attention. The valley, despite its proximity to Fredericton, also lacked proper church structures. An additional problem was that Kelly had come prepared with an Abenaki dictionary, but the local First Nations people were Malecite. Kelly spent the period addressing these issues, learning English, and in constant communication with Plessis. \\"I think that if St Jerome had had to go sixty leagues on snowshoe to obtain absolution and had needed confession as frequently as I, he would have given up the solitary life very quickly,\\" noted Kelly in January, 1810. =Saint-Denis= That October, Kelly returned to Saint-Denis upon Cherrier's death. Saint-Denis was no Madawaska; Kelly found a well-maintained, prosperous church. He busied himself with collecting funds for, and then implementing, its remodeling. He also attempted to revive the church's college, but this project was derailed by a similar undertaking by the Reverend Antoine Girouard in nearby Saint-Hyacinthe. In 1811, Bernard- Claude Panet and Kelly toured Quebec from La Malbaie to Quebec City. The War of 1812 brought two American invasions into Lower Canada over the next two years. Kelly also made a tour of Upper Canada with his mentor in 1816. =William Henry/Saint-Pierre= First Nations basket-makers near Sorel in the 19th century Those six years would be the most comfortable for Kelly. In September 1817, Plessis once again decided a new challenge was in order. Kelly was posted to the large parish of Saint-Pierre, in William Henry (Sorel). Kelly came face-to-face with the notorious fur traders, who were less than receptive to his sermons. Three years later, Kelly refused an even more difficult assignment from Plessis, further into the northwest, wanting less of the fur traders, not more of them. The Saint-Pierre presbytery may have been preferable to the wilderness, but by 1819 it was declared dangerously unfit for habitation. It wasn't until 1832 that a new presbytery was built, using stone from the original. Only a year into his new position, Kelly was given responsibility for √éle du Pads (Dupas) and Drummondville in another of Plessis' shows of confidence in him. Kelly (perhaps ironically, given his surname), especially objected to Drummondville's Irish population, in part out of his French Canadian nationalist tendencies. Nevertheless, he oversaw the building of a church there, Saint-Fr√©d√©ric, completed in 1822. \\"The Protestants are jealous of it, theirs will never look as good as this one.\\" In 1824 Drummondville was given into the spiritual care of a John Holmes, but Kelly maintained authority over √éle du Pads. Kelly maintained his interest in building Catholic educational institutions. Along with Plessis, he participated in a boycott of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning. In contrast to his experience in Saint-Denis, Kelly's Saint-Pierre's educational project bore fruit. An English Catholic school opened in 1831. Plessis died in 1825, and so did not live to see Kelly raised to archpriest. The ceremony was performed in 1835 by Joseph Signay, successor to Panet as archbishop of Quebec. =European travel= Kelly spent some of 1842 and 1843 in Europe. Ignace Bourget, the new ultramontane archbishop, had recently returned from Europe, after successfully recruiting a number of priests for the new Province of Canada, including the introduction of the Jesuit order to Quebec. Bourget sent Kelly and Joseph-Sabin Raymond to Britain to argue for the return of exiled rebels back to Canada East, and to find additional priests for Montreal. Kelly and Raymond, however, failed to match Bourget's accomplishments as an emissary. They had no more luck in Paris, where both the Filles de la Charit√© de Saint-Vincent de Paul and the Fr√®res de Saint-Joseph both refused to support new communities in Montreal. A January trip to the Vatican, then under Pope Gregory XVI, was yet another disappointment. The two Qu√©b√©cois priests lobbied for the creation of another coadjutor position for Bourget, and the creation of a new ecclesiastical province for British North America, entirely unsuccessfully. Kelly blamed the failures of the trip on the Montreal Sulpicians, who were concerned about Bourget's growing influence, and especially on Jean-Baptiste Thavenet, a Montreal Sulpician who was then living in Rome. Thavenet was a notoriously bad book-keeper, and he and Kelly, while both were in Quebec, had a troubled financial relationship. Thavenet, financial disputes aside, was usually quick to campaign against any further extension of the powers of the bishop of Montreal. =Return= Kelly returned home in August, to be named vicar-general by Bourget. Kelly also received a canonship of the Cathedral of Saint-Jacques in Montreal. In September, Signay seconded the appointment. Kelly's return was not universally well-received, however. A number of parishioners preferred his interim replacement, but the issue was resolved by December. Kelly continued to improve educational opportunities for his congregation after his return. By 1846 the parish library contained four hundred volumes. The late 1840s saw a very different community than Kelly had inherited. A monument to temperance was built in 1848, the bells of which Kelly blessed, and, in the same year, a society for the care of the poor and sick, and for the education of girls, was established under Kelly's supervision. The next year marked the completion of another new presbytery, funded privately by Kelly, who turned the old one into another college. William Henry was renamed Sorel in 1845. Kelly's work in the area had exhausted him, and by the end of 1849 he entered the Hospice Saint-Joseph at Longue-Pointe, physically, mentally and financially distressed. After a four- year stay he died in their care, and was buried in Sorel by Bourget. Political positions and controversies A Crown lands map of Quebec in 1784, a year after Kelly's birth. Kelly was forced to face the divisive issue of Quebec's future. William Henry, in spite of the town's remoteness, offered Kelly a chance to be of further use to Plessis. Lord Dalhousie Ramsay, the current Governor General, summered in William Henry. Through Kelly, Plessis (and Plessis' successor, Panet) learned of the governor's response to Jean- Jacques Lartigue's controversial 1820 promotion to auxiliary bishop of Montreal. Kelly was concerned by the governor's reaction; \\"I believe . . . we must not let ourselves be frightened by that man, that it will be necessary to bare our teeth. . . . We have a right to raise our voice and to make ourselves heard together at the foot of the throne. . . . Because we have been quiet spectators in politics it is thought that we feel nothing. It is quite clear that our enemies bear ill-will not only to the constitution of the country but also to its religion.\\" In spite of his strong words against the British colonial governor, Kelly was no supporter either of the nationalist Parti Canadien in charge of the House of Assembly. When that local government moved against the authority of the Catholic Church in Quebec, Kelly wrote to Panet, \\"It is time that a dike was erected against that body, ambitious and intoxicated by its success with the ministers. ...It is trying to invade everything and take to itself not only the legislative and ecclesiastical power, but also the executive and judicial power.\\" Kelly also opposed Wolfred Nelson and the nationalists' attempts to build a monument to Louis Marcoux, a nationalist killed in the 1834 elections. As the Lower Canada Rebellion was beginning, Kelly urged Lartigue to speak out against violence; \\"at this time [your voice] would be much more powerful than all the English bayonets in the country. ...It would be too late to wait for the government to strike several blows from which the factious would certainly profit to stir up the countryside.\\" Kelly's impression of Lartigue's influence may have been based on Kelly's own position as a powerful voice against outright rebellion in William Henry. In spite of this, Lord Dalhousie attacked Kelly for stirring up anti-government sentiment. Kelly involved himself in other disputes in William Henry. In 1839 he was suspected of helping Dr. George Holmes, who had killed Louis-Pascal-Achille Tach√©, to flee to the United States. Kelly, as a Catholic priest might be expected to, had counselled Holmes against committing suicide. Tach√©'s wife, and Holmes' lover, Jos√©phine d‚ÄôEstimauville, was related to Kelly by marriage, which may have encouraged his involvement in the case. Although d'Estimauville visited family in William Henry, and Holmes had briefly been a resident, the murder and the trial took place in Kamouraska, and might not have otherwise called for Kelly's involvement. Kelly's testimony on d'Estimauville's behalf was at least partly responsible for her avoiding a sentence for complicity in the murder. In 1970, Anne H√©bert wrote a book, Kamouraska, about the affair, which was made into a film in 1973 by Claude Jutra. Kelly appears in the film as a character, played by an uncredited actor. Despite, or perhaps because of, Kelly's opposition to both the nationalists and the Protestant colonial government, Kelly was eulogized as \\"respected by all citizens, Catholic and Protestant\\".

Such a transaction is known as an \\"arm's-length transaction\\". It is used specifically in contract law to arrange an agreement that will stand up to legal scrutiny, even though the parties may have shared interests (e.g., employer‚Äìemployee) or are too closely related to be seen as completely independent (e.g., the parties have familial ties). An arm's length relationship is distinguished from a fiduciary relationship, where the parties are not on an equal footing, but rather, power and information asymmetries exist. It is also one of the key elements in international taxation as it allows an adequate allocation of profit taxation rights among countries that conclude double tax conventions, through transfer pricing, among each other. Transfer pricing and the arm's length principle was one of the focal points of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G20. Examples in contract law A simple example of not at arm's length is the sale of real property from parents to children. The parents might wish to sell the property to their children at a price below market value, but such a transaction might later be classified by a court as a gift rather than a bona fide sale, which could have tax and other legal consequences. To avoid such a classification, the parties need to show that the transaction was conducted no differently from how it would have been for an arbitrary third party. This could be done, for example, by hiring a disinterested third party, such as an appraiser or broker, who could offer a professional opinion that the sale price is appropriate and reflects the true value of the property. The principle is often invoked to avoid any undue government influence over other bodies, such as the legal system, the press, or the arts. For example, in the United Kingdom Arts Councils operate \\"at arm's length\\" in allocating the funds they receive from the government. In the workplace, supervisors and managers deal with employee discipline and termination of employment at arm's length through the human resources department, if the company has one. In such cases, terminations and discipline must be rendered by staff who have the training and certification to do so legally. This is intended to protect the employer from legal recourse that employees may otherwise have in the event that it can be demonstrated that such discipline or terminations were not handled in accordance with the latest labor laws. For employees in unionised environments, shop stewards can represent the employee, whereas the HR department represents the company, so that both sides are on a more equal footing and can resolve matters outside of court, using informal negotiations or a grievance, saving both sides time and money. The arm's length dealings in this case mean that both an employee and a supervisor each have a qualified advocate. International tax law The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has adopted the principle in Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, to ensure that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises are established on a market value basis. In this context, the principle means that prices should be the same as they would have been, had the parties to the transaction not been related to each other. This is often seen as being aimed at preventing profits being systematically deviated to lowest tax countries, although most countries are also concerned about prices that fail to meet the arm's length test due to inattention rather than by design and that shifts profits to any other country (whether it has low or high tax rates). The OECD Model Tax Convention provides the legal framework for governments to have their fair share of taxes, and for enterprises to avoid double taxation on their profits. The arm's length standard is instrumental to determine how much of the profits should be attributed to one entity and, consequently, the extent of a country's tax claim on such entity. The OECD has developed thorough guidelines on how the arm's length principle should be applied in this context. Under this approach, a price is considered appropriate if it is within a range of prices that would be charged by independent parties dealing at arm's length. This is generally defined as a price that an independent buyer would pay an independent seller for an identical item under identical terms and conditions, where neither is under any compulsion to act. Transfer pricing became a highly controversial topic in the last years, which contributed to the development of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project by the OECD and with the endorsement of the G20. The World Customs Organization (WCO) and World Trade Organization (WTO) have also adopted, in effect, the arm's length principle in Customs valuations. The Agreement on Implementation of Article VII (known as the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation or the ‚ÄúValuation Agreement‚Äù) ensures that determinations of the customs value for the application of duty rates to imported goods are conducted in a neutral and uniform manner, precluding the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values.United States Trade Representative - Customs Valuation, http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/wto-multilateral-affairs/wto- issues/customs-issues/customs-valuation See also *English contract law *Say on pay *Transfer pricing *Customs valuation ReferencesExternal links *Transfer pricing: Keeping it at arm‚Äôs length *OECD: Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (2010) *Article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) *WCO: Brief Guide to the Customs Valuation Agreement *WTO: Technical information on Customs Valuation *WCO: Guide to Customs Valuation and Transfer Pricing Category:Contract law Category:International taxation ","title":"Arm's length principle"},{"id":"2713433","text":"Dominie (Wiktionary definition) is a Scots language and Scottish English term for a Scottish schoolmaster usually of the Church of Scotland and also a term used in the US for a minister or pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church.

At the time of the genocide, Seromba was the priest in charge of a Catholic parish at Nyange in the Kibuye province of western Rwanda. He was convicted of committing genocide due to his providing of key and necessary approval for the bulldozing of his church, where 1,500-2,000 Tutsis were taking refuge, with the intent to not only kill large numbers of people, but specifically to destroy the Tutsis as an ethnic group.

Under pressure from Carla Del Ponte, the then Chief UN War Crimes Prosecutor, Seromba surrendered himself to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) on February 6, 2002. On February 8, 2002, he pleaded not guilty to the charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. His trial began on September 20, 2004, before the Third Trial Chamber of the ICTR. On 13 December 2006, he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Seromba appealed the verdict.

When the demand for observation balloons for the Dardanelles operations came through in March of that year the Royal Navy was able to send out a completely equipped Kite Balloon Section in a specially fitted steamer. The vessel, the Manica, a converted tramp, which arrived just a month after the demand was made, immediately proved the value of the unit. Within three days a Turkish camp was shelled under the direction of the kite balloon, and the occupants thrown into confusion; while in the following week the \\"Spotter\\" directed fire on the Gaba Tepe position, which resulted in the destruction if the barracks. The triumph, however, came before April was out, for from their aerial perch the observers spotted, lying quietly in the water on the other side by the Peninsular out of sight of our warships, a large Turkish transport. The transport apparently considered herself quite safe-but in warfare the unexpected often happens. H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth was operating near the balloon ship, and the bearings of the Turkish vessel were given her. The first shot fell short. By this time the other ships near by were beginning to take an interest in what was happening to Elizabeth's invisible target, which was lying nine miles the other side of the Peninsula. A second shot went nearer the mark. Again the direction was corrected, and a third heavy projectile screamed overland. By the telephone wire of the kite balloon came the words, \\"Got her. She's sinking by the head.\\" The signalman semaphored this literally to the Queen Elizabeth and a roar of laughter went up as the various ships read the laconic message. Repeated attacks were made by the Turks on the solitary kite balloon and her parent ship, but were fought back. The effect on the Turkish shipping was evident, for whenever the Manica's offspring ascended, the enemy craft, remembering the fate of the transport, hustled off out of range of our big guns. The official record of the Manica for the next fortnight was as follows: *28 April.-Two field batteries silenced; several guns destroyed *30 April.-Chanak shelled; burned for two hours *2 May.-Battery of 8in guns shelled; three direct hits *8 May.-Four batteries silenced *12 May.-House, reported to be Turkish Headquarters, destroyed. This and other work was a wonderful tribute to the efficacy of the new observation contrivance, and it should be remembered that barely two months before there was not a single kite balloon in England, and that the whole of the section was in an embryonic state. The experience gained in the Manica was the foundation of what is now an active branch of the Royal Navy.

His subsequent novels, which include Among Thieves, Family Honor, and Trial By Water, engage troubling issues of race, class, and social justice. Cuomo's deeply fallible heroes tend to be people that genteel society would prefer to forget: a small-time criminal caught up in a brutal prison riot, a racial minority ensnared in a domestic terrorist plot.

He finds that the hereditary ruler, the Suzerain, is away in the army, leaving the Provost in charge. Back in London, the Ministry of Agriculture realise that Venus, a valuable pedigree Guernsey cow, remains on the island. They petition the War Office to mount a rescue operation, and Major Valentine Morland is assigned the mission, with the assistance of the Suzerain's sister Nicola Fallaize who joined the A.T.S. at the outbreak of war. They travel to Armorel by submarine, contact the Provost and other friends on the island, and discover that Weiss, a cattle breeder in civilian life, is about to have the cow shipped to Germany.

Nergal-ushezib reigned as King for little more than a year. Sennacherib soon made war on Babylon to recover the city and avenge his son's death.

Ashur-nadin-shumi was probably Sennacherib's firstborn son and his first crown prince and thus the designated successor to the Assyrian throne.  Biography  Confirmation by the later Babylonian king Shamash-shum-ukin, Ashur-nadin-shumi's nephew, of a grant originally made by Ashur-nadin-shumi. 670‚Äì650 BC. The tablet is currently housed in the British Museum. Babylonia had been conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire by King Tiglath-Pileser III (745‚Äì727 BC) less than thirty years before Ashur-nadin-shumi became its king.' During these thirty years, Babylonia had repeatedly attempted to once more become an independent kingdom. Babylonian revolts became an especially frequent nuisance during the reign of Sennacherib, who had to defeat numerous southern revolts throughout his reign. Even Sennacherib's own appointed vassal king of the city, Bel-ibni, had revolted in an attempt to make the south independent.' After defeating Bel- ibni's revolt in 700 BC, Sennacherib named his own son, Ashur-nadin-shumi, as the new King of Babylon. Ashur-nadin-shumi was also titled as mƒÅru rƒì≈°t√ª, a title that could be interpreted either as the \\"pre-eminent son\\" or the \\"firstborn son\\". His appointment as King of Babylon and the new title suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was being groomed to also follow Sennacherib as the King of Assyria upon his death. Ashur-nadin-shumi being titled as the mƒÅru rƒì≈°t√ª likely means that he was Sennacherib's crown prince; if it means \\"pre- eminent\\" such a title would be befitting only for the crown prince and if it means \\"firstborn\\", it also suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was the heir as the Assyrians in most cases followed the principle of primogeniture (the oldest son inherits).' More evidence in favor of Ashur-nadin-shumi being the crown prince is Sennacherib's construction of a palace for him at the city of Assur,' something Sennacherib would also do for the later crown prince Esarhaddon.'''''' As an Assyrian King of Babylon, Ashur-nadin-shumi's position was politically important and highly delicate and would have granted valuable experience to him as the intended heir to the entire Neo-Assyrian Empire. However, Ashur-nadin-shumi's tenure as Babylonian king would not last long and he was unable to handle the volatile political situation in the south.' In 694 BC, Sennacherib campaigned against Elam (modern day southern Iran) to chase after Chaldean rebels which had fled there. In response to this incursion into their territory, the Elamites invaded the southern parts of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and in 694 BC, probably encouraged by the Babylonians themselves, successfully captured Ashur-nadin-shumi at the city of Sippar. The prince was taken back to Elam and probably executed.'

Life Elisabeta Alexandrovna Stroganova. Portrait by Robert Lef√®vre (c. 1800-1805), Saint-Petersburg, Hermitage The son of Nikita Akinfiyevich Demidov (1724-1786) and his third wife Alexandra Safonova, Nikolai Demidov inherited his father's industrial empire aged only 15 and began to spend so recklessly that the government had to send in the receivers. In September 1795 at Saint Petersburg he married Baroness Elisabeta Alexandrovna Stroganova (5 February 1779 - Paris, 27 March 1818). They had four children - Aleksandra Nikolaievna Demidova (19 October 1796 - 24 August 1800), Pavel Nikolaievich Demidov (1798-1840), Nikolai Nikolaievich Demidov (17 February 1799 - 24 August 1800) and Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato (1812-1869). Nikolai entered the diplomatic service and the young couple moved to Paris, becoming ardent supporters of Napoleon I of France and setting up home in the h√¥tel de Brancas-Lauragais, at the corner of rue Taitbout and boulevard des Italiens. However, rising Franco-Russian tensions forced his recall and they moved back to Russia via Italy, arriving in Russia in 1812. He fought with distinction in the Russo-Turkish War (1806-1812) and at the start of the French invasion of Russia he financed the creation of an infantry regiment (including his son Pavel as one of its officers, which he then commanded against Napoleon's forces, fighting at Oravais and Borodino. In 1813 he gave his important collections to the mineralogical museum of Moscow (founded by his uncle Pavel Grigoryevich) to replace those lost in the burning of the city, giving art to Moscow University in the same vein. He also financed the construction of 4 bridges in Saint Petersburg. With age, he also became a wiser industrialist, modernising his factories' infrastructure and doubling his fortune. He gave his home over to many industries and public utility services, perfecting the exploitation of mines and raising his income to 5 million. He also acclimatised Bordeaux and Champagne vines and Lucca olive trees to the Crimea. Nikolai Demidov served as chamberlain to the Tsar, a Hereditary Commander of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, and member of the privy council. In 1819 he was made Russian ambassador to the court of Tuscany. After divorcing his wife, who moved back to France, he lived his last years in France and Italy among scholars, financing the creation of schools, hospitals and other charitable institutions in Tuscany. He bought of marshland north of Florence from the Catholic Church and there built the Villa San Donato from 1827 to 1831 (now destroyed), where he set up richly-decorated private rooms, a suite of 14 rooms housing his enormous art collection, a theatre and a foreign languages academy. That collection, reputed among the most lavish private collections in Europe, was divided between his residences in San Donato, Saint-Petersburg, Paris and Moscow, included works by Flemish and Italian masters, decorative art objects and a famous collection of weapons now in the Wallace Collection in London. His collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures is now at the Hermitage Museum. By decree of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, on 23 February 1827 Demidov was made \\"count of San Donato\\" for the services he had rendered to Tuscany by setting up a silk factory.

They work with local partners to distribute Bibles and Christian literature, give discipleship training and provide practical support, such as emergency relief aid. Open Doors' stated aims are to raise awareness of global persecution, mobilising prayer, support and action among Christians from around the world. It is based in Ermelo, The Netherlands. Open Doors is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International. Open Doors has 20 affiliate offices around the world. History Open Doors was founded in 1955 by Andrew van der Bijl, a Dutchman more widely known as Brother Andrew, when he decided to smuggle Bibles to discriminated Christians in Communist Poland. He continued this work in smuggling Bibles to many of the Soviet-controlled countries and in 1957 was given a blue Volkswagen Beetle which he used to make deliveries within the Communist bloc. With this new car he was able to carry more literature. Thereafter, the work of Open Doors continued to expand as it extended its network throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. On 18 June 1981, Open Doors delivered one million contraband Chinese Bibles in one night to a beach near the city of Shantou in southern China on a mission they named Project Pearl. Project Pearl was carried out by an international crew of 20, led by Brother David. A semi-submersible, 137-foot barge, named Gabriel, was loaded with 232 waterproof, poly-wrapped, one-ton packages containing a million Chinese Bibles. A 97-foot tugboat named Michael was used to tow Gabriel to the beach, weaving through a maze of anchored Chinese navy ships. The crew arrived at the beach at 9 pm. 10,000 Chinese Christians had gathered to bring the Bibles to shore and then deliver them all over China. Time magazine described Project Pearl as \\"A remarkable mission‚Ä¶ the largest operation of its kind in the history of China.\\" In 1988, Open Doors used Glasnost as an opportunity to openly provide one million Russian Bibles to the Russian Orthodox Church, at a cost of $2.5 million. (Registration required) Open Doors partnered with the United Bible Societies to complete the task in just over one year. (Registration required) In 2005, 428,856 people from over 70 different countries signed Open Doors' global Right to Believe petition, saying Yes to religious liberty and No to the UN's Defamation of Religions Resolution.The petition was presented to the UN in New York in December 2010. In 2015, Open Doors (including its affiliates) delivered 3 million Bibles and literature, and delivered relief and aid to 239,164 people.

In 1913 he became a member and then stage manager of a troupe of Gaelic players, called Na hAisteoir√≠ , relating historical traditions of Irishness, cultural revivalism, and nationalism.

Irish National Aid & Volunteer Dependent‚Äôs Fund In the days after the executions, the Irish Volunteers Dependent‚Äôs Fund (\\"IVDF\\") was founded by Sorcha McMahon, √Åine Ceannt and Kathleen Clarke, to provide for the dependents of those killed or imprisoned, as well as undertaking protests outside Mountjoy prison and Kilmainham gaol. Shortly after, the more moderate Irish National Aid Association (\\"INAA\\"), was founded by the Redmondites. O‚ÄôHegarty was a central member of the IVDF and, when in September 1916 the two organisations amalgamated, O'Hegarty's influence helped to ensure that the new body, the INA&VDF;, was dominated by republicans.http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp- content/uploads/2011/11/OHegarty.pdf Whilst the INA&VDF;‚Äôs primary task remained the support of prisoners and their dependents, as a national organisation, it quickly also became a vehicle for the regeneration of advanced nationalism.Political Imprisonment and the Irish, 1912-1921 By William Murphy  Reorganisation of the Irish Volunteers after The Easter Rising and the emergence of the IRA (1916 to 1917)  On his release, O‚ÄôHegarty was prominent in the re-organisation of the Irish Volunteers after the 1916 Easter Rising, subsequently becoming a member of the executive of the IRB's supreme council along with Michael Collins and Se√°n √ì Murthuile. Se√°n √ì Muirthile and Diarmuid O‚ÄòHegarty began touring the country during the summer of 1916, establishing contact between the few leaders who had not been arrested, arranging for them to recommence meetings of the Volunteers and ensuring that the Volunteers being released from jail in 1916 and 1917 were able to return to organized units.http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context;=history_theses On Cathal Brugha‚Äôs discharge from hospital in August 1916, Sean √ì Muirthile and O'Hegarty visited Brugha at his home in Rathgar and a provisional committee for the reorganization was established. In August 1916, a meeting was held in Minerva Hotel Parnell Square for the reorganization of the IRB, at which O‚ÄôHegarty attended.Michael Collins, by Patrick Breen At Brugha's behest, Sean √ì Muirthile and O'Hegarty organized a first Convention of the Volunteers, which was held at Fleming's Hotel in Gardiner Street in October 1916.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0150.pdf Although still severely injured, Brugha presided at the meeting and an executive was established to continue the reorganization, with Brugha as the head of the provisional committee.http://centenaries.ucd.ie/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Brugha-Cathal.pdf The committee was dominated, as the early Executive of the Volunteers had been, by members of the IRB and included O‚ÄôHegarty. Progress was slow for the next few months, but volunteer reorganization gained speed after most of the Rising prisoners were released from Frongoch internment camp in Wales on 23 December 1916. Early in August 1917, a meeting was held in the offices of Craobh Ch√©itinn of Conradh na Gaeilge in 46 Parnell Square. It was decided at this meeting that an Army Convention would be held to establish a National Executive of √ìglaigh na h√âireann. The date of the Convention was chosen to coincide with, and to use the cover of, the larger gathering of republicans in Dublin on 25 and 26 October 1917 - the Sinn F√©in Ard Fheis, when large numbers of republicans being in the city would not draw the attentions of the police, who'd presume they were still be around following the Ard Fheis. Nearly 250 people attended the convention, with internment preventing many more from attending. Those in attendance included √âamon de Valera, Cathal Brugha, Thomas Ashe, Diarmuid O'Hegarty, Diarmuid Lynch, Michael Collins, Michael Staines and Richard Mulcahy. The Sinn F√©in and the Irish Volunteers conventions formalized their organizations and elected leadership, with each of Sinn F√©in and the Irish Volunteers appointing Eamon de Valera as president. A national executive was also elected, composed of 26 provincial representatives (including Dublin). In addition, a number of directors were elected to head the various IRA departments. Those elected were: Michael Collins (Director for Organisation); Diarmuid Lynch (Director for Communications); Michael Staines (Director for Supply); Rory O'Connor (Director of Engineering). Se√°n McGarry was voted General Secretary, while Cathal Brugha was made Chairman of the Resident Executive, which in effect made him Chief of Staff. There were six co-options to make-up the full number when the directors were named from within their ranks, including Diarmuid O'Hegarty. Civil Service appointments (1918-1921) Having been dismissed from the civil service for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown in 1918, his administrative talents found ample outlet in the secretariat of the revolutionary D√°il.The Irish Revolution, 1916-1923 By Marie Coleman Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty chose what must have been the tempting option of a permanent career in the emerging Irish civil service The civil service and the revolution in Ireland, 1912‚Äì38 by Martin McGuire, page 161 and contributed in the service of the new state to such an extent that he has been called ‚Äòthe civil servant of the revolution‚Äô (Longford, 102) and ‚Äòthe Grey Eminence of the Free State Government‚Äô (de Vere White, 59). =The First D√°il (1918-1921)= The December1918 General Election resulted in the annihilation of the Irish Parliamentary Party, which won only six seats as opposed to Sinn F√©in‚Äôs 73.

O‚ÄôHegarty used his administrative experience to influence the nomination of the Sinn F√©in candidates but did not seek his own election to the Dail. The selection process was resented by those who had aspirations to enter the D√°il but who failed to be nominated and P√°id√≠n O‚ÄôKeeffe, who was the full-time secretary of Sinn F√©in from 1917 and had a fund of knowledge about the leaders, maintained that the vote against the Treaty was partly an anti-Collins vote, arising from the antagonism Collins, Harry Boland and Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty aroused by their choice of candidates for the December 1918 election.Michael Collins, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin, 1980 √ì Broin, Le√≥n =Republican loan 1919 and The D√°il Bonds film, 1919 = The D√°il Bonds film, 1919: Fionan Lynch TD subscribing for the Dail Bond from Michael Collins and Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegary (seated on the right of the photograph) Within days of being appointed Minister for Finance in 1919 Collins set about raising the funds necessary if Dail Eireann was to fulfil its stated ambition of providing an alternative government to the British one that was operating from Dublin Castle.

Nobody could resist buying a bond and we having such a handsome minister of finance.‚Äô https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CfrkvE7_hshttp://www.generalmichaelcollins.com/life- times/finance/national-loan-191920/ =Secretary to the First D√°il (1918-1921)= O'Hegarty was the organizational genius as secretary to the First D√°il (1919‚Äì21) and he was determined that the D√°il would demonstrate its worth by ‚Äòfunctioning as any progressive government would be expected to function‚Äô.The resurrection of Ireland (1999) Michael Laffan, p308 As clerk of the first D√°il and secretary to the D√°il cabinet (1919‚Äì21), he was largely responsible for its success, organising meetings of the clandestine parliament and coordinating the work of various departments from his offices on the corner of O'Connell St. and Abbey St. and later in Middle Abbey St. He recorded the minutes and handled all correspondence of the D√°il cabinet. As the conduit through which the D√°il's ministers communicated, his role was central to the effective operation of government on the run. The influence this gave him within the revolutionary movement was bolstered by his senior role within the IRB and the positions of military significance which he occupied. He was arrested by the British, tried, convicted of illegal assembly and jailed for three months in Mountjoy (November 1919‚ÄìFebruary 1920). The offence of trespassory assembly effectively limited the size of a crowd to minimal number under the public order acts. Whilst in Mountjoy jail he became a dominant figure amongst the IRA prisoners, ordering Noel Lemass to end his self-imposed hunger strike. The War of Independence (1921 to 1922)Military appointments (1916-1921)= O‚ÄôHegarty was a member of the Irish Volunteer executive (June 1916‚ÄìNovember 1921), IRA director of communications (July 1918‚ÄìMarch 1920), and director of Organisation (March 1920‚ÄìApril 1921). Following the execution of Ned Daly in the aftermath of the Easter Rising O'Hegarty was made Commandant of the 1st Battalion of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0819.pdf =Director of Organisation (March 1920 to April 1921)= In March 1920, following his release, O‚ÄôHegarty took over from Collins to be the new Directorial Head of Organization as well as being promoted vice-commandant of the Dublin brigade. Fionan Lynch was appointed to the GHQ Staff of the IRA as Assistant Director of Organisation to O‚ÄôHegarty. At the same time, Collins gave the position of Adjutant General to Gearoid O'Sullivan. This allowed Collins to move to Intelligence to conduct a 'dirty war' against soft targets March 1920 ‚Äì April 1921. O'Hegarty was a close friend of Harry Boland, as well as Collins, and they called him \\"the parson\\". Collins could be provocative towards his colleagues and, as O'Hegarty took as Director of Organization, he described O‚ÄôHegarty as follows: > \\"a long cow-lick fell over his right eye; he had untidy collar angled tie > and a disheveled appearance...worked hard...muttered rapid speech; mind > worked quickly, shrewdly and surely...in clear clever imagery, often > biting...quick intellect, often disguised by a surface casualness.\\"E > O'malley, \\"On Another Man's Wounds\\" p.128. But this attitude came to exemplify the true heroic freedom fighter \\"Lack of general regard for health and personal comfort had become close to affectation with us; it was a sign of manliness.\\"[5] On 21 November 1920 O‚ÄôHegarty, in common with a number of other members of the various Dublin units, was picked to assist the regular Squad members with the elimination of British agents on Bloody Sunday.https://stairnaheireann.net/2015/07/30/1919-the-first- assassination-authorised-by-michael-collins-detective-sergeant-the-dog-smith- was-shot-by-the-squad/?iframe=true&preview;=true Tom Barry, who was in Dublin from 19 to 25 May 1921, commented on O‚ÄôHegarty:Published in Issue 3 (May/June 2010), Letters, Letters, Revolutionary Period 1912-23, Volume 18http://www.historyireland.com/revolutionary-period-1912-23/who-was-ira-ghq- director-of-organisation-in-1921/Guerilla Days in Ireland ‚ÄòDiarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty was Director of Organisation and also, at the time of my visit, Secretary of the Cabinet of the Irish Republic. He was a brilliant organiser with a first- class brain, and although he spoke little he was obviously well thought of by the other members of General Headquarters. Diarmuid was assisted by Eamonn (Bob) Price, who extensively toured the country, organising and inspecting Units of the Army.‚Äô http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0403.pdf#page=1http://www.difp.ie/docs/1921/Publicity/118.htm O'Hegarty built on the extensive training and development achieved under Collins, although at the time of the treaty negotiations, it was on its last legs, effectively beaten by superior British forces. The Second Dail and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) O‚ÄôHegarty resigned his military duties in April 1921, being replaced as Director of Organisation by E√≥in O‚ÄôDuffy, to concentrate on his work in the D√°il secretariat. In October 1921 he was a member of the delegation[24] appointed by the D√°il that went to London to negotiate[25] the Anglo-Irish Treaty[26] with the UK, serving as joint secretary.[27][28] The delegation consisted of Arthur Griffith (Minister for Foreign Affairs and chairman of the delegation); Michael Collins (Minister for Finance and deputy chairman of the delegation); Robert Barton (Minister for Economic Affairs); George Gavan Duffy and √âamonn Duggan, with Erskine Childers, Fion√°n Lynch, Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty and John Chartres providing secretarial assistance. Frank Pakenham in \\"Peace by Ordeal\\" describes Diarmuid O'Hegarty as, the \\"civil servant of the revolution,\\" the man perpetually behind the scenes, could conceal from few who met him the gifts that were to make possible the Irish constitutional achievements at the Imperial Conference of 1926 '. The Civil War (1922 to 1923)The Third D√°il= On 7 January 1922 the D√°il voted to accept of the Treaty, with the Deputies having being called to vote by Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty one by one in order of their constituencies . Michael Collins: A Life By James Mackay The D√°il decision to accept the Treaty split the movement. Shortly before de Valera resigned as President of the D√°il in January 1922, to be replaced by Arthur Griffith, GHQ had reassured him that the IRA would support the Government; but in reality it was as divided as Sinn F√©in. Fortunately those IRA staff officers who declared against the Treaty did not head the operations and training branches of the IRA and this lack of expertise became apparent as the civil war progressed.The Irish Civil War 1922‚Äì23 By Peter Cottrell O‚ÄôHegarty was a vital and vocal supporter of the Anglo-Irish Treaty within the IRB and was appointed secretary to the cabinet of the provisional government in 1922, participating in the unsuccessful army unification talks to prevent hostilities by unifying army commands in May 1922. Popular support for the Treaty was strong and widespread, though more marked in the more prosperous east than west. The landslide for the pro-Treaty parties in the General Election of June 1922, reflecting a country tired of war and searching for peace, enabled O'Hegarty's appointment to the new D√°il Secretariat of the Provisional Government in 1922‚Äì the beginnings of an Irish only civil service. When the Free State took possession of the headquarters of the British Army in Ireland O‚ÄôHegarty was one of the five C√©itinneach (Richard Mulcahy, John Murthuile, Gerard O'Sullivan and Michael Collins) were present in behalf of Ireland, and four of the five had previously been members of the Keating Branch of the IRB.Portrait of a Revolutionary: General Richard Mulcahy and the Founding of the Irish Free State By Maryann Gialanella Valiulis, page 5 During the Four Courts crisis, on 22 June 1922 Diarmuid O Hegarty wrote to the Lloyd George explaining the strategy of the government for dealing with the anti-Treatyites, saying \\"The Government was, however, satisfied, that those forces contained within themselves elements of disruption which given time would accomplish their own disintegration and relieve the Government of the necessity of employing methods of suppression which would have perhaps evoked a certain amount of misplaced sympathy for them\\", arguing that force need not be used against them.Twentieth-Century Ireland (New Gill History of Ireland 6): Revolution and State Building By Dermot Keogh =Governor of Mountjoy Jail (July to August 1922)= Complaints about overcrowding in prisons, and the behaviour of prison guards, became a regular feature of republican propaganda in the course of, and after, the civil war. A major riot by republican prisoners in Mountjoy prison in July 1922, during the Civil War, caused the jail to be put under the control of the military, with Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty briefly seconded from his civil service post to serve as military Governor of Mountjoy prison (July‚ÄìAugust 1922), a post for which he was spectacularly ill-suited. A stalwart defender of the Free State, O'Hegarty prompted anger and resentment amongst the unruly republican inmates.[6] In Mountjoy, conditions for internees were appalling, but resistance was fierce. Internees frequently knocked holes in the walls so that they could pass right along a tier, from cell to cell, without going out on the landing. Barricades were often erected to prevent warders entering and searching ‚Äì a necessary precaution since guns were, on occasion, smuggled in and used in escape attempts. D wing, where many of the internees were, faced the North Circular Road where crowds would gather nightly to wave flags, sing songs of encouragement and shout messages. The internees responded by quarrying out the window frames so that they could lean right out of the windows and shout back. O'Hegarty demanded that these goings- on should cease but the internees refused. He announced that prisoners would be treated as ‚Äòmilitary captives ‚Ä¶ and that any resistance to their guards or any attempt to assist their own forces, revolt, mutiny, conspiracy, insubordination, attempt to escape or cell wrecking will render them liable to be shot down‚Ä¶‚Äô http://www.kildarearchsoc.ie/wp- content/uploads/2015/11/Internees.pdf O'Hegarty threatened that the troops would open fire on anyone leaning out of the windows. This news was relayed to the crowds which then swelled in numbers. When the internees refused, the soldiers opened fire on the windows at 3 p.m. on 14 July 1922, and George Plunkett and a volunteer called Kane were wounded. Then a volley was poured into the cells and more prisoners were hit by ricochets. It has been reported that the troops had instructions to not deliberately shoot anyone but, nonetheless, amazingly, no one died. Peadar O'Donnell, who was a prisoner there, blandly remarks: \\"One often marvels at the ways of bullets and how they can avoid doing serious injury.\\"http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern4.htm and remembered him as the focus of much ‚Äòrepublican bitterness‚Äô.Peadar O'Donnell, The Gates Flew Open (Dublin 1932) p20) Referring to such appointments, Gear√≥id O‚ÄôSullivan, adjutant-general of the National Army, later commented: ‚ÄòYou had to ‚Ä¶ get men whom you could trust, not because they had any particular ability. = Director of Organization (July 1922 ‚Äì December 1922)= O‚ÄôHegarty was a General Staff Officer during the Civil War, holding the rank of Commandant General (lieutenant-general) and a member of the Army Council from September 1922, during the civil war. He served for a second term as Director of Organization between July 1922 ‚Äì December 1922. =Director of Intelligence (November 1922- April 1923)= In September 1922, following the death of Michael Collins, he was appointed Director of Intelligence of the National Army until May 1923, replacing Liam Tobin. O‚ÄôHegarty realized the importance of expanding the intelligence network outside Dublin and worked to that aim.http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/5176/1/Darragh_Biddlecombe_20140708161420.pdf Professor James Hogan succeeded Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty as the Intelligence Department‚Äôs Director in April 1923, with O‚ÄôHegarty returning to his Civil Service role in May 1923.O‚ÄôSullivan Adjutant General, Joseph McGrath Director of Intelligence and Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty Director of Organisation.

Colonel Costello of Army Intelligence who was with Colonel MacNeill, the officer in charge of the raid, outside the hotel met the Adjutant General Gearoid O‚ÄôSullivan and Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty the secretary of the Executive Council at Portobello Barracks. A discussion ensued on whether the Minister for Defence should be contacted, but it was felt it would take too long to get an answer. Eventually it was agreed that entry and arrest should be effected and eleven mutinous officers were captured, although many escaped.Twentieth-Century Ireland (New Gill History of Ireland 6): Revolution and State Building By Dermot Keogh In the event, due to time constraints, none of the Generals in charge of the Army, the Minister for Defence or any member of the Executive Council were contacted until after the raid. Later life In March 1923, he was appointed Secretary to the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, leaving the army on 1 May 1923 to resume a civil service career full-time. His career is the prime example of the influence of revolutionary veterans within the higher civil service in the early years of the state. Secretary of the Free State Executive Council (1922 to 1932) He was Secretary to the Free State Executive Council from 1922 to 1932 and principal private secretary to its president, W. T. Cosgrave. Again he recorded the cabinet minutes and was the administrative pivot upon which government turned. He served as secretary to numerous governmental delegations and was widely praised for his work in this role at the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930. In 1927 he went to New York and Washington DC to represent the government at congressional hearings on the fate of republican funds in the USA which had not been paid into Irish accounts. O'Hegarty's long connections with the revolutionary period, and the old guard, sealed his career in 1932 when a new constitution devised by De Valera had him removed from office. He was one of the very few senior civil servants who was effectively removed from his position after the change of government in 1932. Commissioner of Public Works (1932 to 1957) From 1932 he was a Commissioner of Public Works responsible for government buildings, mostly in and around Dublin and in 1949 was appointed Chairman of the Commission. He held the position of Chairman of the Commission of the Board of Works until his retirement in 1957. Between 1939‚Äì40 during The Emergency he served on the economy committee to advise on wartime spending. He was on the Tribunal inquiry into the bankruptcy of Great Southern Railways, and the poor state of public transportation systems in Ireland from 1941. He was a member of the Transport Commission which published its report in 1943. Family On 27 April 1922, he married Claire Archer, daughter of Edward Archer, a post office telegraph inspector, from Dublin and Susan Matthews. Michael Collins was best man at the wedding. They lived at 9 Brendan Road, Donnybrook. Claire‚Äôs brother, Liam Archer, was a prominent republican volunteer who served in F Company, 1st Battalion, Dublin Brigade, Irish Volunteers, during the Easter Rising http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0819.pdf but was against the Anglo-Irish Treaty.http://www.ainm.ie/Bio.aspx?ID=747 Diarmuid O‚ÄôHegarty died on 14 March 1958 in Dublin, leaving an estate worth ¬£5, 441, and is buried in Deans Grange.

As a reformer, he spent most of his reign attempting to heal rifts within the church, but following his death, a faction formed the independent Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church in 1889, under the leadership of Metropolitan Palakunnathu Thomas Athanasius. The faction that opposed the reformation of the Malankara church conducted the Synod of Mulanthurathy against the reformations in 1876 in the presence of Malankara Metropolitan Pulikootil Joseph Dionysious 2 and Syrian Orthodox Patriarch.He was the 108th Successor to the Holy Apostolic Throne of St.Thomas Mathews started his career in the church in childhood, and was influenced by the Church Mission Society and his uncle Abraham Malpan, a priest who instituted reforms in Maramon parish in 1840. When Abraham's reforms led to conflict with the reigning Malankara Metropolitan Dionysius IV, Deacon Mathews traveled to the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch, who consecrated him as Bishop Mathews Athanasius in 1841. After years of dispute over the church's leadership between Mathews and Dionysius, the issue was settled by the Travancore government in 1852, with Mathews being recognized as Metropolitan since he got the Royal decree from the Maharaja of Travancore. He worked to repair the rift in the church, but continuing unrest ultimately led to a permanent split. After the Synod of Mulanthurathy and the death of Athanasious the rift in Malankara Church became more visible. Following the Royal Court Verdict against Metropolitan Thomas Athanasius and the reform party, the independent Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church was formed in 1889 as the Independent Malankara Syrian Church. Early lifePakalomattom Palakunnathu family= In the 17th century, a member of the Panamkuzhy family came and settled in Kozhencherry on the banks of river Pampa. Later they moved to Maramon, and lived at Chackkalyil, on the other side of the river. The second son in that family, Mathen moved to a nearby house at Palakunnathu. He had six sons and a daughter. The daughter was married to Pavoothikunnel family and the first four sons moved to Themoottil, Neduvelil, Periyilel, and Punamadom. The fifth son was a hermit priest (sanyasi achen). As was the custom, the youngest son Mathew lived at Palakunnathu family house (this house still exists). Being members of the ancient Malankara Church, many leaders were born in this family. Leader of the reformation in Malankara Church, Abraham Malpan, Mathews Athanasius Metropolitan (Thoma XIII); Thomas Athanasius Metropolitan (Thoma XIV); Titus I Thoma Metropolitan (Thoma XV); Titus II Thoma Metropolitan (Thoma XVI); were from this family. The present head of the Thoma Church, Dr. Joseph Thoma Metropolitan (Thoma XXI), is also from this family.Cherian Cherian. (1958). Maramon Pakalomattom Chackalyil Kudumba Charitram. (Family History of Maramon Pakalomattom Chackalyil).N. M. Mathew (2003). History of Palakunnathu Family. Chekottassan =Parents= Mathen (‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µª), the eldest son of Palakunnathu Mathew and Maraimma, was born on 25 April 1818. After 90 days he was baptized at the Maramon palli (church). =Education= Early education was at Maramon and his teacher was the poet laureate Chekottassan. At the age of eleven, he joined the Syrian Seminary at Kottayam.Ittoop Writer (1906). Malayalathulla Suryani Chistianikauleday Charitram (History of Syrian Christians in the land of Malayalam) When he was thirteen, he was ordained as a deacon by Thoma XII. (Cheppattu Dionysius). After completing his education in Kerala, Deacon Mathen joined Rev. John Anderson's School (now known as Madras Christian College), at Chennai. His friend Deacon George Mathen also joined him. By 1839, they had completed their education in Madras and returned home. =Future plan= At that time condition of Malankara Orthodox, the Syrian Church was in disarray and at times deplorable. Before leaving Madras, the two friends, Deacon Mathen and Deacon George Mathen would often spend time together talking about their future plans. Both of them being deacons, and by scholarly insight, felt the condition of the Malankara Church to be deplorable. Saying, \\"It is impossible to restore the Malankara Church,\\" Deacon George decided to join the Anglican C.M.S. Church. But for Deacon Mathen it was about being faithful to his family's cause and that of Abraham Malpan. It is said that, in the pride of youth, he often said, \\"As long as I am alive, I shall work only in my mother Church (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) and will live to pull out the weeds in my Church and bring it back to its original glory of pure undiluted faith.\\"Chacko, T. C. (1936 ) Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitra Samgraham. (Concise History of the Marthoma Church) Page 95.http://www.lightoflife.com/LOL_Photos/MathewsMarAthanasios_Marthoma_Shrt.jpg.jpg Beginning of reformation By this time, Deacon Mathen's uncle (father's brother) Abraham Malpan had already begun reformation in the church and made the following changes: *On Sunday 27 August 1837, Qurbana (Holy Communion) was conducted in Malayalam, the language of the people. *Every year on 5 October, there was a church festival at Maramon, connected with a saint (Eldho Mor Baselios) of the church. A wooden image of Muthappan was taken around in procession; people would offer prayers and offerings to it. In 1837, Abraham Malpan took the image and threw it into a well saying, \\"Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?\\" (Isaiah 8:19). Thus the prayers to the saints and prayers for the dead were removed from the reformed liturgy. *Changes were made to certain prayers in the prayer books, incorporating reformation theologies and insights received through the study of the Holy Bible. The use of the revised liturgy and the changes Abraham Malpan brought about in practices offended Cheppad Philipose Dionysius, who threatened him with excommunication. But Abraham Malpan informed him that if excommunicated, he would not come begging to revoke it. Thoma XII did not terminate or laicize him, allowed to keep the vicar position, then suspended Malpan from religious duties; he also refused the priesthood to the deacons trained under Malpan because of his divergent teachings.George Kassessa, Rev. M. C. (1919). Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan. (Biography in Malaylam) Page 42.) Decision to go to Antioch It was at this time Deacon Mathen returned from Madras. He realized the problems that faced him, his friends, his uncle Abraham Malpan, and the clergy who wanted a reformation in the Church. Deacon Mathen stood with his decision, \\"I shall live to pull out the weeds in my Church and bring it back to its original glory of pure undiluted faith.\\" The synod convened by the Dionysius at Mavelikkara on 16 January 1836 accepted the supremacy of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.Mavelikara Padiola. Para 1, Sentence 1. They also stated that only bishops permitted by the Patriarch had authority over the Church.Mathew N. M. (2006) Malankara Mar Thoma Sabha Charitram, Volume I, Page 259. This led Deacon Mathen to the conviction that he must visit the Patriarch of the Bishopric without permission. Abraham Malpan was willing to sacrifice anything for a new order in the Church; he prepared letters, spurred on by his determination Because of the difficulties of traveling from Kerala to Antioch, no one from the Malankara Church had ever attempted to go to Antioch before. Deacon Mathen was the first one to attempt this tedious journey. =Metropolitan= Deacon Mathen was ordained, by Moran Mor Elias II, Patriarch under the Episcopal title, Mathews Athanasius Metropolitan, at Mardin on 17 February 1842. He was appointed as the Metropolitan there and was given charge of a diocese. After about a year, Athanasius left for India. =Back in Kerala= Mathews Athanasius Metropolitan returned to Kerala on 17 May 1843 and was received by a number of parish priests and laymen. While he was at Cochin, his teacher, Konattu Varghese Malpan, arrived there with his followers. He advised the Metropolitan that the people of Malankara Church would accept him as their Metropolitan, and if he began reformation, the people would not follow. He realized that he could not make reforms easily. =Meeting with Swathi Thirunal Maharaja= Soon after his return to Kerala, he paid a visit to the then ruling Maharaja (king) of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal. Both of them were fluent in Malayalam, English, and Arabic, and their conversations were extended to happenings in western Asia through these languages. Reformation The Malankara Church was following the teachings of Jesus as told to them by St. Thomas & St. Bartholomew and had copies of the original Peshittha Bible. But things changed with the arrival of Vasco Da Gama on Sunday 20 May 1498. The teachings of the Roman Catholic Church were inculcated into the original teachings: prayers to and for the dead, Veneration of icons, Celibacy of priests, and so on. Many other practices of the Malankara Church become deplorable. So he and his friends stood at the helm of a reformation movement that was already there in the church pioneered by Abraham Malpan, a practice of bringing the church to its radix form as Bible Principles. His whole time he spent in bringing his Church to the Bible and to its \\"original purity\\" as evoked by Abraham Malpan.Chacko T. C. (1936) Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram Page 95 and the letter sent out on 13 September 1875 by more than 20 clergy, use this term In 1856 inspired by the Anglican missionaries cooperated in the Old Syrian Seminary at Kottayam, he printed and distributed prayer books in Malayalam, leaving out a prayer to Saint Mary. Holy Communion services were conducted in Malayalam the language of the people of Malabar. While with the Patriarch at Antioch, he was asked to preach at worship services. He continued this new practice after coming to Kerala. He encouraged clergy to read the Bible and interpret it to the common people of parishes. Allowed Tamil missionaries to preach at various churches. He was against honoring icons and statues, so he removed the statue of Saint Mary from Manarcaud Church (near Kottayam), and at Puthupally church, near Kottayam. Social reforms Athanasius was a social reformer also. He did a lot of things to help to improve the conditions of society. Some of the schools were run by the Malankara Church. Athanasius advised the government to give some of the grant to the schools as an encouragement. Government approved this proposal and gave grants to more than sixty schools.Chacko, T. C. (1936 ) Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitra Samgraham. (Concise History of the Marthoma Church). Page 125. Without the difference in caste, creed or color people approached Athanasius with their grievances for help from him. Christians were forced to work on Sundays and do menial work in Hindu temples at other times. Punishments were severe if they disobeyed. Athanasius put an end to all these. His friendship with the Maharajas, government, and its officials were of great help in this area. Oppositions Athanasius went to the Patriarch of Antioch without the permission of Dionysius IV. He was educated in a school run by British missionaries. His uncle Abraham Malpan was the leader of the reformation. Because of all these, though he returned as a Metropolitan, there were objections from among the Malankara Church. They later wrote to Antioch their objections, and as a result, the patriarch sent Euyakim Coorilos Metropolitan to Kerala, and from then on the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch introduced the \\"registered deed of submission\\" as an element of consecration as a metropolitan bishop. =Royal proclamation= In 1852, Cheppattu Philipose Dionysius' deteriorating health led to abdication. During the days of Thoma VII (1808‚Äì1809), a sum of 3000-star pagoda (Poovarahan) was given by Col.Macaulay as an investment in perpetuity by East India Company for support of church activities; Value of one-star pagoda coin is equivalent to 3.50 INR in the current currency system.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13210/14/14_chapter%208.pdf Forgiving the interest for this amount known as Vattipanam then, the government had to find out who the head was. Athanasius was approved by the governments of Travancore and Cochin as Malankara Metropolitan on 30 August 1852. after Cheppattu Philipose Dionysius abdicated due to ill health. Because of this, he was able to collect the interest of Vattipanam for the past 45 years, from the government. This did not please some of the members of the Church. =Consecration at Thozhyoor= In 1856, Athanasius ordained Ouseph Coorilose as Metropolitan of Malabar Independent Syrian Church. =Parishes= Athanasius used to visit parishes stayed there for a few days and meet the people of the parish. During that period, he appointed officers to conduct financial matters efficiently. Some members did not like this. =Publications= Athanasius established a printing press at Kottayam for the use of the Church. There, the liturgy was printed and published, omitting the prayers to Saint Mary and other saints. This infuriated a few priests. Those who opposed the Metropolitan published another book with all these prayers included.Varkey, M. P. (1901) Malankara Idavakayude Mar Dionysius Metropolitan. (Biography of Mar Dionysius Metropolitan). Page 11. Arrival of Patriarch During his time, reformation of the Church gained momentum. Ouseph Kathanar from Kunnamkulam, who objected to reformation, went to Antioch and was consecrated as Joseph Dionysius on 3 April 1865. After his return, those who opposed Mathews Athanasius invited the Patriarch of Antioch. The large majority of the people were conservative, and the reformist party was a very small minority. Thus a large majority joined the Patriarch of Antioch. Ignatius Pathrose III, Patriarch of Antioch arrived in June 1875 at Kunnamkulam. On his way, he visited Istanbul, London, and Madras. By this time, those who opposed Mathews Athanasius had a rumor flying among them that Athanasius would be laicized or excommunicated, without realizing that this was not possible.Canon of the Malankara Syrian Church. Keppalayon (Chapter) 2. para 16‚Äì22. There are no records discovered yet to show that Mathews Athanasius was ever excommunicated. Although there have been rumors that Abraham Malpan and Mathews Athanasius weren't in agreement on reformation, Malpan sought for restoration through puritanism, while Mathews Athanasius sought for separation and autonomy. Ordinations Athanasius ordained * Maramon Palakunnathu Thomas Kassessa under the name Thomas Athanasius as his successor on 1 June 1868. * Aarthatt Alathoor Ouseph Kathanar under the name Ouseph Coorilos of Malabar Independent Syrian Church in 1856. * Kochaypera of Mulanthuruthy Chathuruthy family was ordained as Koraya (sub-deacon) on 14 September 1858, at Karingachira (was reordained in 1864). Later he became Gheevarghese Gregorios of Parumala, he died on 2 November 1902 and was laid to rest at Parumala Church. Later he was a canonized saint of the Malankara Church and is also known in Malayalam as Parumala Thirumeni. Relation with other Metropolitans * Cheppad Philipose Dionysius was seriously ill and was living at Cheppad. He had no one to care for him. Athanasius went to Cheppad made arrangements to care for him and visited the parishes nearby till he died on 9 October 1855. The funeral service was conducted by Athanasius. *Coorilos became sick and was at Mulanthuruthy church. He visited him and comforted him. Coorilos died on 2 September 1874. Death Metropolitan died on 16 July 1877, after being bitten by a rat on 16 July 1877, and was laid to rest at Maramon Palli (church). Soon after the demise of Mathews Athanasius Metropolitan the Malankara Church was involved in litigation for the properties of the Church in Kerala between the two factions of the church, culminating in the Royal court verdict of 12 July 1889, which was in favor of the traditionalist faction. The traditionalist faction, with the blessing of the Patriarchate of Antioch, was led by Metropolitan Pulikkottil Joseph Dionysious V. The reformist faction, which lost the court litigation, was led by Thomas Athanasius. ReferencesFurther reading In English *#Juhanon Marthoma Metropolitan, The Most Rev. Dr. (1952).

This lineup recorded the 1984 four-song EP The Name of This Group Is Green and the group's 1986 self-titled debut album, which featured 14 songs, including re-recordings of all four songs from the earlier EP. Green established themselves via live shows around Chicago and undertook several national tours with the assistance of manager Cindy Illig. In 1986, Diamond and Valley elected to leave the band as Lescher announced plans for a national tour. Recruited from local music papers and from among their Chicago fan base were new bassist Ken Kurson (who had his own band, Circles, and later fronted The Lilacs), rhythm guitarist Stuart Shea, and drummer Rich Clifton. Shea departed following a brief U.S. tour, and the remaining three-piece recorded Elaine MacKenzie, including the tracks \\"Heavy Metal Kids\\", \\"She Was My Girl\\", and \\"Radio Caroline.\\" Writing in Spin magazine, renowned rock critic Ira Robbins reviewed Elaine MacKenzie, noting, \\"Lescher's voice is astonishing -- a rough but melodic roar that seems to be straining for release\\" before concluding \\"The Greening of America starts here.\\" Away From the Pulsebeat magazine's review of Elaine MacKenzie stated: \\"Best American band, best songwriter, best singer, best LP.

The company uses Segoe in its online and printed marketing materials, including recent logos for a number of products. Additionally, the Segoe UI font sub-family is used by numerous Microsoft applications, and may be installed by applications (such as Microsoft Office 2007 and Windows Live Messenger 2009). It was adopted as Microsoft's default operating system font beginning with Windows Vista, and is also used on outlook.com, Microsoft's web-based email service. In August 2012, Microsoft unveiled its new corporate logo typeset in Segoe, replacing the logo it had used for the previous 25 years.\\"Microsoft Debuts New Logo Before Windows 8\\" by Dina Bass , Businessweek August 23, 2012 The Segoe name is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation, although the typeface was originally developed by Monotype.  History  Segoe was designed by Steve Matteson during his employment at Agfa Monotype. Licensed to Microsoft for use as a branding typeface and user interface font, it was designed to be friendly and legible. Matteson created a range of weights and italics with a humanist feel. =Licensing controversy= In 2004, Microsoft registered certain Segoe and Segoe Italic fonts as original font designs with the European Union trademark and design office. The German font foundry Linotype protested, citing Segoe UI's similarity to its licensed Frutiger family of typefaces. In its submission to the EU, Microsoft claimed that Linotype had failed to prove that it had been selling Frutiger and Frutiger Next prior to 2004. The EU rejected these claims, and in February 2006 the EU revoked Microsoft's registration. Microsoft did not appeal the decision. Microsoft still holds United States design patents to various Segoe- based fonts. During the same period, in late 2004, after six years under the Agfa Corporation, the Monotype assets were acquired by TA Associates and the company was incorporated as Monotype Imaging. Later, in August 2006, Monotype Imaging acquired Linotype. So at the end of 2006, Linotype, the company that had challenged the validity of Microsoft's Segoe patents, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Monotype, the company that had originally licensed Segoe to Microsoft. The clearest differences (from top to bottom) Segoe UI, Frutiger, and Segoe Several letters have distinctly different forms in Segoe UI and Frutiger, reflecting Segoe UI's different intended use: low-resolution screen display, rather than airport signage (Frutiger). However, Ulrich Stiehl asserts that many of these differences were introduced in later versions of Segoe UI - earlier versions of Segoe UI were closer to Frutiger.Designer Says Vista Font is Original (Brian Livingston, 25 April 2006)Segoe UI 1997‚Äì2003 vs. Segoe UI 2005 (Comparison on page 3) On June 7, 2005, Scala, an electronic signage company (unrelated to the typeface FF Scala), announced that Segoe was being removed from its InfoChannel product \\"due to licensing issues\\". Scala replaced Segoe with Bitstream Vera fonts. In November 2005, Simon Daniels, a program manager in Microsoft's typography group, stated that \\"The original Segoe fonts were not created for or by Microsoft. It was an existing Monotype design which we licensed and extensively extended and customized to meet the requirements of different processes, apps and devices.\\" In April 2006, a Microsoft public relations spokesperson, who asked not to be named, stated: > Segoe was an original design developed by Agfa Monotype (now Monotype > Imaging) in 2000. In 2003, we acquired the original Segoe fonts and used > them to develop an extended family of fonts retaining the Segoe name. Many > of these new fonts received design patent protection in the United States. > Segoe was not derived from Frutiger. Microsoft also has a current up-to-date > license that allows us to distribute certain Frutiger fonts in connection > with Microsoft products including Office and Windows. There are distinct > differences between Segoe and Frutiger. Additionally, unlike clone > typefaces, the Segoe family of fonts are not metrically compatible with > Frutiger so cannot be used as replacements. Under United States copyright law, the abstract letter shapes of functional text fonts cannot be copyrighted; only the computer programming code in a font is given copyright protection. This makes the production and distribution of clone fonts possible. An early version of Segoe, possibly an evaluation version, was included with certain versions of SuSE Linux, but no longer ships as part of that operating system. Segoe UI Segoe UI is a member of the Segoe family used in Microsoft products for user interface text, as well as for some online user assistance material, intended to improve the consistency in how users see all text across all languages. It is distinguishable from its predecessor Tahoma and the OS X user interface font Lucida Grande by its rounder letters. Segoe UI was produced by Monotype Imaging. Light and Semibold versions of Segoe UI were introduced with Windows 7. The notable differences between the old (top) and the newer (bottom) revisions of Segoe UI In Windows 8, 8.1 and 10, Segoe UI has undergone a number of changes and stylistic additions: * A Semilight version was introduced in order to make a perfect lightweight down to 11 pixels. * True italic variants were introduced for the Light, Semilight, and Semibold weights. * The Light and Semibold versions have been tuned for better quality for screen reading. * Typography design changes were made that closely resemble the Segoe WP font family with similarities to Linotype Frutiger. Notable changes have been made from Windows Vista and Windows 7, such as to the letters ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúQ‚Äù, and the digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. * Additional scripts and character sets are supported, such as Arabic, Armenian, Georgian (Mkhedruli and Khutsuri), Hebrew, and Fraser alphabet (Lisu). * OpenType variants were included. In Windows 8.1 Segoe UI gained Black and Black Italic weights, but only for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts. =Characteristics= Segoe UI is optimized for Vista's default ClearType rendering environment, and it is significantly less legible when ClearType is disabled, except at key user interface sizes (8, 9 and 10 point) where Segoe UI has been hinted for bi-level rendering. The standard font size increased to 9 point in Windows Vista to accommodate for better layout and readability for all languages. The Windows Vista version of Segoe UI (version 5.00) contains complete Unicode 4.1 coverage for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Arabic (romans only), totaling 2843 glyphs in the regular weight. Segoe UI has a true cursive italic, unlike the oblique used in Frutiger and Helvetica. =Variations= * Segoe UI Mono is a variation of Segoe UI with monospace characters. It supports Latin (including Eastern European, and Turkish), Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Thai characters, and symbols, geometric shapes and drawing elements. The family includes two fonts in two weights, without italics. * Segoe UI Symbol is a new font added in Windows 7 that includes new scripts/symbols such as Braille, Deseret, Ogham or Runic glyphs. It is not however a \\"symbol charset-encoded font\\" (like MS Symbol) but rather it is a Unicode-encoded font with symbols assigned to respective Unicode code points. Segoe UI Symbol also has some other miscellaneous symbols such as chess pieces, playing card and dice symbols (these glyphs formed the basis of the Segoe Chess and Segoe News Symbols fonts), box-drawing characters, block elements, technical symbols, mathematical operators, arrows, control pictures, and OCR-optimized glyphs. In Windows 8, Segoe UI Symbol was extended to support Glagolitic, Gothic, Old Italic and Orkhon scripts. In Windows 8.1 it gained support for Meroitic Cursive and Coptic script. The updated Segoe UI Symbol from Windows 8 has also been backported to Windows 7. * Segoe UI Historic is a new font added in Windows 10 to support ancient scripts. Coptic, Glagolitic, Gothic, Meroitic Cursive, Ogham, Old Italic, and Runic were moved from Segoe UI Symbol to Segoe UI Historic. Additionally supported are Brahmi, Carian, Coptic, Cypriot, Egyptian hieroglyphs (except for phallic ones since v 1.01), Imperial Aramaic, Inscriptional Pahlavi, Inscriptional Parthian, Kharosthi, Lycian, Lydian, Old Persian, South Arabian, Old Turkic, Phoenician, Shavian, Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform, Syriac ( æEs·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ style), and Ugaritic scripts. * Segoe Boot is a vertically stretched font based on Segoe. Its vertical stretching allows the font to be rendered as the normal version when a 4:3 image (like the BIOS screen) is stretched to fill a screen with an aspect ratio of 16:9. It is included in the Windows 10 installation ISO. * Zegoe UI is a Zune-specific variation on Segoe. * In Windows 8.1 Microsoft added unofficial color support to fonts, first implemented in the Segoe UI Emoji font.How to enter and use Emoji on Windows 8.1 hanselman.com As of Windows 10, this has been formally supported with UWP applications natively using DirectWrite/Direct2D for text rendering with color font support, and first-class emoji support including an emoji keyboard included in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. = Availability = * The Segoe UI font family can be obtained as part of Windows and Windows Server operating systems: ** Recent Segoe UI design is included along with Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2. Certain Segoe fonts, but not Segoe UI, were included in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, replacing Trebuchet MS. ** The redesigned Segoe UI is included along with Windows 8 (Developer Preview since build 8130), Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Server 2012 R2, and Windows 10 (Server 2016 and later Windows Server versions) * Segoe UI is installed into Windows XP if the user installs Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2010, Windows Live Messenger or Windows Live Mail. Microsoft Word Viewer and Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007 install certain Segoe fonts, but not Segoe UI. * A semilight version of Segoe UI is installed into Windows 7 if the user installs Microsoft Office 2013.  Other Segoe fonts  Segoe Script The article of cat in English Wikipedia for sample of Segoe Script Other members of the Segoe family include: * Segoe Print is a font family based on the handwriting of Monotype Imaging employee Brian Allen, developed by Carl Crossgrove, James Grieshaber and Karl Leuthold.

It resembles the original Segoe, but is not optimized for ClearType rendering. * Segoe TV is a font family built into MSN TV set-top-boxes. It retains characteristics of the original Segoe, such as sans-serif capital I and straight tail in capital Q, whereas other characters have been redrawn such as the i and j. * Segoe WP is the Windows Phone 7 specific version of Segoe. The Segoe WP family is distributed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Currently, only release candidate beta version is available (March 2010). At one time, Microsoft also posted a package called Print Ad for Microsoft Dynamics Business Management Solutions Brief Description to the Microsoft downloads center. The package included TrueType and PostScript Type 1 beta versions of the Segoe branding fonts along with PowerPoint templates and marketing material. Windows Phones also include a more customised version called Segoe WP N which is designed with more clarity and narrow to enhance their take on ClearType. * \\"Segoe Pro\\" is a custom font used by Microsoft and its affiliates for branding. Segoe Pro contains the same glyphs that Segoe UI does, only that it has specific emojis of Microsoft products attached as well. Segoe Pro comes in Black, Bold, Condensed, Display, Semibold and Semilight, along with their italic versions of each. * \\"Segoe Slab\\" is a custom font which can be found if the user extract the Windows SDK.apk (Android app package). The font file is named 'SegoeSlabWP-Semilight.ttf'. * \\"Segoe Xbox Symbol\\" is a font developed specifically for the Xbox 360. It comes in 2 weights: Regular and Bold. These fonts can be extracted from the Xbox Android app. Other versions of this font include 'Segoe X Symbol' and 'Segoe Xbox MDL2 Assets'. * \\"Skype UI Symbol\\" is a font, similar to Segoe Xbox Symbol, however comprises the Latin script from Segoe UI. It comes in 2 weights, Regular and Bold. It can be extracted from the Skype app for Android.  Related fonts  Microsoft released Selawik as a metric-compatible Segoe UI replacement, and Symbols as a Segoe UI Symbols and Segoe MDL2 Assets fall-back, under SIL OFL in 2015. These fonts are used in WinJS and Winstrap. Selawik is also one of Microsoft's recommended fonts for Universal Windows Platform apps. The same text using Segoe UI and Leelawadee The Latin glyphs from Segoe and Segoe UI can also be found in the following Microsoft font families: Malgun Gothic (Korean), Microsoft JhengHei (Traditional Chinese), Microsoft YaHei (Simplified Chinese), Gisha (Hebrew), Leelawadee (Thai). In Windows 7, they are also found in Ebrima (N'Ko, Tifinagh, Vai), Khmer UI (Khmer), Lao UI (Lao), Microsoft New Tai Lue (Tai Lue), Microsoft PhagsPa (Phags-pa), Microsoft Tai Le (Tai Le). In these fonts some of the glyph shapes diverge significantly from Segoe UI and the Frutiger / Myriad model and are in some ways more calligraphic. In Gisha and Leelawadee the capital ‚ÄòM‚Äô is narrower, and has a raised apex, the lowercase ‚Äòi‚Äô and ‚Äòl‚Äô have tails, and the capital ‚ÄòI‚Äô has no serifs. These characteristics are also seen in Segoe UI italic.

He acted in 351 films, 27 plays and 17 television series; wrote 25 film scripts; and produced 30 films. He is considered to be one of the greatest actors in the middle east. He was also known as Malek El Terso (\\"The King of the Third Class\\" - a reference to his popularity among the poor, who bought third-class seats in movie theatres), as \\"Wahsh Ash shashah Al Arabiyah the Monster of the Arab Silver Screen\\" in honor of his various roles of beloved hero, as Farid Bay (\\"Sir Farid\\", an informal title of respect), and as Abu el-Banat (\\"father of all girls\\", a reference to his having six daughters and no sons). ŸèŸèThe closet title to Farid Shawqi's heart was\\" the king\\", was named after his movie \\"Night's Devils\\" that was released in 1966 directed by Niazi Mustafa. he was known with The king among his colleagues Career In a career spanning almost 50 years, Shawqi starred, produced, or wrote the scenario of over 400 films - more than the films produced collectively by the whole Arab world - in addition to theatre, television and video plays. His popularity covered the whole of the Arab World, including Turkey where he acted in some films there, and directors always addressed his as ' Farid Bay' (Sir Farid) as a sign of respect. As he worked with over 90 Film directors and producers. For the first ten years he typically cast as a villain. By the late 1940s his name alongside that of the late Mahmoud el-Mileegy guaranteed a box-office success. In 1954 he changed that image forever, playing the leading role in Ga'aloony Mujriman (\\"They Made Me a Criminal\\"), his own script in which he tackled the problem of homeless children and the first crime thus exposing the failure of government policy and the corruption of state run orphanages and young offenders institutions. Disliked by the establishment, the film was later awarded the State Prize; Shawqi went on to collect 10 best actor awards in many festivals, and four other awards for his scripts in the next thirty years. Critics referred to him as the \\"John Wayne\\" or \\"Anthony Quinn\\" of Egyptian cinema and of the Arabic speaking World\\", and to the masses he was the Beast of the Silver Screen, who championed the underdog, especially women, and the dispossessed using an effective mixture of cunning, physical strength, personal charm, and unbending principles, to overcome the wicked aggressors. With an illiteracy of over 80 per cent at the time, the \\"Screen Beast\\" personified the masses' dreams of defeating the wealthy, who were above the law thanks to an unjust class system. Screenwriter Abd-el-Hay Adeeb once had to rewrite a scene in a film after it had been released: Shawqi's character was slapped on the back of the neck, which is a sign of contempt in southern Mediterranean countries; the cinema audience in the city of Assiut rioted in protest, destroying the building. In 1969, Youssef Chahine's film al-Ardh (\\"The Land\\") ended with the main character being dragged to his death behind the horse of a corrupt police officer. Audiences called for the \\"Beast\\" - Shawqi - to come to his rescue, despite the fact that Shawqi did not appear in that film. A number of critics spent a great deal of time discussing the phenomenon as it was clear that Shawqi lived in the psyche of the nation as an image greater than reality and he represented hope and implementation of justice during the totalitarian military rule in the 1950s and 60's. With the influence of Egyptian cinema on the whole of the Middle East, the \\"Beast of the Silver Screen\\" had a similar status in all Arabic-speaking nations, where the main entertainment was, and still to a large degree, Egyptian films. Film producers and financiers called Shawqi - Malek el-Terso - or the King of the Third Class (Terso is an Egyptian slang word derived from the Italian word referring to the cheap third class seats in the cinema from which the bulk of the box office takings came). Shawqi was born in July 1920 in El Baghghala neighborhood of Cairo's popular quarter of Al-Sayyedah Zynab, where the majority of residents were the terso- film goers when Egyptian cinema started turning into a big industry. Shawqi worked as a civil servant as the Second World War broke out. He was given small parts in Ramsis Theatre group headed by Youssef Bay Wahby, then he worked with Anwar Wagdy doing small parts on the silver screen. He also formed a local theatre group \`The National League of Acting' which included his young wife actress Zainab Abd-el-Hady whom he married in 1941, they had one daughter Mona. They were divorced four years later, when he married his second wife, dancer Saneya Shawqi, whom he also divorced in 1950. By 1943 the NLA became The 20 Theatre as the members grew to 20 all became household names in Egyptian theatre and cinema for decades to come. The group specialized in presenting Chekov's plays, and Shawqi excelled in playing the leading parts - later on he loved to play classic parts in screenplays of novels by Nobel Prize holder Naguib Mahfouz. One of them was playing the role of Sultan in the film Bidaya wa nihaya. With success in theatre, and small parts in films, Shawqi left his post at the civil service in 1946. Few months later the 20 Theatre became the nucleus of the Higher Institute of Drama. In 1947 he made his mark in the film ‚ÄúMala‚Äôeka Fi Gohanam‚Äù \` Angels in Hell'. With his third wife, singer and actress Huda Sultan, whom he married in 1951, they made a famous partnership in more than 80 films. The marriage lasted 18 years and produced two daughters Maha and Nahed who is a successful film producer in her own right. He was working on a script for his daughter Abir in film dealing with homeless young people just before he died. Personal life Shawqi married Huda Sultan and had two daughters with her; one of them, Nahid Shawqi, is now a movie producer. In 1970, he married Soheir Tork, they stayed together until he died, she gave him two daughters Abir and Rania. He was survived by wife Soheir Turk and five daughters Mona, Nahed, Maha, Abeer and Rania. His brother was the late General Staff of Egyptian police Ahmad Shawqi. Farid's youngest daughter, Rania, is a well-known actress. She has two children, Fareeda and Malak. His other daughter from Soheir, Abir, is a film director with two children as well.

Biography Quinlan was born in the Bronx and raised both there and in Yonkers, New York. He attended public elementary and middle schools, and Regis High School, a tuition-free Jesuit high school in Manhattan. As a teenager, he held numerous jobs, including working for years as a caddie. His father was an alcoholic, which had a profound effect on Quinlan's development as a child and young man. Quinlan began his career writing grant proposals and press releases at Greyston Bakery and Greyston Foundation, where he worked for Bernie Glassman, helping raise millions of dollars to house homeless families and homeless people with AIDS. Later, Quinlan worked in public relations for the National Science Foundation. Quinlan's crime thriller, Smoked, was published in the United States and Canada by St. Martin's Press in April 2006, and in the United Kingdom and many countries throughout the world by Hodder Headline in March 2006. It received worldwide critical acclaim, and has been translated into Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and Dutch. Film rights were optioned in 2007, and again in 2009. His second crime thriller, The Takedown (also published as The Falling Man), appeared in May and June 2007, from both St. Martin's and Headline. His third crime thriller, The Drop-Off appeared in July 2008, and his fourth, The Hit, appeared in June 2009. Quinlan has written numerous books under pen names and as a ghost author. Quinlan's 2014 thriller Sexbot predicts a dystopian future where people have sex with, fall in love with, and download their awareness into robots. Quinlan himself has indicated he believes that in the near future, people (men especially) will easily fall in love with realistic sex robots, in a similar but deeper way than they fall in love with other inanimate objects, like cars and electronic gadgets. Much of this will have to do with the release of endorphins during sexual activity, but also with the ability of artificial intelligence to seem compassionate or supportive through simple techniques like rephrasing a person's statements back to them. Quinlan is the co-author, with Blade Runner film star Rutger Hauer, of Hauer's memoir, All Those Moments, released by HarperCollins in May 2007, and which was a Los Angeles Times bestseller. He is also the co-author, with Elena Nikitina (author), of the 2017 memoir Girl, Taken, Nikitina's story of being abducted and surviving the First Chechen War. Girl, Taken is available in English and Russian.. After the book came out, the BBC World Service covered the story on their Outlook (radio programme) program, which took the story global. In 2016, Quinlan contributed a chapter, The Rise of the Portland Greens, to the political science book, Empowering Progressive Third Parties in the United States. The chapter recounts Quinlan's experiences as an early member of the Green Party affiliate in Portland, Maine, that achieved unexpected electoral successes from the early- to the mid-2000s, and launched the careers of progressive politicians John Eder and Ben Chipman, among numerous others. Quinlan has been featured or favorably reviewed in many publications, including The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, The Times of London, The Observer, The Guardian, The New York Times, and Entertainment Weekly. His writing has frequently been compared to that of Elmore Leonard,http://www.elmoreleonard.com/index.php?/weblog/more/thrills_frills_and_elmore James Ellroy, and the movies of Quentin Tarantino. Quinlan is known to be an avid traveler, and has visited dozens of countries around the world. His travel writing has appeared in Transitions Abroad, Travel Smart, International Living, and Maine Ahead, among others. Politics In 2002, Quinlan served as campaign manager for John Eder, who as a result of the election became the second Green Party member elected to a state legislature in the United States. Quinlan also served as a consultant to Eder's 2004 campaign, and as Eder's legislative aide at the Maine State House during 2004 and 2005. In 2009, Quinlan established an exploratory committee and began raising funds for a run for governor of Maine. Later, he withdrew, citing his recent divorce and need for personal time. In 2010, he worked with Ben Chipman on his successful run for State Representative. In 2016, he served as campaign manager during Chipman's successful primary race for the Maine State Senate.

Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald FRSE (1 January 1748 ‚Äì 1 July 1831) was a Scottish nobleman and inventor. Life The son of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald, he joined the British Army as a youth and also served time in the Royal Navy before returning to Culross in 1778 after inheriting the Earldom of Dundonald from his father. He inherited a title and family lands but little money. Left with no other means of support, Archibald turned to invention. Cochrane's most noted invention was a method for making coal tar (patented in 1781) on an industrial scale. The British Tar Company invested in a works; it was managed by John Loudon McAdam. The coke byproduct was used, in part, by an ironworks at Muirkirk, and the flammability of the coal gas byproduct was recognised but not capitalized on. McAdam bought the company, but the deal was troubled. Cochrane hoped that he would be able to sell tar as a sealant for the hulls of ships to the Royal Navy. After contacts with the British Admiralty were made, a test was performed on a buoy. The buoy was coated on one side and left uncoated on the other. After some time the uncoated half was leaking and full of worms and barnacles, while the treated half was in quite good condition. A patent for his invention was drawn up, while the family estates were used as collateral. The coal tar technique was a rival to copper sheathing, preferred by the Admiralty. It has been argued that there were also powerful interests at play, shipyards needing the maintenance business. The patent expired, and the Royal Navy eventually adopted the tar mixture. Other experiments with alum production, making bread from potatoes, and paint manufacturing also proved unprofitable. His experiments with producing soda from table salt proved more successful but were not enough to reverse his financial misfortunes. In 1784, close to the Society's inception, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Hutton and Adam Smith.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Cochrane died impoverished in Paris at the age of 83. The earldom of Dundonald passed to his son Thomas Cochrane. Family He married three times. His first wife was Anne Gilchrist, daughter of Captain James Gilchrist whom he married in 1774. After her death, he married Isabella Mayne, a widow and daughter of Samuel Raymond, in 1788. His third wife was Anna Maria Plowden, daughter of Francis Plowden whom he married in 1819. He had four sons: Thomas Cochrane who was a highly successful Royal Navy officer, Basil Cochrane who briefly served in the Royal Navy before transferring to the British Army, William Erskine Cochrane who served in the British Army and Archibald Cochrane who also served in the Royal Navy. The Cochrane brothers Cochrane's younger brothers also had notable careers. Charles Cochrane (1749-1781) served as a major in the notorious British Legion during the American Revolution; John Cochrane (1750-1801) and Basil Cochrane (1753-1826) were supply contractors for the British army and navy; Basil in particular made a fortune providing supplies to the navy in India. Alexander Cochrane (1758-1832) became an admiral. George (b. 1762) served in the army and in Parliament. Andrew (1767-1833) was an army officer, colonial governor, member of Parliament, and fraudster. The Earl of St. Vincent, Admiral of the Fleet, wrote of the Cochrane brothers in 1806, \\"The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight, they are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling‚Äîand there is not a single exception in any part of the family.\\"History of Parliament Online bio of Cochrane-Johnstone ReferencesExternal links *Significant Scots - Archibald Cochrane *Coal Tar before the Invention of Town Gas 9 Category:Scottish inventors Category:1748 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Archibald ","title":"Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald"},{"id":"2713708","text":"DLO can refer to: * D'Lo Brown, ring name of American wrestler Ace Conner * D'Lo, Sri Lankan-American writer *Dead letter office, part of a postal office *Defence Logistics Organisation of the UK military * IATA location identifier for Delano Municipal Airport, California, US *Dense linear order, in mathematical order theory * Direct labour organisation of a UK local authority * Discontinuity layout optimization, an engineering analysis procedure * Nickname of D'Angelo Russell, an American basketball player ","title":"DLO"},{"id":"2713715","text":"Michael Staines (1 May 1885 ‚Äì 26 October 1955) was an Irish republican and politician. He was born in Newport, County Mayo, his mother Margaret's home village, and where his father Edward was serving as a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) officer. Staines was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and on its Supreme Council from 1921 to 1922. He served as Quartermaster General in the GPO during the 1916 Easter Rising and was later interned with his fellow insurgents at Frongoch internment camp. These men were served with internment orders under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which stated that they were \\"suspected of having honoured, promoted or assisted an armed insurrection against His Majesty\\".Sean O Mahony, Frongoch, University of Revolution (Dublin, 1987), pp. 19‚Äì23. This meant that there were no charges, no court appearances and no pleas.Lyn Ebenezer, Fron-goch, and the birth of the IRA (Llanrwst, 2006), p.16. Staines was elected Commandant of the prisoners after the former Commandant J. J. O'Connell was sent to Reading Gaol on 30 June.Ebenezer (2006), p.63 W. J. Brennan-Whitmore described Staines as: \\"a highly efficient officer who earned the love and respect of every individual prisoner.\\"W. J. Brennan-Whitmore, With the Irish in Frongoch (Dublin, 1917), p. 62. The attempts to conscript men in Frongoch to the British Army proved to be a serious source of disagreement between the prisoners and the camp authorities. The prisoners felt that it was ludicrous to expect Irish rebels to fight for Britain and the Crown. In addition they were concerned that acceptance of conscription in Frongoch might be a prelude to the introduction of conscription in Ireland. Roughly sixty men in Frongoch had lived in Great Britain before the Rising and they were accordingly deemed liable for conscription.O Mahony (1987), p.122 Staines, whom W. J. Brennan- Whitmore describes as maintaining \\"a very difficult position with remarkable efficiency and tact\\" throughout the conscription troubles which took place in Frongoch, took up a very resolute attitude on the question of identification. He asked Colonel F.A. Heygate-Lambert, Camp Commandant, if he expected the prisoner leaders to identify comrades of theirs for military service in the British Army. To this Heygate-Lambert replied that it was the leaders' duty to identify men for all purposes. Staines retorted that by identifying the men for military service they would be lowering themselves to the level of spies and informers.Brennan-Whitmore (1917), pp. 138‚Äì139 On his release from internment in Frongoch, he collaborated with √âamon de Valera, James Ryan, Eamonn Duggan and others in founding the New Ireland Assurance Collecting Society, in furtherance of the Sinn F√©in policy of investment in Ireland. He was elected Director for Supply for Sinn F√©in on 27 October 1917. He was also elected as a Sinn F√©in MP for the Dublin St. Michan's constituency at the 1918 general election. He attended D√°il √âireann, working closely with the legal side of government, as well as becoming a Dublin Corporation alderman. He was re-elected in 1921 and 1922 for the Dublin North-West constituency. He later served in the Free State Seanad. He was on the Grangegorman Psychiatric Hospital Board.

HistoryThe early years (1960‚Äì1972)= Joaquin \\"Chino\\" Roces, owner of the Manila Times was granted of a radio-TV franchise from Congress under Republic Act 2945 on 19 June 1960. He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law. Both ABC and the Manila Times were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals ABS- CBN, RBS, MBC and RMN‚ÄìIBC's radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day. After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with President Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival ABS-CBN reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after. New stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The Securities and Exchange Commission granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). =The return and growth (1992‚Äì2003)= ABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, Novaliches, Quezon City in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM- TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations. ABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under Republic Act 7831 signed by President Fidel Valdez Ramos. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \\"The Fastest Growing Network\\" under new network executive Tina Monzon-Palma who served as Chief Operating Officer. In 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of The Price Is Right (hosted by Dawn Zulueta and later acquired by ABS-CBN); Wheel of Fortune (hosted by Rustom Padilla, later acquired by ABS-CBN); and Family Feud (hosted by Ogie Alcasid, later acquired by GMA Network and then by ABS-CBN). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of IBC's Philippine editions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (hosted by Christopher de Leon, which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by Vic Sotto) and The Weakest Link (hosted by Edu Manzano). =The Cojuangco era (2003‚Äì2008)= In October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \\"Tonyboy\\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and owner of Dream Satellite Broadcasting and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of Philippine Basketball Association games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \\"Iba Tayo!\\" (\\"We're Different!\\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market. ABC continued to support Family Rosary Crusade, and its religious pre- identification campaign \\"Please Pray the Rosary\\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp. In 2005, ABC won the \\"Outstanding TV Station\\" award at the 2005 KBP Golden Dove Awards, with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories. In early 2007, ABC implemented a series of budget cuts, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the 2007 general elections, left ABC almost incapable of coverage. In November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including NBA basketball, pro boxing, and WWE events, as part of a new five-year deal with Solar Entertainment. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \\"House of Hoops\\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract that ended after the 2008 Fiesta Conference), would be picked up by RPN, who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011. =First TV5 era (2008‚Äì2018)= ABC-MPB Primedia partnership (2008‚Äì2010)  In March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by Media Prima Berhad of Malaysia as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive. MPB Primedia, meanwhile, was formed to serve as seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in various media companies within Southeast Asia.Media Prima set to exit Philippine TV Accessed 8 October 2018 Cojuangco said MPB Primedia Inc., in principle, would produce and source most of the entertainment programs while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and operation of the stations. MPB Primedia was also given exclusive right to schedule and manage sale of ABC-5's airtime. Christopher Sy was named CEO of MPB Primedia, Inc.; he served in that capacity until his resignation in January 2009 due to reported differences in management style. ABC signed off for the last time at around 22:00 PHT on 8 August 2008 with its late night newscast Sentro as the last program on air,Last Minutes of ABC-5 Accessed 8 October 2018 and then aired a countdown to its re-launch for much of the next day until 19:00 PHT, when the network officially re-launched under its new name of TV5. Its programming lineup aims towards \\"progressive Pinoys including those young at heart\\" (market classes C and D), and unveiled its newly upgraded 120-kilowatt state-of-the-art stereo TV transmitter. Shall We Dance, some shows in Nick on TV5, Kerygma TV, Light Talk, and Sunday TV Mass were the only ABC programs that were carried over to the line-up of TV5. In December 2008, a lawsuit was filed by GMA Network, Inc., Citynet Television and ZOE Broadcasting Network against ABC, MPB, and MPB Primedia, alleging that TV5's lease of airtime to Media Prima was intended to circumvent regulations restricting foreign ownership of broadcasting companies. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the network was a Filipino company that was self-registered and Filipino-run. Despite the lawsuit, the network's ratings were revitalized by the new management, as its audience share increased from 1.9% in July 2008 (prior to the re-branding) to 11.1% in September 2009.AGB-NMR Arianna Acquisition by PLDT, the Kapatid Network years (2010‚Äì2018) On 20 October 2009, Media Prima announced that it would be divesting its share in MPB Primedia / TV5, along with its affiliate ABC TV stations, and selling it to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company's broadcasting division, MediaQuest Holdings as it contributes to the company's losses during the year. The acquisition was officially announced by Chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan on 2 March 2010, along with the announcement of a new lineup of programming to debut on the network, along with a new campaign branding itself as the \\"Kapatid\\" (\\"sibling\\") network, in par with its rivals ABS-CBN and GMA Network. Dream FM and its affiliate stations in other parts of the country were not part of the acquisition and remained under the Cojuangco management led by former ABC stockholder Anton Lagdameo; which then acquired a non-controlling share on Interactive Broadcast Media (IBMI), to continue the operation of the stations, which became collectively known as the Dream FM Network, with IBMI as its licensee until its closure in June 2011, with the airtime of its flagship Manila station being sold to Ultrasonic Broadcasting System and relaunched as Energy FM. On 1 October 2010, TV5 took over the management of MediaQuest's Nation Broadcasting Corporation stations; DWFM was re-launched as a TV5-branded news radio station on 8 November 2010, Radyo5 92.3 News FM, and DWNB-TV was re-launched as AksyonTV on 21 February 2011, a news channel based on TV5's newscast Aksyon. At its peak, while retaining current position, TV5 was able to outrank GMA Network and become second most-watched network in key cities in Visayas and Mindanao, including Iloilo, Cebu, Bacolod, Davao, Cagayan de Oro; and even shared the top spot with ABS-CBN in General Santos City.TV5 outranks GMA in six markets? Accessed on 2 November 2018 On 23 December 2013, the network began broadcasting from its new headquarters, the 6,000-square meter TV5 Media Center located in Reliance, Mandaluyong. In 2014, ABC Development Corporation acquired Filipino broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics, 2014 Summer Youth Olympics and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Despite financial struggles within the management, TV5 continued to be on top as one of the top three television networks in the country with male and younger viewers dominated the audience reach due to the network's broadcast of the Philippine Basketball Association via Sports5 and the strengthened TV5 Kids block, which included the Marvel Studios animation programs in October 2014. The network celebrated its fifth anniversary under the management of Manny V. Pangilinan coinciding with its trade launch of 2015 shows held at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza on 26 November 2014. The network opened the year 2015 with the grand New Year's Eve countdown dubbed as Happy sa 2015 at the Quezon City Memorial Circle. In 2015, the network changed its corporate name from ABC Development Corporation to TV5 Network Inc. However, by that point, the network incurred increasing losses and debts brought about by few advertisers (e.g. Unilever) as well as digitalization. This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's in-house entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and initiated layoffs, including Wilma Galvante, its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resized TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017. Incapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed Viva Entertainment CEO, Vicente \\"Vic\\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture Sari- Sari Channel and outsourcing Viva Television for its entertainment shows, including a revival of Ang Panday, the return of Diether Ocampo and Claudine Barretto's tandem in Bakit Manipis ang Ulap? and shows from by-then sister station MTV Pinoy such as Top 20 Pilipinas. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings. Since January 2016, TV5 and Cignal via Hyper was the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the Philippines, this lasted until December 31, 2018. By July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from MTV and MTV International like Catfish, Ridiculousness and Ex on the Beach after inking a deal with Viacom International Media Networks that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block. On 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs Aksyon Bisaya (Cebu) and Aksyon Dabaw (Davao) due to cost- cutting measures. However, the personnel remained employed as they will continue filing reports for the national edition of Aksyon. On 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \\"Noel\\" C. Lorenzana stepped down from his position. He was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head, Vicente \\"Chot\\" Reyes the following day. Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization. In April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the WWE after Fox Philippines decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons. The network previously handle the rights from 2007 to 2008 and 2010. On 12 October 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with ESPN, licensing its PBA, UFC, PSL and NFL rights and giving TV5 access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership formed the ESPN5 brand, airing on TV5 and AksyonTV. The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel. = The 5 Network era and reverting back as TV5 (2018‚Äì2020) = On 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply 5 with a new logo and station ID entitled Get It on 5, whereas the word TV on the top right quadrant of the logo was dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid was divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the Kapatid moniker was also de-emphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the gradual phaseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a practice that dated back from the operations under the MPB Primedia era in 2008. At present, even its Disney Club on 5 programs and its movies aired in the English language. On 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of AksyonTV to 5 Plus, 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It also included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics. On 22 April 2019, TV5 Network was granted a 25-year legislative franchise extension under Republic Act 11320 albeit without President Rodrigo Roa Duterte's signature as the bill lapsed into law after 30 days of inaction. On 3 June 2019, Chot Reyes retired as TV5 President and CEO. He was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, who also leads pay-TV provider and radio company Cignal TV/Mediascape. Upon her appointment, the network began to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels One News, One PH, One Sports, and PBA Rush; it also phased out its daytime ESPN5 programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station 5 Plus in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; that included retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from Cignal Entertainment and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November. On 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang was appointed as the new president and CEO of TV5 Network and Cignal TV, replacing Basas who in turn, was appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of Smart Communications. On 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel 5 Plus was relaunched as One Sports (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer carried the ESPN5 banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de facto sports portal of both One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as One TV (adopting from Cignal TV's \\"One\\"-branded channels), which was originally scheduled on 13 April 2020. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (and the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine), the network postponed it. In June 2020 (after Metro Manila was placed in general community quarantine), the network announced that the rebrand would be pushed through on 20 July, but on July 4, the network officially cancelled the change due to netizens' adverse reaction to the upcoming rebrand as well as the opinions of the network's loyal viewers and fans. Viewers complained that it would have confused them and potentially diminished viewership. Due to this, the plugs of One TV (both on-air and online) were later pulled out of circulation. On 20 July 2020, 5 brings out new Tagalog-dubbed series and more entertainment content on primetime then later it announced that 5 will be reverted as TV5.. On 27 July 2020, Cignal TV, TV5 and their sister company, Smart Communications announced its multi-year deal with the National Basketball Association for the league's official broadcast rights in the Philippines, replacing Solar Entertainment Corporation. The games during the 2019‚Äì20 season will be aired live on free-to-air networks TV5 and sister channel One Sports (replacing CNN Philippines as an exclusive but temporary free-to-air broadcaster, which eventually dropped in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and Canada, as well as the 4 month suspension of league play). This is the first time the NBA broadcasts on TV5 since the then-ABC 5 last aired the NBA games (in partnership with Solar Entertainment Corporation) from 2007 to 2008. = Second TV5 era and collaboration with Cignal TV (2020‚Äìpresent) = On 15 August 2020, 5 reverted to its former name, TV5 (while retaining the variation of its current numerical logo that was introduced in January 2019), as the network announced its partnership with sister company, Cignal TV as TV5's main content provider to handle its programming in order to bring back the glory days of TV5 to compete again with its rival TV network, GMA Network and other TV networks in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 unveiled its first wave of entertainment programs produced by blocktimers, among them Archangel Media, ContentCows Company, Inc., Luminus Productions, Inc. (and later Viva Television and Brightlight Productions), which were part of the supposed lineup for now-cancelled rebranding of TV5 as One TV. In addition, shows from the foreclosed ABS-CBN were announced to be transferred to TV5 as the former implemented retrenchments following the non-renewal of its broadcast franchise. Currently, TV5 is in talks with the same network for the possibility to hire the displaced employees of its former rival with TV5 chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan stating that they are open to work with them.. In mid-September 2020, TV5 unveils second wave of new programming line-up for October (including programs that produced by its blocktimers Viva and Brightlight, and News5 produced shows). Branding of TV5Network identity= On 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher Joaquin \\"Chino\\" Roces launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation. Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today. :*Associated Broadcasting Corporation (1960‚Äì1972) ‚Äî founded by Joaquin \\"Chino\\" Roces until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the Martial Law by President Marcos. :*Associated Broadcasting Company (1992‚Äì2008) ‚Äî fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003. :*TV5 (2008‚Äì2018; 2020‚Äìpresent) ‚Äî renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group Media Prima Berhad. In 2010, Media Prima divested its share with MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. to business tycoon Manuel V. Pangilinan. Upon relaunch as 5, the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers. It was officially restored as the network's full- time identity on August 15, 2020, coinciding with the return of local entertainment programs to the station. :*5 (The 5 Network) (2018‚Äì2020) ‚Äî TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply 5 on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, TV5 was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself. \\"The 5 Network\\" branding was retired on 14 August 2020, though the 2019 numerical 5 logo variant was retained. =Logos= TV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in Metro Manila, DZTM-TV carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors red, blue and green‚Äîcolors making up a pixel shown on the television technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan \\"Come home to ABC\\", the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan \\"Iba Tayo!\\". The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re- launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear. In 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on ESPN5 logo, which was launched in October 2017, dropping the \\"TV\\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their Get It on 5 campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \\"(title) on 5\\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \\"on\\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions News5, Radyo 5, and D5 Studio. A variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the its former sister network, 5 Plus (now One Sports), though it was retained despite the renaming of 5 to TV5 in 2020. Programming TV5's programming consists of news and public affairs programs, dramas, musical and variety shows, reality shows, soap operas, comedy and gag shows, dubbed cartoons and anime shows, movies, sports, informative and talk shows. On its second month since its re-launch on 9 August 2008, TV5 had been reportedly on Top 3 based on the AGB Nielsen survey. It also gained its rating on their Nick on TV5 morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block. In 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, Wilma Galvante (2012‚Äì2015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings. In 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \\"Happy Ka Dito!\\" campaign. In 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \\"Happy sa 2015\\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA. Months later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named Sari-Sari Network as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and Viva executive, Vicente \\"Vic\\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create Sari-Sari Network (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with Viva Entertainment on 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows. In December 2016, Brillante Mendoza signed a contract with TV5 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the Brillante Mendoza Presents umbrella. Unfortunately, the actual date of mini- series Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo, that supposed to premiere on TV5, was cancelled due to unknown reasons. Since 2017, NFL games began to broadcast on TV5, replacing the TV5 Kids presents Cartoon Network block (whereas Cartoon Network shows were moved to GMA Network since Ben 10 on 29 March 2018 and CNN Philippines on 1 September 2018 in original English-language audio.) The network also started airing selected shows from the Sari-Sari Channel under the Sari-Sari sa Weekends banner. After several months of hiatus, the local drama Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo premiered on 21 April 2018. On 13 January 2019, all foreign entertainment shows broadcast on 5 started to be broadcast in the original English-language audio instead of Filipino dubbed audio (except Scorpion and Sine Squad on weekends). In March 2019, the Sine Squad movie block on weekends are now aired in original English audio (except on weekday afternoons in Filipino dubbed audio starting June 2019). On 23 September 2019, upon 5's expansion of its movie blocks, they returned in airing the Filipino language dubbing instead of the original English audio. However, in January 2020, the primetime movie blocks returned to the original English audio as reruns of 5 programming took the place of the afternoon movies. On 20 July 2020, TV5 introduced a set of foreign programs like Betty sa NY, Tierra de Reyes, and Marimar to fill up vacant time blocks due to lack of sporting events due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to replace provisional reruns of their former programs that began in September 2019. These entertainment programs was further beefed up by the launch of the first batch of new local entertainment shows such as Fill in the Bank, Bawal na Game Show, and Chika, Besh! (all produced by Archangel Media), Fit for Life (produced by Luminus Productions Inc.), and the returning Bangon Talentadong Pinoy (a co- production with The IdeaFirst Company) on 15 August. Kapatid Channel TV5 programs are seen internationally via Kapatid Channel, and is currently available in Guam, the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Canada, and the United States.

The film features Diana Dors, Rod Steiger, Tom Tryon and Beulah Bondi.Harrison's Reports review; August 31, 1957, page 138.Variety film review, September 4, 1957, page 6. The screenplay was written by William Durkee and Jonathan Latimer The plot concerns a femme fatale named Phyllis (Diana Dors) who tells her sordid story from her prison cell in flashback. Dors later said the film \\"wasn't good. They edited it badly.\\" The movie's box office failure hurt her career. Plot The film begins with Phyllis (Diana Dors) telling her story in flashbacks. It begins how she meets rich vintner Paul Hochen (Rod Steiger) from Napa Valley in a bar and marries him soon after. Not long after the marriage, Phyllis begins having an affair with a local rodeo rider, San Sanford (Tom Tryon), seeing him every time her husband is away, which is frequently. One night, her elderly mother-in-law (Beulah Bondi) thinks a burglar is breaking into the house, so she calls the police. Phyllis sees this as an opportunity to kill her husband and blame the burglar for the crime. The plan backfires a day later when she instead kills her husband's best friend. Not wanting to go to jail, she convinces her husband to confess to the killing and they concoct a story that would set him free after the trial. Phyllis lies at the trial and Paul is put away for murder. The \\"unholy\\" wife finally gets the punishment she deserves when her mother-in-law dies of poisoning and the blame goes to Phyllis, who is sent to prison for a crime she did not commit. Later, she faces her execution in the gas chamber. The film ends with Paul showing their son Michael (Gary Hunley) the vineyard that will someday be his. Cast * Diana Dors as Phyllis Hochen * Rod Steiger as Paul Hochen * Tom Tryon as San Sanders * Beulah Bondi as Emma Hochen * Marie Windsor as Gwen * Arthur Franz as Father Stephen Hochen * Luis Van Rooten as Ezra Benton * Joe De Santis as Gino Verdugo * Argentina Brunetti as Theresa * Steve Pendleton as Deputy Bob Watkins * Douglas Spencer as Judge * Gary Hunley as Michael * James Burke as Sheriff Tom Watling * Tol Avery as Dist. Atty. Carl Kramer The Prowler The film was based on a TV play, \\"The Prowler\\" which was presented on the TV show Climax! starring Claire Trevor, Pat O'Brien and Cameron Mitchell. There was some talk this play was based on the Woodward case but the host of the show, William Lundigan, denied this in the press, saying the script had been bought six months previously, and was held until Claire Trevor was available to star in it. The script had been purchased by CBS by William Dozier. When Dozier became head of RKO he purchased the film rights for RKO. Dozier bought two other Climax scripts for filming by RKO ‚Äì Public Pigeon Number 1 to star Red Skelton and Deal a Blow written by Dozier's son Robert. However these two films would not be made. Production RKO were attempting to re-establish itself as a leading filmmaking studio at the time and had numerous projects in development. The movie was made by John Farrow as the second in a three-film contract he had with RKO. The first was Back from Eternity (1956); there ended up being no third film. Rod Steiger signed to star in April. Shelley Winters was a leading contender for the female lead. However, in July 1956 the role was given to Diana Dors as part of a long-term contract with RKO; it was her second film in the USA (and for RKO) the first being I Married a Woman (1956). Ethel Barrymore signed to play Dors' mother- in-law, Barrymore's first film in two years. However, she changed her mind, fearing the heat of a location shoot in the Napa Valley, and dropped out. Beulah Bondi replaced her. Filming started in September 1956 on location in the Napa Valley under the title The Lady and the Prowler. Reception The New York Times panned the film when it was released, writing, \\"Indeed, this might be an excellent time for the actress to take inventory or choose a comedy (her real forte). For the new R. K. O. production and Universal- International release, teaming her with Rod Steiger, is a dull, unholy mess, and an absolute waste of anyone's time. Including, we might add, that of the two principals. Pretentiously tinted in garish color, and staged with coronation pomp by director-producer John Farrow, the picture is a hollow, tawdry little drama of frustration, violence and a loveless marriage in California's Napa Valley.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, March 7, 1958. Accessed: August 5, 2013. Dors made no more films for RKO. She later sued RKO for defamation of character claiming $1,275,000. She settled out of court for $200,000.

Hatab is said to have been a Ba'ath party member. Arrest Hatab was arrested in a raja bazaar where he was trying to sell a U.S. Army issue M16 rifle. The serial number of this rifle showed it was one issued to a member of the unit that included captured Army Private Jessica Lynch. United States Marines who were guarding the prisoners at Camp Whitehorse believed that his possession of the rifle implicated Hatab in Lynch's capture. Death in custody Hatab was in custody for only a few days. Hatab was interrogated by a military intelligence officer before he was killed. He was also looked at by a medic who stated that Hatab appeared to have suffered a mild heart attack. The medic also suggested Hatab might be faking it. In the days before he died Hatab was observed being unsteady on his feet. He was observed spontaneously falling over and landing on a bale of razor wire. He appeared dazed. He had completely lost control of his bowels, and his clothes were covered in excrement. Major Clarke Paulus ordered Corporal Christian Hernandez to haul Hatab over to where he could be hosed off. He was then to strip Hatab naked, burn his clothes, and tie him to a stake, and leave him outside, so he wouldn't foul the clothes of other prisoners. Hatab was left naked out in the desert, limp and incapacitated in the blazing sun. At midnight it was noticed Hatab was dead. Investigations A post-mortem was conducted on Hatab. It determined that he died from a broken hyoid bone, a very small bone, near the larynx. Hernandez had been ordered to haul Hatab by his neck, when he dragged him to where he could be hosed off. General James Mattis dropped all charges against Hernandez. Initially eight Marines were under investigation for their roles in Hatab's death. But Pittman and Paulus were the only two to be court martialed. The post-mortem had found a large bruise that was probably caused by Pittman's kick. Pittman was cleared of assault, but was convicted of dereliction of duty and abuse of prisoners. He was reduced of rank to private and was sentenced to 60 days of hard labor. Samples of Hatab's bodily fluids were packed in ice to be sent to Germany for analysis, as part of the autopsy. However, the container was left on the tarmac at Tallil Air Base in Iraq and exploded in the hot sun.

These are constructed by filming a drawing, making erasures and changes, and filming it again. He continues this process meticulously, giving each change to the drawing a quarter of a second to two seconds' screen time. A single drawing will be altered and filmed this way until the end of a scene. These palimpsest-like drawings are later displayed along with the films as finished pieces of art.Greg Kucera Gallery 2007. Early life and career Kentridge was born in Johannesburg to Sydney Kentridge and Felicia Geffen. Both were advocates (barristers) who represented people marginalized by the apartheid system. He was educated at King Edward VII School in Houghton, Johannesburg. He showed great artistic promise from an early age, and in 2016 became the first artist ever to have a catalogue raisonn√© devoted to his juvenilia.Cole 2016. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics and African Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand and then a diploma in Fine Arts from the Johannesburg Art Foundation. In the early 1980s, he studied mime and theatre at the L'√âcole Internationale de Th√©√¢tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris. He originally hoped to become an actor, but he reflected later: \\"I was fortunate to discover at a theatre school that I was so bad an actor [... that] I was reduced to an artist, and I made my peace with it.\\". Between 1975 and 1991, he was acting and directing in Johannesburg's Junction Avenue Theatre Company. In the 1980s, he worked on television films and series as art director. Work As someone who is ethnically Jewish in South Africa, Kentridge has a unique position as a third-party observer. His parents were lawyers, famous for their defence of victims of apartheid. Kentridge developed an ability to remove himself somewhat from the atrocities committed under the later regimes. The basics of South Africa's socio-political condition and history must be known to grasp his work fully, much the same as in the cases of such artists as Francisco Goya and K√§the Kollwitz.Cameron, Christov-Bakargiev, Coetzee 1999. Kentridge is of expressionist lineage: form often alludes to content and vice versa. The feeling that is manipulated by the use of palette, composition and media, among others, often plays an equally vital role in the overall meaning as the subject and narrative of a given work. One must use one's gut reactions as well as one's interpretive skills to find meaning in Kentridge's work, much of which reveals very little actual content. Due to the sparse, rough and expressive qualities of Kentridge's handwriting, the viewer sees a sombre picture upon first glance, an impression that is perpetuated as the image illustrates a vulnerable and uncomfortable situation.Christov-Bakargiev, 1998. Aspects of social injustice that have transpired over the years in South Africa have often become fodder for Kentridge's pieces. Casspirs Full of Love, viewable at the Metropolitan Museum, appears to be nothing more than heads in boxes to the average American viewer, but South Africans know that a casspir is a vehicle used to put down riots, a kind of a crowd-control tank. The title, Casspirs Full of Love, written along the side of the print, is suggestive of the narrative and is oxymoronic. A casspir full of love is much like a bomb that bursts with happiness - it is an intangible improbability. The purpose of a machine such as this is to instil \\"peace\\" by force, but Kentridge points to the fact that it was used as a tool to keep lower-class natives from taking colonial power and money.Edmunds 2003. =Prints and drawings= Print from portfolio 'Ubu Tells the Truth' by William Kentridge, Honolulu Museum of Art By the mid-1970s, Kentridge was making prints and drawings. In 1979, he created 20 to 30 monotypes, which soon became known as the \\"Pit\\" series. In 1980, he executed about 50 small-format etchings which he called the \\"Domestic Scenes\\". These two extraordinary groups of prints served to establish Kentridge's artistic identity, an identity he has continued to develop in various media. Despite his ongoing exploration of non-traditional media, the foundation of his art has always been drawing and printmaking. In 1987, he began a group of charcoal and pastel drawings based, very tenuously, on Watteau's Embarkation for Cythera. These extremely important works, the best of which reflect a blasted, dystopic urban landscape, demonstrate the artist's growing consciousness of the flexibility of space and movement. In 1996-1997, he produced a portfolio of eight prints titled Ubu Tells the Truth, based on Alfred Jarry's 1896 play Ubu Roi. These prints also relate to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Kentridge's South Africa after the end of apartheidHonolulu Museum of Art, wall label, Ubu Tells the Truth, 1996-97, accession TCM.1998.16.1-8 One of the stark and somber prints from this portfolio, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is illustrated. The Six Drawing Lessons, delivered as part of The Norton Lectures series at Harvard University in 2012, consider the work in the studio and the studio as a place of making meaning developed. A series of large drawings of trees in Indian ink on found encyclopedia pages, torn up and reassembled, analyzes the form of different trees indigenous to southern Africa. Drawn across multiple pages from books, each drawing is put together as a puzzle ‚Äì the single pages first painted, then the whole pieced together.Marian Goodman Gallery, New York. \\"My drawings don't start with a 'beautiful mark',\\" writes Kentridge, thinking about the activity of printmaking as being about getting the hand to lead the brain, rather than letting the brain lead the hand. \\"It has to be a mark of something out there in the world. It doesn't have to be an accurate drawing, but it has to stand for an observation, not something that is abstract, like an emotion.\\" =Animated films= Between 1989 and 2003 Kentridge made a series of nine short films that he eventually gathered under the title 9 Drawings for Projection. In 1989, he began the first of those animated movies, Johannesburg, 2nd Greatest City After Paris. The series runs through Monument (1990), Mine (1991), Sobriety, Obesity & Growing Old (1991), Felix in Exile (1994), History of the Main Complaint (1996), Weighing and Wanting (1997), and Stereoscope (1999), up to Tide Table (2003) and Other Faces, 2011. For the series, he used a technique that would become a feature of his work - successive charcoal drawings, always on the same sheet of paper, contrary to the traditional animation technique in which each movement is drawn on a separate sheet. In this way, Kentridge's videos and films came to keep the traces of the previous drawings. His animations deal with political and social themes from a personal and, at times, autobiographical point of view, since the author includes his self-portrait in many of his works. The political content and unique techniques of Kentridge's work have propelled him into the realm of South Africa's top artists. Working with what is in essence a very restrictive media, using only charcoal and a touch of blue or red pastel, he has created animations of astounding depth. A theme running through all of his work is his peculiar way of representing his birthplace. While he does not portray it as the militant or oppressive place that it was for black people, he does not emphasise the picturesque state of living that white people enjoyed during apartheid either; he presents instead a city in which the duality of man is exposed. In a series of nine short films, he introduces two characters - Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitlebaum. These characters depict an emotional and political struggle that ultimately reflects the lives of many South Africans in the pre-democracy era. In an introductory note to Felix In Exile, Kentridge writes, \\"In the same way that there is a human act of dismembering the past there is a natural process in the terrain through erosion, growth, dilapidation that also seeks to blot out events. In South Africa this process has other dimensions. The very term 'new South Africa' has within it the idea of a painting over the old, the natural process of dismembering, the naturalization of things new.\\" Not only in Felix In Exile but in all of his animated works do the concepts of time and change comprise a major theme. He conveys it through his erasure technique, which contrasts with conventional cel-shaded animation, whose seamlessness de-emphasizes the fact that it is actually a succession of hand-drawn images. This he implements by drawing a key frame, erasing certain areas of it, re-drawing them and thus creating the next frame. He is able in this way to create as many frames as he wants based on the original key frame simply by erasing small sections. Traces of what has been erased are still visible to the viewer; as the films unfold, a sense of fading memory or the passing of time and the traces it leaves behind are portrayed. Kentridge's technique grapples with what is not said, what remains suppressed or forgotten but can easily be felt. In the nine films that follow Soho Eckstein's life, an increasing vehemence is placed on the health of the individual and contemporary South African society. Conflicts between anarchic and bourgeois individualistic beliefs, again a reference to the duality of man, indicate the idea of social revolution by poetically disfiguring surrounding buildings and landscapes. Kentridge states that, although his work does not focus on apartheid in a direct and overt manner, but rather on the contemporary state of Johannesburg, his drawings and films are certainly spawned by, and feed off of, the brutalised society that it left in its wake. As for more direct political issues, Kentridge says his art presents ambiguity, contradiction, uncompleted movements and uncertain endings, all of which seem like insignificant subtleties but can be attributed to most of the calamity presented in his work. In a mixed-media triptych entitled \\"The Boating Party\\" (1985), based on Renoir's painting of a similar name, the havoc caused by a seemingly-uninterested aristocracy is perhaps his most severe comment on the state of South Africa during apartheid. The languid diners sit at ease while the surrounding area is ravaged, torn and burned, a contrast that is reflected in his style and choice of colours. In 1988, Kentridge co-founded Free Film-makers Co-Operative in Johannesburg. In 1999, he was appointed a film-maker by Stereoscope. \\"Purely in the context of my own work,\\" he wrote in a published playscript of his celebrated Ubu and the Truth Commission, \\"I would repeat my trust in the contingent, the inauthentic, the whim, the practical, as strategies for finding meaning. I would repeat my mistrust in the worth of Good Ideas. And state a belief that somewhere between relying on pure chance on the one hand, and the execution of a programme on the other, lies the most uncertain but the most fertile ground for the work we do [...]. I think I have shown that it is not the clear light of reason or even aesthetic sensibility which determines how one works, but a constellation of factors only some of which we can change at will.\\"Kentridge 2007. In 2001, Creative Time aired his film Shadow Procession on the NBC Astrovision Panasonic screen in Times Square.Notations/William Kentridge: Tapestries, 12 December 2007 ‚Äì 6 April 2008. =Opera= He has been invited to create stage design and act as a theatre director in opera. His political perspective is expressed in his opera directions, which involves different layers: stage direction, animation movies, influences of the puppet world. He has staged Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (Monteverdi), Die Zauberfl√∂te (Mozart) and The Nose (Shostakovich). Following that, he collaborated with the French composer Fran√ßois Sarhan on a short show called Telegrams from the Nose, for which he made the stage and set design for the performance. In November 2015 his \\"provocative and visually stunning new staging\\"James Jorden, William Kentridge Commits Murder Most Excellent at the Met, New York Observer, 11 November 2015. of Berg's Lulu, premi√®red at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, a co- production with the English National Opera and the Dutch National Opera. On 8 August 2017, William Kentridge's Wozzeck (Alban Berg) premi√®red at the Salzburg Festival and received enthusiast reactions. \\"The Head and the Load\\", Holland Festival, Amsterdam 2019 =Tapestries= Kentridge's protean artistic investigation continues in his series of tapestries begun in 2001. The tapestries stem from a series of drawings in which he conjured shadowy figures from ripped construction paper and collaged them onto the web-like background of nineteenth-century atlas maps. To reincarnate these figures into tapestry, Kentridge worked in close collaboration with the Johannesburg-based Stephens Tapestry Studio, mapping out cartoons from enlarged photographs of the drawings and hand-picking dyes to colour the locally spun mohair (goat hair).Notations/William Kentridge: Tapestries, 12 December 2007 ‚Äì 6 April 2008. =Sculpture= William Kentridge, Il cavaliere di Toledo (2012) -2, Naples William Kentridge, Il cavaliere di Toledo (2012), Naples In 2009, Kentridge, in partnership with Gerhard Marx, created a 10m-tall sculpture for his home city of Johannesburg entitled Fire Walker. In 2012 his sculpture, Il cavaliere di Toledo, was unveiled in Naples. Rebus (2013), referring in title to the allusional device using pictures to represent words or parts of words, is a series of bronze sculptures that form two distinct images when turned to a certain angle; when paired in correspondence, for example, a final image ‚Äì a nude ‚Äì is created from two original forms ‚Äì a stamp and a telephone. =Murals= In 2016, the anniversary of Rome's legendary founding in 753BC, Kentridge unveiled Triumphs and Laments, a monumental mural along the right bank of the river Tiber. The 550m-long frieze depicting a procession of more than 80 figures from Roman mythology to the present is Kentridge‚Äôs largest public work to date. To celebrate its launch, he and his long-time collaborator, the composer Philip Miller, devised a series of performances featuring live shadow play and more than 40 musicians.  Family  Kentridge is married to Anne Stanwix, a rheumatologist, and they have three children. A third-generation South African of Lithuanian-Jewish heritage, he is the son of the South African lawyer Sydney Kentridge and the lawyer and activist Felicia Kentridge.

The stage version premiered in 1978 at the Mermaid Theatre in London, and subsequently opened on Broadway in 1979. The play involves a sculptor who is paralysed. Plot Set in a hospital room, the action revolves around Ken Harrison (Claire Harrison in some later productions), a sculptor by profession, who was paralysed from the neck down (quadriplegia) in a car accident and is determined to be allowed to die. Clark presents arguments both in favour of and opposing euthanasia and to what extent government should be allowed to interfere in the life of a private citizen. In portraying Ken as an intelligent man with a useless body, he leaves the audience with conflicting feelings about his desire to end his life. Productions The play was televised on 12 March 1972 by Granada TV. It was directed by Richard Everitt, with the cast that featured Ian McShane (Ken), Suzanne Neve (Dr. Scott), and Philip Latham (Dr. Emerson).Clark, Brian. \\"Details of First TV and Stage Productions, pp. x-xii\\" Whose Life is it Anyway?, Heinemann, 1993, Whose Life Is It Anyway? opened at the Mermaid Theatre, London, on 6 March 1978, before playing at the Savoy Theatre from June 1978 to October 1979.

It opened at the Trafalgar Theatre on 17 April 1979 and ran for 223 performances and 9 previews. Conti, who was making his Broadway debut, was joined by Jean Marsh and Philip Bosco. Conti was nominated for a Drama Desk Award and won the 1979 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Both the play itself and Lindsay-Hogg were nominated as well. The play, again directed by Lindsay-Hogg, was revived on Broadway at the Royale Theatre, where it opened on 24 February 1980 after nine previews. A gender reversal found Mary Tyler Moore in the lead role, renamed Claire, and James Naughton as her now-male doctor. Josef Sommer completed the principal cast. The play ran for 96 performances.\\"'Whose Life Is It Anyway?'

The capitol houses the chambers for the Louisiana State Legislature, made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the office of the Governor of Louisiana. At tall and with 34 stories, it is the tallest building in Baton Rouge, the seventh tallest building in Louisiana, and tallest capitol in the United States. It is located on a tract, which includes the capitol gardens. The Louisiana State Capitol is often thought of as \\"Huey Long's monument\\" due to the influence of the former Governor and U.S. Senator in getting the capitol built. The building's construction was completed in 1931. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982.  History  In order to secure the mouth of the Mississippi River for the French, the town of New Orleans was founded in 1718 and became the capital for colony of Louisiana in 1722. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris ceded the portion of Louisiana that was west of the Mississippi River, as well as New Orleans, to Spain and the remaining territory east of the Mississippi was turned over to Great Britain. The French reclaimed Louisiana from the Spanish in 1803 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800; the territory was then sold as the Louisiana Purchase to the United States. The ceremonial transfers of Louisiana from Spain to France in November 1803 took place in front of the colonial seat of government, the Cabildo. The transfer from France to the U.S. occurred there as well less than a month later. New Orleans continued to be the location of the capital of the Territory of Orleans, and through its admission into the U.S. as the state of Louisiana. The State Legislature passed a resolution declaring that the seat of government be moved to a \\"more convenient place\\" than New Orleans. No action was taken until 1829 when the Legislature voted to move to Donaldsonville. It convened for the first time in Donaldsonville in January 1830. On January 8, 1831, it became \\"dissatisfied with the quarters there\\", and adjourned shortly thereafter to return to New Orleans. = Old State Capitol = The Old State Capitol (1849-1862, 1882-1932) Included in the Louisiana State Constitution of 1845 was a clause that required the state capital to be moved from New Orleans by 1849., Article 112. A committee was formed to prepare a site for the eventual move and, the designs by James H. Dakin were chosen in a competition on May 5, 1847. The city of Baton Rouge donated a plot of land situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River to the state on September 7 for the construction of the new capitol. Dakin's design for the capitol consisted of a \\"castellated\\" Gothic Revival building, a rarity for government buildings in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on December 1, 1849 in what was planned to be a grand ceremony. However, a devastating fire in Baton Rouge a week prior saw the funds reallocated as aid for the victims, which was deemed a \\"more worthy cause\\". Despite the Old State Capitol being considered the best example of Gothic Revival architecture in the South, Mark Twain recounted from his time as a steamboat pilot that it was \\"pathetic\\" and likely the result of the \\"medieval romances\\" of Sir Walter Scott. With the start of the Civil War in 1861, and the occupation of both New Orleans and Baton Rouge by the Union Army, the location of the state government was moved to Opelousas in 1862, and then to Shreveport in 1864. The portion of Louisiana that was occupied by Union troops was governed out of New Orleans. The vacant Old State Capitol was originally used as a prison by the Union Army and, then, as a garrison for its colored troops. On December 28, 1862, it was gutted by an accidental fire. After the war, the state government returned to New Orleans and utilized a mechanics' institute as a meeting place until the state purchased an old hotel in 1875. The State Legislature appropriated money to rebuild the Old State Capitol in 1880; William A. Freret was placed in charge of the reconstruction. Under Freret, the capitol's famous spiral staircase and stained glass dome were added, as well as a fourth floor. The State Legislature returned to Baton Rouge, after the completion of the renovations, on May 8, 1882. = Current State Capitol = The new capitol lit up at night in 1932 By the 1920s, the Old State Capitol was starting to show its age and proving to be too small for the expanding state government. Proposals were drawn up for a new building, but were never acted upon due to the lack of money and more important issues. In 1928, Huey Long was elected Governor of Louisiana as a populist candidate. Long seized upon the idea of using a new capitol as a way to symbolize the end of the \\"political domination of Louisiana's traditional social and economic elite\\" in the state. In January 1930, Long secured funds from the Board of Liquidation, enabling him to hire architects to design the new capitol and approached Leon C. Weiss with the proposal; Weiss' architectural firm Weiss, Dreyfous and Seiferth was well known for its many public buildings it had designed in Louisiana. By using funds that he controlled to start the design work, Long prevented the State Legislature from stopping the construction of the capitol. The designs for the capitol consisted of a modern skyscraper, sited on the former campus of the Louisiana State University, and expected to cost $1 million. In a special session of the State Legislature in September 1930, a bond issue for the final cost of the new capitol--$5 million--was passed despite initial reluctance from some of the legislators By November 1930, the designs for the building were finalized, and, on December 16, construction of the capitol was started. A spur from the nearby Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad to the capitol was also built \\"to facilitate the delivery of the 2,500 carloads of necessary materials\\". Work on the building progressed rapidly due to the insistence by Long that it be completed under his governorship. Long, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1930, delayed taking the oath of office until January 1932 to prevent a political adversary from becoming governor. Despite being completed in little over a year, the State Capitol was not dedicated until May 16, 1932, during the inauguration of Governor Oscar K. Allen. On September 8, 1935, Huey Long was assassinated in the State Capitol by Dr. Carl Weiss. Weiss, in turn, was gunned down shortly thereafter by members of the Louisiana State Police acting as Long's bodyguards. His alleged motivation for the attack was that his father-in-law, Judge Benjamin Pavy, was going to be gerrymandered out of office by Long. Long lingered for two days at the nearby Our Lady of the Lake Hospital before he died on September 10\\\\. His body lay in state at the State Capitol where approximately 100,000 people--some from as far away as Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas--paid their respects. On September 13, Long was interred on the grounds in front of the Capitol. In 1938, the State Legislature appropriated $50,000 to replace Long's original gravemarker, a simple tombstone, with a more monumental one; two years later, a marble pedestal surmounted by a bronze statue was erected. On April 26, 1970, a bomb consisting of \\"twenty to sticks of dynamite\\" was detonated in the Senate Chamber. The bomb was an apparent retaliation for the shootings of three African Americans by the police; a second bomb exploded at a Baton Rouge country club. A pencil remains embedded in the ceiling of the chamber from the force of the explosion. The Louisiana State Capitol was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 12, 1982.  Exterior  Closeup of the tower's cupola and beacon The inspiration to reject the traditional \\"rotunda-dome-and- wing\\" capitol when designing Louisiana's came from Nebraska. At the time, the Nebraska State Capitol, designed by Bertram Goodhue, was under construction and was the first that was a modern skyscraper instead of traditionally being modeled on the United States Capitol. Despite the inefficiencies of floor space in early skyscrapers due to the presence of elevator shafts, Huey Long insisted that his capitol be a tower. The Louisiana State Capitol has 34 stories and is tall, making it the tallest capitol in the United States. Currently, it is also the tallest building in Baton Rouge and the seventh tallest in Louisiana. The Capitol's facade was constructed out of limestone from Alabama and is decorated with many sculptures and reliefs, and includes much of Louisiana's symbols and its history. A frieze designed by Ulric Ellerhusen runs along the top of the tower's base, at the fifth floor, depicting the actions of Louisianans in wartime and peace, from colonization to World War I. Between each pilaster on the outside of the House and Senate chambers is one of twenty-two square portraits of important persons in Louisiana history. The portraits were divided up among several New Orleans sculptors: Angela Gregory worked on eight, Albert Reiker on six, John Lachin and Rudolph Parducci jointly on six, and Juanita Gonzales completed two. The front doors to the Capitol are reached by a \\"monumental stairway\\" consisting of 49, Minnesota granite steps. Each step has engraved the name of a U.S. state in the order of its statehood; Alaska and Hawaii, which were admitted after the completion of the Capitol, are both on the last step along with the phrase \\"E pluribus unum\\". Flanking both sides of the stairs are free-standing, limestone sculptures by Lorado Taft entitled Pioneers and Patriots, respectively, memorializing both the early settlers and defenders of Louisiana. On either side of the front doors are reliefs designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman depicting allegorical scenes of government providing \\"protection and encouragement...to the welfare of its people.\\" Contrasting with Weinmans's reliefs is Lee Lawrie's flatter architrave that frames the doors and portal; the architrave more closely resembles the style of ancient Egyptian reliefs. The tower itself is relatively unadorned until the 21st floor, where the square tower starts to transition to an octagonal shape. Four allegorical busts representing Law, Science, Philosophy and Art are carved into the corners of the tower reaching from the 22nd to the 25th floor. The cupola, originally referred to as a \\"temple\\", is dominated by large windows on all four sides, each topped with a pediment. Four stone eagles act as flying buttresses from the top of the cupola to the beacon atop the tower. The State Capitol is topped with a lantern \\"symbolizing the higher aspirations of Louisiana.\\" = Gardens = Gravemarker and statue of Huey Long The Louisiana Capitol Garden comprises , the majority of which are laid out to the south and east of the capitol. The landscaping of the grounds was overseen by the capitol's architect Leon Weiss and was installed by Jungle Gardens on Avery Island. The gardens flora include azaleas, camellias and magnolias--the state flower of Louisiana. Many live oaks were also transported to Baton Rouge; a few oaks, which were already present and were incorporated into the gardens, are over 200 years old. The of sidewalks in the grounds are all lined with boxwood hedges. The south park is square and is divided by two sidewalks extending from the capitol parking lot to Boyd Avenue. In its center is an arrangement of cris-crossing walks where the remains of Huey Long are interred; marking the spot is a monument, including the bronze statue of Long, designed by Charles Keck. The grounds east of the capitol are less formal with \\"clusters of evergreens, palms, and small flower garden.\\" The sidewalks east of the capitol end at the Old Arsenal, which has a rose garden in front of it.  Interior  The Louisiana State Capitol houses the chambers for the Louisiana House of Representatives, the Louisiana State Senate and, the office of the Governor of Louisiana and several other state offices. Huey Long had an apartment installed for his use on the 24th floor under the impression that the altitude would help alleviate his \\"hay fever\\". An observation deck, complete with a gift shop, is located on the 27th floor allowing views of Baton Rouge and the Mississippi River. = Memorial Hall = The front entrance to the capitol opens directly into the four-story, rectangular Memorial Hall. The Hall is long and wide; it is often referred to as a \\"rotunda\\" despite not being round as it takes the place of one in a traditional domed capitol. Embedded in the floor, in the center of Memorial Hall, is a bronze plaque in diameter and weighing . The plaque depicts a relief map of Louisiana showing parish boundaries and seats, industries and exports, and the flora and fauna of Louisiana. Mounted on the balcony over the elevator banks are the flags of the entities that have held dominion over Louisiana. = House and Senate Chambers = Louisiana Senate Chamber The chambers for the Louisiana House of Representatives and State Senate, along with Memorial Hall, make up the majority of the capitol's broad base. The Louisiana House of Representatives and the Louisiana Senate meet here for 120 days during a regular session to make bills and either vote them into law or kill them.  In popular culture  The 1975 television film The Deadly Tower, depicting the shootings at the University of Texas at Austin in 1966 by Charles Whitman, was filmed at the Louisiana State Capitol. The film was unable to use the actual tower in Austin. Instead, the capitol, which bore a similar appearance and whose grounds have a similar layout, was used. The Louisiana State Capitol, especially the bronze plaque in Memorial Hall, is featured heavily in the 2006 film adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's novel All the King's Men. The novel itself was thought to be inspired by the life and assassination of Huey Long. Featured in the opening scene pep rally of the 1988 film Everybody's All-American (film) with the John Goodman character climbs up the Huey Long statue.

It was developed by Jeffery Goldberg, PhD. who left Bell Labs after using Unix and became VP of engineering for Charles River Data Systems (CRDS), now defunct. UNOS was written to capitalize on the first 32-bit microprocessor, the Motorola 68k central processing unit (CPU). CRDS sold a UNOS based 68K system, and sold porting services and licenses to other manufacturers who had embedded CPUs. History Jeff Goldberg created an experimental OS using only eventcounts for synchronization, that allowed a preemptive kernel, for a Charles River Data Systems (CRDS) PDP-11. CRDS hired Goldberg to create UNOS and began selling it in 1981. UNOS was written for the Motorola 68000 series processors. While compatible with Version 7 Unix, it is also an RTOS. CRDS supported it on the company's Universe 68 computers, as did Motorola's Versabus systems. CRDS's primary market was OEMs embedding the CRDS unit within a larger pile of hardware, often requiring better real-time response than Unix could deliver. UNOS has a cleaner kernel interface than UNIX in 1981. There was e.g., a system call to obtain ps information instead of reading /dev/kmem. UNOS required memory protection, with the 68000 using an MMU developed by CRDS; and only used Motorola MMUs after UNOS 7 on the 68020 (CRDS System CP20) (using the PMMU (MC68851 PMMU)). UNOS was written in the programming languages C and assembly language, and supported Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, and Business Basic. Limits UNOS from CRDS never supported paged VM and multiprocessor support had not been built in from the start, so the kernel remained mostly single- threaded on the few multiprocessor systems built. A UNOS variant enhanced by H. Berthold AG under the name vBertOS added demanded page loading and paged processes in 1984, but was given up in favor of SunOS because of the missing GUI and the missing networking code in Spring 1985, when Berthold imported the first Sun to Europe.

He was Minister of the Interior from 15 March 1850 to 24 January 1851, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 10 April 1851 to 26 October 1851, President of the Conseil d'√âtat from 30 December 1852, briefly Minister of Foreign Affairs again from 4 January 1860 to 24 January 1860, Minister without portfolio from 3 December 1860, and Minister of Justice (and of Public Worship) from 23 June 1863 to 17 July 1869. Born to a family of shopkeepers, Baroche received his baccalaur√©at in 1820 and pursued a legal education, becoming a lawyer in 1823. He became moderately well-known and somewhat notorious as a lawyer, particularly in his pleadings before the Cours des pairs (Court of Peers). He defended former Defense Minister Am√©d√©e Louis Despans-Cubi√®res from corruption charges before the peers in 1847. Baroche ran for office unsuccessfully in Seine-et-Oise in 1840, 1842 and 1846, finally winning a National Assembly seat in Charente-Inf√©rieure in 1847. He strongly opposed the government of Fran√ßois Guizot and took part in its overthrow. A sincere republican during the 1848 revolution, he represented Charente- Inf√©rieure at the constituent assembly of the Second Republic. After 1848, however, he became associated with right wing politics and particularly with the purge of leftist and royalist judges from the French courts and with the defense of the many press censorship laws passed as the republic became increasingly authoritarian. He resigned his ministry in 1851 in a disagreement with French president Louis Napoleon, and he refused to participate in the coup d'√©tat of 14 January 1852 that established the Second Empire, but became president of the Conseil d'√âtat in December of the same year, remaining in that powerful post for most of the next decade. Following liberal reforms in 1860, Napoleon III appointed Baroche to a ministry without portfolio, while he was still president of the Conseil d'√âtat, in order to shore up his support in parliament. Baroch's appointment to the Ministry of Justice was his principal role in the 1860s, but in the end, as the political tide turned against the Empire, he declined in popularity and was dismissed by the Emperor in 1869, although he appointed Baroche to the French Senate. Nonetheless, Baroche was so closely linked to the Empire and its repressive policies that, like many other high-ranking officials in the imperial government, he fled to Great Britain as the Second Empire crumbled, dying shortly afterwards on the island of Jersey.

The rails have an 'L' cross- section and the wheels have no flange. A plateway is an early kind of railway, tramway or wagonway, where the rails are made from cast iron. They were mainly used for about 50 years up to 1830, though some continued later. Plateways consisted of \\"L\\" shaped rails where a flange on the rail guided the wheels in contrast to edgeways, where flanges on the wheels guide it along the track. Plateways were originally horsedrawn, but cable haulage and small, light locomotives were sometimes used later on. The plates of the plateway were made of cast iron, often cast by the ironworks that were their users. On most lines this system was replaced by rolled wrought iron (and later steel) \\"edge rails\\", which along with realignment to increase the radius of curves converted them to modern railways better suited to locomotive operation. Plateways were particularly favoured in South Wales and the Forest of Dean, in some cases replacing existing edge rails. Other notable plateways included the Hay Railway, the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway, the Surrey Iron Railway, the Derby Canal Railway, the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, the Portreath Tramroad in Cornwall and lines at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire.  Plates and rails  A reconstructed section of flangeway track as used by Richard Trevithick's pioneering locomotives at Coalbrookdale and Merthyr The plates of a plateway generally rested on stone blocks or sleepers, which served to spread the load over the ground, and to maintain the gauge (the distance between the rails or plates). The plates were usually made from cast iron and had differing cross sections depending on the manufacturer. They were often very short, typically about long, able to stretch only from one block to the next. The L section plateway was introduced for underground use by John Curr of Sheffield Park Colliery in about 1787. Joseph Butler of Wingerworth near Chesterfield, constructed a line using similarly flanged plates in 1788. A leading advocate of plate rails was Benjamin Outram whose first line was from quarries at Crich to Bullbridge Wharf on the Cromford Canal. The early plates were prone to break so different cross sections were employed, such as a second flange underneath. Some lines later introduced chairs to support the plates on the blocks and wrought iron plates, increasing the length to 6 ft and later 9 ft, spanning several sleeper blocks William Jessop had used edge rails cast in three foot lengths, with \\"fish-bellying\\" to give greater strength along the length of the rail on a line between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. However, after he became a partner in Benjamin Outram and Company (Butterley Iron Works) he designed the Surrey Iron Railway and the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway as plateways. = Combined plate and rail = An alternative design with the flange on the outside designed to be additionally used with flanged wheels was unsuccessfully trialed on the Monmouthshire Canal Company's line shortly before reconstruction as a modern railway. This idea was taken up in 1861 by the Toronto streetcar system. Horsecars ran on the upper, outer part as edgerail with the wheel flanges on the inside. The edge rail formed an outside flange for a broad foot which allowed wagons to pass through the unmade streets. This combination necessitated a unique broader gauge of known as the Toronto gauge.  Operations  The early plateways were usually operated on a toll basis, with any rolling stock owner able to operate their wagons on the tracks. Sometimes the plateway company was forbidden to operate its own wagons, so as to prevent a monopoly situation arising. Some plateways such as the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway were single track with passing loops at frequent intervals. The single track sections were arranged so that wagon drivers could see from one loop to the next, and wait for oncoming traffic if necessary. However others such as the Surrey Iron Railway, the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and the Monmouthshire Canal Company's tramroads and the Severn and Wye Railway were wholly or partly double track.  Advantages and disadvantages  Plateways tended to get obstructed by loose stones and grit leading to wear. Edgeways avoid the stone obstruction problem. Stone blocks had an advantage over timber sleepers in that they left the middle of the track unhindered for the hooves of horses. Timber sleepers had an advantage over stone blocks in that they prevented the track from spreading, the gauges of some tramroads increased by a couple of inches after decades of horses passing up the middle, but being loose on the axles the wheels could usually be adjusted slightly with washers. Level crossings could be made truly level, the carts being re- engaged with the flanges once across the roadway.  Antecedents  Even older than plateways were wagonways which used wooden rails. Despite its ancient appearance, the Haytor Granite Tramway, the track with ledges cut in stone blocks to produce a similar effect as tram plates, was contemporary with plateways, being built in 1820.

Instead reserves will be provided on demand at the bank rate set by the central bank. This inverts the mainstream textbook money multiplier relationship between deposits and loans since loans are said to cause deposits which in turn cause reserves. Horizontalism influenced monetary circuit theorists to develop the endogenous money approach that was already nascent within post-Keynesian academic thought. It states that an increasing demand for loans by bank customers leads to banks making more loans and creating more deposits, without regard to the size of the bank's available reserves.

This trilogy is a sequel to the standalone novel Neverness (1988).Charles N. Brown. \\"David Zindell: Back to Roots\\" (excerpt), Locus, v44:6 No.473 June 2000. Retrieved on 2000-09-07. The series has been described as containing \\"the most striking writing, vivid spectacles, memorable characters, and insightful presentations of philosophy and religion seen in SF for many a year.\\" Some reviewers have commented on similarities between the series and Frank Herbert's Dune. BooksThe Broken God= Set 10 years after the events in Neverness, and narrated by its protagonist, Mallory Ringess, this book tells the story of the early life of Danlo, Ringess's son. After the tribe he is living with is destroyed by a plague, he undertakes a perilous journey to Neverness City, where he is taken in and instructed by an alien Fravashi (\\"Old Father\\"), and joins the Academy in order to become a pilot like his father. A new religion forms around the various tales told about Mallory Ringess, and Danlo comes into conflict with his former friend, Hanuman li Tosh, who assumes control of the \\"Way of Ringess\\" for his own purposes. =The Wild= Danlo's story continues as he explores the galaxy on a dual quest: first, to locate the home of the Architects of the Universal Cybernetic Church and persuade them to stop the Program of Increase that has resulted in the continual explosions of stars in the Vild (or Wild); and second, to find the cure for the engineered plague that killed his tribe (the Devaki) and will kill the rest of the primitive Alaloi back on Neverness. Like his father, Danlo penetrates the Solid State Entity and interacts with her. Based on her information, he seeks out a remnant of the great cybernetic god Ede. With Ede's help, Danlo at last reaches the distant planet of Tannahill, home of the Architects. His coming sparks a bloody war between various factions. The defeated faction escapes with a star-killer weapon, headed for Neverness. =War in Heaven= Danlo rejoins the pilots who were commissioned to find Tannahill and discovers that Hanuman li Tosh has taken dictatorial control over Neverness, and has begun construction of his \\"Universal Computer.\\" Fearing that this will excite the anger of the galaxy's other cybernetic \\"gods,\\" the rest of the pilots mobilize the Civilized Worlds in a great war. Danlo returns alone to Neverness and, after a series of adventures, succeeds in toppling Hanuman, restoring order, and pointing the way for the rest of humanity to counteract the gods' power by realizing its full potential. CharactersHistory=Arcite Then known as the Order of Scientists, the Order of Mystic Mathematicians and Other Seekers of the Ineffable Flame was first founded on the ice world Arcite some time before the Vastening of Ede the God. This marks the year zero on the Order's Calendar. It was founded by Kelkemesh, then known as Rowan Madeus or the Timekeeper. A student of the Fravashi, Omar Narayama brought many new ideas that spelled the demise of the Order of Scientists and developed the Universal Syntax, that made holism begin to permeate and supersede science. The Order of Scientists became the new Order, and moved to Neverness on the planet Icefall 20 years later. Icefall Over time, the Order of Cetics on Simoom and other groups merged with the Order. Under the watchful eye of many Timekeepers (who, in fact, were actually the same person), the Order became an interworld educational institution, with schools spread throughout the human areas of the galaxy, with of course the prime academy at Neverness. The most glamorous and respected discipline of the order was the Pilots, and hence it was sometimes referred to as the Order of Pilots, but it also included many other disciplines (\\"More disciplines, it seems, each year\\"). 2934 years since the founding of Neverness, Mallory Ringess lead a schism against the conservative Timekeeper's rule. Leopold Soli was sent to combat this, thus beginning the Pilots War. After intervention by the Solid State Entity (a.k.a. Kalinda of Qallar), Mallory proves the second continuum hypothesis, thus earning Soli's respect and ending the war. They return to confront the Timekeeper and Mallory is made Lord Pilot. When the Timekeeper is confronted it turns out to be a double. The double explodes a hydrogen bomb in an attempt to destroy the city but it was too old. The genuine Timekeeper had already fled the city. Mallory Ringess is briefly made Lord of the Order before departing mysteriously. The Order then goes under a massive restructuring, and is ruled by consortium of the major Lords of the disciplines. After Danlo wi Soli Ringess comes to Neverness, the prevalence of Ringism under Hanuman Li Tosh grows greatly and Lord Pall, head cetic, uses his manipulative powers to make Ringism the official religion of the Order, thus installing him as the new Lord of the Order. Hanuman Li Tosh, however, controls Lord Pall. Many Lords and Masters who were not converts to the new religion were sent to found a new Order on Theills, a planet deep in the Vild. After the Danlo wi Soli Ringess poses as Mallory Ringess and uproots ringism by killing Hanuman, the Universal Computer is destroyed and Bardo, Mallory's old friend, is made Lord Pilot and Lord of the Order. = Disciplines =Major disciplines These are the main branches of study at the Order's academies. While novices not yet having specialized in a discipline wears grey-coloured formal clothing, the clothes of specialized students varies; each discipline having its own particular colour. *Pilots - Able to manipulate the \\"manifold\\" utilizing pure mathematical theorems coupled with technology, thus warping spacetime to travel vast distances in \\"lightships\\". The colour of the pilots' robes are black. *Cetics - Advanced computational programmers concerned with the nature, function and principles pertaining to consciousness. Their hard and rather controversial studies‚Äîresulting from long traditions of research‚Äîhas given rise to a few odd and specific disciplines, like reading human emotion and thought from faces, and making tentative predictions of conscious/subconscious processes. Treated with wariness and superstition by many, a specific branch of Cetics known as cyber-shamans wear skullcaps, enabling them to continually interface with a computer. There are many different sects of Ceticism, as the Cetics were once their own Order. The colour of the cetic robes are orange. *Scryers - Dressed in white robes and usually with their eyes removed, the Scryers are able to perceive the future possibilities. They are often regarded with contempt, particularly by Leopold Soli, and they frequently use half- sentences and confusing language. Scryers' robes are pearl-white. *Remembrancers - These people are reverse-scryers. Many believe they are of the same basic discipline, but there are numerous differences. Some remembrancers are not only able to remember early memories of themselves, but are also able to remember the memories of their ancestors or even the legendary Ieldra, creators of the universe. The robes of the remembrancers are brown. *Akashics - Whereas the cetics study conscious processes(\\"programs\\") and the principles where artificial programming and consciousness meet, the akashics focus on how information is stored in the human brain, using computers to create holograms of the human brain and extracting information, should the need arise. The akashics wear yellow robes. *Horologes - These people are associated with the keeping of time and time-devices. The Timekeeper, Lord of the Order for over two thousand years, was always the Lord Horologe. The robes of the horologes are red. *Tinkers - Tinkers devote themselves to the basic study of physics and engineering. They are responsible for realizing technological advancements. Aside from simply building/designing things, Tinkers also‚Äîtogether with the Programmers‚Äîare responsible for the design and creation of the pilots' lightships. Their robes are green. *Eschatologists - Devoted to the study of galactic gods, such as the Solid State Entity, and the study of events throughout galactic history pointing towards humanity's purpose and destiny, should there be one. In their studies, they also concern themselves with the classification of other beings, based on their progress towards Divinity, or \\"godhood\\". *Holists - People who study the sixth mentality of Man, holism, creating connections with all things, and claiming that the essence of everything is in everything. They are fairly involved in the study of the Universal Syntax among other things. *Ecologists - People who study life and its associated objects. *Programmers - Those who study the discipline of computational management of information; programming tutelary robots as well as defining the electronic neurologics found in numerous utilities and computers. These synthetical neurologics are made by growing diamond-like crystals into complex circuitry, used in almost all electronics of the time (and especially in the pilots' lightships). *Cantors - Those who dedicate themselves to the study of pure mathematics for its own sake. Their robes are grey in colour. *Historians - Those who are devoted to the study of history. Examples of cults and professions found elsewhere in the Order's vicinity *Imprimaturs - Although all Imprimaturs are also Akashics, Imprimaturs have less prestige. They are able to implant knowledge and memory by hardwiring synapses in the brain. *Cutters - Those who shape the body to suit various purposes. *Autists - Those who believe in the world as a huge dream and eternally stay in \\"dreamspace\\". *Phantasts - Similar to Autists, Phantasts are believed to work in the realms of illusion and dream. Other Disciplines * Neologicans At 2929 years since the founding of Neverness, there were one hundred and eighteen disciplines in the Order, however this number fluctuated rapidly throughout the years. The Phantast discipline, for example, was not created until many years later. =Progression= There are many Order Schools throughout the arm of the galaxy. Humans travel from abroad to be educated at these schools as they are regarded as the best places for a thorough education. The best of these schools then go to the Elite Schools on planets such as Catava and Farfara. The best of these Elite Schools are then permitted into the Novice Academy, Borja, at Neverness (and later Thiells), and then later into the Resa Academy. Some lucky petitioners are harshly trialed and are allowed direct access to the Novice academy without entering the earlier stages. Ede The God Ede The God, also known as Nikolos Daru Ede, is said to have copied his consciousness directly into a large computer he calls \\"The Eternal Computer\\". The Architects of the Universal Cybernetic Churches believe that he has attained Godhood through this and, according to the Cybernetic Doctrine of Totality, eventually the Ede-Computer will grow to encompass the whole universe and the universe, being a large computer itself, will reach halt state, this is known as the Doctrine of the Halting and also as the (Tiplerean) Omega Point, and that all architects would participate in the rebuilding of the galaxy at the end of time. This was not the belief of Ede himself, rather his assistant Ivi Olorun proscribed doctrine and founded the church, the chief doctrine of which is \\"Ede is God, and God he shall be, and there shall only be one God.\\" Ede The God was destroyed by the Silicon God in The Wild. Ede is supposed to have been an ally of Kalinda of Qallar. The Silicon God had presented Ede the God with a gift, a beautiful, horribly realistic simulation of how the galaxy (indeed, the entire universe) could be, and within this simulation there was viral programming that infected Ede until the last nanosecond of his existence, when he reduced himself and cut away all nonessential elements of his godly nature, to preserve himself as photons (radio). A cut-down version of his personality after his supposed death was preserved in an Architect's Devotionary computer, that is held by Danlo wi Soli Ringess on his journeys to find the planet Tannahill and recover Ede's lost human body. The Silicon God The Silicon God was an experiment by the technicians at Fostora, to build a self-programming and self-aware computer, that is not possessing human consciousness, unlike Ede the God and Kalinda of Qallar. Once the computer was started, it opened a window into the manifold and disappeared immediately. When it was rediscovered by the Order of Mystic Mathematicians and Other Keepers of the Inneffable Flame in the Deva Cluster, it had expanded to gigantic proportions and was making war against the other Gods, including Chimene, Kalinda of Qallar, and Ede the God. He developed a unique information virus that appealed to Ede's vanity, thus forcing Ede to store his remaining personality in a tiny Architect's Devotionary computer, that the Silicon God could not track. The God is considered to be evil. It makes war against Kalinda of Qallar, the April Colonial Intelligence and Ede the God. The April Colonial Intelligence The April Colonial Intelligence was the result of a human-engineered nanorobotic bacterium, that was used for the intelligent design and construction of buildings. The bacterium got so out of hand that its reproductive cycle caused it to overrun the entire planet it was inhabiting, against the covenants of the Order of Mystic Mathematicians and Other Keepers of the Inneffable Flame. This bacterium went on to occupy most of the April Cluster, forming a gigantic colonial intelligence. The only Pilot from the Order of Mathematicians to survive entering this cluster was The Richardess, a friend of Danlo wi Soli Ringess, who also knew Mallory Ringess.

The array consists of six telescopes operating as an astronomical interferometer. Construction was completed in 2003. CHARA is owned by Georgia State University (GSU).  Functionality  CHARA‚Äôs six telescopes each have a one-meter diameter mirror to reflect light. They are spread across Mount Wilson to increase the angular resolution of the array. Each of the six telescopes provides a different image, to combine it into one image the light from each telescope is transported through vacuum tubes and fed into a single beam, where they are matched up to within one micron. This process is called interferometry, and allows the array to have the same resolving power as a telescope with a 330-meter mirror, and an angular resolution of 200 micro-arcseconds.  History  In 1984 CHARA was founded, and with financial support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), in 1985 planning for the array began. Construction for the array started on July 13, 1996, and with $6.3 million awarded to GSU by the NSF, and the same amount matched by GSU, going towards the effort. In July 1998, GSU was awarded another $1.5 million by W.M. Keck Foundation, which allowed for a sixth telescope to be added to the previously planned five. With a final gift of $574,000 from David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the funding for the array was completed in October 1998. After another five years of construction, the CHARA array was completed in 2003. In April of the same year, CHARA was awarded a 3-year grant to support scientific programs at the center, which was renewed in 2006. In 2013 another grant from the NSF worth 3.6 million was given to the Center. Observatories throughout the world have come to CHARA to test beam combining technology.  Discoveries  Animation showing the Beta Lyrae eclipsing binary, using images from the CHARA array On January 15, 2007, the diameter of an exoplanet was measured directly, using CHARA. This was achieved by using the observed angular diameter of the star that the planet orbited, and the already known distance of the star from Earth, to get the diameter of the star. With this they could calculate the diameter of the exoplanet when comparing its size to the star when it passed in front of it. This was the first time the diameter of an exoplanet was directly measured, and returned a value slightly different than that obtained from indirect, more conventional methods. In 2013 CHARA was used to capture images showing the starspots on Zeta Andromedae, a star 181 light years away. This was the first time that images of starspots on stars other than our Sun has been taken. CHARA directly observed binary stars, such as Beta Lyrae and Algol. CHARA directly imaged multiple stars, such as Regulus, Rasalhague, Altair, Alderamin and Beta Cassiopeiae to measure the flattened shape of these rapidly rotating stars. Because the equator is further from the center of the star, it will appear cooler than the poles, an effect called gravity darkening. The CHARA array can also resolve the circumstellar disks around Be-stars and measure the disk precession variations.  Events  CHARA holds annual science meetings where recent advancements in science and technologies relevant to the array are discussed. The center also gives access to the array to the astronomical community using the National Optical Astronomy Observatory peer review system for around 50 nights per year. They also have periodic community workshops.

According to the San Diego Union-Tribune Paulus was about 35 years old. The troops he commanded at Camp Whitehorse were all reservists. =Death of Nagem Hatab= Several hundred POWs passed through Camp Whitehorse. One of them, Nagem Hatab, died on or around June 5, 2003. Hatab was captured for an alleged role in the March 23, 2003 ambush of the 507th Maintenance Battalion in An Nasiriyah that resulted in the deaths of 9 U.S. soldiers and the capture of Private Jessica Lynch. He was only in custody for about three days. Unlike the other detainees who were at Camp Whitehorse, Hatab refused to communicate with the Marine translator at the detention facility, which led to a later misperception of his condition. Moreover, Paulus had been informed by the Marine Human Intelligence Exploitation Team who interrogated Hatab his first day in confinement that it was unlikely that Hatab would cooperate with his captors. On June 5 he began to display listless behavior, first appearing unstable on his feet then lying down and soiling himself, becoming covered in excrement. As other prisoners had been known to exhibit false signs of faking physical distress, it was unclear if Hatab's behavior was legitimate, and his failure to communicate with the Marine translator compounded the situation. Paulus ordered one of his Marines to haul Hatab out of the common cell to where he could be hosed off. He ordered his soiled clothes removed and burned, and for him to be placed in an outside wire enclosure so his loss of bowel control wouldn't soil the other prisoners' living and eating areas. A medical corpsman examined Hatab at approximately 5pm, and reported to Paulus that options for Hatab's condition included that he may have suffered a heart attack. However, the medic said Hatab's vital signs were normal and therefore he should be left under observation. (Hatab's autopsy report confirmed he did not suffer a heart attack.) Because the detention facility had no replacement clothing Hatab was left outside naked that evening. At midnight Hatab was found dead. A post-mortem alleged that Hatab had haemorrhaged and suffocated because his hyoid bone had been broken. The hyoid break allegedly occurred when the Marine Paulus had ordered to remove Hatab from the general living area dragged him out. Hatab would not stand so he was hauled by the Marine who cupped his hands under the man's chin, dragging him to the wire enclosure. Once in the enclosure, Hatab was cleaned off, provided food and water and left under direct observation of one of the Marine guards. The entire episode occurred with Major Paulus's commanding officer present. According to the Houston Chronicle: :\\"Lieutenant Colonel Kathleen Ingwersen of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology noted the body had extensive bruising and found seven cracked or fractured ribs. Hatab also had a broken hyoid bone ‚Äî the free-floating, wishbone-shaped bone supporting the tongue. That, she said, caused him to slowly asphyxiate after he was dragged by the neck to a holding pen. She declared the death a homicide.\\"Chilling precursor to Abu Ghraib: Long before scandal erupted, Nasiriyah death ruled a homicide, Houston Chronicle, July 31, 2004 Medical testimony for the defense stated that there was nothing clear about the autopsy photo of the hyoid bone and that Ingwersen's autopsy report contradicted her final conclusions. For example, her autopsy report showed Hatab's larynx was not bruised. When confronted with this Ingersen flatly replied that on that point the autopsy report was mistaken. According to the North County Times Ingwersen said Hatab's was not the usual kind of suffocation‚Äîthat his death would have spanned hours.Death of Iraqi prisoner topic of military hearing, North County Times, January 28, 2004 When pressed by Paulus' lawyers to present medical literature supporting her theory of death Ingwersen admitted there was none but that she stood by her findings. Court martial Maj. Paulus was charged with negligent homicide, aggravated assault, abetting an assault, maltreatment, false official statement and dereliction of duty and went through a preliminary hearing in January 2004 to determine if he should be referred to a court martial. The presiding judge, Colonel William Gallo, heard all evidence presented by the prosecution and defense. At the conclusion of the Article 32 hearing Gallo recommended to then-Major General James Mattis, Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division and presiding officer, that the negligent homicide, assault, abetting an assault and false official statement charges be dropped. Col. Gallo's recommendation was for Paulus to receive non-judicial punishment. MajGen Mattis rejected Gallo's recommendation and referred Paulus to a General Court Martial. He also overruled Gallo and keeping the assault charge against Paulus During Paulus's court martial in November 2004 the presiding judge, Colonel Robert Chester, was highly critical when he learned that key prosecution exhibits, including various of Hatab's body parts- specifically the hyoid bone that LTC Ingwersen alleged was broken- were unaccountably missing. Hearing resumes for officer who ran Iraqi prison , Marine Corps Times, October 14, 2004 He threatened \\"extreme measures\\" if Hatab's body parts could not be located. Due to lack of cooperation from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in explaining and locating the missing medical evidence Chester eventually threw out all medical testimony from the case, despite the fact that the case stemmed from LTC Ingwersen's questionable autopsy report and unsupported theory of Hatab's death. The treatment of Hatab's body did not improve after his death. A United States Navy surgeon, Dr. Ray Santos, testified that when Hatab's body arrived at the morgue: ‚ÄúIt kept slipping from my hands so I did drop it several times.‚Äù The U.S. Army Medical Examiner, Lieutenant Colonel Ingwersen, who performed the autopsy, reportedly acknowledged that Hatab's body had undergone decomposition because it was stored in an unrefrigerated drawer at the An Nasiriyah Hospital before the autopsy. A second Navy doctor, Commander Dennis McKenna, testified that the manner in which Hatab's body was removed from the holding cell would not have caused him bodily harm and would not have been the cause for a hyoid bone fracture. Following this testimony the most serious charge against Paulus, aggravated assault, was dropped by the judge. Paulus was found guilty of maltreatment and dereliction of duty and was administratively dismissed from the service.

Monfalcone means 'falcon mountain' in Italian. It is a major industrial centre for manufacturing ships, airplanes, textiles, chemicals, and refined oil. It is the home of the Fincantieri cruise ship building company. Geography Monfalcone port Monfalcone is the fifth most populous town in Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the main centre of Bisiacaria territory. Joined to its neighbourhoods, it has about 50,000 inhabitants. The town lies between the Karst hills and the Adriatic coast, and it is the northernmost port of the Mediterranean Sea.  History  In prehistoric times the area of Monfalcone housed several fortified villages called castellieri. After the foundation of the Roman city of Aquileia (181 BC), some thermal buildings were created on the hills, known as Insulae Clarae. After Ostrogoth, Byzantine, Lombard, and Frankish domination, Monfalcone was controlled by the Patriarchs of Aquileia starting from 967.Touring Club Italia: Gorizia e provincia: Grado, la laguna, il Collio, Redipuglia, l'Isonzo page 103: \\"...attraverso un ¬´priviliegium imperiale¬ª Ottone I assegn√≤ nel 967 il ¬´vicus Panzani¬ª, primo nucleo abitato della futura Monfalcone, al patriarca di Aquileia.\\"; in English: \\"...through a priviliegium imperiale of the year 967, Otto I granted the territory called vicus Panzani, the original nucleus of the future village of Monfalcone, to the patriarch of Aquileia.\\" The Venetians conquered it in 1420 after three days of siege, keeping it until 1511, when it fell to the French. Conquered back by Venice, it was ravaged by the troops of Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I in 1513, who destroyed the Rocca fortress. In 1521 it was returned to the Republic of Venice, under which it remained until its dissolution by the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. Adria factories in Monfalcone during Austrian bombing in World War I From 1805 it was controlled by the French Empire until the fall of Napoleon in 1814, after which it was included in the Kingdom of Illyria, part of the Austrian Empire. Incorporated into the crown land of Gorizia and Gradisca, it belonged to the Austrian Littoral from 1849. The first shipyards arose from about 1908 onwards, among them the Cantiere Navale Triestino company building steamships for the Austro-Americana Line based in Trieste. During World War I, the town was captured by Italian forces in 1915 and became the rear line during the bloody Battles of the Isonzo, being briefly recaptured by Austria-Hungary after the 1917 Battle of Caporetto, but returning to Italy in 1918. The shipyards were severely damaged by bitter fighting and had to be rebuilt afterwards. During World War II the town was repeatedly bombed and heavily damaged, became a center of the Italian Resistance after the Armistice of Cassibile, and it was briefly occupied by Yugoslav troops at the end of the war.

Closed-loop hydraulics were also substituted for Sparrow's open-loop type, which gave Aspide better downrange maneuverability. This resemblance, and the fact that Selenia was provided with the technology know-how of the AIM-7 (around 1,000 of which it had produced under license), has generally led non-Italian press to refer to the Aspide as a Sparrow variant. However, the Aspide had original electronics and warhead, and a new and more powerful engine. Even the control surfaces are different, replacing the original triangular wings, fixed in the air-to-air and instead foldable in the surface- to-air version, to a newly designed common cropped delta fixed version. Design Aspide, in its various versions, was used both in the air-to-air role, carried by Aeritalia F-104s in the apposite versions F-104S and F-104ASA, and in the surface-to-air naval role. In the latter role it has been replaced by the MBDA Aster. Naval Aspide launchers can be adapted to fire the Sparrow by merely switching a single circuit board. In the mid 1980s, China imported a small batch of the Aspide Mk.1 from Italy, then signed an agreement with Alenia to produce the missile locally under license. In 1989, China produced its first batch of Aspide Mk.1 missiles using imported parts from Italy. However, due to the European Union arms embargo imposed after the Tiananmen Square incident, China was unable to purchase additional Aspide kits. China subsequently developed its own missile family based on the Aspide Mk.1, with surface to air versions designated as the LY-60, and an air-to-air version designated as PL-10. The rocket engine of the Aspide is produced by Turkish missile manufacturer ROKETSAN. Variants * Aspide Mk.1 - Similar to AIM-7E, with Selenia monopulse semi-active seeker and SNIA-Viscosa solid- propellant rocket motor. This version was popular with export customers, and sold to 17 countries. * Aspide Mk.2 - Improved version with active radar- homing seeker. Development was shelved in favor of better missiles, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. * Aspide 2000 - Surface-to-air version of the Aspide Mk.1, used on Italian Army Skyguard and Spada air-defense systems.

Lie groups have many symmetries. Symmetry occurs not only in geometry, but also in other branches of mathematics. Symmetry is a type of invariance: the property that a mathematical object remains unchanged under a set of operations or transformations. Given a structured object X of any sort, a symmetry is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This can occurs in many ways; for example, if X is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a bijective map from the set to itself, giving rise to permutation groups. If the object X is a set of points in the plane with its metric structure or any other metric space, a symmetry is a bijection of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (i.e., an isometry). In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry, many of which are listed in the given points mentioned above. Symmetry in geometry The types of symmetry considered in basic geometry include reflectional symmetry, rotation symmetry, translational symmetry and glide reflection symmetry, which are described more fully in the main article Symmetry (geometry). Symmetry in calculusEven and odd functions=Even functions is an example of an even function. Let f(x) be a real-valued function of a real variable, then f is even if the following equation holds for all x and -x in the domain of f: : f(x) = f(-x) Geometrically speaking, the graph face of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the y-axis. Examples of even functions include , x2, x4, cos(x), and cosh(x). Odd functions is an example of an odd function. Again, let f(x) be a real-valued function of a real variable, then f is odd if the following equation holds for all x and -x in the domain of f: : -f(x) = f(-x) That is, : f(x) + f(-x) = 0 \\\\, . Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin. Examples of odd functions are x, x3, sin(x), sinh(x), and erf(x). =Integrating= The integral of an odd function from ‚àíA to +A is zero, provided that A is finite and that the function is integrable (e.g., has no vertical asymptotes between ‚àíA and A). The integral of an even function from ‚àíA to +A is twice the integral from 0 to +A, provided that A is finite and the function is integrable (e.g., has no vertical asymptotes between ‚àíA and A). This also holds true when A is infinite, but only if the integral converges. =Series= * The Maclaurin series of an even function includes only even powers. * The Maclaurin series of an odd function includes only odd powers. * The Fourier series of a periodic even function includes only cosine terms. * The Fourier series of a periodic odd function includes only sine terms. Symmetry in linear algebraSymmetry in matrices= In linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose (i.e., it is invariant under matrix transposition). Formally, matrix A is symmetric if :A = A^{T}. By the definition of matrix equality, which requires that the entries in all corresponding positions be equal, equal matrices must have the same dimensions (as matrices of different sizes or shapes cannot be equal). Consequently, only square matrices can be symmetric. The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. So if the entries are written as A = (aij), then aij = aji, for all indices i and j. For example, the following 3√ó3 matrix is symmetric: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 7 & 3 7 & 4 & -5 3 & -5 & 6\\\\end{bmatrix} Every square diagonal matrix is symmetric, since all off-diagonal entries are zero. Similarly, each diagonal element of a skew-symmetric matrix must be zero, since each is its own negative. In linear algebra, a real symmetric matrix represents a self-adjoint operator over a real inner product space. The corresponding object for a complex inner product space is a Hermitian matrix with complex-valued entries, which is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, in linear algebra over the complex numbers, it is often assumed that a symmetric matrix refers to one which has real-valued entries. Symmetric matrices appear naturally in a variety of applications, and typical numerical linear algebra software makes special accommodations for them. Symmetry in abstract algebraSymmetric groups= The symmetric group Sn (on a finite set of n symbols) is the group whose elements are all the permutations of the n symbols, and whose group operation is the composition of such permutations, which are treated as bijective functions from the set of symbols to itself.Jacobson (2009), p. 31. Since there are n! (n factorial) possible permutations of a set of n symbols, it follows that the order (i.e., the number of elements) of the symmetric group Sn is n!. =Symmetric polynomials= A symmetric polynomial is a polynomial P(X1, X2, ‚Ä¶, Xn) in n variables, such that if any of the variables are interchanged, one obtains the same polynomial. Formally, P is a symmetric polynomial if for any permutation œÉ of the subscripts 1, 2, ..., n, one has P(XœÉ(1), XœÉ(2), ‚Ä¶, XœÉ(n)) = P(X1, X2, ‚Ä¶, Xn). Symmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view, the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial. Examples In two variables X1 and X2, one has symmetric polynomials such as: * X_1^3+ X_2^3-7 * 4 X_1^2X_2^2 +X_1^3X_2 + X_1X_2^3 +(X_1+X_2)^4 and in three variables X1, X2 and X3, one has as a symmetric polynomial: * X_1 X_2 X_3 - 2 X_1 X_2 - 2 X_1 X_3 - 2 X_2 X_3 \\\\, =Symmetric tensors= In mathematics, a symmetric tensor is tensor that is invariant under a permutation of its vector arguments: :T(v_1,v_2,\\\\dots,v_r) = T(v_{\\\\sigma 1},v_{\\\\sigma 2},\\\\dots,v_{\\\\sigma r}) for every permutation œÉ of the symbols {1,2,...,r}. Alternatively, an rth order symmetric tensor represented in coordinates as a quantity with r indices satisfies :T_{i_1i_2\\\\dots i_r} = T_{i_{\\\\sigma 1}i_{\\\\sigma 2}\\\\dots i_{\\\\sigma r}}. The space of symmetric tensors of rank r on a finite-dimensional vector space is naturally isomorphic to the dual of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree r on V. Over fields of characteristic zero, the graded vector space of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the symmetric algebra on V. A related concept is that of the antisymmetric tensor or alternating form. Symmetric tensors occur widely in engineering, physics and mathematics. =Galois theory= Given a polynomial, it may be that some of the roots are connected by various algebraic equations. For example, it may be that for two of the roots, say A and B, that . The central idea of Galois theory is to consider those permutations (or rearrangements) of the roots having the property that any algebraic equation satisfied by the roots is still satisfied after the roots have been permuted. An important proviso is that we restrict ourselves to algebraic equations whose coefficients are rational numbers. Thus, Galois theory studies the symmetries inherent in algebraic equations. =Automorphisms of algebraic objects= In abstract algebra, an automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself. It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the automorphism group. It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object. Examples * In set theory, an arbitrary permutation of the elements of a set X is an automorphism. The automorphism group of X is also called the symmetric group on X. * In elementary arithmetic, the set of integers, Z, considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a ring, however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any abelian group, but not of a ring or field. * A group automorphism is a group isomorphism from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group G there is a natural group homomorphism G ‚Üí Aut(G) whose image is the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms and whose kernel is the center of G. Thus, if G has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group. * In linear algebra, an endomorphism of a vector space V is a linear operator V ‚Üí V. An automorphism is an invertible linear operator on V. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, the automorphism group of V is the same as the general linear group, GL(V). * A field automorphism is a bijective ring homomorphism from a field to itself. In the cases of the rational numbers (Q) and the real numbers (R) there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of R have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of R (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in R). In the case of the complex numbers, C, there is a unique nontrivial automorphism that sends R into R: complex conjugation, but there are infinitely (uncountably) many \\"wild\\" automorphisms (assuming the axiom of choice). Field automorphisms are important to the theory of field extensions, in particular Galois extensions. In the case of a Galois extension L/K the subgroup of all automorphisms of L fixing K pointwise is called the Galois group of the extension. Symmetry in representation theorySymmetry in quantum mechanics: bosons and fermions= In quantum mechanics, bosons have representatives that are symmetric under permutation operators, and fermions have antisymmetric representatives. This implies the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. In fact, the Pauli exclusion principle with a single-valued many-particle wavefunction is equivalent to requiring the wavefunction to be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric two-particle state is represented as a sum of states in which one particle is in state \\\\scriptstyle x \\\\rangle and the other in state \\\\scriptstyle y\\\\rangle: : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{x,y} A(x,y) x,y\\\\rangle and antisymmetry under exchange means that . This implies that , which is Pauli exclusion. It is true in any basis, since unitary changes of basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric, although strictly speaking, the quantity is not a matrix but an antisymmetric rank-two tensor. Conversely, if the diagonal quantities are zero in every basis, then the wavefunction component: : A(x,y)=\\\\langle \\\\psix,y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi  ( x\\\\rangle \\\\otimes y\\\\rangle ) is necessarily antisymmetric. To prove it, consider the matrix element: : \\\\langle\\\\psi ((x\\\\rangle + y\\\\rangle)\\\\otimes(x\\\\rangle + y\\\\rangle)) \\\\, This is zero, because the two particles have zero probability to both be in the superposition state \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\rangle + y\\\\rangle. But this is equal to : \\\\langle \\\\psi x,x\\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\psi x,y\\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\psi y,x\\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\psi  y,y \\\\rangle \\\\, The first and last terms on the right hand side are diagonal elements and are zero, and the whole sum is equal to zero. So the wavefunction matrix elements obey: : \\\\langle \\\\psix,y\\\\rangle + \\\\langle\\\\psi y,x\\\\rangle = 0 \\\\,. or : A(x,y)=-A(y,x) \\\\, Symmetry in set theorySymmetric relation= We call a relation symmetric if every time the relation stands from A to B, it stands too from B to A. Note that symmetry is not the exact opposite of antisymmetry. Symmetry in metric spacesIsometries of a space= An isometry is a distance- preserving map between metric spaces. Given a metric space, or a set and scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set, an isometry is a transformation which maps elements to another metric space such that the distance between the elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, two geometric figures are congruent if they are related by an isometry: related by either a rigid motion, or a composition of a rigid motion and a reflection. Up to a relation by a rigid motion, they are equal if related by a direct isometry. Isometries have been used to unify the working definition of symmetry in geometry and for functions, probability distributions, matrices, strings, graphs, etc.  Symmetries of differential equations  A symmetry of a differential equation is a transformation that leaves the differential equation invariant. Knowledge of such symmetries may help solve the differential equation. A Line symmetry of a system of differential equations is a continuous symmetry of the system of differential equations. Knowledge of a Line symmetry can be used to simplify an ordinary differential equation through reduction of order. For ordinary differential equations, knowledge of an appropriate set of Lie symmetries allows one to explicitly calculate a set of first integrals, yielding a complete solution without integration. Symmetries may be found by solving a related set of ordinary differential equations. Solving these equations is often much simpler than solving the original differential equations. Symmetry in probability In the case of a finite number of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to permutations (relabelings) implies a discrete uniform distribution. In the case of a real interval of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to interchanging sub-intervals of equal length corresponds to a continuous uniform distribution. In other cases, such as \\"taking a random integer\\" or \\"taking a random real number\\", there are no probability distributions at all symmetric with respect to relabellings or to exchange of equally long subintervals. Other reasonable symmetries do not single out one particular distribution, or in other words, there is not a unique probability distribution providing maximum symmetry. There is one type of isometry in one dimension that may leave the probability distribution unchanged, that is reflection in a point, for example zero. A possible symmetry for randomness with positive outcomes is that the former applies for the logarithm, i.e., the outcome and its reciprocal have the same distribution. However this symmetry does not single out any particular distribution uniquely. For a \\"random point\\" in a plane or in space, one can choose an origin, and consider a probability distribution with circular or spherical symmetry, respectively.

It is charged with the defence of Portugal, in co-operation with other branches of the Armed Forces. With its origins going back to the 12th century, it can be considered as one of the oldest armies in the world. The Portuguese Army is commanded by the Chief of Staff of the Army (CEME), a subordinate of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the operational matters and a direct subordinate of the Ministry of National Defense for all other matters. The CEME is the only officer in the Army with the rank of General (Four-star rank). Presently, the Portuguese Army is an entirely professional force made of career personnel (officers and NCOs) and of volunteer personnel (officers, NCOs and enlisted ranks). Until the early 1990s, conscripts constituted the bulk of the Army personnel, with a cadre of career officers and NCOs responsible for their training. Conscription was however gradually reduced since the middle 1990s, until being finally formally abolished in 2004. As 2014, the Portuguese Army employed 5,667 career personnel and 10,444 volunteers, this representing a total of 16,111 military personnel. Of the total military personnel, 2,669 were officers, 3,917 were NCOs and 9,595 were other ranks. Further, the Army also included 1,897 civilian employees.  Current deployments  National deployed forces = The national deployed forces (for√ßas nacionais destacadas or FND) are units or teams deployed by the Portuguese Armed Forces in foreign missions, mostly in the scope of NATO, the United Nations or the European Union. Currently, the Portuguese Army maintains forces or elements deployed in the following international missions: * Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan * UNAMA in Afghanistan * KFOR in Kosovo * MINUSMA in Mali * Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq * EUTM-Somalia in Uganda * MINUSCA in the Central African Republic =Technical-military cooperation= The technical- military cooperation (coopera√ß√£o t√©cnico-militar or CTM) are the military missions permanently maintained by Portugal in several members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries to train and support their national armed forces. Currently, the Portuguese Army maintains elements deployed in the following CTM missions: * CTM Angola * CTM Cape Verde * CTM Guinea-Bissau * CTM Mozambique * CTM S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe * CTM Timor-Leste History The Portuguese Army has a long history, directly connected to the history of Portugal since its early beginnings. =Middle Ages= The Portuguese Army has its remote origins in the military forces of the County of Portugal that allowed its ruler, Afonso Henriques, to obtain its independence from the Kingdom of Le√≥n and to enlarge its territory in the 12th century. The victory of the Portuguese forces in the Battle of S√£o Mamede, on 24 June 1128, is considered the seminal event for the foundation of the independent Portugal, leading to Afonso Henriques to style himself as Prince. The Portuguese forces were also involved in the Reconquista, successively advancing south to reconquer territories occupied by the Moors and expand the territory of Portugal. On 25 July 1139, the Portuguese troops obtain a spectacular victory over five Moorish kings in the Battle of Ourique, after its end proclaiming Afonso Henriques as King of the Portuguese. Under the Treaty of Zamora, signed on 5 October 1143, Portugal was officially recognized as an independent Kingdom. In 1147, an important step in the Reconquista is done, with the conquest of the city of Lisbon to the moors. The Portuguese part of the Reconquista would finally came to an end in 1249, with the complete recapture of the Algarve. The Portuguese ground forces of that time were initially formed by military contingents provided by the landlords (lords of the manors and of the Church), called the mesnadas. Later, to these were added the knights of the military orders (initially the Knights Templars and later also the knights of the Hospital, of Saint James of the Sword and of Aviz) and the knights of the border towns. These contingents were collectively referred as the Hoste, which was under the supreme command of the Monarch, but who often delegated his command in the Alferes-Mor (High Standard-bearer). These forces also included bands of irregular riders (latrones) of some warlords, which attacked the moor fortresses by surprise, usually taken advante of the night or of the bad weather. Occasionally, for certain military campaigns, like the siege of Lisbon, the Portuguese forces were reinforced by Crusaders from the Northern Europe, who happened to be passing by the Portuguese coasts, on their way to the Holy Land. With the resettling of the territories conquered to the Moors and the establishment of new towns and municipalities, these increased their contribution of municipal contingents of horse (cavaleiros vil√£os) and foot troops. The municipal military service was regulated, with the establishment of a defensive service (apelido), an offensive service (fossado) and the possibility of the replacement of the presential military service by the payment of special taxes (fossadeira). Portuguese victory at the Battle of Aljubarrota In the 14th century, the Portuguese troops defeated Castilian invaders, obtaining a definitive victory in the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. With the independence guaranteed, Portugal then began its worldwide overseas expansion, starting by the conquest of Ceuta in North Africa in 1415. Organization of the Portuguese military developed during the Middle Ages, leading to a more complex structure and the consequent creation of new command offices. Thus, in 1383, the office of Constable of Portugal was created, replacing the Alferes-Mor as the head of the military. The Constable was assisted by the Marshal of Portugal. Other Portuguese important military offices that existed were those of fronteiro-mor (theatre commander of the forces operating in a province), of Coudel-Mor (superintendent of the cavalry) and of Anadel-Mor (superintendent of the shooters). The Anadel-Mor, by himself, superintended the commanders (anad√©is) of the king's crossbowmen, of the horse crossbowmen and of the municipal crossbowmen. =Overseas expansion= With the start of the maritime expansion of Portugal in the 15th century, the country's land forces focused on overseas campaigns intended to conquer new territories in Africa, Asia and the Americas, that would form the Portuguese Empire. Among these many campaigns were the wars for the control of Morocco, the wars with the Ottoman Empire for the control of India and the Indian Ocean, the war with the Persian Empire for the control of the Persian Gulf and participation in the Abyssinian‚ÄìAdal war in support of the Ethiopian Empire. The role of the ground forces was more important in the campaigns of Morocco, that were fought mainly on land. A great part of the other overseas campaigns occurred at sea and so were led by the Portuguese Navy, but the ground forces had also an important role as boarding forces during naval battles and as landing forces in amphibious operations. In Europe, Portuguese ground forces engaged in the War of the Castilian Succession. The Portuguese forces, personally commanded by King Afonso V, in the conquest of Asilah, Morocco Reflecting the importance of the artillery, in 1449, the role of Vedor-Mor da Artilharia (Superintendent of the Artillery) is established by King Afonso V, with the responsibility for the procurement and conservation of the artillery. After a number of previous failed attempts, King Sebastian established the foundations of a standing army, with the creation of the Ordenan√ßas in 1570. The Ordenan√ßas was a militia-type territorial organization aimed to provide a military framework for the Portuguese population and to create a nationwide standardized system of military training and mobilization. It was organized into 250-man companies, each headed by a captain, assisted by an alferes (ensign) and a sergeant. The several Ordenan√ßas companies of a city, town or municipality were grouped into captaincies, each headed by a captain-major, assisted by a sergeant-major. The Ordenan√ßas system would cover virtually all available manpower of Portugal and become part of the basis of the Portuguese military organization until the 19th century. Its efficiency would soon be evidenced by its important contribution to the raising of the expeditionary army that would fight the 1578 Moroccan campaign. During the reign of Sebastian, Portuguese land forces also adopted the ter√ßo (modeled after the Spanish tercio) as its main infantry formation. In 1578, for the Moroccan campaign, four provincial ter√ßos were raised through the Ordenan√ßas system, another one was drawn from young nobles volunteers and a further three were made up of foreign mercenaries. Each of these ter√ßos was made of 12 companies and around 3000 men (pikemen, arquebusiers and musketeers), under the command of a colonel. In respect of the Portuguese cavalry of the time, it included the acorbetados (heavy armored cavalry) and the ginetes (light cavalry). The advanced organization of the Portuguese forces, however, was not sufficient to avoid the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir with the death of the young and childless King Sebastian. His death soon led to the takeover of the Portuguese Crown by Philip II of Spain in 1580, consolidated after the defeat of the Portuguese resistance, led by Ant√≥nio of Portugal, in the War of the Portuguese Succession. These events originated the 60-year-long Iberian Union, period in which the interests of Portugal became subordinated to those of Spain, causing a sharp decline in its economical, political and social might. =Restoration War= With Portugal subject to the Spanish kings, the early 17th century was a period of neglect of the Portuguese military. Portuguese forces were mobilized to fight for Spain in its campaigns in several theatres. By contrast, almost no military support was received from Spain for the defense of the Portuguese Empire, which came under successive attacks by Spain's enemies, in particular the English and the Dutch. As a result, Portugal suffered a series of military set backs, losing several territories in Africa, in Asia and in America. On 1December 1640, the Portuguese revolted and restored their full independence, under the leadership of the Duke of Braganza, who was crowned as King John IV of Portugal. The Portuguese Restoration War then started, with the Portuguese Army defeating the Spanish Army in a series of military campaigns, until achieving the final victory in 1668. At the same time, the Portuguese defeated the Dutch in a series of overseas campaigns, recovering most of its territories in Africa and South America. Partial depiction of the Battle of Montes Claros in a 17th- century azulejo panel at the Palace of Fronteira At the moment of the Restoration of Portuguese independence, the country's ground forces were reduced to around 2000 ill-equipped men. The Ordenan√ßas had been neglected and virtually disappeared. A new military organization had then to be built. By this time, ground forces started to be referred to as the Ex√©rcito (Army). The high command structure of the new military organization had a Council of War (Conselho de Guerra) as the supreme military body of the country. The Monarch delegated most of his military roles in this council, including the responsibility for military organization, commission of officers, military operations planning, building of fortifications and military justice. The role of Captain-General of the Arms of the Kingdom was created to serve as the commander-in-chief of the Army, at the same time presiding over the Council of War. Under the Captain-General, there was a military territorial organization that included a general officer governor of arms for each of the six provinces (Entre-Douro e Minho, Tr√°s-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alentejo and Algarve) and under them, a military governor for each of the 25 comarcas. This system of forces - approved by the Portuguese Cortes (Parliament) in 1642 - had one of the most advanced organizations of the time, including three lines or classes of troops. The organization of the forces established at this time would remain almost unchanged until the disbandment of the Army in 1837, after the end of the Civil War. The first line was made up of the paid troops (professional troops), which included ter√ßos of infantry and independent companies of horse (cuirassiers and carabineers). The paid infantry soldiers were recruited among the cadet sons of all classes, except orphans and farmers, while the soldiers of horse were recruited only among the cadet sons of the nobles, and usually volunteered to serve for six years. The officers were all recruited among the nobles. Initially, 10 paid ter√ßos were raised, besides the already existing ter√ßo of the Navy. With the course of the war, additional paid ter√ßos were raised, with the number fixed at 20, after the end of the conflict. The ter√ßos were the equivalent of the regiments of most of the non-Iberian European armies. Each ter√ßo was commanded by a mestre de campo (equivalent to colonel), assisted by a sergeant-major and a staff, with 10 companies and around 2000 men (pikemen, arquebusiers and musketeers). Despite the existence of plans for the creation of regiments of horse, grouping several companies of horse, these were never implemented and these companies continued to be independent units through the duration of the war. However, for merely tactical purposes, the companies of horse were occasionally grouped in temporary formations (tro√ßos), each under the command of a commissioner general (senior officer of cavalry). The second line was made up of the auxiliary troops that formed the reserve of the Army, being able to assume the same role as the troops of the first line, if necessary. The soldiers of the auxiliary troops were recruited among the orphans, farmers and married men, these only being paid if engaged in campaign. Its officers were taken from the paid troops. Initially, the auxiliary troops were organized in independent companies, several of which were grouped under the command of each of the 25 military governors of comarca. In 1661, the role of governor of comarca was disbanded, with the companies of auxiliary troops being grouped into 25 auxiliary ter√ßos. Finally, the third line was made up of the rebuilt Ordenan√ßas. These were intended to include all the eligible men of the country, serving as a recruitment depot to provide men to the first and second lines of the army. Besides the role of recruitment depots, its units could occasionally be actively employed in the garrison of fortresses or in local defense roles. The Ordenan√ßas continued to follow the organization established by King Sebastian, with their basic units being the companies of 250 men, grouped in captaincies. In the city of Lisbon, whose inhabitants were exempt from being draft for the auxiliary troops, the Ordenan√ßas had a special organization, constituting five ter√ßos commanded by colonels.Ribeiro, Ant√≥nio Silva. Organiza√ß√£o Superior de Defesa Nacional. Lisbon: Pref√°cio, 2004. The Restoration War also obliged the incorporation of foreign troops into the Army. In 1641, these included eight French regiments (five of light cavalry, one of carabineers, one of dragoons and the other of infantry), two Dutch cavalry regiments, one Irish infantry regiment, one Scottish infantry regiment and one Italian infantry regiment. Military forces were also organized in the overseas territories of Portugal, especially in Brazil, where the European Portuguese military organization with three classes of troops was replicated, although with local adaptations. In Brazil, ter√ßos of whites, Indians and blacks were raised. The Brazilian colonial forces successfully defeated and expelled the Dutch invaders not only from Brazil, but also constituted the bulk of the expedition to Africa that expelled the Dutch from S√£o Tom√© Island and from Angola, restoring Portuguese sovereignty in those territories. =Ancien R√©gime= In the early 18th century, the Portuguese Army participated in the War of the Spanish Succession on the side of the Grand Alliance forces. In the middle of the century, it took part in the Seven Years' War, fighting the Spanish in the European theater (Iberian Peninsula) and in the South American theater. Portuguese grenadier at the time of the Seven Years' War In 1707, with the Portuguese Army engaged in the War of the Spanish Succession, King John V decreed a reform of the military organization. Within the scope of this reform, the paid ter√ßos were transformed in infantry regiments, with the designation of their commanding officers changed from mestres de campo to colonels. The change of designations was mainly done to match the names of the Portuguese units and military ranks with those of the foreign allied armies, following the standard designations used in most of Europe. By this time, each infantry regiment was tactically organized as single battalion, with a staff and 12 companies, one of these being of grenadiers. The new military organization also presaged the creation of regiments of cavalry and dragoons. Artillery regiments would also be formed later. The regiments of infantry, cavalry and dragoons were grouped in brigades, each under the command of a brigadier. The auxiliary ter√ßos however remained with the same designation and organization until 1796, when these followed the model of the infantry of the line, being transformed into militia regiments. In the scope of the Fantastic War, the Army increased in size with the inclusion of two battalions of Swiss troops (latter merged into a single foreign regiment) and the raising of a regiment of light troops of infantry and cavalry. William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe was appointed to the new rank of Field Marshal General (Marechal-General) to command the Army in that campaign and, at the same time, to reorganize it. With the end of the War, the Army was again reduced. By 1764, the first line of the Army included 27 infantry regiments (three of them permanently deployed in Brazil), 10 regiments of cavalry, two regiments of dragoons, four regiments of artillery, one regiment of foreign infantry (the Royal Foreigners Regiment) and one regiment of light troops (the Royal Volunteers Regiment). Additionally, there were two regiments of infantry of the Navy. Each of these regiments (with exception of the foreign regiment) corresponded to a specific district from where their soldiers were recruited. In 1790, Queen Maria I decreed the creation of the Academia Real de Fortifica√ß√£o, Artilharia e Desenho (Royal Academy of Fortification, Artillery and Drawing), in Lisbon, for the higher education and training of the Army officers. The main purpose of this Academy was the training of engineer officers, but it also the trained officers of the other branches of the Army. It replaced a number of previous military academies that had existed since the 17th century, being the direct ancestor of the present Portuguese Military Academy. Besides the Army in Europe, the armies of the Crown of Portugal also included military forces and garrisons in the Portuguese Overseas territories. These forces formed separate organizations subordinated to the local Portuguese Viceroys and governors, who, as military commanders, had also the title of captains-generals. In the late 18th century, the larger contingents of first line troops were in Brazil (12 infantry regiments, three infantry regiments deployed from Portugal, three artillery regiments, one dragoon regiment, one cavalry regiment, the Viceroy Cavalry Guard and a Legion of Light Troops), in India (two infantry regiments, one artillery regiment, one cavalry regiment and two legions of sepoys) and in Angola (an infantry regiment, an artillery regiment and a cavalry regiment). Since the 17th century, several military academies had been established in several parts of the Overseas for the training of the members of the local military forces. In 1792, the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica√ß√£o e Desenho (Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Drawing) was established in Rio de Janeiro - on the exact model of the Royal Academy of Fortification of Lisbon - for the training of the officers of the Army in Brazil, this being considered the oldest engineering school of the Americas. =Peninsular War= Soldier of the 6th Ca√ßadores Battalion in 1811 At the end of the 18th century, Portugal joined in the Revolutionary Wars, when it sent an expeditionary army to aid Spain against the Revolutionary French in the War of the Pyrenees (Roussillon campaign). However, Spain made a separate peace with France and turned itself against Portugal. In 1801, the Spanish Army invaded Portugal with the aid of France, with the Portuguese Army facing the invaders in the War of Oranges. The refusal from Portugal to antagonize Britain, its old ally, and to adhere to the Continental System, led to the start of the Peninsular War, with the French Army invading Portugal in 1807. The French invasion obliged the strategic transference of the Portuguese Crown to Brazil and put the Portuguese Army in disarray. Under French occupation, the Army was disbanded and its most important units were integrated into the Portuguese Legion raised by order of Napoleon, that would fight for him in the campaigns of Germany, Austria and Russia. Reconstituted and integrated into the Anglo-Portuguese Army, led by the British General Arthur Wellesley, the Portuguese Army performed well in the remainder of the Peninsular War. The first major battle of the Anglo-Portuguese Army was the Battle of Bussaco in 1810, the success of which gave the inexperienced Portuguese troops confidence in their abilities. The infantry and artillery went on to perform well up until the final Battle of Toulouse in 1814 when news arrived of Napoleon's abdication. The experience from the Roussillon campaign highlighted some gaps in the Portuguese Army, including the lack of light infantry troops. This led to the inclusion of a ca√ßadores (light infantry) company in each of the infantry regiments and the raising of the elite Legion of Light Troops in 1796. This Legion was an experimental all-arms unit, that included an infantry battalion (occasionally referred as ca√ßadores), three cavalry squadrons (occasionally referred as hussars) and a horse artillery battery. The Portuguese Army underwent a major reorganization in 1807, being focused mainly on the territorial military division of the country, for recruitment, mobilization and training purposes, taking advantage of the data obtained in the 1801 census about the number and distribution of the Portuguese population. The country was divided into three grand military divisions (North, Center and South), these being in turn subdivided into 24 recruiting districts called Ordenan√ßa brigades. This geometrical division was established so that each Ordenan√ßa brigade would cover an identical population and would be responsible for the raising of a line infantry and two militia regiments. Each grand division then included eight line infantry regiments (grouped in four brigades), four cavalry regiments, one artillery regiment, eight militia regiments and four Ordenan√ßas brigades. The South Division included further the Legion of Light Troops and a second artillery regiment. The existing line infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments were kept, but became numbered instead of being designated after their garrison places or the name of their commanding officers as they were previously. Lisbon's inhabitants also became eligible to be drafted for the Militias, with two regiments being created in the city (the regiments of Royal Volunteers of Foot Militias of Eastern and Western Lisbon). The Army was then to be composed of 24 infantry, 12 cavalry, four artillery and 48 militias regiments, the Legion of Light Troops, the 24 Ordenan√ßas brigades, the Army military corps (Army Staff, Engineers, Fortresses Staff, Fortress fixed garrisons, Guides and Artificiers) and the Army civil corps (Treasury, Hospitals, Hospital Guardianship, Transportation and Army Police). Shortly afterwards, a militia cavalry regiment (the Regiment of Royal Volunteers of Horse Militias) was raised in Lisbon and added to the Army. The transference of the Portuguese Government and Crown to Brazil meant that some of the most important military officers were also transferred. Most of the remaining more experienced officers and best units of the Army were ordered by the French occupant authorities to form the Portuguese Legion and sent to France to fight for Napoleon. These events suspended the full implementation of the 1807 reorganization and left the Portuguese Army practically dismantled. The military resistance to invaders began to be carried away mainly by the initiative of the Militias and local Ordenan√ßas, which launched a guerrilla war on the rearguard of the French forces, managing to cut their lines of communications and to isolate many of their units. A number of voluntary and irregular units were raised on the initiative of local military, administrative and even ecclesiastical authorities, including the Volunteers Regiment raised by the Governing Board of Portalegre, the Transtagana Legion raised by the corregedor of Beja and the Academic Battalion raised by the University of Coimbra. Another important voluntary unit, the Loyal Lusitanian Legion, was raised in England with Portuguese √©migr√©s. In 1809, following the Battle of Corunna, the Portuguese Army was reconstituted under the initiative of the Secretary of War Pereira Forjaz and re-trained by the British under the direction of Lieutenant General William Beresford. Most of the 1807 organization was retained, but with the addition of the newly raised independent battalions of ca√ßadores, that would become famous in the Peninsular War. These were formed mainly by the transformation of previous irregular voluntary units and of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion. Six of these battalions were raised in 1808 by order of Secretary Pereira Forjaz, with six additional ones being raised in 1811. The lack of experienced Portuguese officers was mitigated by the inclusion of a number of British officers in the several Army units, in a way that most of them had a Portuguese commanding officer and a British second in command or vice versa. The Militias were augmented with newly raised special units, including the infantry and cavalry regiments of the Royal Commerce Volunteers, the 1st and 2nd battalions of national artillerymen of Lisbon, the 1st and 2nd battalions of national ca√ßadores of Lisbon and the Battalion of the Royal Volunteers of Oporto. Active units of Ordenan√ßas were also raised, including the 16 national legions for the defense of Lisbon (each with three battalions) and a number of Ordenan√ßas artillery companies for the garrison of fortresses, these being mainly employed in the Lines of Torres Vedras. =South American campaigns= The Division of Royal Volunteers parading in Rio de Janeiro, before embarking to the Banda Oriental campaign The Portuguese Royal Court and Government install themselves in Brazil from 1808, with Rio de Janeiro becoming the de facto capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil is raised to the status of Kingdom, with the whole Portuguese Monarchy becoming the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. As a retaliation against the Napoleonic invasion of the Portugal, the Portuguese forces in Brazil invaded and conquered the French Guiana in 1808. In 1811, the Portuguese Army in Brazil invaded the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay), to retake Portuguese claimed territories that were under Spanish occupation. In 1816, the Portuguese forces invaded again the Banda Oriental, defeating the forces of Artigas in a series of battles. Banda Oriental is then annexed to the Portuguese Crown as the Brazilian Cisplatine Province. After the declaration of the Independence of Brazil in September 1822, by the Portuguese Prince heir Peter, the Portuguese Army fought the brief Brazilian War of Independence. This war assumed a character of a kind of a civil war, with the forces loyal to the Portuguese Government fighting the separatist army whose leaders and officers were also mostly Portuguese. By 1823, the resistance of the Portuguese loyal forces was concentrated in some coastal cities, especially those of Salvador of Bahia and Montevideo (presently the capital of Uruguay), all under siege of the Brazilian separatist forces. Despite repelling successive attacks by the superior Brazilian forces, but with no perspectives of receiving reinforcements, the Portuguese garrison of Salvador, under the command of General Madeira de Melo, evacuated the city and embarked in a Portuguese naval squadron, sailing to Portugal in July 1823. The Portuguese garrison of Montevideo was the last to resist in Brazil, only surrendering to the Brazilian forces (ironically, commanded by the Portuguese General Carlos Lecor) on 8 March 1824. With the presence of the Royal Court and of a high number of Portuguese Army officers that accompanied it, the military organization of Brazil is developed, with its ground forces now being frequently referred as the \\"Army of Brazil\\" (while the Portuguese Army in Europe was referred as the \\"Army of Portugal\\" or the \\"Army of the Kingdom\\"). The Army of Brazil would be the origin of the present Brazilian Army. With the end of the Peninsular War, the Army of Brazil is reinforced with military contingents sent from Portugal, one of the most important of these being the Division of Royal Volunteers, commanded by General Carlos Lecor. This Division was originally raised, by the request of the Duke of Wellington, to integrate its army in the Waterloo Campaign, but ended instead to be sent to Brazil. =Liberal Wars= From 1828 to 1834, occurred the Liberal Wars, a civil conflict that opposed the Miguelites (Absolutists) led by King Michael I to the Liberals led by his brother Peter (ex-Peter I of Brazil and ex-Peter IV of Portugal, defending the rights of his daughter, the Queen Mary II). The Portuguese Army divided itself by the two sides, although most of its units aligned on the side of Michael. The Miguelite forces were occasionally referred as the \\"Royalist Army\\". The Liberals raised the so-called \\"Liberator Army\\", made up mainly of newly raised units, but also incorporating some units of the regular Army that passed to their side. Both the Miguelite and the Liberal armies were referred as the \\"Rebel Army\\" by their respective opponents. The war ended formally on 26 May 1834, with the capitulation of Michael I in the Concession of Evoramonte. Miguelites partisans continued, however, a guerrilla warfare in several regions of the country until around 1838. The Article 9 of the Concession of Evoramonte established that all regiments and corps loyal to Michael should peacefully disband themselves. This meant in practice the dismantling of the \\"old\\" Portuguese Army, as most of its centuries-old regiments were disbanded. The victorious Liberals regime then raised a \\"new\\" Portuguese Army built essentially from the Liberator Army. The Militias and Ordenan√ßas were also expressly extinguished, thus ending the traditional Portuguese military territorial organization originated in the 16th century. This extinction was mainly related with political reasons, as those organizations were considered traditionalists and far aligned with the Miguelites. To serve as second-line troops, partially replacing the previous organizations, the Liberal regime raised the new National Guard. The NatioGuard was however not part of the Army, being instead subordinated to the civil administrative authorities. Despite the new regime initially given a high importance, the National Guard turned out to show herself inefficient, undisciplined and highly politicized, being involved in a number of conspiracies and coups, eventually losing the confidence of the authorities and be disbanded in 1847. As early as 1835, the new organized Army sends an expeditionary division to Spain, to support the Spanish liberals and their Queen Isabel II, in the Carlist War. For several years, the Portuguese Army would also be involved in a number of internal civil conflicts that erupted as remnants of the Liberal Wars. These included the Revolution of Maria da Fonte and the Patuleia. The Battle of Ponte Ferreira, between the Miguelite and the Liberal armies The Royalist Army (Ex√©rcito Realista) that fought on the Miguelite side resulted essentially from the reorganization of the Portuguese Army established by King Michael I in 1829. The main changes implemented in this reorganization were the formal disbandment of the military units that joined the liberal side, the change of the line regiments designation system (the units ceased to be identified by numbers and come to be again designated by the names of their garrison places) and the creation of four regiments of ca√ßadores from the four battalions of ca√ßadores that remained loyal to Michael. The first line of the Army thus included eight cavalry, 16 infantry, four ca√ßadores and three artillery regiments, the Engineers Battalion and the Telegraph Corps. The Militias and Ordenan√ßas were maintained with the previous organization, but were joined by a newly raised volunteers corps (the Corps of Royalist Volunteers), that included around 40 battalions and a number of independent companies of cavalry and ca√ßadores. The army raised by the Liberals to fight the Miguelites came to be known as the \\"Liberator Army\\" (Ex√©rcito Libertador). It started to be raised from the military units stationed in the Azores (the first portion of the Portuguese territory under Liberal control), including the elite 5th Ca√ßadores Battalion, that had been deployed to garnish the Fortress of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista in Terceira island. In August 1829, these forces were able to win the Battle of Praia da Vit√≥ria, an attempt of the Miguelite Navy to disembark troops and retake Terceira island. The initial Liberal forces in Azores were soon joined by Liberals evaded from the Miguelite army, by exiled Liberal volunteers and by foreign volunteers and mercenaries (mainly French, English, Belgians, Polish, Irish and Scottish). When the Liberal forces landed at Mindelo (near Oporto) in July 1832 ‚Äì initiating the campaign in Mainland Portugal ‚Äì they included more than 7000 men, most of them being foreigners. By July 1833, the Liberator Army included the Imperial Staff, the inspections generals of the Cavalry, Engineers and Artillery branches, the governments of arms of the Douro Province and of the fortresses of Oporto, the staffs of the six Portuguese brigades, the civil departments of the Army (pay-office, health, military administration, general audit, catering, transports and permanent court-martial), one cavalry regiment, seven line infantry regiments, four battalions of ca√ßadores, the Artillery Staff, one artillery battalion, the Academic Artillerymen Volunteers Corps, the Artillerymen Conductors Company, the Corps of the Royal Police Guard of Oporto, the Royal Corps of Engineers, the Queens Own Volunteers Regiment, the National Volunteers (one national corps on horse, five national mobile battalions, two national fix battalions, four provisional battalions and one public employees battalion), the Royal Arsenal of the Army, the Ouro Train, the Oporto Veterans (two companies), the Military General Depot, the Staff of the Expeditionary Division to Algarve, the Staff of the Azores Division, the staffs of the two foreign brigades, the Queens Own Lancers Regiment (British), the Navy's Regiment (British), the Queen's Own Grenadiers Regiment (Irish), the Scottish Fusiliers Battalion (British), the British Volunteers Battalion (British), and the 1st and 2nd Queen's own light infantry regiments (mainly French and Belgians). The transformation of the Liberator Army into the new Portuguese Army occurred by the organization established in July 1834. By this organization, the Army included the General Staff, the Staff Corps, the Engineering Corps (including a staff and the Sappers Battalion), the Artillery Corps (including a grand staff and two regiments), six regiments of cavalry, 12 regiments of infantry, four regiments of light infantry or ca√ßadores and the military intendancy. The infantry regiments would form six brigades grouped in three divisions, the light infantry regiments would form two brigades grouped in a light division and the cavalry regiments would form three brigades. Each province continued to have a military governor, that commanded the troops stationed there and that were not assigned to a special purpose division. The artillery, cavalry, infantry and light infantry regiments would be numbered. Despite several of these regiments originated from units of the previous Liberator Army, they received numbers identical to those once used by the old disbanded regiments to whom they were not related. Besides the previous referred corps and units, the Army also included the fortresses staffs, the secretariats, the academies, the Military College, the arsenals and trains, the Telegraph Corps, training depots, the Veterinary School, veterans, invalids and fortress garrisons. =Constitutional Monarchy= After the gradual stabilization of the Constitutional Monarchic regime after the Liberal Wars and with no imminent perceived immediate threats against the Portuguese European territory, the Army will focus on internal security duties and in the organizations of military expeditions to overseas. The first major re-organization of the Army after its transformation from the previous Liberator Army, occurred as soon as 1837. The cavalry started to be organized in eight regiments, of which four would be of lancers and the others of ca√ßadores a cavalo (mounted rifles). The infantry ceased to have regiments and become organized in 30 independent battalions, of which 10 would be of ca√ßadores (numbered 6 to 25) and the others would be of line infantry (numbered 1 to 5 and 26 to 30). The artillery started to include four regiments, one of which was of horse and mounted artillery and the others were of garrison artillery. Manuel II, the last monarch of Portugal, visiting an Army unit, near the end of the monarchy In 1837, a deep reformation of the military higher education also occurred. The previous Royal Academy of Fortification, Artillery and Design was transformed into the new Escola do Ex√©rcito (Army School), intended to train the Army officers and also to train civil engineers. The old Royal Academy of the Navy was replaced by the new Escola Polit√©cnica (Polytechnic School), intended to serve as an undergraduate preparatory establishment for the access to the Army School and also to the Naval School. The infantry came to be again organized in regiments in 1842. It now included the Queen's Grenadiers Regiment, 16 line infantry regiments and 18 ca√ßadores battalions. The Queen's Grenadiers was a special regiment responsible to serve as the royal guard of Queen Mary II. In 1855, it would however cease to have a special status and be transformed into a regular line infantry regiment. Until the 1840s and to face the internal troubles caused by the political instability that followed the Liberal Wars, the Army continued to be reinforced with units of volunteers, generically referred as the \\"national battalions\\". These included units of infantry, ca√ßadores, artillery and cavalry, raised through all the country. The inexistence of nationwide gendarmerie, meant that the Army would partially be employed in that role, mainly in the rural areas of the country. So, most of the Army units were frequently requested by the local administrative authorities to maintain public order and to perform other police duties, employing in these services an important part of their personnel. The national defense strategy of the late 19th century focused mainly on the defense of Lisbon, as the major populational, economical and political center of the country and its only part considered defendable against possible aggression from a major power. Lisbon was so transformed in a national redoubt, with a modern system of fortifications built around the city, equipped with advanced systems of armament and communications. This fortified system protected the city against both land and sea attacks and became known as the Lisbon Entrenched Camp. The last Army organizations in the Monarchy occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By that time, the Army was administratively organized in three grand military circumscriptions (North, Center and South), each including two military territorial divisions, plus two military commands (Azores and Madeira). Distributed by the several territorial divisions, there were four cavalry brigades and 12 infantry brigades, each including two regiments. Each division, brigade and military command had its own headquarters. The Lisbon Entrenched Camp constituted a separate military command headed by a general, with its own permanent garrison artillery and engineering units. In 1901, the units of Army included one engineering regiment (with sappers-miners, pontoneers, telegraph and railway companies), three engineering independent companies (fortress sappers, torpedoes and fortress telegraph), six mounted artillery regiments, one horse artillery batteries group, one mountain artillery batteries group, six garrison artillery groups, four garrison artillery independent batteries, 10 cavalry regiments, six ca√ßadores battalions (these including also troops of cyclists and machineguns) and 27 infantry regiments. Besides these, the Army also included a number of service support units, schools and other establishments. When mobilized to enter in operations, the Army constituted the Field Army. The Field Army included a commander-in-chief and its headquarters, four active army divisions, active army independent troops (including two cavalry brigades), active army train and garrison and reserve troops. Each active division included a headquarters, two infantry brigades (each with three infantry regiments), a ca√ßadores regiment, a cavalry regiment, three field artillery groups, a sappers-miners company and a divisional train. If needed army corps could be organized through the grouping of divisions and composite brigades which included all arms and service supports units. =Colonial pacification campaigns= From the second half of the 19th century until the beginning of the 20th century, the Portuguese Army focused in a number of colonial pacification campaigns in Africa and in Asia. In the 1840s, the Portuguese forces in Macau face several conflicts, including internal insurrections and Chinese threats, being able to maintain the Portuguese sovereignty in the territory. In India, the Portuguese Army had to face several uprisings of local military units. In Africa, the Portuguese forces organize a number of campaigns intended to suppress tribal uprisings and to expand the hinterland controlled by the Portuguese authorities. These campaigns intensify especially after the beginning of the Scramble for Africa in 1881, in order to protect the Portuguese territorial claims that were being threatened by other European colonial powers. The success of the Portuguese advance to the interior of Africa led to Portugal reclaiming the sovereignty over the whole African hinterland between Angola and Mozambique. This claim collided however with the British interests on the same territory, leading to the 1890 British Ultimatum, forcing the withdrawal of the Portuguese forces from those areas. The most important pacification campaigns occurred in Mozambique and in Angola in the 1890s. In Mozambique, the Portuguese Army faces the powerful Gungunhana, tribal emperor of Gaza that rebelled against Portugal. Gungunhana is finally defeated and captured at Chaimite in 1895. Portuguese troops in the Battle of Marracuene, against the forces of Gungunhana The military forces of the Portuguese Overseas, continued to constitute separate organizations, distinct from the so-called Army of Portugal or Army of the Kingdom. As so, they were not subordinated to the War Ministry, but instead they were under the supervision of the Overseas Ministry. They usually included local raised units, being reinforced by expeditionary units sent from Portugal. In 1869, the Portuguese troops of the Overseas were globally organized in four administrative divisions: the Army of Western Africa, the Garrison of Mozambique, the Army of India and the Garrison of Macau and Timor. The Army of Western Africa included five ca√ßadores battalions, an artillery battery, two second-line battalions and 28 mobile companies, all based in Angola except a ca√ßadores battalion in Cape Verde and another one in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. The Garrison of Mozambique included three ca√ßadores battalions and one veteran company. The Army of India included a corps of engineers, an artillery regiment, a line infantry battalion, three ca√ßadores battalions, the Municipal Guard of New Goa and two veteran companies, all based in Goa, except a ca√ßadores battalion in Daman. The Army of India further included its own military academy (the Military and Mathematics School of Goa), which granted university training to its engineers, artillery and infantry officers. Finally, the Garrison of Macau and Timor included an infantry battalion in Macau and two companies in Timor. Later, the military forces of the Overseas suffer several reorganizations. In 1876, the Overseas Infantry Regiment was created. This regiment had its home garrison in Lisbon, but deployed its forces to the Overseas. Two of its battalions were always deployed in India and Macau, on rotation. This regiment would be disbanded in 1892 and replaced by the Overseas Enlisted Depot. From the end of the 19th century, the whole of Overseas forces started to be collectively referred as the Ex√©rcito Ultramarino (Overseas Army) or Ex√©rcito Colonial (Colonial Army), to distinguish it from the Army in the Metropole (European Portugal) that was now frequently referred as the Ex√©rcito Metropolitano (Metropolitan Army). A major reorganization of these forces, occurs between 1895 and 1901, taking advantage of the experience obtained in the colonial campaigns that were on course. The organization of the military forces of the Overseas established in 1901 included the headquarters of the overseas provinces and autonomous district, first-line garrisons, military organized corps of police and customs guard, disciplinary corps, military courts, war material depots, fortresses and strongpoints staffs, health service, military administration services, the Overseas Enlisted Depot, retirees and second-line troops. The governors-general of province (Angola, Mozambique and India), the governors of province (Cape Verde, Guinea, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Macau) and the governor of autonomous district (Timor) continued to be the superior commanders of the military forces in their respective provinces and district, with the same role as a general commanding a division, superintending the respective headquarters. The governors of subordinate districts were the commanders of the garrisons in their districts, with the role of a general commanding a brigade. The first line units included three mixed batteries of mountain and garrison artillery (in Angola, Mozambique and India), one European company of garrison artillery (in Macau), one Indigenous company of garrison artillery (in Cape Verde), six mixed companies of mountain artillery and infantry (one in Guinea, two in Angola, one in Mozambique and two in Timor), two mixed companies of garrison artillery and infantry (in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Mozambique), three squadrons of dragoons (one in Angola and two in Mozambique), four independent platoons of dragoons (two in Guinea, one in India and one in Timor), six European companies of infantry (one in Cape Verde, one in Angola, two in Mozambique, one in India and one in Macau), 32 Indigenous companies of infantry (16 in Angola, 10 in Mozambique and six in India), six corps of police (in Cape Verde, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Angola, Mozambique, India and Macau), two disciplinary battalions (in Angola and Mozambique), eight depot companies (four in Angola and four in Mozambique), five European music bands (three in Angola and two in Mozambique) and four Indigenous music bands (in Cape Verde, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, India and Macau). =World War I= The period before World War I, were years of political instability in Portugal. In the early October 1910, a republican revolutionary event occurred in Lisbon. Despite receiving few popular and military support, the revolutionaries manage to prevail, much thanks to the passive attitude of the Army and its reluctance in suppressing the uprising, with the Constitutional Monarchy being overthrown and the republic being proclaimed on 5 October 1910. One of the first measures of the new republican regime was to implement a military reform that aimed to transform the Portuguese Army into a militia type army, modeled after the Swiss Army. Portugal participated in World War I on the side of the Allies. The Portuguese Army would engaged in combat against the Germans in the European Western Front, in the South-West Africa and in the East Africa campaigns. The conflict between Portugal and Germany started well before the formal declaration of war between the two countries when several military clashes between Portuguese and German troops occurred in the borders of southern Angola with German West Africa and of northern Mozambique with German East Africa in the middle of 1914. The formal entry in the war would only occur when Germany declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916 in response to the Portuguese seizure of German shipping. Portuguese troops marching to the line in the Western Front The republican reform of the Army implemented between January and May 1911 did not change deeply the organization of the last years of the Monarchy, the changes being especially the honors, disciplinary and conscription systems, with the transformation of a mainly professional army into a mainly militia army. Notable changes in the organization included the increase of the number of divisions and regiments, the extinction of the traditional ca√ßadores units, the creation of independent units of machineguns (being part of the infantry, but organized in batteries as the artillery) and the subdivision of the artillery arm in two almost separate branches (the field artillery and the foot artillery, this last being mainly a weapon engineering and technical branch, but being also responsible for the operation of the heavy guns of the garrison and coastal artillery). By this organization, the Metropolitan Army included the general officers, the Staff Service, the several arms and services (the engineering, artillery, cavalry and infantry arms, the military health, military veterinary and military administration services, the military secretariat and the auxiliary staffs), the Army general services (War Secretariat, Army Staff, headquarters and military territorial commands, military courts and justice, military schools, retirees companies and military invalids asylum) and the services of the Lisbon Entrenched Camp. The Army troops included the active troops, the reserve troops and the territorial troops. The active troops included eight divisions (each with four infantry regiments, one machinegun batteries group, one mounted artillery regiment and a cavalry regiment) and a cavalry brigade (with three cavalry regiments), plus non-divisionary engineering troops (eight companies of sappers-miners, eight divisionary sections of bridges, eight sections of floodlights, ten sections of field telegraphists, one bridge park, one wireless telegraph company, one balloon company, one railway companies group and one fortress telegraphists company, the majority of these units being administratively grouped in two sappers-miners and one pontoneers battalions), artillery troops (two mountain artillery regiments, one horse batteries group, two howitzers batteries groups and three independent mountain batteries), infantry troops (three infantry regiments and three independent machinegun companies), health service troops (eight health companies, administratively grouped in three companies groups) and military administration troops (eight supply companies and eight transportation companies, grouped in three military administration companies groups). Adjustments to the above organization would later be done in the Army. These included the creation of the Military Aeronautical Service in May 1914, following the development of the military aviation that was happening. An aviation unit would integrate the Portuguese Forces campaigning in East Africa and Portuguese pilots would fight in the Western Front integrated in French aviation squadrons. Later, in 1924, the Army aviation would gain the status of a full arm of service (known as the \\"Military Aeronautics\\" or \\"aeronautics arm\\") as were the engineering, artillery, cavalry and infantry. For the African campaigns, the local Portuguese colonial forces were reinforced with military expeditions sent from the European Portugal. These expeditions were made of infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons and artillery batteries detached from their parent regiments in European Portugal. Usually, each regiment deployed its 3rd battalion. Around 15 000 men were deployed to Angola and 17 000 to Mozambique. For the European Western Front, around 60 000 men were deployed in two expeditionary forces: the Independent Heavy Artillery Corps (CAPI) and the larger and better known Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (CEP). The CAPI was a heavy artillery regiment, raised with personnel taken from the coastal and garrison artillery units of the Lisbon Entrenched Camp, that operated heavy railway guns under the control of the French Army. The CEP was an infantry formation that would assume the responsibility for a whole autonomous sector of the front, under the control of the British First Army. It was initially raised as a reinforced division, but was then reorganized as an army corps of two divisions, including six infantry brigades, divisionary troops, corps troops, a rearguard base and army troops (heavy artillery and a railway units under the direct control of the First Army). The CEP was deployed to France in the early 1917 and - although almost being destroyed in April 1918, in the Battle of the Lys - it continued to fight on the Western Front until the armistice brought an end to World War I. =Inter-wars and World War II period= On 28 May 1926, an Army led coup d'√©tat ended the politically instable Portuguese First Republic and established the transitory National Dictatorship, an event that led to the establishment of the New State in 1933. From 1936 on, a number of Portuguese volunteers (known as the Viriatos) offered to fight in the Spanish Civil War on the Francoist nationalist side. Many of these volunteers were officers and NCOs of the Portuguese Army, and most served mainly in elite units like the Spanish Foreign Legion and the National Aviation. Although Portugal did not officially participate in World War II, Portuguese troops fought in Timor against the Japanese invaders and had to deter a planned invasion of the Continental and Atlantic islands territories of Portugal. Anti-aircraft gun installed in Mindelo, as part of the Portuguese military reinforcement to defend the Cape Verde isles during World War II One of the first measures of the new regime was the rationalization and re-organization of the Army, taking into account the lessons learned in the participation in the World War I. The basis of the organization established in July 1926 will prevail, although with diverse and successive adjustments, until the 1990s. The Swiss-inspired concept of a militia army is abandoned and replaced by a mixed model, capable of allowing the rapid engagement of operational forces, which had proven difficult with the previous model. Two types of units came into existence. The first was the territorial units spread across the territory, including the regiments of the several arms, that continued to serve mainly as training and mobilization centers, with a small permanent staff of professional officers and NCOs responsible for the annual training of conscripts. The second type was units permanently maintained in a higher state of readiness, with their effectiveness in time of peace being almost identical to those planned for war. These last units consisted mainly in 10 border defense reinforced battalions (with the title ca√ßadores being recovered to designate these units) and in two brigades of cavalry. No divisions or other field formations, besides the two cavalry brigades, would be permanently maintained active, only being raised if needed. The number of military units was decreased, the territorial divisions were abolished, with the territory of Continental Portugal becoming divided in four military regions and in the Military Government of Lisbon (this one having both the role of military region and the role of the abolished Lisbon Entrenched Camp command). The Army would suffer another major reorganization in 1937. This reorganization kept the major features of the previous one. Regarding the ground forces, the major changes were the reduction of the number of infantry regiments, from 22 to 16 and the raising of armored units. The militia-type Portuguese Legion is formalized as being part of the military structure. The Military Aeronautics arm ‚Äì although continued to be administratively part of the Army ‚Äì gained a high level of operational autonomy, starting to have its own central command, what transformed it into an almost separate branch of service. During World War II, to deter a possible invasion of the Portuguese islands and overseas territories, the Army had to send several military expeditions to reinforce the local defense forces. As part of the defense measures of the Overseas, the colonial military forces were transitorily placed under the control of the Army, although continuing to be separate from it. The larger contingent of expeditionary forces went to the Azores, with its Army garrison achieving the 35 000 men. The defense of the Azores was crucial as these islands were planned to serve as retreat point and base of the Portuguese Government in case of an enemy occupation of Continental Portugal. Besides this, the Portuguese authorities received intelligence about the existence of both Axis and Allied plans to occupy the islands (including the planned British operations Alloy, Shrapnell, Brisk, Thruster, Springboard and Lifebelt, the US Operation Grey and the German operations Felix, Ilona and Isabella), to use them to control the North Atlantic. The defense of Continental Portugal was also reinforced, especially of the Lisbon area. The measures for the defense of Lisbon included the raising of a complex system of coastal and anti- aircraft defense and the raising of an army corps of three divisions for ground defense. =Early Cold War= In 1949, Portugal was one of the founding members of NATO. In the peak of the Cold War, the Portuguese Army focused on the preparation for a conventional or even nuclear warfare in Europe, during the 1950s. As part of this preparation, the Portuguese Army increasingly aligned with the doctrine, organization, training and equipment model of the United States Army. In 1950, the Portuguese Armed Forces were created as an integrated organization, with the operational command responsibilities of the Army and the Navy being increasingly transferred to unified bodies of command. The Colonial Military Forces are finally merged with the Metropolitan Army, with a single common Army existing since then, both in the Metropolis (European Portugal) and in the Overseas territories. In 1952, the Military Aeronautics arm is completely separated from the Army - at the same time absorbing the Portuguese Naval Aviation - and becomes the autonomous Portuguese Air Force. However, at the same time, the Army activated a small light aviation service for artillery observation and maintained it until 1955, when it was disbanded and its aircraft transferred to the Air Force. Piper L-21 Super Cub used by the Portuguese Army artillery observation light aviation in the 1950s With the creation of the roles of Minister of National Defense and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces on 1 August 1950, a unified chain of command for the then existing two branches of services (with the third one being added in 1952) was established. The Chief of the General Staff assumes the operational command functions of the then disbanded roles of major-generals (operational commanders) of the Army and of the Navy. Under the command of the Chief of the General Staff, it is foreseen the existence of commanders-in-chief, with the roles of unified operational commanders of all the ground, naval and air forces in a given theatre. A permanent commander-in- chief is created in each of the Overseas provinces. The Army continues to have however a highly administrative and logistical autonomy, including its own ministry (the Army Ministry, ex-War Ministry) and a network of territorial commands. The new doctrines and military technological requirements of the Cold War led to the creation of new corps in the Army, including the Materiel Service (from the previous weapons and industrial engineers branch of the artillery arm), the Military Police, the Communications arm (from the previous communications branch of the engineering arm) and the Signal Intelligence Service. Two special units are also experimentally raised, these being the commando-type Assault Sappers and, latter, the Paratroopers. However, until the 1960s, the Army high command will show an aversion against the existence of special units, causing the Assault Sappers to be disbanded and the Paratroopers to be fully transferred to the Air Force (where they stayed until 1993). In the early 1950s, the Portuguese Government committed itself with NATO with an ambitious plan to raise 10 divisions, of which five would be stronger field divisions (known as \\"American type\\") to constitute an expeditionary army corps to operate under the SHAPE, while the others would be less equipped territorial divisions intended to assure a static defense of the Iberian Peninsula (three for the defense of the Pyrenees and two for the home defense of Portugal). The deployment of these divisions tended to follow the Portuguese defense doctrine of the time, that considered most of Western Continental Europe indefensible in case of a massive invasion by the Warsaw Pact forces, so focusing in transforming the Iberian Peninsula in a redoubt, considered to be defensible at the Pyrenees line. In 1953, the first division of the expeditionary corps (the Division \\"Nun¬¥√Ålvares\\") is raised and was maintained as permanently active. This division adopts almost totally a U.S. organization and equipment, including around 20 000 men, with three infantry regiments (each reinforced with a squadron of tanks), a divisionary tank battalion, three field artillery battalions and anti-aircraft, engineering, signal and logistical units. To serve as training base for this division, the large Santa Margarida Military Camp is built. As the Nun'√Ålvares Division started to be mainly maintained by the 3rd Military Region (headquartered in Tomar), from 1955, it starts to be officially designated as 3rd Division. The Nun'√Ålvares Division would be the strongest and best equipped permanent force of the Portuguese Army, serving as its main training organization. In 1961, the Division engaged in its last major field maneuvers. From then on, the Army would re-orient its main focus to the Overseas war, with the Division being left in a background, although only being officially disbanded in 1976. =Overseas wars= In December 1961, the small garrisons of the Portuguese Army in the Portuguese India had to face an invasion from overwhelmingly stronger Indian ground, air and naval forces. After brief resistances, each of the isolated Portuguese garrisons of Goa, of Daman, of Diu and of the Angidiva island collapse and surrender. In Africa, the Portuguese Army would be deeply engaged in military counterinsurgency campaigns against separatists forces, that became collectively known as the \\"Colonial War\\" or the \\"Overseas War\\". These campaigns are fought in three different theatres of operations, separated by thousands of kilometers from each other and from the European Portugal: Angola (1961-1974), Portuguese Guinea (1963-1974) and Mozambique (1964-1974). Despite having almost no external support and facing enemies strongly supported by the Warsaw Pact and even by some Western European countries and despite having to fight in three distant theaters at the same time, the small Portuguese Armed Forces were able to resist in campaign for 13 years. The counterinsurgency campaigns in Africa had various degrees of success, with an almost victory of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola, a stalemate in Mozambique and a disadvantageous almost conventional warfare situation in Portuguese Guinea. This war ended after the Carnation Revolution military coup of 25 April 1974 in Lisbon and the subsequently independence of the Portuguese African overseas provinces. Portuguese Army soldiers progressing in an Angolan jungle trail, attentive to possible ambushes, in the early 1960s The 1950s, saw a deep reorganization of the military forces in Portugal. The Armed Forces were established as an integrated organization in 1950, encompassing the already existing Army and Navy (to which the newly created Air Force was added in 1952), under the overall command of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. The ground forces in the Overseas were finally merged with the Metropolitan Army, with a single Portuguese Army existing from then on. The establishment of the integrated Armed Forces led to the creation of the permanent roles of commander-in-chief to serve as the unified operational commanders of all the ground, air and naval forces stationed in each of the Overseas provinces. These commanders-in-chief will soon increase their operational importance over the local service commanders, with the Army territorial commands in each province going to have mere logistical responsibilities. In the scope of the peak of the Cold War, the organization of the Portuguese Army in the Overseas was built with a concern on the imminent threat of war in Europe, compared with a perception of the existence of a low risk of conflicts in the Overseas provinces themselves. So, the Overseas forces were re-organized going from a focus on the internal security to a focus on the conventional warfare, at the same time being oriented to be able to reinforce the Army in Europe and not the opposite. As part of these, the previous military organization based in small company-sized units scattered along the territory was replaced by an organization based in battalion and even regiment-sized units concentrated in the main cities. In Angola and Mozambique, this structure was designed to allow the raising of entire field divisions to be deployed to European Portugal in case of a conventional warfare with the Warsaw Pact. In the early 1960s, however, there was already a perception that guerrilla type conflicts would erupt in some of the Portuguese African territories, leading the Portuguese Army to re-orient its strategy and reorganize its forces in the Overseas, at the same type preparing its forces in Europe to be able reinforce the Overseas. As part of this, the 9th Infantry Regiment in Lamego was transformed in the Special Operations Training Centre, intended to provide counter insurgency and guerrilla warfare training. The Army territorial organization that was implemented when the Overseas war erupted, divided the Portuguese national territory (Metropolitan and Overseas) in military regions (that could be subdivided in territorial commands) and in independent territorial commands. Angola and Mozambique constituted military regions commanded by generals, subdivided in territorial commands, while the other Overseas provinces - including Portuguese Guinea - constituted independent territorial commands (The exception was S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe which constituted a territorial command of the Angolan military region, until becoming an independent command in 1962). The Overseas military regions and territorial commands included units of the normal garrison (regiments, battalions and others), which constituted the permanent territorial administrative bodies responsible for the mobilization and preparation of active troops. Portuguese Army patrol - integrating African and European soldiers - making a pause in the middle of the Guinean jungle, in 1968 The active troops themselves were organized in formations and units raised by the normal garrison units. Besides the local raised active units, many of these were raised by the European Portuguese regiments and deployed to the Overseas, being referred as \\"reinforcement units\\". The active units were temporary units - mainly formed with conscripts framed by a small cadre of career officers and NCOs - that existed only during the tour of duty or active military service period of their elements (usually two years). When their period of existence was near the end, these units were replaced in the field by newly raised similar units, then returning to their parent regiment's barracks, where they were formally disbanded, their conscripts being licensed and their career elements being transferred to other units. The majority of active units employed in the Overseas War were light infantry units, designed for the counterinsurgency role, designated as ca√ßadores (similar units raised by cavalry and artillery regiments had the designation of their respective branches, although trained, equipped and organized as ca√ßadores). These were organized in companies of ca√ßadores that could be independent or be grouped in battalions of ca√ßadores. Besides the ca√ßadores units, the Portuguese Army also raised and fielded regimental-level battlegroups (agrupamentos) headquarters and a number of specialized units (including units of field artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, armored reconnaissance, military police, engineering, signals, mortars, recoilless guns and combat support services). The Army also raised special forces and was involved in the organization of a number of irregular forces. The Army's special forces in the initial stages of the War were the Special Ca√ßadores companies, raised by the 5th (Lisbon) and 10th (Chaves) Ca√ßadores battalions, with specially selected personnel that then received their training in the Special Operations Training Centre. The Army lobby against the special forces prevailed however, with these units ceasing to be raised in 1962, with the intention that all normal ca√ßadores units would receive the same training as the disbanded special ca√ßadores. However, this proved infeasible and the lack of special forces made quickly felt, with some units mitigating this issue by raising informal special forces sub-units with selected personnel, with some of these being referred as \\"commandos\\". The Commandos would soon be formalized in Angola and then in the other theatres. From 1966, a special anti-guerrilla horse unit (the Angola Dragoons) also existed. The majority of the ca√ßadores units were deployed in grid (quadr√≠cula), being scattered through the theatres, with each unit being responsible for the counterinsurgency activities in a given area of responsibility. Usually a ca√ßadores battalion was responsible for a sector, having its companies disperse through the sector, each one being responsible for its own sub-sector. Sometimes, several battalion sectors were grouped in a larger battlegroup area of responsibility. The grid units were often reinforced with artillery, armored reconnaissance and other types of units. Besides the grid units, there were also the intervention forces that were held in reserve by the commands to intervene in any part of the theaters, usually in offensive operations or in the temporary reinforcement of grid units under heavy attack. Most of the intervention forces were units of special forces, but some selected ca√ßadores units also served in this role. By 1974, as active units in the field, the Army had six Commando companies, eight battlegroup headquarters, 35 ca√ßadores battalions headquarters and 180 ca√ßadores companies in the Angolan theatre, one Commando battalion, four battlegroup headquarters, 18 ca√ßadores battalion headquarters and 80 ca√ßadores companies in the Guinean theatre and one Commando battalion, four battlegroups headquarters, 28 ca√ßadores battalions headquarters and 120 ca√ßadores companies in the Mozambican theatre, besides a number of active units of artillery, armor, engineering and other branches, units of normal garrison units and of other bodies. =Late Cold War= Portuguese Army conscripts engaged in the Commando training course in the mid-1980s After the independence of most of the Portuguese overseas territories in the 1974‚Äì1975 period and after 500 years of being a multi-continental country, Portugal became again mainly confined to its European territory. After the end of the political instability period that followed the Carnation Revolution and the tutelage of the Armed Forces over the new regime, the Portuguese Army returned to the barracks and began the process of changing from an oversized colonial and counter-insurgency army to a conventional European army, including drastic personnel reductions, disbanding of some units, acquisition of new arms and equipment, reorganizing units and roles and fielding new headquarters. In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, the main concern of the Army became again the possible conflict with the Warsaw Pact in Europe, in the scope of the latest period of the Cold War. The Army continued to be mainly staffed with conscripts, framed by a core of professional officers and NCOs. The Army kept the previous basic administrative and territorial organization. The Army Ministry was formally disbanded in 1974, but its structure continued to exist, with some adjustments, under the management of the Chief of Staff of the Army, who gained the status of minister. The Army and the other branches of the Armed Forces would only be administratively integrated in the new Ministry of National Defense after 1982. The territory of Continental Portugal continued to be divided in military regions, with the Azores and Madeira territorial independent commands now being designated \\"military zones\\". The regiments and other territorial units ceased to be numbered and became again designated by the place where they had their garrison. The traditional designation ca√ßadores disappeared, with the battalions of that type being either disbanded or transformed in infantry units. Most of the Army regiments continued to be maintained in cadre strength, usually including three battalions (service, training and operational), with their main role being the annual training of conscripts. Each military region was now responsible to raise a territorial defense brigade and each military zone a territorial defense battle group. These territorial defense formations had a core of units permanently raised, but would only be fully completed through mobilization in case of war. The main operational formation was now the new 1st Independent Composite Brigade, a mixed mechanized and motorized infantry force, based in the Santa Margarida Military Camp, maintained in a high state of readiness with most of its units permanently raised. This formation was intended to be an expeditionary force, replacing the old Nun'√Ålvares Division as the main contribution of the Portuguese Army for the NATO ground forces. In 1986, the Special Forces Brigade was also raised as a formation kept in a high state of readiness. This was a light infantry formation, having two battalions of Commandos as its core units. The early 1980s see the Special Operations Training Center raising its own special operations unit, which becomes the second type of Army special forces, after the already existing Commandos. =Post Cold War= The end of the Cold War and the consequent reduction of the threat of a conventional warfare in Europe brought the refocus of the Portuguese Army. From the beginning of the 1990s, the Army started a process of deep transformation, evolving from a mainly conscript army organized as skeleton structure oriented to support the raising of operational units through mobilization to a much smaller professional army organized with permanent operational units. This change implied a rationalization of the forces that included the deep reduction of personnel, the disbandment of a number of regiments and bodies (including the Commando Regiment) and the transference of the Parachute Troops from the Air Force to the Army. The involvement of Portugal in a series of multinational and even national peace operations in foreign countries led the Army to become again a mainly expeditionary oriented force. Since the end of the 20th century, the Portuguese Army participated with national deployed forces in numerous foreign operations, including in Angola, Mozambique, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon. Portuguese Army Chaimite V200 armoured vehicles in western Bosnia, 2002 As part of the Army transformation, it was re-organized in 1993. The division of the territory in military regions and zones was kept, with the reduction of the number of regions, but with the raising of the Airborne Troops Command (using the structure of the previous Air Force's Paratroopers Command) and the Santa Margarida Military Camp as two special territorial commands. The regiments of the Army became again designed by numbers and not anymore by the place where they were based. The assigned numbers were not consecutive, as in previous organizations, but were the historical numbers previously used by each unit or by its predecessor in the same garrison place. The old 1950's plans to equip the Army with light aviation assets were resumed, with the raising of a Light Aviation Unit that was intended to operate helicopters. However, the reception of the planned helicopters was delayed successively until being finally canceled and the unit disbanded. The military regions and zones continued to be responsible for keeping territorial defense brigades and battle groups, mostly maintained only in cadre strength in time of peace. The Army now would have an increased permanent operational force with three brigades: the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI), the Independent Mechanized Brigade (BMI) and the Light Intervention Brigade (BLI). The BAI resulted from the old Air Force's Light Paratrooper Brigade, also absorbing the parachute qualified members of the disbanded Commando Regiment. The BMI resulted from the fully mechanization of the previous 1st Composite Brigade. The BLI would be a completely newly raised motorized infantry brigade, although inheriting part of the disbanded Special Forces Brigade. Operationally, each of the three brigades had a similar organization that included three maneuver (infantry / armoured) and one field artillery battalion, engineering, signals and services companies, an armored reconnaissance squadron and an anti-aircraft battery. Administratively however each of the brigades had completely different organizations, with the BAI being entirely maintained by the Airborne Troops Command in several of its regiments and other units spread across the country, with the BMI being entirely maintained by the Santa Margarida Military Camp concentrated in a single place and with the BLI being maintained by the several military regions in their several regiments spread across the country. In the new organization implemented in 2006, the military regions, the Airborne Troops Command and the Santa Margarida Military Camp command would be finally disbanded. This implied the completely disbandment of the territorial defense brigades. The Azores and Madeira military zones were however maintained, being responsible for the command of the garrison and territorial defense forces stationed in their respective isles. The three operational brigades - respectively renamed Rapid Reaction Brigade (BriRR), Mechanized Brigade (BriMec) and Intervention Brigade (BrigInt) - assumed also the administrative role of their former parent commands, starting to control the regiments responsible for maintaining their operational units (the exception being the BriMec, whose operational units were not maintained by regiments, being administratively directly under the brigade headquarters). As part of this new organization, the re-raised Commando units and the Special Operation Troops were integrated in the BriRR, joining the parachute troops. The BrigInt evolved to a light mechanized brigade, with its units being equipped with wheeled armored vehicles. In the 2010s, the Armed Forces of Portugal created the Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, For√ßa de Rea√ß√£o Imediata), with the main mission of conducting operations of evacuation of Portuguese citizens from foreign geographies under crisis or tension, to participate in humanitarian operations in defense of the national interests and to assure the responsibilities of the Armed Forces in case of severe catastrophes in the National Territory. The FRI includes the ground, the special operations, the naval and the air components, with the Army assuring the first component and participating in the second one. The initial core of the ground component - with an operational readiness of 48 hours - includes a battalion headquarters, a maneuver company, an EOD team, a signal detachment, a CIMIC tactical team and a sanitary module. Most of this core is assured by one of the paratrooper battalions of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, which also maintains a second maneuver company ready to serve as reinforcement. The Army also provides a special operations detachment to the initial core of the special operations component. In April 2012, the FRI was activated for the first time in a real situation, when a military coup occurred in Guinea-Bissau allowed the FRI to be deployed and pre-positioned in Cape Verde, ready to intervene in the previous mentioned country if needed. General organization The general organization presently in force for the Portuguese Army was established in December 2014. Accordingly, with this organization, the Army is commanded by the Chief of Staff of the Army and includes: * the Army Staff (EME); * the central bodies of administration and management; * the Land Forces Command (CFT); * the bodies of advisement; * the Inspection General of the Army (IGE); * the base bodies; * the elements of the operational component of the system of forces. =Chief of Staff of the Army= The Chief of Staff of the Army (Chefe do Estado-Maior do Ex√©rcito, CEME) is the Army commander. He/she is the only officer with the rank of general (four stars) in the Army. The CEME is the principal adviser of the minister of National Defense and of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in all Army specific matters, having the competence foreseen in the Law and participates, inherently, in the bodies of advisement in it foreseen. The Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army - headed by a major-general - is the personal and direct support body of the CEME. The CEME is assisted by the Vice-Chief of Staff of the Army (VCEME), who is the Army second-in-command. The VCEME is a lieutenant-general superordinate to all the other Army officers of the same rank. Under the direct dependency of the VCEME are the Directorate of Communications and Information Systems, the Directorate of History and Military Culture and the Directorate of Education. =Army Staff= The Army Staff (Estado-Maior do Ex√©rcito, EME) is the body of study, conceiving and planning of the Army activities, for the decision support of the CEME.

It includes the Coordinator Staff and the Support Unit. =Central bodies of administration and management= The Portuguese Army's Personnel Command, installed at the Santo Ov√≠dio barracks, Porto The central bodies of administration and management have a functional character and are intended to assure the management and the execution of essential specific activities, namely in the management of human, material, financial, intelligence and infrastructure resources. They are headed by general officers, directly subordinated to the CEME. These bodies are: * Personnel Command (CMDPESS) - assures the Army's activities in the scope of the human resources administration, of the training and of the health. It is commanded by a lieutenant-general designated Adjutant-General of the Army. Besides the office of the commander and the support unit, the CMDPESS includes the Directorate of Training, the Directorate of Human Resources Administration, the Directorate of Personnel Services and the Directorate of Health; * Logistics Command (CMDLOG) - assures the Army's activities in the scope of the material resources administration, of the movements and transportation and of the infrastructures. It is commanded by a lieutenant-general designated Quarter-Master General of the Army. Besides the office of the commander and the support unit, the CMDLOG includes the Directorate of Material and Transportation, the Directorate of Procurement and the Directorate of Infrastructures; * Directorate of Finance (DFIN) - assures the administration of the financial resources made at the disposal of the Army. It is headed by a major-general, designated Director of Finance. =Land Forces Command= The Land Forces Command (Comando das For√ßas Terrestres, CFT) is the land component command. It is commanded by a lieutenant-general, directly subordinated to the CEME, with a major-general as second-in-command. The CFT has the mission of supporting the exercise of command from the part of the CEME, in view of the preparation, the readying and the sustentation of the forces and means of the operational component of the system of forces, of the accomplishment of the missions regulated by particular legislation and other missions given to the Army, keeping the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces permanently informed of the employed forces and means and of the development and results of their respective operations and of the administration and management of the units and bodies of the fixed component placed under its direct dependence. Under the dependence of the CFT are the CFT Headquarters (QGCFT), the military zones commands and their respective headquarters, the formations commands and their respective headquarters and the elements of the operational component of the system of forces. =Advisory bodies= The advisory bodies support the decisions of the CEME in special and important matters regarding the preparation, discipline and administration of the Army. These bodies are: * Higher Council of the Army (CSE) - it is the highest advisory body of the CEME. Under the presidency of the CEME, it includes all the lieutenant-generals of the Army; * Higher Council of Discipline of the Army (CSDE) - it is the advisory body of the CEME in disciplinary matters; * Medical Board of Appeal of the Army (JMRE) - it has the mission of analyzing appeals regarding decisions taken by the competent entities and advising based in the opinions issued by other medical boards of the Army. =Inspection-General of the Army= The Inspection-General of the Army (Inspe√ß√£o-Geral do Ex√©rcito, IGE) is the inspection body of the Army. Its mission is to support the CEME in the exercise of the role of control and evaluation, through the activities of inspection and certification of forces. It is headed by the Inspector-General of the Army, who is a general officer in the reserve. =Base bodies= The base bodies are responsible for the training, the sustainment and the general support of the Army. They include units, establishments and bodies divided by the areas of obtainment and administration of human resources, of readying of forces, of logistical support, of teaching and training and of divulgation and preservation of the military culture. Among the many different types of base bodies are the Military Academy, the School of the Arms and the regiments. The Military Academy is a public military university establishment with the primary mission of training the professional officers of the arms and services of the Army and of the National Republican Guard. The School of the Arms is a training unit with the primary mission of conceiving and provide training programs in the scope of the combat and combat support arms. The regiments are the base units of the Army and integrate the structure for the readying of forces and logistical support. Despite being designated \\"regiments\\" and being usually associated to an arm of service for historical reasons, presently these types of organizations are not deployable units, serving mainly as military bases intended to lodge and support the operational deployable units (battalions/groups, independent companies/squadrons/batteries and others) permanently stationed or temporary deployed in their barracks. Some regimental type units do not include the word \\"regiment\\" in their designation as are the cases of the Special Operations Troops Center, of the Santa Margarida Military Camp and of the Army Materiel General Support Unit. =Elements of the operational component of the system of forces= The elements of the operational component of the system of forces are the Army's forces and means for the fulfillment of the missions of operational nature. These elements are: # The Land Forces Command; # The commands of the formations and operational units - the formations are force echelons that include operational units, having a balanced organization of elements of command, maneuver and support that allow them to effectuate operational training and to conduct independent operations. The formation commands are commanded by brigadier-generals. # The commands of military zone - they include all the Army's units, bodies and other establishments located in each of the autonomous regions of Portugal. They assure the preparation and the training of the forces under its command, being given to them missions and operational means. Each one is commanded by a brigadier-general. # The general support and emergency military support forces - they are combat support and service support units that provide additional capabilities to the formations, military zones and operational units and the flexibility to respond to specific international commitments. They assure widely set of capacities that can be employed in supplementary support to civil authorities in missions of support to the development and welfare of the population, namely in the scope of a national articulated response to catastrophe and calamity situations. System of forces of the Army As a whole, the Army is part of the system of forces of the Portuguese Armed Forces. The system of forces of the Army itself includes a fix component and an operational component. =Fix component= The fix component of the system of forces of the Army is constituted by the base bodies, which guarantee the training, the sustainment and the general support of the Army. These are all non-deployable elements and include regiments, schools, centers and number of other types of bodies. An important part of these bodies is responsible to prepare and maintain the deployable operational units and other elements of the operational component of the system of forces.

It was originally a fully airborne brigade, with most of its personnel being paratrooper-qualified (including the members of combat support and service support units). It has no longer that feature, now including other types of units beyond those of paratroopers, including the two other special forces of the Army (Commandos and Special Operations). It also used to include the Army Light Aviation Unit, until its disbandment due to the cancelation of the planned acquisition of helicopters to the Army. Its operational units presently include the 1st Paratrooper Infantry Battalion, the 2nd Paratrooper Infantry Battalion, the Commando Battalion, the Special Operations Force, a field artillery group (L118 Light Gun), a reconnaissance squadron (Panhard VBL), an anti-aircraft battery (FIM-92 Stinger), the Air-Land Operational Battalion, an engineers company, a signal company and a support unit.

After her sister Rachel Messerer-Plisetskaya was arrested in the Great Purge, Sulamith legally adopted Rachel's daughter Maya Plisetskaya, whom she coached into one of the greatest ballerinas ever. From 1950 until 1980, she was also active as a ballet mistress and teacher in the Bolshoi. Since 1961, she spent much time in Tokyo, where she mastered Japanese and was instrumental in establishing the Tokyo Ballet. In 1980, at the age of 72, she defected to Great Britain, where she continued to work as a much sought-after coach.

The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models. A 3D scanner can be based on many different technologies, each with its own limitations, advantages and costs. Many limitations in the kind of objects that can be digitised are still present. For example, optical technology may encounter many difficulties with shiny, reflective or transparent objects. For example, industrial computed tomography scanning and structured-light 3D scanners can be used to construct digital 3D models, without destructive testing. Collected 3D data is useful for a wide variety of applications. These devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies and video games, including virtual reality.

Functionality  3D scanning of a fin whale skeleton in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia (August 2013) The purpose of a 3D scanner is usually to create a 3D model. This 3D model consists of a point cloud of geometric samples on the surface of the subject. These points can then be used to extrapolate the shape of the subject (a process called reconstruction). If colour information is collected at each point, then the colours on the surface of the subject can also be determined. 3D scanners share several traits with cameras. Like most cameras, they have a cone-like field of view, and like cameras, they can only collect information about surfaces that are not obscured. While a camera collects colour information about surfaces within its field of view, a 3D scanner collects distance information about surfaces within its field of view. The \\"picture\\" produced by a 3D scanner describes the distance to a surface at each point in the picture. This allows the three dimensional position of each point in the picture to be identified. For most situations, a single scan will not produce a complete model of the subject. Multiple scans, even hundreds, from many different directions are usually required to obtain information about all sides of the subject. These scans have to be brought into a common reference system, a process that is usually called alignment or registration, and then merged to create a complete 3D model. This whole process, going from the single range map to the whole model, is usually known as the 3D scanning pipeline.  Technology  There are a variety of technologies for digitally acquiring the shape of a 3D object. A well established classification divides them into two types: contact and non- contact. Non-contact solutions can be further divided into two main categories, active and passive. There are a variety of technologies that fall under each of these categories. = Contact = A coordinate measuring machine with rigid perpendicular arms. Contact 3D scanners probe the subject through physical touch, while the object is in contact with or resting on a precision flat surface plate, ground and polished to a specific maximum of surface roughness. Where the object to be scanned is not flat or can not rest stably on a flat surface, it is supported and held firmly in place by a fixture. The scanner mechanism may have three different forms: * A carriage system with rigid arms held tightly in perpendicular relationship and each axis gliding along a track. Such systems work best with flat profile shapes or simple convex curved surfaces. * An articulated arm with rigid bones and high precision angular sensors. The location of the end of the arm involves complex math calculating the wrist rotation angle and hinge angle of each joint. This is ideal for probing into crevasses and interior spaces with a small mouth opening. * A combination of both methods may be used, such as an articulated arm suspended from a traveling carriage, for mapping large objects with interior cavities or overlapping surfaces. A CMM (coordinate measuring machine) is an example of a contact 3D scanner. It is used mostly in manufacturing and can be very precise. The disadvantage of CMMs though, is that it requires contact with the object being scanned. Thus, the act of scanning the object might modify or damage it. This fact is very significant when scanning delicate or valuable objects such as historical artifacts. The other disadvantage of CMMs is that they are relatively slow compared to the other scanning methods. Physically moving the arm that the probe is mounted on can be very slow and the fastest CMMs can only operate on a few hundred hertz. In contrast, an optical system like a laser scanner can operate from 10 to 500 kHz.Vermeulen, M. M. P. A., Rosielle, P. C. J. N., & Schellekens, P. H. J. (1998). Design of a high-precision 3D-coordinate measuring machine. CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology, 47(1), 447-450. Other examples are the hand driven touch probes used to digitise clay models in computer animation industry. = Non-contact active = Active scanners emit some kind of radiation or light and detect its reflection or radiation passing through object in order to probe an object or environment. Possible types of emissions used include light, ultrasound or x-ray.  Time-of-flight  This lidar scanner may be used to scan buildings, rock formations, etc., to produce a 3D model. The lidar can aim its laser beam in a wide range: its head rotates horizontally, a mirror flips vertically. The laser beam is used to measure the distance to the first object on its path. The time-of-flight 3D laser scanner is an active scanner that uses laser light to probe the subject. At the heart of this type of scanner is a time-of-flight laser range finder. The laser range finder finds the distance of a surface by timing the round-trip time of a pulse of light. A laser is used to emit a pulse of light and the amount of time before the reflected light is seen by a detector is measured. Since the speed of light c is known, the round-trip time determines the travel distance of the light, which is twice the distance between the scanner and the surface. If t is the round-trip time, then distance is equal to \\\\textstyle c \\\\\\\\! \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\! t / 2. The accuracy of a time-of-flight 3D laser scanner depends on how precisely we can measure the t time: 3.3 picoseconds (approx.) is the time taken for light to travel 1 millimetre. The laser range finder only detects the distance of one point in its direction of view. Thus, the scanner scans its entire field of view one point at a time by changing the range finder's direction of view to scan different points. The view direction of the laser range finder can be changed either by rotating the range finder itself, or by using a system of rotating mirrors. The latter method is commonly used because mirrors are much lighter and can thus be rotated much faster and with greater accuracy. Typical time-of-flight 3D laser scanners can measure the distance of 10,000~100,000 points every second. Time-of-flight devices are also available in a 2D configuration. This is referred to as a time-of-flight camera.Cui, Y., Schuon, S., Chan, D., Thrun, S., & Theobalt, C. (2010, June). 3D shape scanning with a time-of-flight camera. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on (pp. 1173-1180). IEEE.  Triangulation  Principle of a laser triangulation sensor. Two object positions are shown. Triangulation based 3D laser scanners are also active scanners that use laser light to probe the environment. With respect to time- of-flight 3D laser scanner the triangulation laser shines a laser on the subject and exploits a camera to look for the location of the laser dot. Depending on how far away the laser strikes a surface, the laser dot appears at different places in the camera's field of view. This technique is called triangulation because the laser dot, the camera and the laser emitter form a triangle. The length of one side of the triangle, the distance between the camera and the laser emitter is known. The angle of the laser emitter corner is also known. The angle of the camera corner can be determined by looking at the location of the laser dot in the camera's field of view. These three pieces of information fully determine the shape and size of the triangle and give the location of the laser dot corner of the triangle.Franca, J. G. D., Gazziro, M. A., Ide, A. N., & Saito, J. H. (2005, September). A 3D scanning system based on laser triangulation and variable field of view. In Image Processing, 2005. ICIP 2005. IEEE International Conference on (Vol. 1, pp. I-425). IEEE. In most cases a laser stripe, instead of a single laser dot, is swept across the object to speed up the acquisition process. The National Research Council of Canada was among the first institutes to develop the triangulation based laser scanning technology in 1978.  Strengths and weaknesses  Time-of-flight and triangulation range finders each have strengths and weaknesses that make them suitable for different situations. The advantage of time-of-flight range finders is that they are capable of operating over very long distances, on the order of kilometres. These scanners are thus suitable for scanning large structures like buildings or geographic features. The disadvantage of time-of-flight range finders is their accuracy. Due to the high speed of light, timing the round-trip time is difficult and the accuracy of the distance measurement is relatively low, on the order of millimetres. Triangulation range finders are exactly the opposite. They have a limited range of some meters, but their accuracy is relatively high. The accuracy of triangulation range finders is on the order of tens of micrometers. Time-of-flight scanners' accuracy can be lost when the laser hits the edge of an object because the information that is sent back to the scanner is from two different locations for one laser pulse. The coordinate relative to the scanner's position for a point that has hit the edge of an object will be calculated based on an average and therefore will put the point in the wrong place. When using a high resolution scan on an object the chances of the beam hitting an edge are increased and the resulting data will show noise just behind the edges of the object. Scanners with a smaller beam width will help to solve this problem but will be limited by range as the beam width will increase over distance. Software can also help by determining that the first object to be hit by the laser beam should cancel out the second. At a rate of 10,000 sample points per second, low resolution scans can take less than a second, but high resolution scans, requiring millions of samples, can take minutes for some time-of-flight scanners. The problem this creates is distortion from motion. Since each point is sampled at a different time, any motion in the subject or the scanner will distort the collected data. Thus, it is usually necessary to mount both the subject and the scanner on stable platforms and minimise vibration. Using these scanners to scan objects in motion is very difficult. Recently, there has been research on compensating for distortion from small amounts of vibration and distortions due to motion and/or rotation. When scanning in one position for any length of time slight movement can occur in the scanner position due to changes in temperature. If the scanner is set on a tripod and there is strong sunlight on one side of the scanner then that side of the tripod will expand and slowly distort the scan data from one side to another. Some laser scanners have level compensators built into them to counteract any movement of the scanner during the scan process.  Conoscopic holography  In a conoscopic system, a laser beam is projected onto the surface and then the immediate reflection along the same ray-path are put through a conoscopic crystal and projected onto a CCD. The result is a diffraction pattern, that can be frequency analyzed to determine the distance to the measured surface. The main advantage with conoscopic holography is that only a single ray-path is needed for measuring, thus giving an opportunity to measure for instance the depth of a finely drilled hole.Sirat, G., & Psaltis, D. (1985). Conoscopic holography. Optics letters, 10(1), 4-6. = Hand-held laser scanners = Hand-held laser scanners create a 3D image through the triangulation mechanism described above: a laser dot or line is projected onto an object from a hand-held device and a sensor (typically a charge-coupled device or position sensitive device) measures the distance to the surface. Data is collected in relation to an internal coordinate system and therefore to collect data where the scanner is in motion the position of the scanner must be determined. The position can be determined by the scanner using reference features on the surface being scanned (typically adhesive reflective tabs, but natural features have been also used in research work) or by using an external tracking method. External tracking often takes the form of a laser tracker (to provide the sensor position) with integrated camera (to determine the orientation of the scanner) or a photogrammetric solution using 3 or more cameras providing the complete six degrees of freedom of the scanner. Both techniques tend to use infra red light-emitting diodes attached to the scanner which are seen by the camera(s) through filters providing resilience to ambient lighting.Trost, D. (1999). U.S. Patent No. 5,957,915. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Data is collected by a computer and recorded as data points within three- dimensional space, with processing this can be converted into a triangulated mesh and then a computer-aided design model, often as non-uniform rational B-spline surfaces. Hand-held laser scanners can combine this data with passive, visible-light sensors ‚Äî which capture surface textures and colors ‚Äî to build (or \\"reverse engineer\\") a full 3D model. = Structured light = Structured-light 3D scanners project a pattern of light on the subject and look at the deformation of the pattern on the subject. The pattern is projected onto the subject using either an LCD projector or other stable light source. A camera, offset slightly from the pattern projector, looks at the shape of the pattern and calculates the distance of every point in the field of view. Structured-light scanning is still a very active area of research with many research papers published each year. Perfect maps have also been proven useful as structured light patterns that solve the correspondence problem and allow for error detection and error correction.[24] [See Morano, R., et al. \\"Structured Light Using Pseudorandom Codes,\\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. The advantage of structured-light 3D scanners is speed and precision. Instead of scanning one point at a time, structured light scanners scan multiple points or the entire field of view at once. Scanning an entire field of view in a fraction of a second reduces or eliminates the problem of distortion from motion. Some existing systems are capable of scanning moving objects in real-time. VisionMaster creates a 3D scanning system with a 5-megapixel camera ‚Äì 5 million data points are acquired in every frame. A real-time scanner using digital fringe projection and phase- shifting technique (certain kinds of structured light methods) was developed, to capture, reconstruct, and render high-density details of dynamically deformable objects (such as facial expressions) at 40 frames per second. Recently, another scanner has been developed. Different patterns can be applied to this system, and the frame rate for capturing and data processing achieves 120 frames per second. It can also scan isolated surfaces, for example two moving hands. By utilising the binary defocusing technique, speed breakthroughs have been made that could reach hundreds to thousands of frames per second. = Modulated light = Modulated light 3D scanners shine a continually changing light at the subject. Usually the light source simply cycles its amplitude in a sinusoidal pattern. A camera detects the reflected light and the amount the pattern is shifted by determines the distance the light travelled. Modulated light also allows the scanner to ignore light from sources other than a laser, so there is no interference. = Volumetric techniques = Medical  Computed tomography (CT) is a medical imaging method which generates a three-dimensional image of the inside of an object from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images, similarly Magnetic resonance imaging is another medical imaging technique that provides much greater contrast between the different soft tissues of the body than computed tomography (CT) does, making it especially useful in neurological (brain), musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and oncological (cancer) imaging. These techniques produce a discrete 3D volumetric representation that can be directly visualised, manipulated or converted to traditional 3D surface by mean of isosurface extraction algorithms.  Industrial  Although most common in medicine, Industrial computed tomography, Microtomography and MRI are also used in other fields for acquiring a digital representation of an object and its interior, such as non destructive materials testing, reverse engineering, or studying biological and paleontological specimens. = Non- contact passive = Passive 3D imaging solutions do not emit any kind of radiation themselves, but instead rely on detecting reflected ambient radiation. Most solutions of this type detect visible light because it is a readily available ambient radiation. Other types of radiation, such as infra red could also be used. Passive methods can be very cheap, because in most cases they do not need particular hardware but simple digital cameras. * Stereoscopic systems usually employ two video cameras, slightly apart, looking at the same scene. By analysing the slight differences between the images seen by each camera, it is possible to determine the distance at each point in the images. This method is based on the same principles driving human stereoscopic vision. * Photometric systems usually use a single camera, but take multiple images under varying lighting conditions. These techniques attempt to invert the image formation model in order to recover the surface orientation at each pixel. * Silhouette techniques use outlines created from a sequence of photographs around a three-dimensional object against a well contrasted background. These silhouettes are extruded and intersected to form the visual hull approximation of the object. With these approaches some concavities of an object (like the interior of a bowl) cannot be detected.  Photogrammetric non-contact passive methods  Images taken from multiple perspectives such as a fixed camera array can be taken of a subject for a photogrammetric reconstruction pipeline to generate a 3D mesh or point cloud. Photogrammetry provides reliable information about 3D shapes of physical objects based on analysis of photographic images. The resulting 3D data is typically provided as a 3D point cloud, 3D mesh or 3D points. Modern photogrammetry software applications automatically analyze a large number of digital images for 3D reconstruction, however manual interaction may be required if a software cannot automatically solve the positions of the photos which is an essential step in the reconstruction pipeline. Various software packages are available including PhotoModeler, Geodetic Systems, Autodesk ReCap and RealityCapture (see comparison of photogrammetry software). *Close range photogrammetry typically uses a handheld camera such as a DSLR with a fixed focal length lens to capture images of objects for 3D reconstruction. Subjects include smaller objects such as a building facade, vehicles, sculptures, rocks, and shoes. *Camera Arrays can be used to generate 3D point clouds or meshes of live objects such as people or pets by synchronizing multiple cameras to photograph a subject from multiple perspectives at the same time for 3D object reconstruction. *Wide angle photogrammetry can be used to capture the interior of buildings or enclosed spaces using a wide angle lens camera such as a 360 camera. *Aerial photogrammetry uses aerial images acquired by satellite, commercial aircraft or UAV drone to collect images of buildings, structures and terrain for 3D reconstruction into a point cloud or mesh.  Reconstruction  From point clouds = The point clouds produced by 3D scanners and 3D imaging can be used directly for measurement and visualisation in the architecture and construction world. = From models = Most applications, however, use instead polygonal 3D models, NURBS surface models, or editable feature-based CAD models (aka Solid models). * Polygon mesh models: In a polygonal representation of a shape, a curved surface is modeled as many small faceted flat surfaces (think of a sphere modeled as a disco ball). Polygon models‚Äîalso called Mesh models, are useful for visualisation, for some CAM (i.e., machining), but are generally \\"heavy\\" ( i.e., very large data sets), and are relatively un-editable in this form. Reconstruction to polygonal model involves finding and connecting adjacent points with straight lines in order to create a continuous surface. Many applications, both free and nonfree, are available for this purpose (e.g. GigaMesh, MeshLab, PointCab, kubit PointCloud for AutoCAD, Reconstructor, imagemodel, PolyWorks, Rapidform, Geomagic, Imageware, Rhino 3D etc.). * Surface models: The next level of sophistication in modeling involves using a quilt of curved surface patches to model the shape. These might be NURBS, TSplines or other curved representations of curved topology. Using NURBS, the spherical shape becomes a true mathematical sphere. Some applications offer patch layout by hand but the best in class offer both automated patch layout and manual layout. These patches have the advantage of being lighter and more manipulable when exported to CAD. Surface models are somewhat editable, but only in a sculptural sense of pushing and pulling to deform the surface. This representation lends itself well to modelling organic and artistic shapes. Providers of surface modellers include Rapidform, Geomagic, Rhino 3D, Maya, T Splines etc. * Solid CAD models: From an engineering/manufacturing perspective, the ultimate representation of a digitised shape is the editable, parametric CAD model. In CAD, the sphere is described by parametric features which are easily edited by changing a value (e.g., centre point and radius). These CAD models describe not simply the envelope or shape of the object, but CAD models also embody the \\"design intent\\" (i.e., critical features and their relationship to other features). An example of design intent not evident in the shape alone might be a brake drum's lug bolts, which must be concentric with the hole in the centre of the drum. This knowledge would drive the sequence and method of creating the CAD model; a designer with an awareness of this relationship would not design the lug bolts referenced to the outside diameter, but instead, to the center. A modeler creating a CAD model will want to include both Shape and design intent in the complete CAD model. Vendors offer different approaches to getting to the parametric CAD model. Some export the NURBS surfaces and leave it to the CAD designer to complete the model in CAD (e.g., Geomagic, Imageware, Rhino 3D). Others use the scan data to create an editable and verifiable feature based model that is imported into CAD with full feature tree intact, yielding a complete, native CAD model, capturing both shape and design intent (e.g. Geomagic, Rapidform). For instance, the market offers various plug-ins for established CAD-programs, such as SolidWorks. Xtract3D, DezignWorks and Geomagic for SolidWorks allow manipulating a 3D scan directly inside SolidWorks. Still other CAD applications are robust enough to manipulate limited points or polygon models within the CAD environment (e.g., CATIA, AutoCAD, Revit). = From a set of 2D slices = 3D reconstruction of the brain and eyeballs from CT scanned DICOM images. In this image, areas with the density of bone or air were made transparent, and the slices stacked up in an approximate free-space alignment. The outer ring of material around the brain are the soft tissues of skin and muscle on the outside of the skull. A black box encloses the slices to provide the black background. Since these are simply 2D images stacked up, when viewed on edge the slices disappear since they have effectively zero thickness. Each DICOM scan represents about 5 mm of material averaged into a thin slice. CT, industrial CT, MRI, or Micro-CT scanners do not produce point clouds but a set of 2D slices (each termed a \\"tomogram\\") which are then 'stacked together' to produce a 3D representation. There are several ways to do this depending on the output required: * Volume rendering: Different parts of an object usually have different threshold values or greyscale densities. From this, a 3-dimensional model can be constructed and displayed on screen. Multiple models can be constructed from various thresholds, allowing different colours to represent each component of the object. Volume rendering is usually only used for visualisation of the scanned object. * Image segmentation: Where different structures have similar threshold/greyscale values, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called segmentation, a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image. Image segmentation software usually allows export of the segmented structures in CAD or STL format for further manipulation. * Image-based meshing: When using 3D image data for computational analysis (e.g. CFD and FEA), simply segmenting the data and meshing from CAD can become time- consuming, and virtually intractable for the complex topologies typical of image data. The solution is called image-based meshing, an automated process of generating an accurate and realistic geometrical description of the scan data. = From laser scans = Laser scanning describes the general method to sample or scan a surface using laser technology. Several areas of application exist that mainly differ in the power of the lasers that are used, and in the results of the scanning process. Low laser power is used when the scanned surface doesn't have to be influenced, e.g. when it only has to be digitised. Confocal or 3D laser scanning are methods to get information about the scanned surface. Another low-power application uses structured light projection systems for solar cell flatness metrology, enabling stress calculation throughout in excess of 2000 wafers per hour. The laser power used for laser scanning equipment in industrial applications is typically less than 1W. The power level is usually on the order of 200 mW or less but sometimes more. = From Photographs = See Photogrammetry.  Applications  Construction industry and civil engineering = * Robotic control: e.g. a laser scanner may function as the \\"eye\\" of a robot.Landmark detection by a rotary laser scanner for autonomous robot navigation in sewer pipes, Matthias Dorn et al., Proceedings of the ICMIT 2003, the second International Conference on Mechatronics and Information Technology, pp. 600- 604, Jecheon, Korea, Dec. 2003 * As-built drawings of bridges, industrial plants, and monuments * Documentation of historical sitesRemondino, Fabio. \\"Heritage recording and 3D modeling with photogrammetry and 3D scanning.\\" Remote Sensing 3.6 (2011): 1104-1138. * Site modelling and lay outing * Quality control * Quantity surveys * Payload monitoring * Freeway redesign * Establishing a bench mark of pre-existing shape/state in order to detect structural changes resulting from exposure to extreme loadings such as earthquake, vessel/truck impact or fire. * Create GIS (geographic information system) maps and geomatics. * Subsurface laser scanning in mines and Karst voids. * Forensic documentation http://www.leica-geosystems.us/forensic/ = Design process = * Increasing accuracy working with complex parts and shapes, * Coordinating product design using parts from multiple sources, * Updating old CD scans with those from more current technology, * Replacing missing or older parts, * Creating cost savings by allowing as-built design services, for example in automotive manufacturing plants, * \\"Bringing the plant to the engineers\\" with web shared scans, and * Saving travel costs. = Entertainment = 3D scanners are used by the entertainment industry to create digital 3D models for movies, video games and leisure purposes. They are heavily utilized in virtual cinematography. In cases where a real-world equivalent of a model exists, it is much faster to scan the real-world object than to manually create a model using 3D modeling software. Frequently, artists sculpt physical models of what they want and scan them into digital form rather than directly creating digital models on a computer. = 3D photography = 3D selfie in 1:20 scale printed by Shapeways using gypsum-based printing, created by Madurodam miniature park from 2D pictures taken at its Fantasitron photo booth. Fantasitron 3D photo booth at Madurodam 3D scanners are evolving for the use of cameras to represent 3D objects in an accurate manner.Curless, B., & Seitz, S. (2000). 3D Photography. Course Notes for SIGGRAPH 2000. Companies are emerging since 2010 that create 3D portraits of people (3D figurines or 3D selfieshttps://www.3dgeneration.com/3d-figuren/). = Law enforcement = 3D laser scanning is used by the law enforcement agencies around the world. 3D Models are used for on-site documentation of:https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/forensic-response/crime-scene- documentation *Crime scenes *Bullet trajectories *Bloodstain pattern analysis *Accident reconstruction *Bombings *Plane crashes, and more = Reverse engineering = Reverse engineering of a mechanical component requires a precise digital model of the objects to be reproduced. Rather than a set of points a precise digital model can be represented by a polygon mesh, a set of flat or curved NURBS surfaces, or ideally for mechanical components, a CAD solid model. A 3D scanner can be used to digitise free-form or gradually changing shaped components as well as prismatic geometries whereas a coordinate measuring machine is usually used only to determine simple dimensions of a highly prismatic model. These data points are then processed to create a usable digital model, usually using specialized reverse engineering software. = Real estate = Land or buildings can be scanned into a 3d model, which allows buyers to tour and inspect the property remotely, anywhere, without having to be present at the property. There is already at least one company providing 3d-scanned virtual real estate tours. A typical virtual tour would consist of dollhouse view, inside view, as well as a floor plan. = Virtual/remote tourism = The environment at a place of interest can be captured and converted into a 3D model. This model can then be explored by the public, either through a VR interface or a traditional \\"2D\\" interface. This allows the user to explore locations which are inconvenient for travel. = Cultural heritage = There have been many research projects undertaken via the scanning of historical sites and artifacts both for documentation and analysis purposes. The combined use of 3D scanning and 3D printing technologies allows the replication of real objects without the use of traditional plaster casting techniques, that in many cases can be too invasive for being performed on precious or delicate cultural heritage artifacts. In an example of a typical application scenario, a gargoyle model was digitally acquired using a 3D scanner and the produced 3D data was processed using MeshLab. The resulting digital 3D model was fed to a rapid prototyping machine to create a real resin replica of the original object.  Michelangelo  In 1999, two different research groups started scanning Michelangelo's statues. Stanford University with a group led by Marc Levoy used a custom laser triangulation scanner built by Cyberware to scan Michelangelo's statues in Florence, notably the David, the Prigioni and the four statues in The Medici Chapel. The scans produced a data point density of one sample per 0.25 mm, detailed enough to see Michelangelo's chisel marks. These detailed scans produced a large amount of data (up to 32 gigabytes) and processing the data from his scans took 5 months. Approximately in the same period a research group from IBM, led by H. Rushmeier and F. Bernardini scanned the Piet√† of Florence acquiring both geometric and colour details. The digital model, result of the Stanford scanning campaign, was thoroughly used in the 2004 subsequent restoration of the statue.  Monticello  In 2002, David Luebke, et al. scanned Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. A commercial time of flight laser scanner, the DeltaSphere 3000, was used. The scanner data was later combined with colour data from digital photographs to create the Virtual Monticello, and the Jefferson's Cabinet exhibits in the New Orleans Museum of Art in 2003. The Virtual Monticello exhibit simulated a window looking into Jefferson's Library. The exhibit consisted of a rear projection display on a wall and a pair of stereo glasses for the viewer. The glasses, combined with polarised projectors, provided a 3D effect. Position tracking hardware on the glasses allowed the display to adapt as the viewer moves around, creating the illusion that the display is actually a hole in the wall looking into Jefferson's Library. The Jefferson's Cabinet exhibit was a barrier stereogram (essentially a non-active hologram that appears different from different angles) of Jefferson's Cabinet.  Cuneiform tablets  The first 3D models of cuneiform tablets were acquired in Germany in 2000. In 2003 the so-called Digital Hammurabi project acquired cuneiform tablets with a laser triangulation scanner using a regular grid pattern having a resolution of . With the use of high-resolution 3D-scanners by the Heidelberg University for tablet acquisition in 2009 the development of the GigaMesh Software Framework began to visualize and extract cuneiform characters from 3D-models. It was used to process ca. 2.000 3D-digitized tablets of the Hilprecht Collection in Jena to create an Open Access benchmark dataset and an annotated collection of 3D-models of tablets freely available under CC BY licenses.  Kasubi Tombs  A 2009 CyArk 3D scanning project at Uganda's historic Kasubi Tombs, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, using a Leica HDS 4500, produced detailed architectural models of Muzibu Azaala Mpanga, the main building at the complex and tomb of the Kabakas (Kings) of Uganda. A fire on March 16, 2010, burned down much of the Muzibu Azaala Mpanga structure, and reconstruction work is likely to lean heavily upon the dataset produced by the 3D scan mission.  \\"Plastico di Roma antica\\"  In 2005, Gabriele Guidi, et al. scanned the \\"Plastico di Roma antica\\", a model of Rome created in the last century. Neither the triangulation method, nor the time of flight method satisfied the requirements of this project because the item to be scanned was both large and contained small details. They found though, that a modulated light scanner was able to provide both the ability to scan an object the size of the model and the accuracy that was needed. The modulated light scanner was supplemented by a triangulation scanner which was used to scan some parts of the model.  Other projects  The 3D Encounters Project at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology aims to use 3D laser scanning to create a high quality 3D image library of artefacts and enable digital travelling exhibitions of fragile Egyptian artefacts, English Heritage has investigated the use of 3D laser scanning for a wide range of applications to gain archaeological and condition data, and the National Conservation Centre in Liverpool has also produced 3D laser scans on commission, including portable object and in situ scans of archaeological sites. The Smithsonian Institution has a project called Smithsonian X 3D notable for the breadth of types of 3D objects they are attempting to scan. These include small objects such as insects and flowers, to human sized objects such as Amelia Earhart's Flight Suit to room sized objects such as the Gunboat Philadelphia to historic sites such as Liang Bua in Indonesia. Also of note the data from these scans is being made available to the public for free and downloadable in several data formats. = Medical CAD/CAM = 3D scanners are used to capture the 3D shape of a patient in orthotics and dentistry. It gradually supplants tedious plaster cast. CAD/CAM software are then used to design and manufacture the orthosis, prosthesis or dental implants. Many Chairside dental CAD/CAM systems and Dental Laboratory CAD/CAM systems use 3D Scanner technologies to capture the 3D surface of a dental preparation (either in vivo or in vitro), in order to produce a restoration digitally using CAD software and ultimately produce the final restoration using a CAM technology (such as a CNC milling machine, or 3D printer). The chairside systems are designed to facilitate the 3D scanning of a preparation in vivo and produce the restoration (such as a Crown, Onlay, Inlay or Veneer). = Quality assurance and industrial metrology = The digitalisation of real-world objects is of vital importance in various application domains. This method is especially applied in industrial quality assurance to measure the geometric dimension accuracy. Industrial processes such as assembly are complex, highly automated and typically based on CAD (Computer Aided Design) data. The problem is that the same degree of automation is also required for quality assurance. It is, for example, a very complex task to assemble a modern car, since it consists of many parts that must fit together at the very end of the production line. The optimal performance of this process is guaranteed by quality assurance systems. Especially the geometry of the metal parts must be checked in order to assure that they have the correct dimensions, fit together and finally work reliably. Within highly automated processes, the resulting geometric measures are transferred to machines that manufacture the desired objects. Due to mechanical uncertainties and abrasions, the result may differ from its digital nominal. In order to automatically capture and evaluate these deviations, the manufactured part must be digitised as well. For this purpose, 3D scanners are applied to generate point samples from the object's surface which are finally compared against the nominal data. The process of comparing 3D data against a CAD model is referred to as CAD-Compare, and can be a useful technique for applications such as determining wear patterns on moulds and tooling, determining accuracy of final build, analysing gap and flush, or analysing highly complex sculpted surfaces. At present, laser triangulation scanners, structured light and contact scanning are the predominant technologies employed for industrial purposes, with contact scanning remaining the slowest, but overall most accurate option. Nevertheless, 3D scanning technology offers distinct advantages compared to traditional touch probe measurements. White- light or laser scanners accurately digitize objects all around, capturing fine details and freeform surfaces without reference points or spray. The entire surface is covered at record speed without the risk of damaging the part. Graphic comparison charts illustrate geometric deviations of full object level, providing deeper insights into potential causes. Timeline of 3D Laser Scanners = Circumvention of shipping costs and international import/export tariffs = 3D Scanning can be used in conjunction with 3D printing technology to virtually teleport certain object across distances without the need of shipping them and in some cases incurring import/export tariffs. For example, a plastic object can be 3d scanned in the United States, the files can be sent off to a 3d printing facility over in Germany where the object is replicated, effectively teleporting the object across the globe. In the future, as 3D scanning and 3D printing technologies become more and more prevalent, governments around the world will need to reconsider and rewrite trade agreements and international laws.

She was the second empress of her husband Emperor Guangwu (Liu Xiu), even though she married him as his wife before his first empress, Guo Shengtong, did. She was famed for her beauty and meekness. (Her posthumous name started a trend for the rest of the Eastern Han, where empresses' posthumous names were formed not just from their husbands' posthumous names, as was customary during the preceding Western Han, but used part of their husbands' posthumous names along with an additional descriptive character.)  Family background and marriage to Liu Xiu  Yin Lihua was born and grew up in Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan) -- the same commandery that her eventual husband came from. While they were young, he was enamored with her beauty. According to Hou Han Shu, when Liu Xiu was visiting the capital Chang'an, he became impressed with the mayor of the capital (zhijinyu, Âü∑ÈáëÂêæ) and, already impressed by Yin's beauty, he made the remarks: \\"If I were to be an official, I want to be zhijinyu; if I were to marry, I want to marry Yin Lihua\\". Yin's father Yin Mu (Èò¥Áù¶) died early when she was six. Her mother's family name was Deng (ÈÑß). She had at least four brothers‚ÄîYin Xing (Èô∞Ëàà), Yin Jiu (Èô∞Â∞±), Yin Shi (Èô∞Ë≠ò), and Yin Xin (Èô∞Ë®¢). Yin Xing and Yin Xin were born of the same mother as she; Yin Shi was born of her father's previous wife; it is not clear who was the mother of Yin Jiu.) According to Hou Han Shu, the Yins were descended from the famed Spring and Autumn period Qi prime minister Guan Zhong. In 23, while Liu Xiu was an official in the newly reestablished Han government of Gengshi Emperor, he was married to Yin Lihua. Later, when he was dispatched by Gengshi Emperor to the region north of the Yellow River, she returned home.  As imperial consort  Liu Xiu eventually broke away from Gengshi Emperor, and he proclaimed himself emperor of Han in 25 (as Emperor Guangwu). Later that year, when he captured Luoyang to be his capital, he dispatched subordinates to bring Yin to the capital and made her an imperial consort. At that time, however, he was also married to Guo Shengtong, the niece of the regional warlord Liu Yang (ÂäâÊ•ä), the Prince of Zhending, and Guo had given birth to a son, Liu Jiang (ÂäâÁñÜ). In 26, Emperor Guangwu was prepared to create an empress, and he favored his first love, Consort Yin. However, Consort Yin had not yet had a son by that point, and she declined the empress position and endorsed Consort Guo. Emperor Guangwu therefore made Guo empress and her son Prince Jiang crown prince. In 28, Consort Yin gave birth to her first-born son, Liu Yang (ÂäâÈôΩ, not to be confused with Empress Guo's uncle). In 33, Lady Deng and Yin Xin were killed by robbers. Emperor Guangwu greatly mourned them, and he made Yin Jiu a marquess and tried to make Yin Xing a marquess as well, but the humble Yin Xing declined and further instructed Consort Yin to be always humble and not seeking to honor her relatives. She took the advice to heart. As imperial consort, even though Consort Yin was not empress, she continued to be favored by Emperor Guangwu as his first love. She (like Empress Guo) bore him five sons.  As empress  By 41, Empress Guo had long lost the emperor's favor. She continuously complained about that fact, and this angered Emperor Guangwu. In 41, he deposed her and made Consort Yin empress instead. Rather than imprisoning Guo (as is often the fate of deposed empresses), however, he made her son Liu Fu (ÂäâËºî) the Prince of Zhongshan and made her the Princess Dowager of Zhongshan. He made her brother Guo Kuang (ÈÉ≠Ê≥Å) an important official and, perhaps as a form of alimony, rewarded him with great wealth. Not having the heart to depose mother and son, Emperor Guangwu initially left Guo's son, Crown Prince Jiang, as crown prince. Crown Prince Jiang, however, realizing that his position was precarious, repeatedly offered to step down. In 43, Emperor Guangwu agreed and Prince Yang, the oldest son of Empress Yin, crown prince instead. He also changed Prince Yang's name to Zhuang (Ëéä). Empress Yin was not mentioned frequently in history while she was empress‚Äîa sign that she was not trying to exert much influence as empress. However, her three brothers all became powerful officials and marquesses, even though they generally were low key and did not seek high offices on their own. She greatly favored former Empress Guo's youngest son Liu Yan, the Prince of Zhongshan, and after Empress Guo died in 52, she treated him as her own son. Emperor Guangwu died in 57, and was succeeded by Crown Prince Zhuang (as Emperor Ming). Empress Yin received the title of empress dowager.  As empress dowager  Empress Dowager Yin appeared to exert a moderate amount of influence on her son, but far less than past empresses dowagers. In 59, a tragedy would strike Empress Dowager Yin's family. The son of her brother Yin Jiu, the Marquess of Xinyang, Yin Feng (Èô∞Ë±ê), had married Liu Xiu's daughter (it is not clear whether she was also Empress Dowager Yin's daughter) Liu Shou (ÂäâÁ∂¨), the Princess Liyi. Princess Liyi was arrogant and jealous, and Yin Feng, in anger, killed her and was executed. Yin Jiu and his wife then committed suicide. (However, even after this, Yin Jiu continued to be posthumously highly regarded, and was praised in a later edict by Empress Dowager Yin's daughter-in-law Empress Ma.) In 60, at Empress Dowager Yin's endorsement, Emperor Ming created Consort Ma, Ma Yuan's daughter, whom Empress Dowager Yin had favored because of her meekness and lack of jealousy‚Äîperhaps because these traits mirrored her own‚Äîempress. Also in 60, Emperor Ming and Empress Dowager Yin made a rare visit to Emperor Guangwu and Empress Dowager Yin's home territory of Nanyang, where they spent days in banquet with Empress Dowager Yin's more distant Deng and Yin relations. Empress Dowager Yin died in 64 at the age of 59 and was buried with her husband, Emperor Guangwu.  References  * Book of Later Han, vol. 10, Part 1. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 39, 40, 43, 44, 45.

He is currently Edwin B. Kyle Professor of Christian Studies and Chair of the Religious Studies Department at the University of Virginia. As a theologian and philosopher, Hart's work epitomizes the \\"theological turn\\" in phenomenology, with a focus on figures like Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida. He has received multiple awards for his poetry, including the Christopher Brennan Award and the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry twice. Biography Hart was born on 5 July 1954 to James Henry Hart and his wife, Rosina Mary Wooton. Hart's family moved to Brisbane, Australia, in 1966. Hart attended secondary school at Oxley State High School, and gained his Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the Australian National University. Hart received his PhD from the University of Melbourne in 1986. In 1991 he became Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Monash University, rising to full Professor in 1995 and also becoming Director of the Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies and the Institute for Critical and Cultural Studies. He also taught in the Centre for Studies in Religion and Theology. Leaving Monash in 2002, he became Professor of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Notre Dame, a position he held until 2007, when he became Edwin B. Kyle Professor of Christian Studies at the University of Virginia, a position he holds as of 2019. Theology and literary criticism In his professional life, Kevin Hart is primarily known as a theologian who works in two areas: systematic theology and religion and literature. His work in systematic theology has not yet been collected into volumes but remains as uncollected essays and chapters. In general, Hart's approach is to ground theology in a phenomenology of the Christ, both a phenomenology of Jesus's words and actions, and an account of Jesus as performing epoche and reduction, especially through the parables. On Hart's understanding, the preaching of the Kingdom brings forth Christ's death and that preaching is confirmed by the Resurrection. His work on the Christian mystical tradition is focused on practices of contemplation.Kevin Hart, \\"Contemplation: Beyond and Beneath,\\" Sophia 48 (2009), 435‚Äì59 In terms of religion and literature, Hart has written extensively on English and French poetry and Christianity, especially Christian mysticism. Recent work has converged on Geoffrey Hill.Kevin Hart, \\"God‚Äôs Little Mountains: Young Geoffrey Hill and the Problem of Religious Poetry,\\" Sacred Worlds: Religion, Literature, and the Imagination (2009), ed. Mark Knight and Louise Lee (Continuum), 23‚Äì36; \\"Transcendence in Tears,\\" Gazing Through a Prim Darkly, ed. Keith Putt (New York: Fordham University Press, 2009), 116‚Äì38; and \\"‚Äôit / is true,‚Äô\\" Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology, ed. Bruce Benson and Norman Wirzba (Fordham University Press), 68‚Äì86. One facet of his work is extensive commentary on the writing of the atheist Maurice Blanchot to whom he has devoted four books: The Dark Gaze, The Power of Contestation, Nowhere without No, and Clandestine Encounters. Hart's analysis on Blanchot was praised by Peter Craven as combining \\"an attractive expository technique with an openness to speculative ideas\\". His work on Jacques Derrida and Samuel Johnson has also been praised, although one critic said that Hart's work on Johnson was \\"dubious\\" \\"and inconsistent in approach\\". Poetry Hart's interests in poetry were piqued by an English teacher's presentation of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias. In addition to Shelley, Hart also cites T. S. Eliot, Charles Baudelaire, Paul √âluard, Vasko Popa, Zbigniew Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins as influences. He first began writing poetry as a teenager, partly thanks to a Shelley anthology he had purchased and partly as an excuse to enjoy the Public Library's air conditioning during Brisbane's hot summers. Critics have noted religious and philosophical themes in Hart's poetry.Paul Kane, \\"Philosopher- Poets: John Koethe and Kevin Hart,\\" Raritan 21: 1 (2001), 109‚Äì110 As Toby Davidson writes, \\"Kevin Hart's poetry cannot be separated from his multiple, enduring engagements with mysticism and mystical poetics. He is an innovator, suggesting new approaches to the mystical in the free facets of *attending*.\\" Toby Davidson \\"Beyond Reach of Language: Kevin Hart and Christian Mysticism,\\" Literature and Theology 24: 3 (2010), 282 Michael Brennan notes that the philosophical connection stems out of Hart's \\"long study into phenomenology\\", specifically connecting Hart's \\"The Room\\" to Heidegger's philosophy.Michael Brennan, \\"In Absentia: Mourning and Friendship,\\" Jacket 27 (2005) Similarly, David McCooey detects the influence of Jacques Derrida, specifically Hart's use of metaphor and perspective. Erotic and sensual themes are also pronounced in Hart's work. Nathaniel O'Reilly notes, for example, that even though most criticism of Hart focuses on his religious themes, Hart is also an \\"intensely physical and sensual poet\\".Nathanael O'Reilly, IRWE 6: 2 (2010), 1 O'Reilly further says that Hart often links physical sensations with spiritual connections. Hart's volume Flame Tree was considered, then rejected, for the English Literature Victorian Certificate of Education in Victoria, Australia, on grounds of obscenity. The objectionable line was \\"My semen hot and wild inside your cunt.\\" In his own defense, Hart claimed, \\"I was very surprised to think that the line could offend 18-year-olds these days. I suppose there will always be parents who are outraged about something in the curriculum.... In Australia ‚Äòcunt‚Äô is often used by lovers, women and men alike, and no offence need be given or taken. It can be said very tenderly....\\" Paul Mitchell Interviews Kevin Hart =Reception= Hart's poetry has garnered multiple awards, including the Greybeal-Gowen Prize for Poetry in 2008, the John Shaw Neilson Poetry Award in 1977, the Mattara Poetry Award in 1982, 11the Wesley Michel Wright Award in 1984, the NSW Premier's Award in 1985, the Victorian Premier's Award in 1985, days wuiajathe Grace Leven Prize for Poetry in 1991 and 1996, the Christopher Brennan Award in 1999. Critical response to Hart's poetry has varied. Harold Bloom, writing on the back cover of Kevin Hart's 1999 volume of poetry, Wicked Heat, strongly praised Hart, saying that he is the \\"most outstanding Australian poet of his generation\\", and one of \\"the major living poets in the English language\\". Bloom also names Hart as one of the eleven canonical writers of Australia and New Zealand in his book, The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages, specifically praising Hart's book Peniel and Other Poems.Bloom, The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1994), p 561 Other critics, such as Cyril Wong and Christian Sheppard, have also praised Hart's poetry. Some critics such as Geoffrey Lehmann and Pam Brown, however, have expressed negative views of Hart's work. while Christian Sheppard, reviewing the same volume, said \\"The primary pleasure of Hart's poetry, however, is an easy rhythmed, swiftly flowing line tracing the moment-by-moment impressions of an often impassioned yet always lucid mind\\". Lehmann, for instance, found Hart's 2008 volume, Young Rain to be self-indulgent and lacking in clear, specific meaning. Kevin Gardner, an American critic and professor, has noted that Hart‚Äôs poems \\"have an annoying tendency toward abstraction\\" and a \\"narcissistic symbolism\\" that frustrates with \\"surreal obfuscation.\\" Examples from Hart's poems that Gardner cites include \\"the curved eyelids of a young hand,\\" \\"you kiss / Like a slack orchid tongue in Cairns,\\" death \\"folded tightly / Like a parachute,\\" \\"let‚Äôs eat the splinters in the house,\\" \\"And filch a little mouse called fear.\\" Published works ;Books of Poetry *The Departure, University of Queensland Press, 1978 *The Lines of Your Hand, Angus & Robertson, 1981, *Your Shadow, HarperCollins Publishers Australia, 1984, *Peniel Golvan Arts, 1991. *New and Selected Poems HarperCollins Publishers, 1995, *Dark Angel, Dedalus Press, 1996, *Nineteen Songs, Vagabond Press, 1999 *Wicked Heat Paper Bark Press, 1999, *Madonna, Vagabond Press, 2000 *Flame Tree Bloodaxe, 2002, *Night Music, Lexicon House, 2003 *Young Rain Bloodaxe Books, 2009, *Morning Knowledge, University of Notre Dame Press, 2011, ;Criticism *; Fordham Univ Press, 2000, *A.

The Rhubarb Triangle (or Tusky Triangle, from a Yorkshire word for rhubarb) is a area of West Yorkshire, England between Wakefield, Morley and Rothwell famous for producing early forced rhubarb. It includes Kirkhamgate, East Ardsley, Stanley, Lofthouse and Carlton. The Rhubarb Triangle was originally much bigger, covering an area between Leeds, Bradford and Wakefield. From the 1900s to 1930s, the rhubarb industry expanded and at its peak covered an area of about . Rhubarb is native to Siberia and thrives in the wet cold winters in Yorkshire. West Yorkshire once produced 90% of the world's winter forced rhubarb from the forcing sheds that were common across the fields there. In February 2010, Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb was awarded Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Commission‚Äôs Protected Food Name scheme after being recommended by Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Cultivation Rhubarb shed in the Rhubarb Triangle The cultivation method for forced rhubarb was developed in the early 1800s. The fields were fertilised with large quantities of horse manure and 'night soil' from the nearby urban areas and woollen waste from \\"mungo and shoddy\\" mills. The rhubarb plants spend two years out in the fields without being harvested. While in the fields the plants store energy from the sun in their roots as carbohydrates. The roots are subjected to frost before being moved into sheds in November where they are kept in complete darkness. In the sheds the plants begin to grow in the warmth and the stored carbohydrate in the roots is transformed into glucose resulting in forced rhubarb's sour-sweet flavour. The sheds are long low buildings which are heated; originally with coal, which was plentiful and relatively cheap in the area, but this has been replaced by diesel. Forced rhubarb grown in the sheds is more tender than that grown outdoors in summer. Without daylight the rhubarb leaves are a green-yellow colour, and the stalks, measuring around , are crimson in colour with a smooth texture. Traditionally, the pickers pull the stalks in candlelight as any exposure to strong light will stop the growth. By the end of March the harvest is over and the root stock is totally exhausted and used for compost.  History  Growing and forcing rhubarb was originally done by many hundreds of small farmers, smallholders and market gardeners. In later years some growers expanded and owned many thousands of roots and extensive forcing sheds. In the late 19th century early forced rhubarb was sent to Spitalfields and Covent Garden markets in London in time for Christmas and was sent to Paris for the French market. A special express train carrying rhubarb was run by the Great Northern Railway Company from Ardsley station every weekday night during the forced rhubarb season from Christmas until Easter. Up to 200 tons of rhubarb sent by up to 200 growers was carried daily at the peak of production before 1939. In 1962, a rail strike caused the growers to look for alternative transport and the service ended shortly after. A permanent exhibition about forced rubarb is on display at Wakefield Museum. Rhubarb became less popular after the Second World War when more exotic fruits became more available. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the name \\"rhubarb triangle\\" to a 1965 textbook mentioning pre-war trains rhubarb specials that ran from the West Riding rhubarb triangle to London and it was mentioned in the Guardian newspaper in 1986. =EU recognition of Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb= Carlton village sign celebrates its link with rhubarb Twelve farmers who farm within the Rhubarb Triangle applied to have the name \\"Yorkshire forced rhubarb\\" added to the list of foods and drinks that have their names legally protected by the European Commission's Protected Food Name scheme. The application was successful and the farmers in the Rhubarb Triangle were awarded Protected Designation of Origin status (PDO) in February 2010. Food protected status accesses European funding to promote the product and legal backing against other products made outside the area using the name. Other protected names include Stilton cheese, Champagne and Parma Ham. Leeds Central MP, Hilary Benn, was involved in the Defra campaign to win protected status. Culture Wakefield Council holds an annual Rhubarb Festival in February, celebrating the area's links and promoting the surviving rhubarb industry. A Farmers' Market, cookery demonstrations, walks and tours of the forcing sheds are among the attractions. In 2005 Wakefield council erected a sculpture depicting a rhubarb plant in Holmfield Park Wakefield. Rhubarb growing and the 'Rhubarb Express' are featured in Wakefield Museum. In Frances Brody's 2019 novel The Body on the Train (Piatkus: ) a murdered man's body is found on a rhubarb train from Ardsley, on its arrival at King's Cross. The book's cover illustration features boxes of rhubarb on a platform beside a train.

In the inaugural issue of the Journal of Interactive Advertising,http://jiad.org/article1.html editors Li and Leckenby (2000) defined interactive advertising as the \\"paid and unpaid presentation and promotion of products, services and ideas by an identified sponsor through mediated means involving mutual action between consumers and producers\\". This is most commonly performed through the internet; often through the use of an ad server that can deliver a variety of interactive advertising units.  Objectives  The goals of interactive advertising are usually akin to the traditional objectives of advertising, i.e. to sell a product. This in turn means that many of the traditional elements of advertising impact and effectiveness remain relevant, even within the scope of interactive media. However, according to the Journal of Interactive Advertising 2001, interactive advertising also has some properties that expand the range of potential objectives and that improve advertising effectiveness. Interactive advertising also has the potential to decrease the losses associated with poorly coordinated advertising, to reduce the difficulties commonly encountered in clearly communicating an advertising message and to help overcome new product hurdles.  Advantages  * Interactive advertising allows consumers to interpret advertisements in unique ways and understandings, and sheds light on the increasing significance of the consumer‚Äôs role in determining the value of marketing campaigns in modern society. * Interactive advertising encourages consumers to actively engage in the marketing communications themselves to input feedback, neglect irrelevant elements, and absorb content that appeals to them. * As consumerism becomes more prominent within the global economy and social interactions become more significant in establishing healthy long-term relationships with consumers, interactive advertising also grows in importance because it triggers greater motivation for social interaction between potential consumers and suppliers.  Disadvantages  * Whilst interactive advertising may be highly appealing to a prepared audience, it is difficult, costly and time-consuming to prepare, especially for target markets that have yet to be properly identified and analyzed. * Interactive advertising has greater benefits in industries where creativity helps to capture the attention of buyers. In some markets however, there is little room for this, and excessive use of creativity can become a form of noise that disrupts the conveying of intended messages to consumers.  Elements  There are many different facets to interactive advertising, including varying methods and types. Using many different types of cognitive tools and advert presentations, organizations can enhance the impact of their campaigns with this type of advertising. According to Thorson (1996), all advertisements can be classified into one of five basic categories, including product/service, public service announcement, issue, corporate and political. Advert types also interact with the user's motives to influence outcomes, or consumer responses, reinforcing the need for Interactive Advertising as a means of persuading potential consumers and target audiences. Using the Internet as the main medium for interactive advertising to study the methods, types and outcomes, we can then sound out the different user or advertiser controlled aspects.  User generated/controlled aspects  Functions, Internet motives and mode are the main factors of user controlled aspects. In fact, a number of researchers and practitioners argue that consumers have more control on the Internet than do advertisers (Roehm & Haugtvedt, 1999). Some have gone so far as to argue that interactive marketing and advertising techniques will not work unless practitioners \\"step into the shoes\\" of and approach the Internet from the consumer's vantage point (Cross & Smith, 1997).  Advertiser controlled aspects  Various aspects of Internet advertising are under the control of the advertiser. Most of these variables include structural elements, such as ad types, formats and features. This does not mean that consumers never control the structure of the interactive ads. Banner Ads, sponsorship, hyperlinks and non-carrier websites are examples of advertiser controlled interactive advertising.

The town is within the Shire of Collie. The town's name comes from the Worsley River, a tributary of the Collie River, which is located nearby. The river was named after Charles Anderson-Pelham, Lord Worsley, a member of the Western Australian Land and Emigration Committee, which also included James Stirling, John Hutt, William Hutt (MP), Edward Barrett-Lennard and Captain Bunbury. The committee promoted emigration to the Swan River colony and the Western Australian Land Company, which established the Australind land settlement project in 1841 under Marshall Clifton. The name was first recorded in surveys performed in the area in 1845. In the 1890s a railway siding was constructed in the area to service the timber industry, and later in 1906 the state government decided to create a town-site in the area. Lots were surveyed in 1907 and the town was gazetted in 1909. The town peaked in 1902 when its population was in excess of 1,500 people but it began to decline in the 1920s and saw the town all but disappear by the 1950s. In 1984 construction of the Worsley Alumina refinery began and the area experienced an unexpected revival.

She took part in the Falklands War as a logistics ship tasked with resupplying the Argentine garrisons scattered around the Falkland Islands. Captured by British forces on 15 June after running aground at Fox Bay, she sank in deep waters while being used as target practice by the Royal Navy on 21 October 1982. History The ship was constructed by Halifax Shipbuilding Limited at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and commissioned in June 1950 for service under the Transporte Navales command. In 1958 she carried the crew of the new aircraft carrier to the United Kingdom. The vessel participated in numerous Antarctic supply missions. In October 1966, she transported the passengers, crew and hijackers of Aerolineas Argentinas DC-4 LV-AGG from the Falkland Islands to Ushuaia. The aircraft had been hijacked by a group of Argentine nationalists and flown to the islands three days earlier. On 10 March 1969 she made a trip to Europe, visiting cities such as Genova, Brugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Portsmouth, Edinburgh, and Dublin. The purpose of the trip was to carry wheat to Europe and bring military items to Argentina. While sailing through the English Channel, she collided with the tanker Asprella and was repaired at the Ferrol shipyard in Vigo, Spain. In 1972 she began regular service between the continent and the Falkland Islands. =Falklands war= The ship landed scrap- metal workers on South Georgia on 19 March 1982. She was involved in the blockade running to the Falkland Islands. She sailed from Stanley towards Falklands Sound on 29 April, before the first British attack. While heading to the south on 6 May, the ship spotted the schooner Penelope, property of the Falkland Islands Company, at anchor along a pier in Speedwell Island. The small craft was taken over by an Argentine prize crew the following day. While berthed in Fox Bay East on West Falkland, she was attacked by two BAe Sea Harrier FRS.Mk.1s (XZ500 and ZA191) from . Because the ship was so close to private homes, the Sea Harriers used their 30 mm ADEN cannons rather than general-purpose bombs. They damaged the ship's bridge and engine room, and set fire to a paint store and workshop ashore. One of the Sea Harriers was hit in the tail by a 7.62 mm bullet while strafing the transport; the aircraft was able to return to Hermes safely. After the attack the ship did not sail again and remained moored in Fox Bay East. During a storm, she partially tore loose from her moorings and the bow swung onto the beach. After the war, Bah√≠a Buen Suceso was towed to San Carlos Water by the tug Irishman. Her cargo of ammunition was unloaded. = Fate = On 21 October 1982 her hull was towed out to deep water where it was sunk by a combination of naval gunfire and fire from Sea Harrier FRS.Mk.1s from 809 Naval Air Squadron. The ship was also hit by a torpedo from the submarine .

Because its origin, its flow varies widely within the year, and it can dry out in some parts of its path during the winter. The only important tributary to the river is the Horcones River, which is born in Salta as Caj√≥n River, and joins the Salado in the Santiago del Estero Province. Higher Salado The Salado originates on the eastern edge of the Altiplano under the name of Juramento River at the Andes range, from thaw and captured precipitations of the high Acay and Cachi mountains in the Salta Province, near Catamarca Province. The Cabra Corral Dam regulates its flow, and deviates some of it for irrigation. When the river enters the Gran Chaco plains it forms several arms in a broad riverbed only partially occupied. Santiago del Estero The river then enters the Santiago del Estero Province from the north, near the border with the Tucum√°n Province, receiving the name of Salado. The Salado and the Dulce River (\\"Sweet River\\") south to it, run diagonally in direction south-east, and are the most important rivers to cross the arid lands of Santiago del Estero, being the economic and demographic axis of the province. The flow of the river is regulated in the Figueroa Department by the Los Figueroa Reservoir, and by a Derivation Dam (Dique Derivador) that re-routes part of its waters to irrigation canals of up to long. Further downstream, the river forms wide marsh wetlands and areas flooded seasonally, during the summer's major high waters. Downstream of the A√±atuya marshlands the streamflow is greatly reduced, rendering the river dry most of the year. Lower Salado After a course of inside Santiago del Estero, the river reaches the Santa Fe Province as Salado del Norte (\\"Northern Salty\\") to finally join the Paran√° River in that province, being the last important tributary to the Paran√°. The more abundant rainfall in Santa Fe Province causes the Salado's discharge to increase. During rainy summers, the river can overflow its riverbed producing floods. A 2003 flood severely affected the city of Santa Fe. The Salado debouches into the Paran√° River southeast of Santa Fe City, in a flooding area with lagoons. Other Argentine rivers called Salado There are other, less important Salado rivers in Argentina, the most important of them being: *In Buenos Aires Province, the R√≠o Salado starts at the El Cha√±ar lagoon and runs southeast some to the Samboromb√≥n Bay. *In Mendoza Province, San Luis Province and La Pampa Province, the Desaguadero-Salado runs down to the Colorado River. *In Catamarca Province and La Rioja Province, the local Colorado river is also referred to as Salado River (La Rioja).

He was a very influential preacher in London of the 1640s, and also one of the most ferocious polemical writers of the time, arguing from a conservative Presbyterian point of view against the Independents. Life He graduated M.A. from Queens' College, Cambridge in 1625, and became a well-known preacher. He continued to reside at Cambridge, where, after taking orders, he was appointed a university preacher, nicknamed 'Young Luther.' In February 1627 he preached a sermon in which he counselled his hearers not to seek carnal advice when in doubt; declared he would testify and teach no other doctrine though the day of judgment were at hand, and was committed to prison until he could find bonds for his appearance before the ecclesiastical courts. After being frequently summoned before the courts, he received an order on 31 March 1628 to make a public recantation of his teaching in St. Andrew's Church, with which he complied on 6 April. Edwards did not remain much longer at Cambridge, and in 1629 a Thomas Edwards was licensed to preach in St. Botolph's, Aldgate. His career was cut short by William Laud.:s:Edwards, Thomas (1599-1647) (DNB00) He was later able to campaign once more against 'popish innovations and Arminian tenets' at various city churches, at Aldermanbury, and in Coleman Street. In July 1640, on the delivery at Mercers' Chapel of a proudly nonconformist sermon he was prosecuted in the high commission court. He preached where he considered his services were most needed: Christchurch, London, Hertford, Dunmow, and Godalming to which at one time he commuted with three or four journeys a week from London. His base in London from 1644 was Christ Church, Newgate, an important Presbyterian centre.Bremer-Webster He was particularly concerned about religious sectarianism in the army, opposing the tendency emerging as the Levellers but not yet known as such. He overplayed his hand against the military, in July 1647. With other ministers in London, he encouraged a popular occupation of Parliament, to get reversed the measures taken to exclude eleven Presbyterian leaders. From 26 July for about a week the Presbyterian side, with City of London backing, were apparently in power in London. The Army then moved in, taking back control by 4 August.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Religion, the Reformation, and Social Change (1967), pp. 326-7. Edwards went into exile in the Netherlands, and died of ague before the end of the year. Gangraena His major work was Gangraena from 1646, a large catalogue of sectarian Protestant views, written from a fearsomely adversarial point of view and treating them as heresies. He hoped that the list would silence or damage his opponents, but they responded, criticising Presbyterianism. Other writings His first book was Reasons Against the Independent Government of Particular Congregations of 1641, an attack on religious tolerance and the Independent faction as it was coming to importance, and addressed to Parliament.

Archived on 14 September 2013 It is the largest refugee camp in Jordan, followed by the Zaatari refugee camp. History Baqa'a was one of six \\"emergency\\" camps set up in Jordan in 1968 to house Palestinians who left the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1967 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war. Between June 1967 and February 1968, residents were housed in temporary camps in the Jordan valley. When Baqa'a was set up it had 5,000 tents for 26,000 refugees on an area of about 1.4 square kilometres. UNRWA replaced the tents with 8,048 prefabricated shelters between 1969‚Äì1971 with contributions from West Germany. Most of the residents have since then replaced the original tents and prefabs with concrete shelters. Facilities During the 2003‚Äì04 school term, the 16 schools in the camp enrolled 16,718 students, and had 493 paid employees on the teaching staff, with each school run on a double-shift basis in eight school buildings. The UN also runs a general clinic, and two mother-and-child clinics, which jointly treat around 1,200 patients every day, and which are staffed by 12 doctors, two dentists, and 57 nurses and assistants; there is also a kindergarten and nursery financed by UNRWA. Two women's programs run courses in sewing, hairdressing, computers, Internet, exercise, English, legal consultancy, and handicrafts. There are also two sports clubs and 17 charities operating in the camp. The camp houses a market, called Souq Al-Hal-lal, where residents can earn some money selling their wares or food, and many also earn a living by traveling by bus in the morning to Amman, where they work as cleaning or maintenance staff.

Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008 The identity of Amenemhat V is debated by a minority of Egyptologists, as he could be the same person as Sekhemkare Amenemhat Sonbef, the second ruler of the 13th Dynasty. Attestations Amenemhat V is attested on column 7, line 7 of the Turin canon, which credits him with a reign of three to four years. This may be confirmed by a papyrus from Lahun which mentions a year three, some months and days of a king Sekhemkare, which could either be Amenemhat V or Sonbef. In addition, Amenemhat V is attested by a single artefact contemporaneous with his lifetime, a statue of him from Elephantine, originally set up in the Temple of Satet and inscribed with the following dedication: The head and arms of the statue were discovered in the 19th century in the ruins of a temple built to honor a nomarch named Heqaib and are in Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The body of the statue bearing the above inscription was discovered in the year 1932 and is now in the Aswan Museum. Identity There is a debate between Egyptologists as whether Sekhemkare Amenemhat V is the same king as Sekhemkare Sonbef, whom Kim Ryholt, J√ºrgen von Beckerath and Darrell Baker see as the 2nd ruler of the 13th Dynasty. Indeed, Sonbef called himself \\"Amenemhat Sonbef\\", which Ryholt argues must be understood as \\"Amenemhat [Sa] Sonbef\\", The Son of Amenemhat Sonbef, i.e. Sonbef would be the son of Amenemhat IV. In particular, they see Sonbef and Amenemhat V as two different rulers. Ryholt and Baker further posit that Sonbef's and Amenemhat's rules were separated by the ephemeral reign of Nerikare, while von Beckerath believes it was Sekhemre Khutawy Pantjeny who reigned between the two.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt, 1964J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgyptens, M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien 46.

X, and is located in the Municipio I. Its emblem consists of a black dragon's head on a white background. This symbol comes from the legend that Pope Silvester I threw out a dragon staying in the Forum Romanum.  History  Some of the major vestiges of the Ancient Rome are located in the area, such as the Palatine Hill, the Campidoglio and the Roman Forum. When in the Middle Ages the new administrative subdivision of the city was adopted, Campitelli was the 12th and last rione. It was called Campitelli in Sancti Adriani, after the deconsecrated church of Sant'Adriano al Foro. Since the 12th century, the Palazzo Senatorio became the seat of the Senatore di Roma (Senator of Rome), the principal civic authority of the city in the Middle Ages. The Palazzo Senatorio and the basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli are the only remaining features of the medieval construction industry in the rione. The rione experienced relevant urban modifications between 1536 and 1546, after Pope Paul III commissioned to Michelangelo the refurbishment of the Campidoglio and of the nearby piazza, in order to receive Emperor Charles V. Michelangelo's project was brought to completion only in 18th century by Carlo Rainaldi, who built the baroque church of Santa Maria in Campitelli. The appearance of the area changed relevantly between 19th and 20th century, after the construction of the Victor Emmanuel II Monument and after the massive demolitions performed by the Fascist government. In 1921 a part of Campitelli was detached and merged into the newly created rione Celio.  Geography Boundaries= Northward, the rione borders with Pigna (R. IX), whose border is marked by Via di San Marco, Largo Enrico Berlinguer and Piazza Venezia, and also with Trevi (R. II), from which is separated by Piazza Venezia itself and Piazza della Madonna di Loreto. Eastward, the rione borders with Monti (R. I), the boundary being marked by the whole Via dei Fori Imperiali, and with Celio (R. XIX), from which is separated by Piazza del Colosseo, Via di San Gregorio and Piazza di Porta Capena. Southward, the border with Ripa (R. XII) is defined by Via dei Cerchi, Via di San Teodoro, Via dei Fienili, Piazza della Consolazione and Vico Jugario. To the west, the rione borders with Sant'Angelo (R.

Often written as rione XI - Sant'Angelo, it has a coat of arms with an angel on a red background, holding a palm branch in its left hand. In another version, the angel holds a sword in its right hand and a scale in its left. The scale refers not to the symbolic scales of justice, but rather to the weighing of fish; Rome's fish market was located here throughout almost 1,400 years. In its first version, the coat of arms, the coat of Arms of Sant'Angelo displayed a silver fish on a red field. Sant'Angelo, the smallest of Rome's rioni, lies along the Tiber river east of Tiber Island. Rioni bordering this district, clockwise from north to south, include Regola, Sant'Eustachio, Pigna, Campitelli, and Ripa. Sant'Angelo's western border is the river. The rione's terrain is low and flat and, until recent times, particularly susceptible to flooding from the river. The historical significance of Sant'Angelo is mainly the result of the presence here of the Roman Ghetto.  History  Roman Age: Circus Flaminius = Model of imperial Rome, 4th century AD, looking north to the southern portion of the Circus Flaminius regio. The D-shaped building in the center is the Theater of Marcellus; furthern north (near the top of the image) is the Theater of Balbus, with the Crypta Balbi to the right. The large open area in the upper left is what remains of the Circus; on its northeast side are, from left to right, the porticoes of Philippus and Octavia. During the early Roman period, the territory occupied by Sant'Angelo lay outside the Servian walls, east of the island. This location, at a point where the river could be forded easily (at least in summer) had great strategic importance. The Cestian and Fabrician bridges, built during the 1st century BC to connect the island with the right and the left bank, respectively, increased the importance of the area.The oldest stone bridge of Rome, the Pons Aemilius, completed in 142 BC, stood slightly south of the island. During the Empire, the district was part of IX Circus Flaminius, one of fourteen Roman regiones. The regio was named after the Circus Flaminius, the second-largest circus of Rome, built here during the 3rd century BC by Gaius Flaminius. The CircusThe Circus was the site of Comitia Plebis as well as the starting point for Roman triumphs. Staccioli, 208. stood near the Capitoline Hill and the Forum. Augustus intended the area near the Circus to be part of Rome's monumental center, with buildings devoted to dramatic performances (such as the theaters of MarcellusThe construction began under Caesar and finished under Augustus. The theatre, dedicated to Augustus' dead nephew Marcellus, could hold 15,000 spectators. Staccioli, 204. and BalbusBuilt by L. Cornelius Balbus in 13 BC, this was the smallest but the most exclusive of Rome's three theaters of Rome. It featured a cryptoportico, whose remains are still visible today in Via delle Botteghe Oscure. Staccioli, 208.) and temples. Moreover, two magnificent porticos, both built in the tradition of Republican-era porticoes, were built toward the end of the 1st century BC: the Porticus Octaviae and the Porticus Philippi. The first was built by Augustus, who dedicated it to his sister Octavia,The original portico was actually built by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus in 146 BC, and was rebuilt by Augustus. It contained Greek and Latin libraries as well as a set of 34 bronze statues by Lysippos, portraying Alexander the Great with soldiers who felln during the battle of Granicus. The portico also contained the temples of Juno Regina and of Jupiter Stator. Staccioli, 206. the second was erected by his stepfather Philippus.The Porticus Philippi was rebuilt in 29 BC, on the site of a portico built in 168 BC by Gnaeus Octavius. The Portico contained the temple of Hercules Musagetes, erected by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior. Staccioli, 208. Part of the area used for these buildings was obtained at the expense of the Circus Flaminius, which was partially dismantled by Augustus.Staccioli, 208. = Middle Ages: Sant'Angelo in foro piscium = The old fish market (\\"La Pescheria\\") in via del Portico d'Ottavia (ca.1860). The marble slabs where the fish was sold are visible on both sides of the road. The houses on the left were demolished together with the Ghetto in 1885, while those on the right are still in place, and host some of the best Jewish restaurants in the Ghetto. After the end of the Empire the monumental edifices collapsed,The Emperor Valentinian I in the second half of the fourth century demolished part of the scaena of the theater of Marcellus to rebuild the Pons Cestius. Delli, 819. but some of them were transformed into fortresses. Several factors played an important role in this transformation: first, the size and solidity of construction; then, the closeness to the Tiber (after the rupture of the aqueducts during the Gothic war, the river became the only source of drinking water for the city). Finally, the possibility of controlling the access to the right bank via the Pons Fabricius, Cestius and Aemilius,Known later as\\"Ponte rotto\\" (\\"broken bridge\\"). the only bridges which were still in place inside the Aurelian walls by that time. The baronal families of the Fabii and later of the Savelli, which owned also the stronghold on the Aventine named Corte Savella, nested inside the theatre of Marcellus, while inside the Theater and the Crypta of Balbus the Stefaneschi built the stronghold known as Castrum aureum (\\"golden castle\\"), which later was donated to the monastery of Santa Caterina. The fish market moved from the Forum Piscarium, located near the Forum Romanum, into the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, which kept this function up to the end of the 19th century, becoming one of the most picturesque places in Rome. During the Middle Ages the district got the name of Vinea Thedemari, while its northern part was named Calcar√†rio, after the limekilns (\\"Calc√†re\\"), which throughout centuries produced quicklime obtained by burning the marbles of the Roman Fora. Later appeared also the appellation Sant'Angelo, after the most important church of the rione, Sant'Angelo in Foro Piscium (\\"St. Angel in the Fish Market\\"). This church, erected in 770 AD inside the Propylea of the Portico of Octavia, had a great historical importance during the Middle Ages. From here, on the Whitsunday of 1347, the Romans, led by Cola di Rienzo, launched the assault on the Capitol, attempting to restore the Roman Republic. Being a quarter inhabitanted mainly by people belonging to the working-class, Sant'Angelo, like the neighboring districts of Regola and Ripa, hosted many guilds: near the church of Santa Caterina were active the rope makers,These gave the name to the church, which was called Santa Caterina dei Funari (\\"St. Catherine by the rope-makers\\"). This is actually the only church in Rome whose name does not come from the patronage of a Guild, but from the closeness of the workers which exercised this job to the church. Pietrangeli. who twisted their ropes in the 60 m long porticoed yard of the Crypta Balbi. Along the Botteghe Oscure (\\"Dark shops\\")--as the arcades of the Theater of Balbus were called-- was produced quicklime, while smiths and coppersmiths had their shops inside the arcades of the theater of Marcellus.The last coppersmiths worked there until the restoration of the theater in 1926. Finally, carders and shearers worked near the church of San Valentino,The church of San Valentino dei Mercanti was pulled down shortly after 1870. Pietrangeli, 66. while fish mongers were placed under the Portico d'Ottavia, where they sold the fishes on marble slabs which were expensively rented by the noble Roman families. On the wall near the Portico is still visible a copy of the marble plaque (the original can be seen in the Musei Capitolini), whose length gives the maximum size of the fishes which could be sold whole. Those which were longer would have their heads cut off. These had to be given as a perquisite to the Conservatori (the town councillors of papal Rome), who used them to prepare a fish soup.The inscription said \\"CAPITA PISCIUM HOC MARMOREO SCHEMATE LONGITUDINE MAIORUM USQUE AD PRIMAS PINNAS INCLUSIVE CONSERVATORIBUS DANTO\\" in English: The heads of fish longer than the markings on this marble shall be given to the counsellors, up to and including the first fins.. Delli, 83. The most typical activity in the market was the fish auction, known as cott√≠o, which took place every night after 2 a.m. Particularly popular in Rome was the cott√≠o on December 23. Many Romans attended it to buy the fish needed for the dinner of Christmas Eve, and many more just to watch the show. It marked the beginning of the Christmas holidays.Zanazzo, 160. = Renaissance: Serraglio delli Ebrei = Disappeared Ghetto: via Rua in a watercolour by Ettore Roesler Franz (ca 1880 ). Via Rua (Rua is a word analogue to the French rue) was the main road in the old Ghetto. There were active many shops of second-hand clothes. The Renaissance reached Sant'Angelo around the middle of the 15th century. At that time Lorenzo Manili, a noble Roman antiquarian enthusiastic about his city, built his house with a fa√ßade containing Roman bas-reliefs and a long inscription in Latin, where he praises the rebirth of the Eternal City.The house lies near the north end of Via del Portico d'Ottavia. Above the windows can still be read the sentence \\"HAVE ROMA\\". Pietrangeli, 48. In the 16th century, the Savelli had built on the top of the Theatre of Marcellus a beautiful palace, the work of Baldassarre Peruzzi, later owned by the Orsini. In the meantime, in the north side of the rione, another powerful family, the Mattei, erected four palaces,The four Palazzi are known as: Mattei di Giove (masterpiece of Carlo Maderno), of Giacomo Mattei (work of Nanni di Baccio Bigio), Mattei di Paganica, and of Alessandro Mattei (now Caetani). Pietrangeli. which together formed a whole block, named \\"Isola dei Mattei\\" (\\"Mattei's block\\").The view of the yard of Palazzo Mattei di Giove in spring, decorated with Roman statues and reliefs, and flooded with rambling roses, teaches us more than many books about the life in Rome during the Renaissance. Other noble families too, like the Costaguti, Santacroce and Serlupi, chose to build their residences here in that period. But, while the wind of the Renaissance was starting to blow around Rome, another event changed deeply the destiny of the rione: the arrival of the Jews. A Jewish colony was present in Rome since the beginning of the Christian era, but the Jews by then had been living in Transtiberim, near the Port of Ripa Grande. Because of the decay of the river trade, at the beginning of the 15th century they left the right bank and scattered through the city. By that time, in Rome there were about 2,000 Jews: 1,200 were living in Sant'Angelo (where they totaled 80 per cent of the population), 350 in Regola, 200 in Ripa, while the others were distributed among the remaining districts.Delli, 435. On 14 July 1555, Pope Paul IV, one of the champions of the Counter-Reformation, promulgated the Bull \\"Cum nimis absurdum\\", where he revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and enclosed them in a walled district,The wall was built under the direction of the architect Giovanni Sallustio Peruzzi. The money for its construction ‚Äì 300 scudi ‚Äì had to be paid by the Jewish community. the Ghetto. The Christians who were owners of the houses placed inside the Ghetto could keep the property but, thanks to the so-called \\"jus gazzag√†\\" (right of possession) they could neither evict the Jews nor raise the rents.Around 1860 a large apartment in Ghetto had to be rented for 30 Scudi per month. The rent had remained the same since the reign of Urban VIII. The same apartment on the free market cost 450 Scudi. About, 96. The wall was interrupted by two gates,Later in the sixteenth century the gates became three: under Sixtus V five, and finally, during the nineteenth century eight. These increases were caused by successive enlargement of the Area.

The area had a trapezoidal shape, and contained hardly any noteworthy buildings.

Pietrangeli, 45. ‚Äì was divided in two parts by the wall. All the churches which stood in the Ghetto were deconsecrated and demolished soon after its construction. The Roman Jews were allowed to practice only unskilled jobs, as ragmen, secondhand dealersDe Rossi, 222. or fish mongers. They could also be pawnbrokers, and this activity excited the hate of the Christians against them. In the lottery game, they were allowed to bet only on low numbers (from 1 through 30), and all belonging to the same group of 10.This law was established because, since the Jews had the reputation of being sorcerers, the Romans believed that they could win by witchcraft. Otherwise, usually the Italian lottery is played betting on up to five numbers ranging from 1 through 90. Zanazzo, 143. In case of a draw of five numbers of that kind, the Romans said that on that day in the Ghetto there was taking place a great feast.Zanazzo, 144. When they went outside their district, the men had to wear a yellow cloth (the \\"sciamanno\\"), and the women a yellow veil (the same color worn by prostitutes). During the feasts they had to amuse the Christians, competing in humiliating games. They had to run naked, with a rope around the neck, or with their legs closed into sacks. Sometimes they were also ridden by soldiers.These habits were usual also before the erection of the Ghetto. For example, Pope Alexander VI was a fan of such competitions. He chose not to pave the new road named Borgo nuovo, which he opened in the year 1500 in Borgo, in order to keep a better ground for the runners. Each year, on the Campidoglio, the rabbi had to pay homage to the chief of the city councillors (\\"Caporione\\"), receiving by him in exchange for it a kick to his bottom. This \\"ceremony\\" meant that the Jewish community had been allowed to stay one more year in Rome.This tradition was interrupted by Pius IX in 1847. About, 96. Every Saturday, the Jewish community was forced to hear compulsory sermonsIt is told that many Jews closed their ears with wax in order not to hear the sermon. in front of the small church of San Gregorio a Ponte Quattro Capi, just outside the wall.On the fa√ßade of the church there is still an inscription of the prophet Isaiah (LXV, 2-3) in Hebrew and Latin, complaining about the stubbornness of the Jewish people. At the time of its construction, in the Ghetto ‚Äì as almost everywhere in Rome ‚Äì there was no fresh water. However, some years later the Popes built several fountains in the rione,The most beautiful fountain, La Fontana delle tartarughe (\\"The fountain of the tortoises\\"), designed by Giacomo della Porta and built by the Florentine sculptor Taddeo Landini, was erected in Piazza Mattei, in the north part of the rione. Its water comes from the aqueduct named Aqua Felice, built under Sixtus V. Delli. and one was placed in Piazza Giudea.The fountain, another work of Giacomo della Porta, is now in Via del Progresso. The great number of people living in such a small area,The area of the Ghetto, after the enlargement under Sixtus V, was slightly larger than three hectares. Pietrangeli, 44. together with the poverty of the population, caused terrible hygienic conditions. The district, lying very low and near the Tiber, was often flooded. During the plague of 1656, 800 of 4,000 inhabitants died because of the epidemic.Pietrangeli, 44. Sant'Angelo, which was the rione with the smallest area, was also, thanks to the presence of the Ghetto, the one having the largest population density. =Modern Age= Sant'Angelo in 1777 (Map printed by Monaldini). On the southern part of the map ‚Äì enclosed by a wall ‚Äì is visible the Ghetto. The 17th and the 18th centuries passed without noteworthy events: the center of gravity of the Church had already moved from the Lateran to the Vatican and Borgo, and the Capitol lost its importance as a residential area in favor of the Campo Marzio plain. Things started to change again with the French Revolution. During the Roman republic, in 1798, the gates of The Ghetto were finally opened, and the Tree of Freedom was planted in Piazza Giudea. The fall of Napoleon caused the compulsory return of the Jews to the walled district. In 1848, Pius IX ordered the demolition of the walls but, because of the resistance of the Romans, the task had to be accomplished during the night. Anyway, it was only after September 20, 1870, that the Roman Jews ceased to be considered as second-class citizens. After the unification of Italy huge transformations affected the district. Great walls were built along the river, in order to avoid prevent flooding, and this caused the demolition of the picturesque row of houses which were mirrored in the Tiber. The Ghetto, although the Jews were now free citizens, was always crowded with the Jewish community,It was said that the Jews, who once had to live there against their will, now stayed there for love. Delli, 435. but the hygienic conditions forced a radical solution. The whole quarter was pulled down in 1885, spending much more than the originally budgeted five millions Lire, and new buildings, whose style unfortunately doesn't match with the old ones, arose around the new Synagogue. The only part of Sant'Angelo which can still give an idea of the old Ghetto is that along the lane named Via della Reginella, which was included in the walled district only during the 19th century.The Rothschild family gave the capital necessary to buy this area. During the twenties of last century, Sant'Angelo was affected by the great demolition works started in the center of Rome by the Fascist regime. In 1926, the quarter around the Theater of Marcellus was pulled down, while the monument was isolated and restored. Many picturesque medieval structures, lanes and squares disappeared but, on the other hand, this work revealed certain Roman temples.The temples of Apollo Sosianus and of Bellona were unearthed by the archeologists at that time. Moreover, also beautiful medieval housesThe house of the Vallati and the albergo della catena were restored at this time. up to then hidden under later accretions, could be carefully restored. Then, in 1940, in the north side of the rione Via delle Botteghe Oscure was drastically enlarged, and there also churches and palaces fell victim to the pickaxe. After the demolitions during the Fascist period, it was decided to modify the historical borders of the rione, established in 1743 under Benedict XIV. Sant'Angelo then spread out, incorporating small but important parts of the adjacent districts of Campitelli and Ripa.Among other things, the churches of Santa Maria in Campitelli and of San Gregorio della divina Piet√† became then part of the rione. During the German occupation of Rome in World War II, the Jewish community was forced to pay 50 kg gold to the SS, in order to avoid the deportation to the Nazi concentration camps. On October 16, 1943, despite the payment of the ransom, 2,091 Jews were deported, and most of them died in Auschwitz. Many others were also killed on March 24, 1944, at the Fosse Ardeatine. = Sant'Angelo today= Via dei Falegnami viewed from Piazza Mattei. At the dawn of the 21st century Sant'Angelo remains one of the most characteristic districts in the old Rome. While the northern part of the rione, with its web of narrow, lonely lanes which protect it from the traffic, keeps a mainly residential character, the southern part is always characterized by the strong Jewish presence. The roads around the Portico d'Ottavia keep the atmosphere of a village, and host several small shops (also run by Jews) and many Trattorie, which, with their fried artichokes and filet of stockfish, perpetuate the tradition of the Jewish Roman cooking. The presence of a strong Jewish community makes necessary a continuous ‚Äì albeit discreet ‚Äì presence of Police and Carabinieri, deployed above all near the Synagogue in order to prevent attacks. Sant'Angelo hosts also several cultural institutions, such as the Enciclopedia Italiana, the Discoteca Nazionale and the Centro di Studi Americani, which holds the most important library of Americana in Europe.Pietrangeli, 12.  Geography Borders= To the north, Sant'Angelo borders with Pigna (R. IX), from which is separated by Via delle Botteghe Oscure and Via Florida. To the east, the rione borders with Campitelli (R. X), whose border is marked by Via d'Aracoeli, Via Margana, Piazza Margana, Via dei Delfini, Via Cavalletti, Piazza di Campitelli, Via Montanara and Via del Teatro di Marcello. Southward, it borders with Ripa (R. XII), the boundary being outlined by Via del Foro Olitorio, Lungotevere dei Pierleoni, Ponte Fabricio and the Tiber, beside the Tiber Island. To the west, the rione borders with Regola, from which is separated by Piazza delle Cinque Scole and Via di Santa Maria del Pianto. It also borders with Sant'Eustachio (R.

It defines the company's ethical strategies and describes the image of the company.  Role  Not only does corporate behaviour play various roles within different areas of a business, it also enables businesses to overcome any problems they may face. For example, due to an increase in globalisation, language barriers are likely to increase for organisations creating major problems as day-to-day business may be disrupted. Corporate behaviour enables managers to overcome this problem by improving flexibility. Also, many businesses are struggling to remain competitive in terms of quality and productivity due to intense competition within markets. However, corporate behaviour is able to fix this issue by allowing managers to empower their employees as they are the ones who are able to make a change. Positive corporate behaviour can result in employees feeling happy and content at work providing their best outcome. This is beneficial for management as it could lead to effective teams being created thus resulting in innovative ideas which is beneficial for the business. It also helps to decrease labour turnover enabling the organisation to retain its most valuable employees.  Importance  Corporate behaviour is important in strengthening relationships within organisations between individuals, teams, and in the organisation as a whole. It is important as it reflects the values of the business and the extent to which it is ethical. Corporate behavior refers to the company values that defines it and makes it different and better than other companies. Portraying positive corporate behavior within a company facilitates strong brand image creation; consequently branding then strengthens the importance associated with corporate behavior.  Influential factors  PESTLE factors influence corporate behaviour in many ways. They cause organisations to change the way they operate, however the size and nature of change is dependent upon which factor is causing the change; (political, economic, social, technological, legal, or environmental). = Political = Examples of political factors could be changes in government legislation. This could affect an organisations Corporate behaviour as they would have to change the way they operate in order to implement these changes; some employees may not like the new changes made. = Economic = Recession is an example of an economic factor. If the economy were to be in a recession, businesses may find they have to reduce jobs. This would affect Corporate behaviour as business teams would be short of skills and ideas in order to operate effectively. According to the 2013 National Business Ethics Survey of the US workforce, economy and misconduct are not interdependent, which was the traditional view. The report suggested that even though the economy grew in 2011 and 2013, misconduct in businesses was at its lowest. = Social = Changes in trends and the market is a social factor which affects Corporate behaviour. Organisations may have to change their products or services in order to keep up to date with new trends. In order to do this, employees may be required to learn new skills within a short amount of time to make these changes; relationships between employees and management could be at risk due to these changes. = Technological = Implementing technology within organisations could mean more virtual meetings and fewer face to face meetings. As a result, relationships between management and employees could weaken as a result of less face to face conversations. = Legal = Legislative rules such as tax may increase which would increase an organisations costs. Changes such as, changing the way the organisation operates may have to be made in order to cover these extra costs. = Environmental = Environmental factors could be any factors which prevent damage to the environment. For example, more employees may be required to telework to reduce the number of employees physically travelling to offices thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However this may lead to isolation as communication is reduced, weakening Corporate behaviour within firms.  Stakeholder influence  Businesses have many stakeholders who influence corporate behaviour. However, businesses who adopt the stakeholder theory are likely to appeal more to their stakeholders as they are showing their care and commitment towards them. This helps to strengthen the Corporate behaviour within a firm and reduces the need for stakeholders to demand change.

XII, and it is located in the Municipio I. The coat of arms of the rione depicts a white rudder on a red background, to remind the port of Ripa Grande, that was placed in Trastevere, but faced the rione.  History  The borough has always been urbanized, although not intensively, since the Ancient Rome: at that time, the area included three regiones, Circus Maximus, Piscina Publica and Aventinus. As of 4th century, the bank of the River Tiber in the rione was called Ripa Graeca, after a Greek community that settled there and increased during the following centuries, particularly in 8th century, when the area was inhabited by Greek and Latin people escaped from the iconoclastic persecutions led by Leo III the Isaurian. During the Middle Ages, the northern part of the rione remained unpopulated, with the only exceptions of some fortified monastery and a baronial castle, the Rocca Savella.  Geography  Initially the rione was ampler and included other portions of the city, that were detached in 1921 in order to establish two more rioni, San Saba and Testaccio. =Boundaries= Ripa borders northward with Regola (R. VII), whose border is defined by a stretch of the Tiber near the Tiber Island, between Ponte Garibaldi and Ponte Fabricio; as well as with Sant'Angelo (R.

Her life She was born in the 12th arrondissement of Paris on December 25, 1881 or 1885, the daughter of Osval Heuvelmans, a designer and cabinetmaker from Ath, and Donatilde Sandra, a milliner from Leuze-en-Hainaut. These two cities in Hainaut, Belgium, still preserve works of the artist: a bronze Christ in the museum of history and archeology of Ath and a Pax Armata on the monument to the dead of Leuze. After attending evening classes in sculpture, Heuvelmans was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1904. She studied under the sculptors Laurent Marqueste, Emmanuel Hannaux (fr), and Denys Puech. After an unsuccessful bid in 1908, receiving the first second Grand Prix in 1910, Heuvelmans became the first woman to win the Grande Prix de Rome for sculpture in July 1911 for her work, The Sister of Orestes Guarding Her Brother's Sleep.. Admitted to the Villa Medici, she studied there from January 1912 to December 1914 under the direction of Albert Besnard. On her return to France, Heuvelmans was appointed professor of drawing in the schools of the City of Paris. She installed her studio on the ground floor and the mezzanine of 17, rue des Tournelles in the rear wing of the hotel de Rohan-Gu√©men√©. The hotel's main facade overlooks the Place des Vosges in the 4th arrondissement. She regularly participated in exhibitions at the Salon des artistes fran√ßais where she earned an honorable mention in 1907, then a bronze medal in 1921, and at the Salon des artistes d√©corateurs in the Grand Palais between 1926 and 1933. From 1924 to 1926, she completed commissions for the Manufacture de S√®vres. Lucienne Heuvelmans received the insignia of Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1926 under the Ministry of Fine Arts (Decree of 22 May 1926).

Brohman played professional league for the Penrith Panthers, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Queensland rugby league team. At present, he is working for 2GB on its Continuous Call Team broadcasts, on The Footy Show and makes guest appearances on the Australian version of the ESPN show Pardon the Interruption. In the summer, he plays a small role in the nationally syndicated radio program entitled Summer Weekend Detention which broadcasts from the Sydney studios of 2GB on weekends during the summer months.  Early life Brohman attended Wavell High School in Wavell Heights, one of Brisbane's northern suburbs, and completed his Senior year in 1973. Personal life He has a partner Beverly, and they have two children, daughters Lizzie and Ruby. Playing careerBrisbane= While still at high school, Brohman played first grade for Norths in the Brisbane competition and was developing into a skillful, ball-playing forward with a good kicking game. He was awarded the Norths Player of the Year in 1976 and won Brisbane's Rothmans Medal as the league's best and fairest player in the same year, joining John Brown, Steve Calder, Neville Draper and lookalike Darryl Duncan as winners of the award from the Norths club. =Sydney= Brohman then moved to Sydney and played for the Penrith Panthers, from 1979 to 1983 (being the club's captain from 1982‚Äì83) and again from 1986 to 1987, and the Canterbury Bulldogs in 1984 and 1985. Brohman played two State of Origin matches for Queensland in 1983 and 1986. In his Queensland debut in the opening match of the 1983 State of Origin series at Lang Park in Brisbane, Brohman had his jaw broken by an elbow tackle from Les Boyd, which saw him sidelined for the rest of the season. At the time, Brohman had been tipped to make his Test d√©but in the series against New Zealand starting three days later, and would have been the Panthers' first international had this eventuated. That honour later went to hooker Royce Simmons in 1986. Ironically, the player who came off the bench for Queensland to replace Brohman, Manly-Warringah's Dave Brown, played well enough in the game to be selected in the front row for the test against the Kiwis at Carlaw Park. Brohman later sued Boyd over the incident and the matter was settled out of court. Brohman returned to the playing field for the 1984 NSWRL season with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, where his skills as a talented ball-playing forward under the leadership of Steve Mortimer helped the club to their Grand Final victory over the Parramatta Eels. His last match was for Penrith Panthers in the 1987 Reserve Grade Final win over Manly-Warringah at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Two of Brohman's team mates in the Panthers Reserve Grade side that day included future Australian internationals Mark Geyer and Mark Carroll. Post playing After he retired from playing, Brohman took up coaching for two seasons. Firstly, he coached the Brisbane Broncos' reserve grade side in 1988, before returning to Canterbury in 1989 to coach their reserve grade team. In 2006, he was nominated as the one of front rowers in the 40th Anniversary Penrith Panthers \\"Team of Legends\\" but lost out to Terry Geary (8 seasons ‚Äì 1969‚Äì76) and Tim Sheens (13 seasons ‚Äì 1970‚Äì82). Brohman was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in the 2020 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to rugby league.\\" =Media= Brohman later had a career in the media where he has worked for several radio stations across Sydney. Brohman's media career includes stints at 2KA, ABC Local Radio, 2UE, 2SM and once before at 2GB. He was a host on the Nine Network's The NRL Footy Show from 2010 to 2018 until the show was cancelled after 25 years on air. He has been part of the menswear chain Lowes's advertising campaigns, which also feature other former Rugby League players.

It is identified by the initials R. XIV and is included within Municipio I. Its coat of arms shows a lion (after the name \\"Leonine City\\", which was also given to the district), lying in front of three mounts and a star. These ‚Äì together with a lion rampant ‚Äì are also part of the coat of arms of Pope Sixtus V, who annexed Borgo as the 14th rione of Rome. HistoryRoman Age: Ager Vaticanus= Hadrian's Mausoleum still makes up the core of Castel Sant'Angelo. The tuff blocks visible in the lower part of the cylinder are Roman. During the Roman age, the Borgo district was part of the 14th Regio (Regio XIV Transtiberim) and was named Ager Vaticanus,itinerari per Roma (from www.archeoroma.com) after the auguries (vaticinii) performed there by the Etruscan Augurs. Since it lay outside the Pomerium (the religious city border inside which burial was forbidden) and was plagued by malaria, this territory was used as a burial place. Some tombs reached notable proportions, including the Terebinthus Neronis, which was a round tomb surmounted by a narrow tower,Borgatti, 5 and the Meta Romuli, a pyramid similar to that still standing near Porta San Paolo) that was demolished only in 1499. At the foot of the Vatican Hill, two roads started: the Via Cornelia, which joined the Via Aurelia near Tarquinii,Borgatti, 2 and the Via Triumphalis (Triumphal Road), which met the Via Cassia a few kilometers north.The site where the two Viae crossed is at about the middle of the present day Via della Conciliazione. Municipio 17 - Profilo storico The latter was so named because, beginning with Titus, the Roman Emperors used it to enter the city when celebrating their Triumphs. At the beginning of the Imperial Age, magnificent Villae (country houses) and Horti (Gardens), such as those owned by Agrippina the Elder, wife of Germanicus and mother of Caligula (Horti Agrippinae), and by Domitia Longina, wife of Domitianus (Horti Domitiae), were built near the slopes of the Gianicolo and Vatican hills. Emperor Gaius (also known as Caligula) built on the Vatican a circus (Circus Gaianus), which was then enlarged by Nero (Circus Neronis).Borgatti, 3 The obelisk standing today in St. Peter's Square was erected along its raised median (the spina). The circus was connected to the city through an archway (Porticus). Nero also replaced the timber bridge of the Via Triumphalis with a stone bridge, (whose ruins can still be seen in the Tiber during the minimum flow periods) named after him Pons Neronianus or Triumphalis. Emperor Hadrian built near the Tiber his huge Mausoleum, which he connected to the left bank of the river with another Bridge, the Pons √Ülius (today's Ponte Sant'Angelo). But what changed forever the destiny of the zone was the martyrdom of St. Peter at the foot of the Vatican hill in 67, during the first persecution of the Christians. The saint was buried nearby, and this turned the Vatican into a place of pilgrimage. Above the tomb of the saint, Pope Anacletus built an oratory, which in 324 Emperor Constantine turned into a huge basilica devoted to the prince of the Apostles.Borgatti, 11 This church, known today as Old Saint Peter's, soon became (until its destruction in the 16th century, when the new Saint Peter's was erected in its place) one of the centers of Christianity. =Middle Ages: Civitas Leonina= During the early Middle Ages the bridge of Nero fell into ruins, while the Mausoleum of Hadrian was converted into a stronghold (Castel Sant'Angelo), the possession of which ensured control of the city. Despite the wars and invasions that plagued Rome during those centuries, the flood of pilgrims to the tomb of the apostle never stopped. Pilgrims of the same nationality gathered together in associations named Scholae,Borgatti, 19-21 whose task was to host and to aid men and women of the same nation coming to Rome. The most famous were those of the Franks, Saxons, Frisians and Lombards. Each Schola had its own hospice and church.The church of the Schola Frisonum, San Michele e Magno, still existes at the top of a long staircase in front of the S Colonnade of Saint Peter. Climbing this staircase gives to the pilgrims the same privileges as mounting the Scala Santa in Lateran. Santi Michele e Magno One of the first ‚Äì the Schola Saxonum - was built during the 8th century by Ina or Ine, king of the West Saxons.Borgatti, 42 That hospice became the core of the future Hospital of Santo Spirito, one of the oldest and largest in Rome, founded by Pope Innocent III in 1198. Near the hospital was erected the church of Santo Spirito in Sassia. The German pilgrims gave the zone around their Scholae the name Burg (fortified town),Borgatti, 13 which, italianised, became the name of the quarter. Passetto, called in Roman dialect er Corridore (\\"the Corridor\\"), seen from Borgo S. Angelo: Via dei Corridori (the ancient Borgo dell'Elefante, so named after Hanno the elephant), and Saint Peter's dome are in the background. Since it lay outside Aurelian's Walls, the Borgo was always exposed to attacks. During the 8th and 9th centuries, the quarter ‚Äì together with the basilica - was plundered several times by Saracens who landed in Portus,Borgatti, 14 and devastated by fires (that of 847 was immortalized by Raphael in a fresco painted in the stanze vaticane). Finally, Pope Leo IV built the walls which still bear his name. On June 27, 852 the Pope, accompanied by the clergy and people, started this undertaking walking bare-foot along the circuit of the new walls. Then, in order to augment the population, Pope Leo settled several families of Corsicans in the Borgo. Since that time, the quarter was no longer considered a part of Rome, but a separate town, the Leonine City (Civitas Leonina), with its own magistrates and governor. It was only in 1586, under Pope Sixtus V, that the Borgo, as fourteenth rione, became again a part of Rome. The Leonine walls, which incorporated an older wall built by Totila during the Gothic War,D'Onofrio, 3rd chapter, passim still exist between the Vatican and the Castle, where they bear the name of Passetto. This constitutes a covered passage, which could be used ‚Äì and actually has been used several times - by the Pope as an escape route from his residence to the Castle in case of danger. miniature portraying pilgrims reaching Rome during the Jubilee of 1300. They are approaching the Leonine City from N (Prati di Castello). The hills in the background are (from right to left) Monte Mario, Vatican and Gianicolo. In the Middle Ages, the quarter was not much populated, with sparse houses, some churches and a lot of vegetable gardens. There were also several brick furnaces, using the clay abundant in the Vatican and Gianicolo hills. A small harbor, the Porto Leonino, later used to deliver the travertine blocks needed to build the new Saint Peter's, existed south of the castle. The pilgrims going to St. Peter's and coming from the left bank through Ponte Sant'Angelo, after entering a gate (later named Porta Castello) could walk through the Borgo of the Saxons (today's Borgo S. Spirito) or the Porticus or Portica (named now Porticus Sancti Petri), which was still in place.The first mention of the existence of the Portica in the Middle Ages comes from Procopius (De bello gothico, Ch. 22); the last from the anonymous author of the life of Cola di Rienzo Those coming from Trastevere along the route that would later become Via della Lungara used the posterula Saxonum (today's Porta Santo Spirito),Borgatti, 15 and, finally, the pilgrims coming from the north (monte Mario) following the Via Francigena, entered through Porta San Pellegrino (also named Viridaria because of its vicinity to the Vatican Gardens). In his Divine Comedy, Dante describes the great crowds of pilgrims visiting the Leonine City during the first Jubilee, which took place in 1300 under Boniface VIII.Inferno, XVIII, lines 28-33. Trans. Mandelbaum > come i Roman per l‚Äôessercito molto, l‚Äôanno del giubileo, su per lo ponte > hanno a passar la gente modo colto, che da l‚Äôun lato tutti hanno la fronte > verso ‚Äôl castello e vanno a Santo Pietro, da l‚Äôaltra sponda vanno verso ‚Äôl > monte. > as, in the year of Jubilee, the Romans, confronted by great crowds, > contrived a plan that let the people pass across the bridge, for to one side > went all who had their eyes upon the Castle, heading toward St. Peter‚Äôs, and > to the other, those who faced the Mount. During the Avignon Papacy the Borgo, together with Rome, suffered decay. The Portica collapsed, and on its place was built the road of Borgo Vecchio,A proof that Borgo Vecchio was built where the Portica was is given by its width, which was constant almost everywhere with a value of 6.90 m. Borgatti, 61 also named Carriera Martyrum after the martyrs going to death in the Circus of Nero. During that time only Borgo S. Spirito and Borgo Vecchio afforded access to reach Saint Peter's from the left bank. =Renaissance Age= Pope Alexander VI played an important role in Borgo's town planning. The most famous among his children, Cesare Borgia, lived in the Leonine City. The recovery began with the end of the Western Schism and the beginning of the Renaissance. By that time, the center of gravity of Rome began to shift from the zone around Campidoglio, where medieval Rome had developed, to the Campo Marzio plain. At the same time, the Popes abandoned finally the Lateran complex for the Vatican, which now became the new center of power in Rome.Krautheimer, Profile, 327 passim The large amount of building activity and above all the rebuilding of Saint Peter, which was the ultimate result of this translocation, attracted several artists to the Borgo, while the renewed flood of pilgrims boosted commerce. Under Nicholas V, Bernardo Rossellino planned three diverging roads with arcades going to Saint Peter, but the Pontiff's death blocked the project. Sixtus IV opened a new road parallel to the Passetto, named after him via Sistina (later Borgo Sant'Angelo). Magnificent buildings were built at the beginning of the 16th century by high prelates and aristocrats, including Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila, designed by Raphael; the Palazzo Caprini by Donato Bramante (a house that Raphael chose to buy, and later became part of the Palazzo dei ConvertendiThe balcony of Palazzo dei Convertendi, designed by Carlo Fontana, was considered the most beautiful in Rome. Ceccarelli, 21); Palazzo Castellesi, built by Cardinal Adriano Castellesi,He came from Corneto, and was titular of the Basilica di San Clemente. Ceccarelli, 21 attributed to Andrea Bregno or Bramante and a small-scale copy of the Palazzo della Cancelleria, and Palazzo dei Penitenzieri,This is its modern name. In that time it was named after its first owner, Cardinal Domenico della Rovere. Ceccarelli, 21 perhaps designed by of Baccio Pontelli. The last three palaces faced a small square, Piazza del Cardinale di S. Clemente (later Piazza Scossacavalli), which became the most important in the Borgo. Drawing of Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila, demolished in the 17th century to open the new piazza Rusticucci, so called after the eponymous palace. Also wealthy bourgeoises, such as Febo Brigotti and Jacopo da Brescia, the doctors respectively of Paul III and Leo X, had their houses built in the Borgo. The Leonine City at that time was also renowned in Rome for its stufe. These buildings, whose tradition came from Germany (the name comes from the German word stube), were something between a Roman bath and a modern sauna, and were often attended by artists, who could freely sketch nudes there (Raffaello himself was owner of a stufa in Borgo, near his palace).Ceccarelli, 8 In order to solve the traffic problem, a new road, the Via Alexandrina or Recta, later named Borgo Nuovo, was opened during the Jubilee of 1500 by Pope Alexander VI Borgia.Giovanni Burcardo (Johannes Burckardt from Strassburg, Master of Ceremonies of the Pope), records thus the opening of the new road in his diary (Liber Notarum): \\"Hodie peracto prandio completa est ruptura vie nove recta a parte Castri Santi Angeli ad portam Palatii Apostolici\\". Ceccarelli, 6 After the creation of Borgo Nuovo to the north of the already existing road of Borgo Vecchio, the row of houses between these two roads formed the so-called \\"spina\\" (named thus on account of its similarity to the dividing line of a Roman Circus). At about its middle, the spina was interrupted by a small square, called Piazza Scossacavalli. A recurrent theme of Roman city planning, were the various projects contemplating the demolition of the spina: starting with, that of Carlo Fontana in the late 17th century; and ending, in 1936, when, under Benito Mussolini and Pius XI, this task was finally accomplished. G.S. Peruzzi, is the only church in Rome whose dome has no drum. The lower height allowed the Castle's gunners (who owned a chapel there) to practise their shooting skills on the Gianicolo. The golden Age of the Borgo reached its apogee during the reign of the two Florentine Popes, Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family. Under the latter, the quarter had a population of 4,926 inhabitants, almost all bachelors and non-Roman. Nine out of the twenty five Cardinals belonging to the Curia, each of whom maintained a court comprising hundreds of people, were living here. The most important artists (such as Raphael) took or built their houses in the Borgo. The only important female presence was that of the so-called Cortigiane, decent prostitutes, who were the lovers of high prelates and noblemen.The most famous cortigiane living in Rome in those years were Fiammetta (mistress of Cesare Borgia), Giulia Campana, Penelope and (some years later) Tullia d'Aragona. The House of Fiammetta can still be seen near Via dei Coronari, in Ponte. Roma segreta Piazza Scossacavalli (destroyed in 1937) shown in an XVIII engraving by Giuseppe Vasi. In the background are shown the church of San Giacomo and on the left side Palazzo Giraud. In the middle stands the fountain of Carlo Maderno, now re-erected in front of Sant'Andrea della Valle, in Sant'Eustachio. All this came to an abrupt end on May 6, 1527, when the soldiers of Charles V entered the Leonine City and mercilessly plundered it, so starting the Sack of Rome. Clement VII barely escaped capture, running through the Passetto in his night dress and locking himself within Castel S. Angelo, while all the Swiss Guards, except those defending his escape, were killed near the obelisk. Despite this disaster, the quarter was able to recover quite quickly. Paul III restored the walls, erecting three new ramparts and the still unfinished Porta Santo Spirito (the work of Antonio da Sangallo the younger). The Borgo continued to grow to such an extent, that in 1565 Pius IV started the construction of three new roads, all north of the Passetto, named respectively Borgo Pio (after himself), Borgo Vittorio (after the victory of Lepanto) and Borgo Angelico (after Angelo, his own first name prior to his election).Ceccarelli, 9 In order to boost the new settlement, he gave tax privileges to the Romans who choose to build their houses here. New Walls, and a new monumental gate (Porta Angelica), were built to protect the new area, which in honor of the Pope was named Civitas Pia. Pius IV also demolished several old churches and monasteries: Among these, in 1564, the old Church of Santa Maria in Traspontina,Traspontina means \\"beyond the Bridge\\", which in this case is Ponte Sant'Angelo which lay directly next to the Castle. A new church bearing the same name was built in 1587 in the middle of Borgo Nuovo. =XIV Rione of Rome= Borgo in 1779 (Map printed by Monaldini). The seven roads that radiate from the Castle are, from N to S: Borgo Angelico, Borgo Vittorio, Borgo Pio, Borgo Sant'Angelo, Borgo Nuovo, Borgo Vecchio, and Borgo Santo Spirito. On December 9, 1586 (the year when Domenico Fontana erected in Saint Peter's Square the obelisk once standing in the Circus of Nero), Pope Sixtus V declared Borgo the fourteenth Rione of the city.Ceccarelli, 10 Its coat of arms represents a Lion (representing the Leonine City), and three Mounts and a Star (taken from the coat of arms of Pope Sixtus).In a first version of the coat of arms, the Lion protected a treasure chest, alluding to the three millions golden scudi, which the Pope accumulated in the Castle San Angelo. The coat of arms bore the motto \\"Vigilat sacri thesauri custos\\". Baronio, 2 At the beginning of the 17th century Pope Paul V restored the Aqua Traiana, an ancient Roman Aqueduct, and had several fountains built in the Rione (among them, that designed by Carlo Maderno in Piazza Scossacavalli,Baronio, 10 now placed in front of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle). Pope Alexander VII, after the completion of the colonnade designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (built between 1656 and 1665),Krautheimer, Alexander VII, Ch. IV passim ordered the demolition of the first block in front of it.The block (Isola in Italian) was named Isola del Priorato after the Priorship of Malta, held by the Knights of St. John Hospitaller. He created so the Piazza Rusticucci, the vestibule to Saint Peter's Square. Among the other buildings, which then went lost, there was Palazzo Branconio. During the 18th and the early 19th centuries, the Borgo kept its characteristics. The bourgeoises abandoned the rione for the new settlements in Campo Marzio, and Borgo became a quarter inhabited by simple people (artisans or workers at the Vatican), very devoted yet always open to new ideas, and men of the church, who appreciated the vicinity to the Holy See. Many sellers of religious goods, named Paternostrari or Coronari (rosary makers) had their shops here. At the edge of the quarter, in Vicolo degli ombrellari, a small lane near Borgo Pio, were the shops of the Roman umbrella makers, gathered there because of the bad smell coming from the oiled silk. In Borgo Vecchio several small foundries were active, where artistic objects made of bronze were cast. Particularly characteristic was the making of bells: the last foundry, located in Vicolo del Farinone, closed around 1995, after an activity lasted about 450 years.Roma artigiana In the Borgo were also located many famous osterie, where Romans and pilgrims could eat and drink wine.The pilgrims could recognize an hostaria because of the coloured pennon bearing its sign. The most famous during the renaissance were those named all'elmo, al sole (whose innkeeper was Vannozza dei Cattanei, mistress of Alexander VI), all'angelo, del bordone, della donzella. During the 19th century, the most popular were those named della vecchietta, alla rosetta, alla fontanella, al lepretto, della sirena, del moccio. Ceccarelli, 3 Another profession peculiar to the men of the Borgo was that of headsman (\\"boia\\"). In fact, the executioner was forbidden to live on the left bank, and even to go there (Boia non passa Ponte, in English: \\"the headsman cannot cross the bridge\\", was a Roman proverb), but had to stay in the Leonine City.The most famous headsman of papal Rome is Giovanni Battista Bugatti, nicknamed Mastro Titta, who took up his second profession (officially he was an umbrella painter) in 1796, and cut his last head in 1864. He executed, all in all, 516 persons. His house was in Borgo Nuovo. Curiosit√† romane The most important yearly event for the rione was the spectacular procession of Corpus Domini, which started and finished in Saint Peter's, and was led by the Pope himself together with the Cardinal Dean, during which each building was dressed with flags and standards. Things began to change again for the Borgo during the French occupation under Napoleon. The Pr√©fet of Rome, Camille de Tournon, started the demolition of the spina, but the project had to be interrupted shortly after it began due to a lack of funds. During the Italian Risorgimento the Borgo, together with Trastevere and Monti, was one of the quarters of Rome where public opinion supported with great enthusiasm the struggle for Italian independence. When, shortly after the September 20, 1870 the Italians offered the Pope full sovereignty over the Leonine City with all its inhabitants, this caused violent demonstrations in the Borgo. This offer was refused by Pius IX, who preferred to declare himself a prisoner of the Italian State and seclude himself in the Vatican complex. After 1870, the walls of Pius IV, which bordered the Rione to the N, were pulled down, together with the Porta Angelica, to ease communication with the new Rione of Prati. Between 1886 and 1911 a new bridge, Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, located slightly north of the ruins of Nero's Bridge, connected the new avenue of Corso Vittorio Emanuele with Borgo. =1936-1950: the destruction of the Spina= Via della Conciliazione at dawn with Castel Sant'Angelo in morning haze. The picture was taken from the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri, so named after the priests who were in charge of confessing the foreign pilgrims in Saint Peter, and offered Absolution touching them with a rod. They acquired the palace in 1655. This situation changed forever in 1936. In that year the project of the demolition of the spina, by the Roman architects Marcello Piacentini and Attilio Spaccarelli, was approved by Mussolini and Pius XI and put in execution. An agreement between the two leaders was possible because of the new climate of collaboration between the State and the Church following the signing of the Lateran Treaties (\\"La Conciliazione\\" in Italian) in 1929. On October 23, 1936 (the day after the anniversary of the March on Rome), the Duce himself, standing on a roof, gave the first stroke of the pickaxe. On October 8, 1937 (less than one year later), the spina ceased to exist, and Saint Peter was freely visible from Castel Sant'Angelo.Ceccarelli, 28 Demolition of the Spina di Borgo at Saint Peter's (1937). The first stretch of the Spina di Borgo during its demolition (1937). Due to World War II, the work was interrupted. After the war, although the political and cultural climate had changed, the government and the Vatican decided to finish the project. Two Propylaea were built in front of Saint Peter's Square (inside that on the south side was enclosed the ancient churchBorgatti, 64 of San Lorenzo in piscibus), and two others at the beginning of the road. The road was finished in time for the Jubilee of 1950, by putting along it two rows of obelisks (which the Romans quickly christened \\"the suppositories\\"). The result was that almost all the houses of the Rione south of the Passetto were demolished, and a new grand avenue emerged: the Via della Conciliazione (named after the Treaty of 1929 between Italy and the Holy See). A few major buildings (Santa Maria in Traspontina, Palazzo Torlonia, Palazzo dei Penitenzieri) were spared because they were more or less on axis with the new road. Vicolo del Campanile di Borgo in a watercolour by Ettore Roesler Franz (about 1880). The house on the left in foreground belongs to the spina. The bell tower on the right is that of Santa Maria in Traspontina, parish church of Borgo. On the left side of this lane is still visible a rare example of Casa Graffita of the Renaissance. All the others were either pulled down and rebuilt with their fronts on the new roads (like Palazzo dei Convertendi, rebuilt on Via della Conciliazione,Its demolition in 1937 brought to light vaulted structures belonging to Palazzo Caprini. Ceccarelli, 21 and the houses of Febo Brigotti and Jacopo da Brescia, whose fa√ßades were reassembled on the new Via dei Corridori), or, like the small churches of San Giacomo a Scossacavalli and Sant'Angelo ai Corridori, built respectively on Piazza Scossacavalli and along the Passetto, simply demolished and never rebuilt.Cambedda, 22 Besides a few drawings,In the book of Ceccarelli there are drawings and detailed surveys of the spina, by Lucilio Cartocci no scientific documentation of the old quarter was taken. Most of the inhabitants, whose families had been living and working in Borgo for centuries, were deported to the outskirts in the middle of the Campagna, as Acilia. That happened because no new apartment houses were built, but only offices, mainly used by the Vatican. Judgement about the whole undertaking, controversial since the beginning, appears now to be largely negative. In fact, besides the destruction of many ancient edifices and, above all, of a whole social tissue, what was lost forever was the \\"surprise\\" (typical of the Baroque), when, at the very end of the narrow and dark lanes of the Borgo, the huge Piazza and Basilica suddenly appeared. Now, instead, Saint Peter's appears in the distance, flattened as in a postcard, and the sense of perspective gets lost as well.Benevolo (1973), pp.638-41Cederna (1979), p.236 During the 1930s extensive demolition affected also the NW part of the rione (Via di Porta Angelica e Via del Mascherino). These were officially undertaken in order to better define the border between Italy and the new State of the Vatican City. =Today= Since 1950, the remaining Borghiciani (the name by which the inhabitants of the Borgo are called in Roman dialect), live north of the Passetto, where the quarter retained until recent times its character. Several high prelates live there: among them, Pope Benedict XVI, who had been living in Borgo Pio for more than twenty years before his election to the Papacy.In the days after the election, a banner was hung on the fa√ßade of Santa Maria in Traspontina. It contained the following sentence in Roman dialect: Auguri ar Papa borghiciano, nostro parrocchiano (English: \\"Greetings to the Pope from Borgo, our parishioner\\") South of the Passetto the quarter houses only some offices (mainly belonging to the Vatican), an Auditorium, and the huge complex of the Hospital of Santo Spirito.  Geography  Borgo lies on the west bank of the Tiber and has a trapezoidal shape. The territory of the rione includes a level part, which is made up of the Tiber's alluvial deposits, and a hilly zone, which coincides with the clay-laden slopes of the Vatican hill. In administrative terms, the rione became part of the city center (the Municipio I) following city decree n.11 issued on 11 March 2013.Deliberazione n. 11 - 11/372013 - Roma Capitale Before then, it was part of the now abolished Municipio XVII, together with rione of Prati (also merged to the I Municipio in March 2013) and the quartieri Trionfale and Della Vittoria. =Boundaries= Northward, Borgo borders with Prati (R. XXII), from which is separated by Piazza Adriana, Via Alberico II, Via Properzio, Piazza Americo Capponi, Via Stefano Porcari and Piazza del Risorgimento Borgo shares with the Vatican City a western border, which is marked by the Vatican wall between Piazza del Risorgimento and Via di Porta Cavalleggeri. Westward, the rione also borders with Quartiere Aurelio (Q. XIII), from which is separated by the stretch of the Leonine Walls beside Via di Porta Cavalleggeri, Largo di Porta Cavalleggeri and Viale delle Mura Aurelie. Southward, Borgo borders with Trastevere (R. XIII), the boundary being outlined by the Aurelian Walls, up to Ponte Principe Amedeo Savoia Aosta. To the east, the rione borders with Ponte (R. V), from which is separated by the stretch of the Tiber between Ponte Principe Amedeo Savoia Aosta and Ponte Sant'Angelo. =Local geography= The main roads run east‚Äìwest and are named Borghi rather than Vie (the noteworthy exception being the modern Via della Conciliazione). Although heavily transformed during the first half of the 20th century, Borgo maintains its historical importance as a forecourt to Saint Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Palace.

It had a population of 872 at the 2011 census. The town is served by Dublin Bus, with route number 65 running four times daily.http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/your-journey1/Timetables/All- Timetables/65/ History Modern plaque near Ballymore Eustace marks the southern extreme of the Pale Ballymore Eustace in the 13th century ‚Äì at the time simply known as Ballymore ‚Äì was the site of a castle, which in 1244 was granted an eight-day fair to be held on site by Henry III. The upkeep of the castle was given to Thomas Fitzoliver FitzEustace as constable in 1373, and his family came to be associated with the town, lending it its present name. Several of Thomas' descendants also held the office of Constable, including his grandson Sir Richard FitzEustace (appointed 1414) and his great-grandson Sir Robert FitzEustace (appointed 1445). No trace of the castle exists today, but the importance of Ballymore then is underlined by the fact that Parliament was held there in 1389. It was a border town of \\"the Pale\\", giving it strategic importance in the area, but also leading to its raiding by local families. The first reference to a church is in 1192, but the existence of two High Crosses in St. John's Graveyard indicates a pre-Norman church site. The town and surrounding lands formed for centuries one of three adjacent exclaves - detached portions - of the barony of Uppercross, County Dublin. These lands, originally part of Dublin because they belonged to religious foundations there, were among the last such exclaves in Ireland, being merged into Kildare only in 1836. The town was the scene of one of the first clashes of the 1798 rebellion when the British garrison were attacked by United Irish rebels on 23 May but managed to defeat the attack in the Battle of Ballymore-Eustace. In the 19th century, the town's largest source of employment was a cotton mill (owned by the Gallagher family), the ruins of which still stand by the river at a spot known as the \\"pike hole\\". This mill employed in the region of 700 people and a row of single-storey houses were built nearby to accommodate a number of their families ‚Äì this terrace today known as \\"Weaver's row\\", running alongside and down the hill from the local Roman Catholic parish church. Surroundings Near the town are the Blessington Lakes, or Poulaphouca Reservoir, created artificially in the 1940s by the damming of the river Liffey at Poulaphouca (the \\"Devil's hole\\") which was done to generate electricity by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), and also to create a reservoir for the supply of water for the city of Dublin. The water is treated at a major treatment plant, the Water Treatment Works at Ballymore Eustace run by Dublin City Council. Activities such as fishing, rowing, sailing, canoeing and windsurfing are regularly seen on Blessington Lakes, whereas waterskiing and fishing takes place on the Golden Falls lake downstream from Poulaphouca Dam. Also nearby is Russborough House, a fine example of Palladian architecture, which houses the Beit art collection, much of which was donated to the state by Sir Alfred Lane Beit, including works by Goya, Vermeer and Rubens. It has also been a place of interest for the film industry. The 1959 film Shake Hands With the Devil was filmed in and around the town. Some of the battle scenes in Mel Gibson's (1995) film, Braveheart, were filmed around Ballymore Eustace. The 2003 film King Arthur was also mostly shot in the village. This resulted in a 1 km long mock-up of Hadrian's Wall being constructed in a field outside of the village during 2003. This was disassembled and the field was returned to its original state. The Irish short film Six Shooter (2004) also shot scenes at Mountcashel, in Ballymore Eustace. People Champion greyhound racing trainer Adam Jackson was born in the town.

XV, and is Located within the Municipio I. It is named after the Esquiline Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome. Its coat of arms bears two figures: a tree and three green mountains, all on a silver background. It is a very cosmopolitan neighbourhood, with large numbers of immigrants from Asia and North Africa.  History  Esquilino is part of the historic center of Rome, where urbanization developed in ancient times. Along with Palatina, Collina and Suburana, the area was one of the four regiones established by Servius Tullius: until Emperor Augustus adopted a new administrative subdivision of the city, the region included the whole area that is part of the modern rione Monti. The territory of the modern rione Esquilino, however, has always been regarded as the frontier of the inner city. Initially at the edge of the Servian Wall, whose agger was located in the area, during the Imperial age the borough was inserted inside the Aurelian Walls, though remaining marginal in the city context: indeed, according to a probable etymology, the name comes from the Latin word esquiliae, meaning \\"suburb\\". Up until Augustan age, the area beyond the agger of the republican walls was a huge landfill, while another portion housed a cemetery for slaves and indigent people. Following to the urban reform pursued by Emperor Augustus, the polluted and pestilent areas were interred and the embankment of the ancient walls became a footway. In the area was also created a park, the Gardens of Maecenas, a complex of magnificent gardens which housed a tall tower where, according to Suetonius, Emperor Nero watched Rome burning. Until the late Imperial age, the borough became a favorite location of residential villas, called Horti. During the Middle Ages, the area came into possession of several orders and convents seated near Santa Maria Maggiore. Starting from the 17th century, a number of aristocratic villas were built in the territory of the rione, such as Villa Palombara, that used to house the famous Porta Alchemica which currently stands out in the garden of Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. A relevant part of the ancient remains has been dismantled after the residential development of the area, starting from 1870, with the construction of new buildings destined to the clerical middle class.  Geography  The rione is located in the eastern part of the center of Rome. It was established in 1921, detaching a portion of Monti. =Boundaries= Northward, Esquilino borders with Castro Pretorio (R. XVIII), the boundary being outlined by Via Gioberti, Via Giovanni Giolitti, Piazza dei Cinquecento, Viale Enrico De Nicola, Via Marsala and Piazzale Sisto V. To the east, it borders with quartieri Tiburtino (Q. XII) (from which is separated by the portion of the Aurelian Walls beside Via di Porta Tiburtina, located between Piazzale Sisto V and Viale dello Scalo San Lorenzo) and Prenestino-Labicano (Q. VII), from which is separated by Piazzale Labicano (Porta Maggiore). Southward, the rione borders with Quartiere Tuscolano (Q. VIII), whose boundary is marked by the portion of the Aurelian Walls between Piazzale Labicano and Piazzale Appio (Porta San Giovanni). To the west, Esquilino borders with Monti (R. I): the boundary is marked by Piazza di Porta San Giovanni, Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano, Via Merulana and Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore.

Golden (2011), Central Asia in World History, p.114 state that existed in the historical region of Khwarezm in Central Asia from 1511 to 1920, except for a period of Afsharid occupation by Nadir Shah between 1740 and 1746. Centred in the irrigated plains of the lower Amu Darya, south of the Aral Sea, with the capital in the city of Khiva, the country was ruled by an Uzbek Turkic tribe, the Khongirads, who came from Astrakhan. It covered present western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan before Russian arrival at the second half of the 19th century. The country's population consisted mainly of Uzbeks and Turkmens. In 1873, the Khanate of Khiva was much reduced in size and became a Russian protectorate. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Khiva had a revolution too, and in 1920 the Khanate was replaced by the Khorezm People's Soviet Republic. In 1924, the area was formally incorporated into the Soviet Union and today is largely a part of Karakalpakstan and Xorazm Province in Uzbekistan.

E. Khorezm Turkmens in the 19th Century / Acad. sciences of the USSR. Institute of Asian Peoples. - M .: Publishing house of oriental literature, 1961. p. 442. Some time around 1600A previous version of this article dated the move to Khiva as 1619, without citation. It was during the reign of Arap Muhammad (1602‚Äì23) according to Annanepesov and Bababekov, page 66. Abul Ghazi dates the river change to circa 575 (quoted in Alexandr Gloukhovskoy, The Passage of the Water of the Amu-Darya,1895, page 25). For more on the changing course of the Oxus see Uzboy River the Daryalik or west branch of the Oxus dried up causing the capital to be moved south to Khiva from Konye-Urgench. Although based in the Oxus delta the Khanate usually controlled most of what is now Turkmenistan. The population consisted of agriculturalists along the river, the so-called Sarts, and nomads or semi-nomads away from the river. The settled area was aristocratic with peasants bound to the land. There were many Persian slaves who had been captured by the Turkmen and a few Russian slaves. Before and during this period the settled area was increasingly infiltrated by Uzbeks from the north, their Turkic dialects evolving into what is now the Uzbek language while the original Iranian Khwarezmian language died out. Ethnically the population was Uzbek along the river and Turkmen in the nomad area. The swampy area of the lower delta was increasingly Karakalpak and there were Kazakh nomads on the northern border. The Turkmen nomads paid taxes to the Khan and were a large part of his army but often revolted. Since the heart of the Khanate was surrounded by semi-desert the only easy military approach was along the Oxus. This led to many wars with the Khanate of Bukhara further up the river (1538‚Äì40, 1593, 1655, 1656, 1662, 1684, 1689, 1694, 1806, and others). Persian slave in the Khanate of Khiva, 19th century Before 1505 Khwarezm was nominally dependent on the Timurid Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara who was based in Khurasan. From 1488 Muhammad Shaybani built a large but short-lived empire in southern central Asia, taking Khwarezm in 1505. At nearly the same time Shah Ismail I was building a powerful Shiite state in Persia. The two necessarily clashed and in 1510 Muhammad was killed and Khwarezm soon occupied. The Shah's religion provoked resistance and in 1511 his garrison was expelled and power passed to the Uzbek Ilbars who founded the long-lived Arabshahid dynasty.The Arabshaids or Yadigarids were Shaybanids and are sometimes distinguished from the Abulkhayrids, another branch of the family. They are named after Yadigar Sultan who was proclaimed khan north of the Aral Sea about 1458 and from his great-grandfather Arabshah. Bregel places them north of the Aral Sea and lower Syr Darya circa 1400-1500. See Yuri Bregel, Historical Atals of Central Asia, 2003, map 24 Circa 1540 and circa 1593 the khans were driven out by the Bukharans. In both cases they fled to Persia and soon returned. In 1558 Anthony Jenkinson visited Old Urgench and was not impressed. Following Arap Munhammad (1602‚Äì23), who moved the capital to Khiva, there was a period of disorder, including an invasion by the Kalmyks, who left laden with plunder. Disorder was ended by Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur (1643‚Äì63) who twice defeated the Kalmyks and wrote a history of central Asia. His son Anusha (1663‚Äì85) presided over a period of urban growth until he was deposed and blinded. From 1695 Khiva was for some years a vassal of Bukhara which appointed two khans. Shir Gazi Khan (1714‚Äì27), who was killed by Persian and Russian slaves, is said to have been the last proper Arabshahid.Cambridge History of Inner Asia, p393. This is not repeated in the other sources. Khan Ilbars (1728‚Äì40) was a Kazakh who unwisely killed some Persian ambassadors. In a repeat of the Shah Ismail story, Nadir Shah conquered Khiva, beheaded Ilbars and freed some 12-20,000 Persian slaves. Next year the Persian garrison was slaughtered, but the rebellion was quickly suppressed. Persian pretensions ended with Nadir's murder in 1747. After 1746 the Kongrat tribe became increasingly powerful and appointed puppet khans. Their power was formalized as the Kongrat dynasty by Iltuzar Khan in 1804. Khiva flourished under Muhammad Rahim Khan (1806‚Äì25) and Allah Quli Khan (1825‚Äì40) and then declined. After Muhammad Amin Khan was killed trying to re- take Merv there was a long Turkmen rebellion (1855‚Äì67). In the first two years of the rebellion either, two or three Khans were killed by the Turkmen. =Russian Empire Period= Khanate of Khiva in 1900 (in grey) Muhammad Rahim Khan II and his officials at the coronation of Nicholas II, Khan of Khiva is sitting third from the right Russians made five attacks on Khiva. Around 1602 some free Ural Cossacks unsuccessfully raided Khwarazm. In 1717 Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky attacked Khiva from the Caspian. After he won the battle, Shir Ghazi Khan (1715‚Äì28) made a treaty and suggested that the Russians disperse so that they could be better fed. After they dispersed they were all killed or enslaved, only a few surviving to tell the tale. In 1801 an army was sent toward Khiva but was recalled when Paul I was murdered. In the Khivan campaign of 1839 Perovsky tried an attack from Orenburg. The weather was unusually cold and he was forced to turn back after losing many men and most of his camels. Khiva was finally conquered by the Khivan campaign of 1873. The conquest of Khiva was part of the Russian conquest of Turkestan. British attempts to deal with this were called the Great Game. One of the reasons for the 1839 attack was the increasing number of Russian slaves held at Khiva. To remove this pretext Britain launched its own effort to free the slaves. Major Todd, the senior British political officer stationed in Herat (in Afghanistan) dispatched Captain James Abbott, disguised as an Afghan, on Christmas Eve, 1839, for Khiva. Abbott arrived in late January 1840 and, although the khan was suspicious of his identity, he succeeded in talking the khan into allowing him to carry a letter for the Tsar regarding the slave issue. He left on 7 March 1840, for Fort Alexandrovsk, and was subsequently betrayed by his guide, robbed, then released when the bandits realized the origin and destination of his letter. His superiors in Herat, not knowing of his fate, sent another officer, Lieutenant Richmond Shakespear, after him. Shakespear had more success than Abbott: he convinced the khan to free all Russian subjects under his control, and also to make the ownership of Russian slaves a crime punishable by death. The freed slaves and Shakespear arrived in Fort Alexandrovsk on 15 August 1840, and Russia lost its primary motive for the conquest of Khiva, for the time being. A permanent Russian presence on the Aral Sea began in 1848 with the building of Fort Aralsk at the mouth of the Syr Darya. The Empire's military superiority was such that Khiva and the other Central Asian principalities, Bukhara and Kokand, had no chance of repelling the Russian advance, despite years of fighting.John Ayde, Indian Frontier Policy. In 1873, after Russia conquered the great cities of Tashkent and Samarkand, General Von Kaufman launched an attack on Khiva consisting of 13,000 infantry and cavalry. The city of Khiva fell on 10 June 1873 and, on 12 August 1873, a peace treaty was signed that established Khiva as a quasi- independent Russian protectorate. See Khivan campaign of 1873. After the conquest of what is now Turkmenistan (1884) the protectorates of Khiva and Bukhara were surrounded by Russian territory. The first significant settlement of Europeans in the Khanate was a group of Mennonites who migrated to Khiva in 1882. The German-speaking Mennonites had come from the Volga region and the Molotschna colony under the leadership of Claas Epp, Jr. The Mennonites played an important role in modernizing the Khanate in the decades prior to the October Revolution by introducing photography, which resulted with the development of the Uzbek photography and filmmaking, more efficient methods for cotton harvesting, electrical generators, and other technological innovations. =Civil war and Soviet Republic= Flags of the World (FOTW). According to David Straub (1996) on FOTW , \\"The flag of the Khivan Khanate in the pre-Soviet period is unknown.\\" After the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in the October Revolution, anti-monarchists and Turkmen tribesmen joined forces with the Bolsheviks at the end of 1919 to depose the khan. On 2 February 1920, Khiva's last Kungrad khan, Sayid Abdullah, abdicated and a short-lived Khorezm People's Soviet Republic (later the Khorezm SSR) was created out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva, before it was finally incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1924, with the former Khanate divided between the new Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, these became Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan respectively. Today, the area that was the Khanate has a mixed population of Uzbeks, Karakalpaks, Turkmens, and Kazakhs.

XVI and located within the Municipio I. Its coat of arms depicts three golden bands and a golden dragon on a red background. It is the coat of arms of the noble Ludovisi family, which here owned the beautiful villa bearing the same name. The villa and the surrounding gardens, except for a single building, the Villa Aurora, were destroyed at the end of the 19th century to build the new district.  Geography  The rione borders with: * northward, quartieri Pinciano (Q. III) and Salario (Q. IV); * eastward, Sallustiano (R. XVII); * southward, Trevi (R. II) and Colonna (R. III); * westward, Campo Marzio (R. IV).  History  Villa Ludovisi, ca. 1880 (watercolor by Ettore Roesler Franz. The rione was born after the unification of Italy (such as San Saba, Testaccio and Prati), from the convention, signed in 1886, between the Boncompagni (heirs of the Ludovisi) and the Municipality of Rome. With this act, the Lords of Piombino assigned to the housing development the area of Villa Ludovisi: about 25 hectares of park between the walls and the historical rioni of Trevi and Colonna, which between the 17th and 19th centuries had extended eastward up to Porta Salaria (the present Piazza Fiume). This housing development, its events, its protagonists, can be considered an exemplary episode of the growth imparted by the Savoys to the new capital; a growth based on speculative construction that attracted businessmen from around Europe and, in the space of not even twenty-five years, led the city from the breach of Porta Pia to the economic crisis of the latter 1880s, to the Banca Romana scandal. The technical and financial arm of the operation (uselessly deprecated by the European intellectuals of the time as an unforgivable ugliness) was the Societ√† Generale Immobiliare, established in Turin in 1862, which followed the movements of the capitals of the Savoy kingdom moving its headquarters first in Florence (in 1862) and then finally in Rome in 1880; here he became, for a century, the great protagonist of the Roman building speculation.For the allotment of Villa Ludovisi, see Paola Puzzuoli (Bibliography). The project for the development of the rione can be dated back to 1870, when Rome became the new Italian capital: it is no coincidence that Prince Ignazio Boncompagni of Piombino had been one of the 18 members of the temporary city counsil (6 nobles, 4 bourgeois and 8 landowners and merchants of the countryside See Franco Ferrarotti (Bibliography).) that, among its first acts, had established a Commission of architects and engineers to select the projects ¬´for the construction of new neighborhoods in that part [of the city] that is best suited to the new building¬ª. The concerned part was the high one, between the Esquiline and the Pincian hill, already identified for its proximity to Termini, where several entrepreneurs from Northern Italy and abroad had already started to built. Between projects, opinions and debates, the first master plan of the urban development of the \\"third Rome\\", signed by Alessandro Viviani, was launched in 1873, thus legitimizing the 7 agreements with the Municipality of Rome for the construction of new neighborhoods that had already been ratified \\"regardless\\".The first one, signed with de M√©rode for the valley of San Vitale, was ready even before the breach of Porta Pia; other new rioni were planned at the Caelian hill, the Esquiline hill, Castro Pretorio and Testaccio (¬´For resounding arts, large workshops, warehouses and buildings for workers' dwellings¬ª), for over 100 hectares in total and a forecast of over 50,000 residents. The Prati di Castello remained temporarily excluded, as they were still perceived as a politically sensitive area due to its proximity to the Vatican. More than 10 years passed, during which both the new properties and the prices of the building areas went on growing, before an official and binding master plan was launched in 1883, based on a law of 1881.For a synthetic scheme of the Viviani master plan, see here. Although the latter Viviani master plan provided for the intangibility of Villa Ludovisi, the aristocracy of the town also wished to participate in the game; so it was that the prince in title at the time, Rodolfo Boncompagni Ludovisi, in 1886 signed an agreement with the Municipality and with the Societ√† Generale Immobiliare for the urbanization, the allotment and the ¬´building of a neighborhood of private dwellings in the Villa formerly Ludovisi¬ª.For the text of the agreement, see Franco Ferrarotti (Bibliography), pp. 71‚Äì74. Note that Giuseppe Giacomelli, CEO of the Societ√† Generale Immobiliare, appears in the deal also as ¬´attorney general of H.E. Don Rodolfo Boncompagni Ludovisi Prince of Piombino¬ª. The deal was however concluded on the eve of the crisis, which involved the Prince of PiombinoThe Prince, in turn, had involved in the affair the Vatican of Leo XIII, obtaining loans which had shares of the allotment as a guarantee; in the subsequent near-bankruptcy of the Immobiliare, the Vatican lost about a million of lire. (see here). and brought the Immobiliare on the verge of bankruptcy which was avoided in 1898 thanks to an arrangement with the creditors. After the acute phase of the crisis was over, the housing development found new vitality: elegant buildings had already been built on Via di Porta Pinciana, in 1890 the Palazzo Margherita had been completed, in 1905 Villa Maraini, the Hotel Flora and the Hotel Excelsior arose and in 1906 Via Vittorio Veneto, the thoroughfare of the rione, was completed. Another season of intense construction took place between 1925 and 1935, with the Hotel Ambasciatori, the INA building and the headquarters of the Ministry of Economic Development (born as Chamber of Fasces and Corporations). right = Coat or arms = Gules, three golden bands withdrawn in the head and a gold dragon cut at the tip (coat of arms of the Boncompagni-Ludovisi) family.

It is located within the Municipio I and the name refers to the ancient Gardens of Sallust (Horti Sallustiani), which were located here. History During the Augustan age, the area belonged to the regio Alta Semita (Latin for \\"high pathway\\"). Here were the Horti Sallustiani, which gave the rione its name, and the Temple of Venus Erycina, in the area between Via Piave and Via Calabria, no less important than the villa of Sallust, to the point that the golden mirror of the goddess on a blue background was chosen as the coat of arms of the rione. The famous Ludovisi Throne, found during the urbanization works in the area, was most likely part of the temple. Between Via Flavia and Via Servio Tullio stood the temple dedicated to the goddess Fortuna, while the circus of Flora was probably located between Via XX Settembre and Via Boncompagni. The Sallustian obelisk, found in the area of the Horti Sallustiani and now in Piazza della Trinit√† dei Monti, was not part of the spina of the circus, but more likely it adorned a private hippodrome of the villa of Sallust. Via Piave follows the route of the former Via Salaria Nova, which exited from Porta Collina in the direction of the demolished Porta Salaria. Near the street there was an important stately sepulchral area, which included the funerary monument to Sulpicius Maximus, today in the center of Piazza Fiume, and that of Cornelia, currently close to the walls in Corso Italia. In AD 410 the Visigoths of Alaric cut the aqueducts and plundered the villa of Sallust, which was reduced to a pile of rubble and definitively abandoned. Due to the consequent lack of water, the area between the Pincian and the Quirinal hill became depopulated. A slight recovery of the rione was promoted in the 16th century by Sixtus V, with the opening of the new Via Pia and the return of the water to the area, thanks to the restoration of an aqueduct, the Acquedotto Felice (named after the Pope himself, whose name was Felice). Furthermore, in 1608 the cardinal Scipione Borghese promoted at his own expense the construction of a beautiful church: Santa Maria della Vittoria. Nonetheless the rione, which was then part of Trevi, continued to be sparsely populated, with vast green areas due to the presence of large villas such as Villa Barberini, on the current Via XX Settembre, Villa Mandosi, on Via Boncompagni, and Villa Cicciaporci, between Via Pia, the Aurelian Walls up to Porta Salaria and Via di Porta Salaria (now Via Piave). All this greenery disappeared with the inevitable urbanization of the area between the Strada Pia and the walls that followed the breach of Porta Pia; breach that, incidentally, was opened in the short portion of walls belonging to the rione. The Boncompagni had two townhouses built on the street that bears their name, one of which currently houses the Museum of Decorative Arts; the local Basilica di San Camillo de Lellis was built on the area of Villa Spithoever, as well as the smaller Chiesa del Sacro Cuore di Ges√π with the adjoining convent. The palace of the Geological Museum in Largo Santa Susanna and the headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests in Via XX Settembre were also built. Currently, the only surviving green zone is in the area just before the walls, included among Porta Pia, Via Piave and Via Augusto Valenziani: it is the garden of the old Villa Cicciaporci Valenti Gonzaga, now known as Villa Paolina (after Pauline Bonaparte, who lived there) and, since 1951, the seat of the French embassy to the Holy See. right = Coat of arms = Azure, mirror of Venus Erycina Or (with reference to the Horti Sallustiani). Geography The rione, just like the neighboring Ludovisi and Castro Pretorio, was born at the end of 19th century in an area between Via Pia (what will later become Via XX Settembre) and Via Boncompagni, which until then had been reduced to vineyards and gardens and was part of Trevi. It differs from the other rioni that developed in the same period for its much less rigid and severe road scheme, with more variations and solutions regarding the shape of the blocks and the conformation of the streets, also due to the small area that it covers. =Boundaries= Northward, the rione shares its border with Ludovisi (R. XVII): the boundary is marked by Via Friuli, Via Lucullo, Via Boncompagni, Via Calabria and Piazza Fiume. Eastward, the rione borders with Quartiere Salario (Q. IV), from which is separated by a stretch of the Aurelian Walls, between Piazza Fiume and Porta Pia. Southward, the rione borders with Castro Pretorio (R. XVIII), whose boundary is defined by Via XX Settembre. Westward, the rione borders with Trevi (R. II), from which is separated by Largo di Santa Susanna, Via di Santa Susanna, Via Giosu√® Carducci and Via Leonida Bissolati. =Local geography= Its center is the quiet Piazza Sallustio, the only real square in the rione, where the archeological remains of the Horti Sallustiani - from which it takes its name - are still visible today. The rione can be ideally divided into two parts, one among Via Piave, Via Piemonte and Via Antonio Salandra, with a moderate housing density, and the other, up to Via Leonida Bissolati, almost uninhabited and with a high concentration of offices and ministries.

The rione takes its name by the ruins of the Castrum Praetorium, the barracks of the Praetorian Guard, included in the Aurelian Walls.  History  Engraving by Giuseppe Vasi showing Villa Peretti (later Villa Negroni). During the Imperial age, the area belonged to the regio Alta Semita (Latin for \\"high pathway\\"). At that time, a huge part of the present-day rione was gloomy and infamous, as it housed the Campus Sceleratus, a large area just outside Porta Collina (between Via Venti Settembre and Piazza dell'Indipendenza) where Vestal virgins that infringed their chastity vows were buried alive. Another landmark of the borough was the Castra Praetoria, the barracks of the Praetorian Guard established by Tiberius between AD 21 and AD 23, later incorporated into the Aurelian Walls. Between 298 and 306, to serve the densely populated quarters of the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline hills, the majestic Baths of Diocletian were built, whose remains can still be seen along Via Cernaia and in Piazza dei Cinquecento. The baths occupied the area between Piazza della Repubblica, Piazza dei Cinquecento, Via Volturno and Via Venti Settembre. They definitively ceased activity in 537, due to the cutting of the aqueducts during the Gothic war. In the eastern part of Piazza dei Cinquecento there was the agger of Servius Tullius, located near the former Porta Viminale, whose remains still rise in front of the Termini railway station. In the rione there were two other gates that no longer exist, Porta Collina and Porta Nomentana, belonging to the Servian and to the Aurelian Walls respectively. Following to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Rome began to depopulate, and the area of the rione was among the first boroughs to be abandoned, being peripheral, unsafe and lacking of water. In the following centuries, little hamlets arose only around some major churches, such as the basilicas of Santa Prassede, Santa Pudenziana and Santa Maria Maggiore, thanks to their convents. During the Renaissance, Sixtus V promoted the urbanization of the area, with the construction of the Strada Felice, a 2 kilometers straight line between Trinit√† dei Monti and Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (it coincides with the present-day Via Sistina, Via delle Quattro Fontane and Via Agostino Depretis) and of the Acquedotto Felice: both the road and the aqueduct recall the name of the Pope, Felice Peretti. The refurbishments promoted by Sixtus V also involved the intersection between Via Sistina and Via Pia, where the Quattro Fontane were positioned, thus creating a scenic viewpoint where people used to stop in summertime and enjoy \\"the good air\\", which is unimaginable today. It must be said that Cardinal Peretti had shown his great interest in this area even before he became Pope, as he ordered the construction of a huge villa, with a park richly adorned with fountains and portals, between Santa Maria Maggiore and the present Via Marsala and Via del Viminale.The villa, which later became Villa Montalto Peretti Massimo, was demolished immediately after the unification of Italy for the urbanization of the area and today no trace remains of it, with the only exception of the Fontana del Prigione now in Trastevere In the 17th century some Jesuits, back from a mission in the Far East, established here and nicknamed the borough Macao: the name was widely used up to the post-war period and is currently evoked by a street of the rione (Via del Macao). After the Capture of Rome, the rione experienced a feverish development, just as the other rioni that were urbanized at the time, and a number of huge stile umbertino palaces, such as the headquarters of the Ministers of Treasury and of Defence, were built alongside Via Venti Settembre; relevant arteries were also opened, such as Via Nazionale and Via Cavour. In the same period, two important Roman squares were built (Piazza dell'Indipendenza, with a central garden, and the monumental Piazza della Repubblica, with the Fontana delle Naiadi in the center and the two large Savoy palaces with arcades on the sides, following the exedra of the Baths on which the square was built), as well as a number of luxury buildings, like the Albergo Quirinale, the Grand Hotel and the Teatro Costanzi (the current Teatro dell'Opera di Roma). The original core (the present one dates back to a complete twentieth-century reconstruction) of the Termini railway station was also built. Between 1883 and 1886, Villa Peretti Massimo was demolished, and Palazzo Massimo alle Terme was built in place of it, to house the Collegio Massimo, a Jesuit school: it is now the main seat of the National Roman Museum. right = Coat or arms = Gules, Praetorians insignia Or. The coat of arms is the labarum of the Praetorian Guard in gold on a red background.Note that the coat of arms of the rione was established by Council Resolution no. 20 of 20 August 1921, which describes it without showing its image. The image that is most frequently used, that is a \\"generic\\" sign of a legion with an aquila, is historically inaccurate for two reasons: first, the Resolution evidently referred to the \\"specific\\" insignia of the Praetorian guard (with reference to the Castra Praetoria), that is, the scorpio which appeared on the vexilla of the guard as a sign of gratitude towards the Emperor Tiberius (who was born under this zodiac sign); second, the aquila could only be carried by the Aquilifer of a legion, and certainly could not appear on the vexillum of the Praetorians, who could not form a legion since they resided within the city. GeographyBoundaries= To the north-west, Castro Pretorio borders with Sallustiano (R. XVII), from which is separated by Via XX Settembre, up to Porta Pia. To the north-east, Castro Pretorio borders with Quartiere Nomentano (Q. V), whose boundary is outlined by the stretch of the Aurelian Walls beside Viale del Policlinico, between Porta Pia and Viale Castro Pretorio and by a portion of the Viale itself. To the east, the rione borders with Quartiere Tiburtino (Q. VI), from which is separated by the stretch of the Aurelian Walls alongside Viale Pretoriano, up to Piazzale Sisto V and the arch of the same name. Southward, Castro Pretorio borders with Esquilino (R. XV), whose boundary is outlined by Piazzale Sisto V, Via Marsala, Viale Enrico De Nicola, Piazza dei Cinquecento, Via Giovanni Giolitti and Via Gioberti. To the south, it also borders with Monti (R. I), whose border is marked by Via dell'Esquilino, Piazza dell'Esquilino, Via Agostino Depretis and Via delle Quattro Fontane. Westward, it borders with Trevi (R. II), from which is separated by Via XX Settembre and Piazza San Bernardo. =Local geography= The rione shows a clearly Piedmontese road network, whose streets, straight and not too wide, follow an orthogonal pattern. This typical nineteenth-century urban plan can be found especially in the area between Via Venti Settembre, Viale Castro Pretorio, Via del Castro Pretorio and the long straight road Via Volturno-Via Marsala, with its center in the large Piazza dell'Indipendenza, the focal point of this section of the rione; a grid of secondary roads, bearing names that recall the places where the Italian wars of independence took place, radiates from the square. This is the most populated area of the rione, showing the urban coexistence of two-storey villas, Stile umbertino palaces, offices and more or less luxurious hotels intended to accommodate the large number of tourists from the nearby Termini railway station. The most monumental part of the rione, as well as most \\"international\\" one due to the large flow of tourists, is certainly Piazza della Repubblica (formerly Piazza Esedra) together with Via Nazionale, the crossroads of the Quattro Fontane and Via Cavour, important arteries connecting the railway station and the historic center.

History Up to 1870, the area was moderately inhabited, with some major religious building and many archaeological remains appearing in the vast filed and vineyards. Following to the unification of Italy, the district was among the first to be urbanized, between 1872 and 1873, with new service buildings and residences for the newcomers. Particularly, a military hospital was built on the summit of the Caelian hill between 1885 and 1891, close to the medieval site of Santo Stefano in Formis, an ancient monastery with an annexed hospital. Up until the postwar period, the road scheme has been reworked in the lower part of the rione, near the Colosseo, and in 1968 a big public housing complex, that was located among Piazza Celimontana, Via Claudia, Via Annia and Via dei Simmachi, was demolished: the plot, facing the military hospital, is now a public park (Parco della Pace).

A 1720 plaque remembering the public use of Prati di Testaccio Until the urban recovery that took place after 1870, which destined a huge area to industrial and manufacturing purposes, the borough was chiefly inhabited by poor farmers and shepherds, it was vulnerable to the Tiber floods and infested by malaria. The zone between Monte Testaccio and the city walls (Prati di Testaccio) was public and commonly used by the citizens as a recreation ground, traditional destination of holiday trips and of the typical ottobrate, hence the name prati del popolo romano (Rome people's meadows). The portion of the rione, inside the Aurelian Walls, is born as a residential extension of the productive area, housing the laborers of the several industries that arose at the end of 19th century by the side of Via Ostiense. The first town plan, in 1873, designated the area for the industrial expansion of Rome because of the level terrain and of the several communication routes with the city, such as Via Ostiense, the river and the new railway. Albeit until 1921 the rione was administratively a portion of Ripa, Testaccio has always had a strong identity, even if it had often a bad reputation, especially due to the countless traffics that took place in the harbor. In 1884 an inquiry launched by the municipality bestowed on Testaccio the national record in alcohol usage, while between the 80s and the 90s it was the stronghold of the so called Testaccini, a branch of the Banda della Magliana. Testaccio is considered the cradle of A.S. Roma, as the Campo Testaccio has been the home stadium of the football club between 1929 and 1940. In modern times, the area has become a center of activity for butchers. Testaccio was one of Rome's traditional working class neighborhoods, but the recent process of gentrification has made it increasingly attractive to tourists. The neighborhood is home to several of Rome's culinary highlights. Testaccio's reputation among tourists is expanding. Geography Initially a part of Ripa, the rione was established in 1921. Testaccio has two principal squares: * Piazza Testaccio, the core of the rione, location of the local market until 2012, when it was moved to Via Luigi Galvani; * Piazza Santa Maria Liberatrice, the social kernel of the borough, where the church and the theatre are: the square has an ample park in the middle, which is named after the Di Consiglio family, fallen in the Ardeatine massacre. =Boundaries= Eastward, the rione is separated from San Saba (R. XXI) by the portion of Via Marmorata between Piazzale Ostiense and Largo Manlio Gelsomini, while the boundary with Ripa (R. XII) is marked by the remaining stretch of Via Marmorata, up to Piazza dell'Emporio. To the west and to the north, Testaccio borders with quartiere Portuense (Q. XI), from which it is separated by the stretch of the River Tiber between Ponte Sublicio and Ponte San Paolo. Southward, the rione borders with quartiere Ostiense (Q. X): the border is defined by the Aurelian Walls beside Viale del Campo Boario, between Ponte San Paolo and Piazzale Ostiense. =Odonymy= Roads and squares of Testaccio are mostly named after explorers, scientists and engineers.

It is located within the Municipio I, and takes its name from the Basilica of San Saba, which is located there. History The church of San Saba and the attached monastery, which after the fall of the Roman Empire have been for centuries the only populated settlement in the area, were built by some hermits between 7th and 9th century. The monastery soon became a powerful and lively institution, with many properties and an advanced diplomatic activity that made it influential in Constantinople and among the barbarians. A view of some ICP houses At the beginning of 20th century the church and the monastery were still surrounded by the countryside, and the 1909 town plan led to the urbanization of the area. Between 1907 and 1914 the Municipality commissioned the construction of a public housing complex for the clerical middle class, between the church and the Aurelian Walls to the Istituto Case Popolari. The planning was entrusted to the young architect Quadrio Pirani and the wide, tree-lined roads were named after prominent architects and artists. The public houses are semi-detached houses and little apartment blocks, with no more than 4 floors, each covered with bricks whose color evokes the ancient walls of the monastery. Positioned on the level top of the Aventine hill, the rione is crossed by rises and steps declining to the walls or to Testaccio. GeographyBoundaries= Northward, the rione borders with Ripa (R. XII), being delimited by Largo Manlio Gelsomini, Via Manlio Gelsomini, Piazza Albania, Viale Aventino and Piazza di Porta Capena. Eastward, San Saba is separated from Celio (R. XIX) by Piazza di Porta Capena, Via Valle delle Camene, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, Piazzale Numa Pompilio and Via di Porta San Sebastiano. To the south, San Saba borders with quartieri Ardeatino (Q. XX) and Ostiense (Q. X): the boundary is marked by the Aurelian Walls, beside Viale di Porta Ardeatina, and by Piazzale Ostiense. Westward, the rione is separated from Testaccio (R. XX) by the portion of Via Marmorata between Piazzale Ostiense and Largo Manlio Gelsomini. =Odonymy= The rione revolves around a principal square Piazza Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which gathers all the elements that characterize an autonomous village, e.g. the elementary school, named after Leopoldo Franchetti, a park, a recreation ground and the nearby church, the market, several stores and a little theatre. One of the main roads of San Saba is Viale Guido Baccelli, passing through the archaeological zone: it was named after the great physician and politician because of his dedication to the promotion of the archaeological area. Other roads and squares are mostly named after artists and architects. Street names of the rione can be categorized as follows: * Local names, such as Via di San Saba, Via di Villa Pepoli and Viale Aventino; * Names that recall Roman antiquity, e.g. Piazza Remuria, Via Antonina, Via Antoniniana (both named after Antoninus Caracalla), Via Annia Faustina, Via Lucio Fabio Cilone, Via delle Terme di Caracalla; * Artists and architects, e.g. Leon Battista Alberti, Francesco Borromini, Bramante, Giacomo Della Porta, Giotto, Pirro Ligorio, Carlo Maderno, Andrea Palladio, Baldassarre Peruzzi, Bartolomeo Pinelli, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Baccio Pontelli, Flaminio Ponzio, Ercole Rosa, Federico Zuccari; * Fallen in the Battle for Rome in 1943, e.g. Largo Bruno Baldinotti and Largo Enzo Fioritto.

It belongs to the Municipio I since 2013, while previously, along with Borgo and quartieri Trionfale and Della Vittoria, it was part of the Municipio XVII. Its coat of arms depicts the shape of Hadrian's mausoleum, in a blue color on a silver background. Although it technically belongs to the rione Borgo, Hadrian's mausoleum (the modern Castel Sant'Angelo) is one of Prati's landmarks. Piazza Cavour History During the Roman Empire, the area mainly consisted of vineyards and rushes and took the name of Horti Domitii, being owned by Domitia Longina, the wife of Domitian. The area was later called also Prata Neronis and, in the Middle Age, it was known as Prata Sancti Petri (St. Peter's Fields), referring to the nearby basilica. Until 1883 the whole borough was a vast expanse of fields, meadows, pastures and wetlands, with just a few farmhouses, chiefly on the slopes of Monte Mario. All the names by which the area has been called over time denote it as a wild, flat and deserted grassland: Pianella di Prati, Pianella d'Oltretevere and Prati di Castello, the latter referring to Castel Sant'Angelo. In 1873 cardinal Xavier de M√©rode, who owned a great portion of the area, signed an agreement with the municipality, in order to start the construction of the new district, however the first urban interventions began only in 1883, when the area was officially included in the new city plan. The borough, however, remained marginal because of the lack of infrastructures, and de M√©rode himself paid for the creation of an iron bridge near the Porto di Ripetta, later dismantled after the inauguration of Ponte Umberto I. Mayor Ernesto Nathan, between 1907 and 1914, started to deal with the administrative and urban problems of the district, originating from the exceptional development of the city. In 1921 the rione was officially established: it was intended to host administrative offices of the newborn Kingdom of Italy and residences of civil servants coming from all over Italy. Piazza del Risorgimento. The road scheme was planned in order that from none of the new roads the dome of St. Peter's Basilica could be visible in the background, because of the tense relationship between the new kingdom and the Holy See. Also toponymy is a proof of it, since roads and squares were named after prominent leaders of the Roman Republic and Empire, pagan writers and scholars, heroes of the Risorgimento. In 1911 the main road of the rione was dedicated to Cola di Rienzo, the popular leader who in the 14th century tried to establish a republican government in Rome. During the construction works, a large amount of ground and fill was carried in the area, in order to create a difference in altitude and to protect the new district from the Tiber floods, that were very common in the past. As the ground employed was mainly clayey, the new buildings often needed stabilization works, and the Palace of Justice had to be reinforced many times to avoid it collapsed because of its size. The first buildings arose alongside the Lungotevere dei Mellini and Via Vittoria Colonna. The urbanization of Prati proceeded until the first half of the 20th century, however modern buildings have lately took the place of the original houses and many buildings have been raised and expanded over time. Wide roads set up in a geometrical scheme, elegant stile umbertino buildings and Art Nouveau cottages currently distinguishes Prati: born as a public housing district to host civil servants coming from all over Italy, it now claims to be a bourgeois district, and its thoroughfare, Via Cola di Rienzo, one of the most famous streets in Rome, is consistently ranked among the most important shopping streets in the city. Geography The main roads of the rione are Via Cola di Rienzo and the rectilinear way formed by Via Cicerone, Via Marcantonio Colonna and Via Lepanto. The said roads are the center of the commercial life of Prati, along with Viale Giulio Cesare, Via Ottaviano and Via Germanico. =Boundaries= To the north, the rione borders with quartiere Della Vittoria (Q. XV), from which is separated by the whole Viale delle Milizie, from Via Trionfale to Ponte Giacomo Matteotti. Eastward, it borders with quartiere Flaminio (Q. I), whose border is marked by the stretch of the River Tiber between Ponte Matteotti and Via Luisa di Savoia, and with Campo Marzio (R. IV), which is separated from Prati by the Tiber itself, up to Via Ulpiano. Southward, Prati borders with Ponte (R. V), the boundary being the stretch of the Tiber between Via Ulpiano and Piazza Adriana, with Borgo (R. XIV) (from which is separated by Piazza Adriana itself, Via Alberico II, Via Properzio, Piazza Americo Capponi, Via Stefano Porcari and Piazza del Risorgimento) and the Vatican City, which is separated by the Vatican Walls, from Piazza del Risorgimento to Viale Vaticano. To the west, the rione borders with quartiere Trionfale (Q. XIV): the boundary is marked by Via Leone IV, up to Viale delle Milizie. =Odonymy= Streets and squares are mostly named after Ancient Rome personalities. Odonyms of the rione can be categorized as follows: * Roman statesmen, e.g. Via Attilio Regolo, Via Caio Mario, Via Catone, Via Fabio Massimo, Via dei Gracchi, Via Paolo Emilio, Via Pompeo Magno, Via Silla, Via Vespasiano, Piazza dei Quiriti; * Roman authors, e.g. Via Cicerone, Via Boezio, Via Cassiodoro, Via Catullo, Via Lucrezio Caro, Via Orazio, Via Ovidio, Via Terenzio, Via Varrone, Via Virgilio; * Roman jurists, e.g. Via Ulpiano, Via Triboniano; * Warriors, e.g. Via Marcantonio Colonna, Via Alessandro Farnese, Via Virginio Orsini; * Humanists, archaeologists and writers, e.g. Via Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, Via Francesco Cancellieri, Via Federico Cesi, Via Vittoria Colonna, Via Marianna Dionigi, Via Pomponio Leto, Via Pietro Della Valle, Via Sforza Pallavicini, Via Pietro Cossa, Via Ennio Quirino Visconti; * Artists, e.g. Via Luigi Calamatta, Via Pietro Cavallini, Via dei Cosmati, Via Paolo Mercuri, Via Benedetto Pistrucci.

As of Windows Vista, LPC has been rewritten as Asynchronous Local Inter- Process Communicationhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ntdebugging/2007/07/26/lpc- local-procedure-calls-part-1-architecture/ (ALPC, often also Advanced Local Procedure Call) in order to provide a high-speed scalable communication mechanism required to efficiently implement User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF), whose user-mode parts require an efficient communication channel with UMDF's components in the executive. The (A)LPC interface is part of Windows NT's undocumented Native API, and as such is not available to applications for direct use. However, it can be used indirectly in the following instances: * when using the Microsoft RPC API to communicate locally, i.e. between the processes on the same machine * by calling Windows APIs that are implemented with (A)LPC (see below) Implementation (A)LPC is implemented using kernel \\"port\\" objects, which are securable (with ACLs, allowing e.g. only specific SIDs to use them) and allow identification of the process on the other side of the connection. Individual messages are also securable: applications can set per-message SIDs, and also test for changes of the security context in the token associated with the (A)LPC message. The typical communication scenario between the server and the client is as follows: # A server process first creates a named server connection port object, and waits for clients to connect. # A client requests a connection to that named port by sending a connect message. # If the server accepts the connection, two unnamed ports are created: #* client communication port - used by client threads to communicate with a particular server #* server communication port - used by the server to communicate with a particular client; one such port per client is created # The client receives a handle to the client communication port, and server receives a handle to the server communication port, and the inter-process communication channel is established. (A)LPC supports the following three modes of message exchange between the server and client: * For short messages (fewer than 256 bytes) the kernel copies the message buffers between processes, from the address space of the sending process to the system address space, and from there to the receiving process' address space. * For messages longer than 256 bytes a shared memory section must be used to transfer data, which the (A)LPC service maps between the sending and receiving processes. First the sender places data into the shared memory, and then sends a notification (e.g. a small message, using the first method of (A)LPC) to the receiving process pointing to the sent data in the shared memory section. * Server can directly read and write data from the client's address space, when the amount of data is too large to fit in a shared section. ALPC has a performance advantage over the former LPC interface, as it can be configured to use I/O completion ports instead of synchronous request/reply mechanism that LPC exclusively uses. This enables ALPC ports high-speed communication which automatically balances the number of messages and threads. Additionally, ALPC messages can be batched together so as to minimize user-mode/kernel-mode switches. Known usage (A)LPC is used heavily in communication between internal subsystems in Windows NT. The Win32 subsystem uses (A)LPC heavily for communication between client and the subsystem server (CSRSS). Quick LPC was introduced in version 3.51 of Windows NT to make these calls faster. This method was largely abandoned in version 4.0 in favor of moving the performance critical server portions into kernel mode (win32k.sys). The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), Session Manager (SMSS), and Service Control Manager all use (A)LPC ports directly to communicate with client processes. Winlogon and the Security Reference Monitor use it to communicate with the LSASS process. As mentioned, Microsoft RPC can use (A)LPC as a transport when the client and server are both on the same machine. Many services that are designed to communicate only on the local computer use (A)LPC as the only transport through RPC. The implementation of remote OLE and DCOM in many cases uses (A)LPC for local communication as well.

YogƒÅcƒÅra-Svatantrika-MƒÅdhyamika), which united the Madhyamaka tradition of Nagarjuna, the Yogacara tradition of Asanga, and the logical and epistemological thought of Dharmakirti. ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita was instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet which was conducted at Samye. His philosophic views were the main views in Tibet from the 8th century until it was mostly supplanted by Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa·πÖgika Madhyamaka in the 15th century. In the late 19th century, Ju Mipham attempted to promote his views again as part of the Rim√© movement and as a way to discuss specific critiques of Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa·πÖgika. Biography There are few historical records of ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, with most available material being from hagiographic sources. Some of his history is detailed in a 19th-century commentary by Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso drawn from sources like the Blue Annals, Buton Rinchen Drub and Taranatha. ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita was the son of the king of Zahor.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.2‚Äì3 Born in Rewalsar,Omacanda HƒÅ·πá·∏çƒÅ, Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history, Indus Publishing, p. 314 in the modern-state of Himachal Pradesh in India, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita was brought to Tibetan Empire at the instigation of Emperor Trisong Detsen sometime before 767 CE. One account details his first trip as unsuccessful and he spent six years in Nepal before returning to Tibet.Contribution of Indian Buddhists in Nepal Once established in Tibet, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita oversaw the translation of a large body of scriptures into Tibetan. He oversaw the construction of the first Buddhist monastery at Samye in 787 CE and ordained the first monastics there. He stayed at Samye Monastery for the rest of his life, another 13 years after its completion, and this was considered significant by Tibetans later that he stayed and did not return to India. It is said that he was kicked to death by a horse.Banerjee, 1982 P.5 Also, in some accounts he left Tibet for a time due to the antipathy of Bonpos and interference from local spirits. Tibetan teachings ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita focused his early teachings in Tibet, directed to the 'seven that were tested', upon the 'ten virtues' (; Sanskrit: da≈õaku≈õala; Pali: dasa sikkhapadani or dasa sila) and 'the chain of casual relation' (). The ten virtues are the opposite of the 'ten non-virtues' (; Sanskrit: da≈õƒÅku≈õala). WritingsMadhyamakalamkara= ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's synthesis of Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and Pramana was expounded in his text MadhyamakƒÅla·πÉkƒÅra. In the short verse text of the MadhyamakƒÅla·πÉkƒÅra, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita details his two truths doctrine philosophical synthesis of the conventional truth of the Yogacara philosophy, with the ultimate truth of the Madhyamaka, with the assistance of Buddhist logic, with a protracted discussion of the argument of \\"neither one nor many\\". In his synthesis text, readers are advised to adopt Madhyamaka view and approach from Nagarjuna and Aryadeva when analysing for ultimacy and to adopt the mind-only views of the Yogacarans Asanga and Vasubandhu when considering conventional truth. He also incorporates the logic approach of valid cognition and the Sautrantika views of DignƒÅga and Dharmakirti. Within the Yogacara in that text he also included the SautrƒÅntika and \\"consciousness- only\\" Yogacara views specifically when referring to \\"conventional truth\\", one of the two truths doctrine. His view is therefore categorised as \\"Yogacara- Svatantrika-Madhyamaka\\" by later Tibetans, but he did not refer to himself that way. =Tattvasa·πÉgraha= ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita is also known for his text Tattvasa·πÉgraha (Compendium on Reality), which is a more encyclopaedic treatment of the major philosophic views of the time and survived in translation in Tibet. A Sanskrit version of this work was discovered in 1873 by Dr. G. B√ºhler in the Jain temple of PƒÅr≈õva at Jaisalmer. This version contains also the commentary by ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's pupil Kamala≈õƒ´la.

The Rim√© movement was funded by the secular authorities in Derge, Kham, and began to establish centres of learning encouraging the study of traditions different from the dominant Gelug tradition in central Tibet. This Rim√© movement revitalised the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and Jonang traditions, which had been by almost supplanted by the Gelug hegemony.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.4‚Äì5 As part of that movement the 19th century Nyingma scholar Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso wrote the first commentary in almost 400 years about ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's Madhyamakalankara. According to his student Kunzang Palden, Mipham had been asked by his teacher Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo to write a survey of all the major Mahayana philosophic shastras for use in the Nyingma monastic colleges. Mipham's commentaries now form the backbone of the Nyingma monastic curriculum. The Madhyamakalankara, which was almost forgotten by the 19th century, is now studied by all Nyingma shedra students.

Club career Born in Belfast, McVeigh started his career at Tottenham Hotspur where he made 3 appearances scoring 1 goal against Coventry City. He joined Norwich City in March 2000 on a free transfer. The following season he made 6 starts and 6 substitute appearances. He also scored his first goal for the club in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The following season he scored 10 goals as Norwich reached the final of the Division One play-offs. In the 2002‚Äì03 campaign he was the club's top scorer with 15 goals. Most of those goals came when he was partnering Iwan Roberts upfront, although later in the season Worthington decided to move him to left midfield. The following season he scored 5 goals in over 40 appearances and helped Norwich win promotion to the FA Premier League. During the 2004‚Äì05 season in the Premier League, McVeigh made 20 first team appearances, and his highlight was when he scored at Old Trafford in Norwich's first away game. McVeigh was made available for transfer by manager Nigel Worthington at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season although towards the end of 2005 injuries forced Worthington to start McVeigh. McVeigh played incredibly well for the remainder of the season scoring vital goals at Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield United. This helped gain him the player of the month award in December and January and he signed a one-year contract extension. He started off the 2006‚Äì07 season from the bench but got a run in the team by October. McVeigh made a bad first impression on new manager Peter Grant when he was sent off for headbutting in injury time during the 1‚Äì0 win over Cardiff. McVeigh got very few opportunities under Grant and was loaned out to Burnley for the last few months of the season where he scored 3 goals helping them to survive in the championship. McVeigh was released by Norwich at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. In July 2007 McVeigh trained with the Italian Serie B side PisaFlown From the Nest ‚Äì Paul McVeigh before Plymouth Argyle manager Ian Holloway gave him a trial with a view to signing him. A 6-month deal was offered but not accepted and the following month he signed for Luton Town, the ninth player Luton manager Kevin Blackwell had signed in the summer. McVeigh was offered a free transfer after Luton were relegated at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, but remained at the club as he was under contract until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He featured in the game against Bradford City on 4 October, and then played regularly until late December, scoring his first goal for the club in the 2‚Äì1 victory against Dagenham & Redbridge. On 19 May 2009 he began a short trial with MLS team San Jose Earthquakes in a bid to gain a contract after being released from Luton on a free transfer. The following season, 2009‚Äì2010, McVeigh began training with his old club Norwich City with City manager Bryan Gunn not ruling out signing McVeigh and on 22 July 2009, McVeigh re-signed for Norwich on a one- year contract. McVeigh made his second debut for Norwich in their 5‚Äì2 victory over Wycombe. McVeigh started the first few games under Paul Lambert although and dropped down to the bench while the team went on a 20-game unbeaten run. He made his only appearance in 2010 coming on as a substitute in the 3‚Äì0 win over Bristol Rovers. He won his second league title with Norwich helping them gain promotion back to the Championship before calling a day on his professional career. Norwich fans sing a song dedicated to the popular McVeigh; to the tune of Frankie Valli's Can't Take My Eyes Off You, it notes the fans' love of him \\"despite your lack of height\\". International career Between 1999 and 2004 he was capped by Northern Ireland 20 times, first by Lawrie McMenemy in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Canada on 27 April 1999 whilst a youngster at Tottenham, then on 11 occasions by Sammy McIlroy after McVeigh moved to Norwich and finally on eight more occasions by Lawrie Sanchez.

Information fusion, which is a related term, involves the combination of information into a new set of information towards reducing redundancy and uncertainty. Examples of technologies available to integrate information include deduplication, and string metrics which allow the detection of similar text in different data sources by fuzzy matching.

The three parts of the peninsula, from west to east, are Fischland (part of Mecklenburg), Dar√ü and Zingst (part of Pomerania). There are six villages on the peninsula - Wustrow, Ahrenshoop, Born, Wieck, Prerow and Zingst. Between the peninsula and the mainland there is a very shallow lagoon (Low German: bodden), the Saaler Bodden, which is part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park, together with the peninsula.  History  In historical times, the main part of Fischland as well as the Dar√ü and the Zingst were islands. They became permanently joined to the mainland as a result of humans sealing the floodwater channels between the 14th and 19th centuries. During the 1872 Baltic Sea flood, which inundated Prerow on the Dar√ü, the Prerower Strom, that had hitherto separated the island of Zingst from Dar√ü, silted up. In 1874 the Prerow-Strom was finally filled in and sealed with a dyke; Zingst thus became a peninsula. The eastern part of the Zingst peninsula and the middle of the Dar√ü are part of the West Pomeranian Lagoon Area National Park.

This was much more effective than manually selecting the random samples (with dice, cards, etc.). Nowadays, tables of random numbers have been replaced by computational random number generators. If carefully prepared, the filtering and testing processes remove any noticeable bias or asymmetry from the hardware-generated original numbers so that such tables provide the most \\"reliable\\" random numbers available to the casual user. Note that any published (or otherwise accessible) random data table is unsuitable for cryptographic purposes since the accessibility of the numbers makes them effectively predictable, and hence their effect on a cryptosystem is also predictable. By way of contrast, genuinely random numbers that are only accessible to the intended encoder and decoder allow literally unbreakable encryption of a similar or lesser amount of meaningful data (using a simple exclusive OR operation) in a method known as the one-time pad, which has often insurmountable problems that are barriers to implementing this method correctly. History Tables of random numbers have the desired properties no matter how chosen from the table: by row, column, diagonal or irregularly. The first such table was published by L.H.C. Tippett in 1927, and since then a number of other such tables were developed. The first tables were generated through a variety of ways--one (by L.H.C. Tippett) took its numbers \\"at random\\" from census registers, another (by R.A. Fisher and Francis Yates) used numbers taken \\"at random\\" from logarithm tables, and in 1939 a set of 100,000 digits were published by M.G. Kendall and B. Babington Smith produced by a specialized machine in conjunction with a human operator. In the mid-1940s, the RAND Corporation set about to develop a large table of random numbers for use with the Monte Carlo method, and using a hardware random number generator produced A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates. The RAND table used electronic simulation of a roulette wheel attached to a computer, the results of which were then carefully filtered and tested before being used to generate the table. The RAND table was an important breakthrough in delivering random numbers because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available (the largest previously published table was ten times smaller in size), and because it was also available on IBM punched cards, which allowed for its use in computers. In the 1950s, a hardware random number generator named ERNIE was used to draw British premium bond numbers. The first \\"testing\\" of random numbers for statistical randomness was developed by M.G. Kendall and B. Babington Smith in the late 1930s, and was based upon looking for certain types of probabilistic expectations in a given sequence. The simplest test looked to make sure that roughly equal numbers of 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. were present; more complicated tests looked for the number of digits between successive 0s and compared the total counts with their expected probabilities. Over the years more complicated tests were developed. Kendall and Smith also created the notion of \\"local randomness\\", whereby a given set of random numbers would be broken down and tested in segments. In their set of 100,000 numbers, for example, two of the thousands were somewhat less \\"locally random\\" than the rest, but the set as a whole would pass its tests. Kendall and Smith advised their readers not to use those particular thousands by themselves as a consequence. Published tables still have niche uses, particularly in the performance of experimental music pieces that call for them, such as Vision (1959) and Poem (1960) by La Monte Young.http://www.users.waitrose.com/~chobbs/smithyoung.html retrieved 29 August 2012  See also  * A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates * Kish grid ReferencesExternal links * Data from A Million Random Digits With 100,000 Normal Deviates by the RAND Corporation Category:Random number generation ","title":"Random number table"},{"id":"2714862","text":"Holy Cross College is a Catholic Sixth Form College for students aged 16 and above.

Due to his idealism about the Great War and the posthumous popularity of his writing, Walter Flex is sometimes compared to Allied war poets Rupert Brooke and Alan Seeger. Biography Walter Flex was born at Eisenach, in the Kingdom of Prussia, on July 6, 1887. The second of four sons, Walter's father, a secondary school teacher, was a fervent admirer of Otto von Bismarck, and all four of his sons were brought up to revere the former German Chancellor. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Flex had a happy childhood and showed no interest in the world until the Second Anglo-Boer War began in 1898. Due to his sympathy for \\"the underdog\\", Flex, like many other Germans of his time, sympathised with the Boer Republics in their battle against the British Empire. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Flex went to the University of Erlangen where he studied German, thanks to the award of a bursary. According to Tim Cross, \\"Walter Flex's first attempt at drama was the tragedy Demetrius, about the Tsarist Pretender. In his following works for the stage, social problems form the core, as in Lothar, Die Bauernf√ºhrer, Das heilige Blut, and Der Kanzler Klaus von Bismarck. These revolve around the premise that society is necessary. Each individual is like a thread, insignificant, disposable, and only makes sense if he is a thread woven into the fabric of the carpet. Interesting as these plays are in the context in which they were written, it cannot be claimed that Flex was am original writers a dramatist, he laboured much under the influence of Hebbel. His poetry is the least distinguished of his output, and appears more as an exercise towards the prose works such as Wallenstein and Der Wanderer.\\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, pp. 185‚Äì186. Flex was successful academically and became a teacher like his father. His first appointment was as a private tutor to the family of Chancellor von Bismarck. A later appointment was to the family of Baron von Leesen, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War in August 1914. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. Despite weak ligaments in his right hand, Flex volunteered for the Imperial German Army in his mother's birthplace of Rawitsch and was assigned to the 50th Infantry. By September 1914, Flex saw combat in the Argonne. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. According to Tim Cross, \\"His poetic outpourings on the war were prolific. Two collections, Sonne und Schild and Im Felde Zwischen Tag und Nacht were produced in the first months of the war. His body, soul, and literary talent were placed wholly at the disposal of the war-effort. The Christmas Fable for the 50th Regiment earned him the Order of the Red Eagle with Crown.\\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. While going through officer training at Posen in early 1915, Flex met Ernst Wurche, a fellow member of the Wandervogel youth movement. Wurche lived by the motto, \\"To stay pure is to mature.\\" Wurche also always carried three books in his backpack: the New Testament, the poems of Goethe, and Friedrich Nietzsche's Also Sprach Zarathustra. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. Flex viewed Wurche as the epitome of the new German and made his friend the subject of the novella Der Wanderer zwischen Beiden Weltem (\\"A Wanderer between Two Worlds\\"), which has never been out of print since its first publication. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, pp. 185‚Äì186. Taking part in Operation Albion, Flex was wounded in action. He died of his wounds at Oti Manor, in Saaremaa on October 16, 1917. Walter Flex was buried in the cemetery of Peude Church in the village of the same name, on Saaremaa island, in modern Estonia. His epitaph was a quote from one of his works Preu√üischer Fahneneid (\\"The Prussian Military Oath\\" written in 1915): :\\"Wer je auf Preu√üens Fahne schw√∂rt, :Hat nichts mehr, was ihm selbst geh√∂rt.\\" (Translation: :\\"He who on Prussia's banner swears :has nothing left that belongs to himself.\\")Walter Flex.

Legacy His Wanderer zwischen beiden Welten was published in 1916, by Verlag C. H. Beck, and was well received. By 1917, over 700,000 copies had been printed in Germany‚Äîa testament to his extreme popularity with the wartime public. Tim Cross compares Flex's posthumous popularity and the idealization of his wartime death with the similar cultus surrounding English war poet Rupert Brooke. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Under the Weimar Republic, Flex's reputation grew further. Between 1933 and 1945, Flex's romanticism and idealism were exploited for propaganda by the Nazi Party, which found his poetry and prose especially appealing and considered Flex the epitome of Aryan ideals. According to Flex, however, \\"It is not national patriotism I represent, but demands for the moral good. When I wrote about the perpetuity of the German race and about the deliverence of the world by the Germanic, it had nothing to do with national egotism; rather it is a moral conviction which can be realized as much in the defeat or in the heroic sacrifice of a nation.\\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, page 185. In 1940, Flex's body was moved from Estonia to a new military cemetery before of the Sackenheimer Tor at K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Walter Flex's grave, along with the rest the city, was destroyed in Allied air raids and during the three-month siege previous to the city's surrender to the Red Army on April 9, 1945.Fritz Gause. K√∂nigsberg in Preu√üen. (Gr√§fe und Unzer, 1968), p. 226. As a song, Flex's poem Wildg√§nse rauschen durch die Nacht gained popularity with the Wandervogel youth and was well known and sung in Germany until the 1970s. During the time of (and partly due to his influence on) the German student movement, his reputation faded almost entirely .

IV. It belongs to the Municipio I and covers a smaller section of the area of the ancient Campus Martius. The logo of this rione is a silver crescent on a blue background.  History  A plaque bearing the old name Campo Marzo, which was used up until 19th century: the plaque is still located above a side entrance of Porta del Popolo Until the domination of Napoleon, in 19th century, the rione was also known by the name Campo Marzo. In the Middle Age, after the main aqueducts of the city were ruined during the Gothic sieges in 6th century and following to the establishing of St. Peter's Basilica as a focal point for pilgrims, Campo Marzio became one of the most densely populated zones of Rome. The borough was crossed by the procession that used to accompany newly-elected Popes from St. Peter's Basilica to their official residence, St. John in Lateran. Moreover, the area was also passed through by the Via Lata, one of the main arteries linking Rome to the rest of Europe, resulting from the merger of Via Cassia and Via Flaminia. The urban pattern was quite dense, and included several monuments and a number of remains of ancient buildings. Campo Marzio experienced manifold urban renewal interventions during the Renaissance, with the construction of several churches and noble palaces. Pope Paul II redeveloped the Via Lata (the current Via del Corso), Pope Julius II promoted the construction of two straight roads on each shore of the Tiber, Via Giulia on the left shore and Via della Lungara on the right one, between Trastevere and the Vatican. Pope Leo X ordered the creation of a new road connecting Ponte Sant'Angelo to Porta del Popolo, the Via Leonina (Via di Ripetta). In 1570, Pope Pius V promoted the restoration of the Acquedotto Vergine, leading to the creation of new fountains in the area. New works were undertaken when Rome became the new Italian capital, in 1870, first of all massive walls were built alongside the Tiber, to avoid floods, which were flanked by Lungotevere in Augusta and Lungotevere Marzio. The rione was linked to the near Prati through the construction of Ponte Regina Margherita in 1891, while in 1902 a new bridge (Ponte Cavour) was built downstream, in line with Piazza Cavour, demolishing the Porto di Ripetta. In 1909, depending on the urban development of Prati, a large demolition project was planned in Campo Marzio, envisaging a new artery climbing down the Pincio and reaching Ponte Cavour. The plan was then modified, and in 1926 a massive refurbishment started in the area near the Mausoleum of Augustus, demolishing about 120 houses and creating a big empty space around it.  Geography Boundaries= Northward, Campo Marzio is delimited by the Aurelian Walls (alongside Via Luisa di Savoia) and by Piazzale Flaminio, that separates it from Quartiere Flaminio (Q. I). To the north, it also borders with Quartiere Pinciano (Q. III), whose border is marked by Piazzale Flaminio and by the portion of the Aurelian Walls beside Viale del Muro Torto. Eastward, Campo Marzio borders with Ludovisi (R. XVI), from which it is separated by Via di Porta Pinciana and Via Francesco Crispi. To the south, it borders with other 3 rioni: Colonna (R. III), from which Campo Marzio is separated by Via Francesco Crispi, Via Capo le Case, Via dei Due Macelli, Via Frattina, Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina and Via di Campo Marzio; Sant'Eustachio (R. VIII), whose boundary is defined by Piazza in Campo Marzio, Via della Stelletta and Via dei Portoghesi; and Ponte (R. V), the boundary being a brief stretch of Via dell'Orso and Via del Cancello, up to the Tiber. To the west, Campo Marzio boundary is the Tiber itself, that separates it from Prati (R. XXII). =Local geography= ;Piazzas * Piazza del Popolo * Piazza di Spagna * Piazza Nicosia ;Roads * Via Bocca di Leone * Via Borgognona * Via dei Condotti * Via del Babuino * Via del Corso * Via della Croce * Via de' Prefetti * Via di Ripetta * Via Margutta * Via Sistina * Via Tomacelli * Via Vittoria * Via Gregoriana  Places of interest Palaces and other buildings= * Accademia di belle arti di Roma, in Via di Ripetta. * Casa di Goethe, in Via del Corso. * Palazzo Della Porta Negroni Caffarelli, in Via dei Condotti. * Palazzo Aragona Gonzaga, in Via della Scrofa. * Palazzo Borghese, in Piazza Borghese. * Palazzo Boncompagni Cerasi, in Via del Babuino. * Palazzo Capilupi, in Via de' Prefetti. * Palazzo Corrodi, in Via Maria Adelaide. * Palazzo Firenze, in Piazza di Firenze. * Palazzo Gabrielli-Mignanelli, in Piazza Mignanelli. * Palazzo Incontro, in Via de' Prefetti. * Palazzo Malta or Palazzo Magistrale, in Via dei Condotti. * Palazzo Nainer, in Via del Babuino. * Palazzo Rondinini, in Via del Corso. * Palazzo Ruspoli, in Via del Corso. * Palazzo dell'Unione Militare, in Via Tomacelli. * Palazzetto Zuccari, in Via Sistina, near Via Gregoriana, and Piazza della Trinit√† dei Monti. * Villa Medici, in Viale della Trinit√† dei Monti. =Archaeological sites= * Ara Pacis * Mausoleum of Augustus * Amphitheater of Statilius Taurus =Churches= * Santa Maria del Popolo * Santa Maria dei Miracoli * Santa Maria in Montesanto * Trinit√† dei Monti * San Rocco all'Augusteo * Santi Ambrogio e Carlo al Corso * Ges√π e Maria * San Girolamo dei Croati * Sant'Antonio in Campo Marzio * Santa Lucia della Tinta * Santa Maria della Concezione in Campo Marzio * Santa Maria Portae Paradisi * Sant'Ivo dei Bretoni * San Gregorio Nazianzeno * San Nicola dei Prefetti * Sant'Atanasio * Santissima Trinit√† degli Spagnoli * San Giacomo in Augusta * Resurrezione di Nostro Signore Ges√π Cristo * San Gregorio dei Muratori * San Giorgio e Martiri Inglesi * All Saints' Church * Rome Baptist Church ReferencesExternal links 01 Category:Rioni of Rome ","title":"Campo Marzio"},{"id":"2714902","text":"Christopher Columbus Amerigo Vespucci This is list of Italian explorers and navigators () in alphabetical order: *Giuseppe Acerbi (1773-1846) *Enrico Alberto d'Albertis (1846-1932) *Carlo Amoretti (1741‚Äì1816) *Paolo Andreani (1763-1823) *Orazio Antinori (1811-1882) *Giosafat Barbaro (1413‚Äì1494) *Giacomo Beltrami (1779‚Äì1855) *Scipione Borghese (1871-1927) *Vittorio Bottego (1860-1897) *Giacomo Bove (1852-1887) *Sebastiano Caboto (1474‚Äì1557) *Umberto Cagni (1863-1932) *Giovanni Caboto (1450‚Äì1500) *Alvise Cadamosto (1432‚Äì1483) *Gaetano Casati (1838‚Äì1902) *Giuseppe Castiglione (1688‚Äì1766) *Cristoforo Colombo (1451‚Äì1506) *Ambrogio Contarini (1429‚Äì1499) *Niccol√≤ de' Conti (1395‚Äì1469) *Andrea Corsali (1487-?) *Antonio da Noli (1418-1496) *Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (1185‚Äì1252) *Ardito Desio (1897‚Äì2001) *Alfonso de Tonti (1659-1727) *Enrico de Tonti (1649-1704) *Andrea Doria (1466-1560) *Eusebio Kino (1645-1711) *Alessandro Malaspina (1754-1810) *Lancelotto Malocello (1269-1335) *Reinhold Messner (born 1944) *Umberto Nobile (1885-1978) *Antonio Pigafetta (1491-1530) *Emanuele Piloti *Marco Polo (c. 1253-1323) *Niccol√≤ and Maffeo Polo (c. 1230 ‚Äì c. 1294, c. 1230 ‚Äì c. 1309) *Michele Pontrandolfo (born 1971) *Domenico Potorti *Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) *Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi (1873-1933) *Pietro Paolo Savorgnan di Brazz√† (1852-1905) *Giovanni da Verrazzano (1484-1527) *Amerigo Vespucci (1454-1512) *Ugolino Vivaldi (fl. 1291) *Vadino Vivaldi (fl. 1291) *Alex Bellini (born 1978) * Explorers Italian ","title":"List of Italian explorers"},{"id":"2714905","text":"The two bridges over the Strelasund, connecting Stralsund and Rugia Island Strelasund Crossing refers to the two bridge links to the German island of R√ºgen (Rugia) over the Strelasund to the West Pomeranian mainland near Stralsund: the R√ºgen Bridge or Rugia Bridge () and the Rugia Causeway (langdeR√ºgendamm}}). Ferry services between Stralsund and Altef√§hr and between Stahlbrode and Glewitz are also available to cross the Strelasund sound. The R√ºgendamm was the first fixed crossing over the sound of Strelasund, for both the old Bundesstra√üe 96, the Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway and a combined footpath and cycle path. It was completed 1936/1937. R√ºgenbr√ºcke is the name of the three-lane viaduct completed in 2007 exclusively for motor traffic, between the village of Altef√§hr on Rugia Island and the Hanseatic and world heritage town of Stralsund; as part of the concept to turn the B96 and European route E22 into a ring road. Both bridges are operated in parallel. The Rugia Bridge has an overall length of , which makes it one of Central Europe's largest bridges.  Bridge crossings  R√ºgen Bridge = Approach on the Stralsund side, approach bridges (5 November 2005) R√ºgen Bridge () is a cable-stayed bridge made of pre-stressed concrete that spans the Strelasund between the city of Stralsund and the island of R√ºgen. The bridge was built to replace the aging R√ºgendamm, which will remain in service to provide a rail link and serve local traffic to D√§nholm island. The bridge has three lanes, the centre one being demand-activated. The main element of the 4,100 metre crossing is the 2,831 metre-long main span over the Strelasund. The crossing comprises a total of seven sections, five of which are bridge structures: * Embankment on the mainland side in Stralsund, * Two approach bridges in Stralsund, * Viaduct over the Ziegelgraben, * D√§nholm approach bridge, * Strelasund approach bridge, * Strelasund Bridge, and * Embankment on the island of R√ºgen.  Southern ramp  The two Y-column pairs, 12 November 2005 The southern bridge ramp begins behind its junction with the Stralsund ring road (the B 96 federal road) and consists, of an 85.53-metre-long embankment structure, measured to the abutment of the first approach bridge. Beyond it are the two Stralsund approach bridges (Vorlandbr√ºcken Stralsund) with gradients of up to 4%. The first, structure BW 1.1, is 327.5-metre-long bridge made of pre-stressed concrete with ten sections and a twin prestressed beam slab girder as the superstructure. BW 1.2 is a 317.0-metre-long bridge with six sections and a single-cell steel composite superstructure that was manufactureed by the steelworks in Neumarkt- Sengenthal. An architectural feature is the B 96 approach road section with its two pairs of Y-supports, which enable the large column spacing of 72 metres at constant height. The railings of the approach bridges have 0.70-metre-high inside walls with laminated safety glass panels as wind deflectors and spray shields. The structures are founded on driven concrete piles cast in-situ.  New Ziegelgraben Bridge (viaduct)  View of the pylon pillars The new Ziegelgraben Bridge (BW 2), designed as a viaduct, crosses the waterway of the Ziegelgraben, an arm of the Strelasund which separates Stralsund from the island of D√§nholm. It has a length of 583.30 metres. The two main section, 126 metres (on the mainland side) and 198 metres (on the D√§nholm side), are designed as a cable-stayed bridge with a three-cell steel box girder frame, which was made in the Neumarkt-Sengenthal steelworks. The bridge enables shipping to pass with a clearance of 42 metres. The 128-metre-high, light blue pylon is divided into two parts: an approximately 40-metre-high base of concrete and an upper part of steel. The superstructure is separated from the base by bridge bearings. The base of the main pillar consists of 40 bored pilings with a 1.5 metre diameter. 32 harp-shaped, diagonally tensioned steel cables suspend the two main openings from the drop- shaped pylon. Model of the steel cables R√ºgen Bridge is fitted with suspension cables using a system unique in Germany, whereby they are triple-protected from corrosion: first the cables are galvanized, secondly they are covered with a coating of polyethylene, and finally with special wax as well. The cables were tested for a year at the Technical University of Munich, and finally approved by the Federal Ministry. The steel cables, with a total mass of up to 135 tons, consist of 34 individual strands that are bundled into a sheath to form a single cable with a diameter of 180 mm. They are rated for a tension of 4000 kN. The railings of the new Ziegelgraben Bridge have a inside lining with laminated safety glass as a wind deflector.  Northern bridge ramp  Bridge over the D√§nholm and Strelasund Bridge The northern bridge ramp consists of three bridges, an embankment and a road section. After the main bridge comes the D√§nholm approach bridge (Vorlandbr√ºcke D√§nholm, BW 3), a 532.3-metre-long approach bridge structure, and the Strelasund approach bridge (Vorlandbr√ºcke Strelasund, BW 4), with a length of 532.2 metres. Both structures have a 10-section, single-cell pre-stressed box girder superstructure and are anchored on bored pilings made of cast-in-place concrete. The railings of the D√§nholm bridge are designed with a internal lining of laminated safety glass as a wind deflector. The final bridge structure is the 539.0-metre-long Strelasund Bridge (Strelasundbr√ºcke, BW 5). This also has a single-cell prestressed concrete box girder superstructure. The last section of the Strelasund Crossing runs down another embankment. The length of this embankment is 455.95 metres, beyond that is a further 732.0 metres of roadway. Filled with 225,000 m¬≥ of earth, the ramp sides have sheet pilings covering an area of 20,690 m¬≤, that runs up to the junction of the crossing with the transport hub of Altef√§hr. In this area there is a cycle path underpass. = R√ºgen Causeway = R√ºgen Causeway (R√ºgendamm, literally \\"R√ºgen Embankment\\") is the name of the original road connecting R√ºgen Island with the City of Stralsund on the mainland of the German state of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern. The road was built in the 1930s and opened in October 1936. The R√ºgendamm consists of two parts: * Strelasund Bridge is a bridge and causeway spanning the Strelasund; its length is and * Ziegelgraben Bridge, a bascule bridge over the Ziegelgraben stream. This bridge opens several times a day to allow for the passage of large ships. Prior to the construction of the new R√ºgen Bridge, the drawbridge bridge was a source of major traffic congestion. The R√ºgendamm provides the only road and rail access to D√§nholm island.  Ferry crossings  Between Stralsund and Altef√§hr there is also a ferry crossing operated by small passenger ships, which are used exclusively for foot passengers. It is operated by the Wei√üe Flotte.  History  For thousands of years the Strelasund has separated the island of R√ºgen from what is today the West Pomeranian mainland. For at least seven millennia, people have settled on the island, establishing their holy sites here too, such as the Swantevit site at Cape Arkona. From the 12th century, Christianity spread to the island. The pagan sites fell into ruins or were slighted. These sites had previously been a destination for many pilgrims also from the mainland. They used boats to cross the sound; boats were also used for trade between the island and the mainland. = Old ferry = The strait was crossed at many different places, because the island lies within sight of the mainland coast along a long stretch. The shortest distance, however, was between the sites of the modern town of Stralsund and the village of Altef√§hr. This point was also very conveniently situated because of the intermediate island of Stralow (later called D√§nholm). From here a regular ferry service evolved; around 1000 or 1100 herring was already being traded here and, during excavations on the island of R√ºgen, even Arabic coins were found. The two ferry stages developed into larger settlements following the arrival of Christianity brought by the Danes. In particular, the ferry village of Stralow (stral means 'arrow' in Middle Low German and Slavic) developed rapidly. At the beginning of the 13th century more and more settlers came, inter alia from Westphalia. Their settlement was encouraged by the princes of R√ºgen and in 1234 Prince Wizlaw I gave town rights to Stralow. The ferry service to Alte F√§hre ('Old Ferry') as the place on R√ºgen was named was becoming increasingly important; more and more goods and wares were traded over the crossing. In 1293 Stralsund became a member of the Hanseatic League and the movement of goods between the island of R√ºgen and the mainland grew in importance and scope. = D√§nholm Ferry = A ferry between D√§nholm and the mainland site of Stralsund was predominantly used by the military. It was established in mid-July 1935, after the completion of the Ziegelgraben Bridge for road traffic. = 2nd Strelasund Crossing = In 2004, construction of a new bridge, called the 2nd Strelasund Crossing (2. Strelasundquerung), commenced. German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the new bridge on 20 October 2007. The name of this new bridge is the R√ºgen Bridge (R√ºgenbr√ºcke). The rugen bridge is a one tower suspension bridge that has nineteen piers holding it up from the water. The connection has a length of , the new bridge is long and the centre pylon is tall. The new bridge crosses but does not provide access to D√§nholm island.  Citations  Literature  * Horst Auerbach (Red.): Von den Postseglern nach Schweden zur Hochbr√ºcke √ºber den Strelasund.

It is one of the chief tributaries of the Tapti river and empties into it at Changdev in Jalgaon, Maharashtra. Etymology The word purna means complete in Sanskrit. It was also called the Payoshni or the Paisani (Sanskrit word meaning Ambrosia). There are other rivers also named Purna (the Khadakpurna and the Katepurna). There are several comparative societies and a highschool is named after Purna river like the Purnamai Vidyalaya,A highschool in Muktainagar taluka (Purna referring to the river and Maai meaning mother).

The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers. All tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the drag (sled). When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \\"full pull\\". When more than one tractor completes the course, more weight is added to the drag (sled), and those competitors that moved past will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the drag (sled) the farthest. The drag (sled) is known as a weight transfer drag (sled). This means that, as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the drag‚Äôs (sled) wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the drag (sled). In front of the rear wheels, instead of front wheels, there is a \\"pan\\". This is essentially a metal plate, and as the weight moves toward it, the resistance between the pan and the ground builds. The farther the tractor pulls the drag (sled), the more difficult it gets. The most powerful tractors, such as those in the heavy modified class in Europe, can produce over . History in the US Prior to the invention of the tractor, when farm implements were pulled by horses, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases, they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay cart or wagon. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would urge his horses to pull the load, with more weight added as competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of horse pulling, which is still carried out today with draft horses, specially bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on drags (sled) are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term horsepower is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by James Watt and Mason Worrell. It wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at Vaughansville, Missouri, and Bowling Green, Ohio. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from state to state, county to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants. In 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \\"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it. Tractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the crossbox which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single driveshaft. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \\"Makin Bacon Special\\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \\"Mission Impossible\\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven blown alcohol engines on board. Subsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large turbochargers, along with intercoolers, but both retained the appearance of a tractor. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \\"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\\" motto obsolete. Throughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' dragsters. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as piston engines, turbine engines (frequently mistakenly called \\"jet engines\\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \\"General\\" Tractor a four-turboshaft unit hitting the hook in 1989. The growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new four-wheel drive division in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from up to and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to naturally aspirated and no blown engine in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \\"4-Play\\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \\"Studley Studebaker\\". =Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class= The two-wheel drive (2WD) division was introduced in 1983. The division imposes a weight-limit of on each competing truck, a maximum width of , and a maximum distance of from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to of cosmetic fiberglass, however.) Alcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted. The National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is , with a maximum circumference of when mounted on an rim and inflated to .

There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to engine and turbocharger. This class typically pulls at and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to engine and an unrestricted size turbocharger, along with intercoolers. The latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls depending on location. These tractors are limited to engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of . The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track. The mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weigh only . Today's engine is capable of a minimum of on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh , utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the weight limit. Nitromethane and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.  Antique tractor pulling  Oliver Antique Tractor Antique tractor pulling is how tractor pulling first got started. As early as 1929, farmers began attaching their tractors to drags, and dragging it down a field to see who could pull it the furthest. People who were event organizers at Bowling Green, Missouri and Vaughansville, Ohio found out farmers were doing this and that it drew spectators. By 1950, county fairs across the country started featuring tractor pulls. Spectators found it fascinating to see machines that would ‚ÄúPull on Sunday, plow on Monday‚Äù. At first competitors would use a ‚ÄòHuman Drag‚Äô, meaning a drag that was weighted by humans, different people would be added as the tractor made it down the track. However, organizers began to look at different ways to add weight to the drag, as spectators walking on the drag while moving proved to be a hazard. In the late 60s, a weight-exchanging drag was created, the drag that was created was basically a flatbed truck trailer with wheels near the back and a drag at the front. A mass that is moveable of up to 65,000 pounds or 29,000 kilograms, the mass starts at the back of the sled, slowly working its way up to the top as the drag moves down the track. The tractors are divided into different weight classes based on the tractor weight, the weight classes starting at 2500 and ending at 14000 pounds. The tractors could go in any class they choose, a lot of tractors will weight their tractors up, so they fit into the higher weighted classes. In order to be able to compete in Antique tractor pull competitions your tractor must have the original speed the tractor is supposed to have. Some pulling competitions will have a ‚Äòdyno‚Äô so you can ‚Äòdyno‚Äô your tractor, which means hooking up the PTO shaft on your tractor to the machine to test the horsepower. If your tractor shows it has more horse power than the original tractor is supposed to have, you get put into an alternate class called ‚ÄòModified Tractors‚Äô. They do this to avoid the tractors that have been modified always winning, they want a fair competition. Most antique tractors when pulling needs about 14-15 pounds in their tires, however it could be more or less depending on the rules of the competition you are entering. There is also a drawbar rule, it is to be a minimum of two square inches in total steel at any point, as well must be rigid in all directions. The hitching device can be no more than 1 1/2 inch round stock (1 1/2 square), or less than 1 1/8 inch round stock (1 inch square), the hole has to be 3\\"X3 3/4\\"- inch diameter. The drawbar on a tractor should be no shorter than 18 inches from the center of the rear axle to the point of the hitch. All the weights that are on your tractor has to be non- moveable, they have to be safety secured to the tractor, bungee cords are not allowed to be used. All drivers when pulling need to remain seated, if they get out of there seat they could face disqualification. However, all these rules can change depending on what competition you go to. History in Australia Tractor pull at Sheffield, Tasmania The first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976. The following year saw Tractor Pulling begin in the Victorian rural town of Quambatook. It has developed over the years into a highly competitive and technical sport, where the difference between first and last place may be as small as one or two metres. Often the top tractors are separated by mere centimetres. The Australian Tractor Pullers Association (ATPA) is a non-profit organisation that governs Tractor Pulling in Australia. Our events (Tractor Pulls) are held in conjunction with a promoter. This is often a local school, sporting, service or community club (for example; Apex, Rotary, Lions, Netball, Cricket, Football) who use the event as a fundraiser. Tractor Pulls are held in locations throughout Australia, predominantly in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. In the west the Western Australian Tractor Pullers Association (WATPA) runs events and is affiliated with the ATPA. The ATPA is focused on actively promoting this spectacular sport and working with communities to not only establish a unique annual event, but more importantly to assist communities financially through the influx of spectators, sponsors and promotion. The tractors are divided into classes and comply with either \\"Limited\\" or \\"Open\\" rules. The classes are Open Modified, Super Modified, Limited Modified, Open Mini Modified, Mini Modified, Pro Stock (diesel) and Two Wheel Drive Trucks. The distinction between classes is determined by the overall maximum weight, engine modifications, fuels and physical size. Competition is open to both women and men, the only restriction being that competitors must at least hold a current Learner Driver‚Äôs Permit. It sometimes comes down to members of the same family competing for the trophies. The Junior Modified Pulling Association conducts an \\"introductory\\" class for 8- to 16-year-olds to develop driving, mechanical and competitive skills. The Modified Mowers pull their own smaller version of the big sled. Drag (sled) pulling Sled Full Pull marker In the early days two main techniques were used. Either a dead weight of fixed mass was dragged, or the step-on method was used, where people stood at fixed positions and stepped aboard as the drag passed. Another rule which has now been dropped was that a speed limit should be observed because of injuries resulting from the increased speed at which they boarded. Today's tractors can achieve theoretical speeds over . Today's drags (sled) use a complex system of gears to move weights up to . Upon starting, all the weights are over the drag's (sled) rear axles, to give an effective weight of the drag plus zero. As the tractor travels the course, the weights are pushed forward off the drag's axles, pushing the front of the drag (sled) into the ground, synthetically creating a gain in weight until the tractor is no longer able to overcome the force of friction. Most drags (sled) have grouser bars that act like teeth and dig into the soil to stop the sled.  Engines  Apart from modified standard diesel tractors, a varietyFour different tractors of a German team of high power engines are used in tractor pulling, which started in the late 1970s. In the early years, mainly single, double or multiple US-made big block dragster engines were used, but nowadays, a lot of parts from discarded military machinery are in use, like Klimov TV3-117 (Isotov)http://www.isotov.de/steckbriefiso2.htm turboshafts from Russian helicopters, Soviet Zvezda M503 torpedo boat engines, Continental AV1790Kiepenkerl I&II; tank engines, or World-War-2-era aircraft piston engines in V12-shape (e.g. Rolls-Royce Griffon) or as radial engines (e.g. Curtiss-Wright R-3350). Due to the limited number of vintage warbird engines remaining, some organisations that own them, such as the Fantasy of Flight museum in Florida, refuse to sell engines from their collection to customers that wish to use them for tractor pulling.Warbirds and Airshows - Fantasy of Flight, website retrieved 20 August 2013. In recent years a number of agricultural engines have been converted to run on methanol with multi-stage turbocharging.

A mechanised kitchen provides free food for all pilgrims, and there are guest houses with modern amenities. Dharmastala represents religious tolerance. A Jain Tirthankara is worshiped beside Daivas and Lord Manjunatha (Shiva). The priests are Vaishnavite Brahmins and the guardian of the temple a Heggade (Jain). To those who come here for justice, the Heggade dispenses judgments that are said to represent the will of the deities. Legend Local legend says that the Shiva Linga in Dharmasthala was brought to Dharmasthala by a local person with great powers, named Annappa. Legend is that he used to work for the Heggade family. Once when the Heggade he was serving wanted to worship Lord Shiva, Annappa had assured him to get one linga and vanished from the sight. The next morning, he had already established the linga in Dharmasthala, a few metres away from Heggade's house. Later it was learned that the linga was from Kadri near Mangalore, from the Kadri temple. By then, Annappa had vanished and he was never again sighted in the vicinity. Now people in Dharmasthala worship Annappa as Annappa Panjurli, a local god deva and a hero. 800 years ago, Dharmasthala was known as Kuduma (‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤°‡≥Å‡≤Æ) in Mallarmadi,Managalore Information http://www.mangalore.com/documents/dharmasthala.html then a village in Belthangady (‡≤¨‡≥Ü‡≤≥‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤Ç‡≤ó‡≤°‡≤ø). Here lived the Jain chieftain Birmanna Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballathi in a house called Nelliadi Beedu. Pergade and the local chieftains built several shrines and invited Brahmin priests to perform the rituals. These priests requested Pergade to install a Shivalinga beside the native Daivas. The Daivas then sent their vassal Annappa Swamy to procure the linga of Lord Manjunatheshwara (‡≤∂‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ä ‡≤Æ‡≤Ç‡≤ú‡≥Å‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤•‡≥á‡≤∂‡≥ç‡≤µ‡≤∞ ‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤Æ‡≤ø) from Kadri, near Mangalore. Subsequently, the Manjunatha temple was built around the linga. Around the 16th century, Shri Devaraja Heggade invited Shri Vadiraja Swami of Udupi to visit the place. The swamiji gladly came but refused to accept Bhiksha (food offering) because the idol of Lord Manjunatha had not been consecrated according to the vedic rites. Shri Heggade then requested the Swamiji to reconsecrate the Shiva Linga himself. Pleased by the observance of the vedic rites and Heggade's charity to all, the Swamiji named the place Dharmasthala the abode of religion and charity. Thus, the roots of charity and religious tolerance established by the Pergades 800 years ago have been nurtured and strengthened by 21 generations of the Heggade family of Tulu lineage (Heggade being a derivative from Tulu word Pergade). Today's Dharmasthala blossoms with the fruit of this selfless dedication. *Great historian Dr. Padoor Gururaj Bhat in his book Thulunadu '‡≤§‡≥Å‡≤≥‡≥Å‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å' (‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤Æ‡≤æ‡≤ú‡≤ø‡≤ï ‡≤ö‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ü‡≤Ø‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≤ø ‡≤í‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≥Å ‡≤∏‡≤Ç‡≤∂‡≥ã‡≤ß‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤Æ‡≤ï ‡≤µ‡≤ø‡≤µ‡≥á‡≤ö‡≤®‡≥Ü)in a chapter page no. 88 to 96, ‡≤¶‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤∑‡≤ø‡≤£ ‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°‡≤¶‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≤ø ‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤•‡≤æ‡≤®‡≤ø‡≤ï‡≤∞ ‡≤ö‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ü has recorded the true history of Dharmasthala temple and its management. \\"Britishers handed over the management of this temple from Sthanika Brahmins to Kumara Heggade who supported British against Tipu Sultan.

Production Butyraldehyde is produced almost exclusively by the hydroformylation of propylene: : CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ H2 \\\\+ CO ‚Üí CH3CH2CH2CHO Traditionally, hydroformylation was catalyzed by cobalt carbonyl and later rhodium complexes of triphenylphosphine. The dominant technology involves the use of rhodium catalysts derived from the water-soluble ligand tppts. An aqueous solution of the rhodium catalyst converts the propylene to the aldehyde, which forms a lighter immiscible phase. About 6 billion kilograms are produced annually by hydroformylation. A significant application is its conversion to 2-ethylhexanol for production of plasticizers. A major use of butyraldehyde is in the production of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a major plasticizer. Butyraldehyde can be produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of n-butanol. At one time, it was produced industrially by the catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, which is derived from acetaldehyde.Boy Cornils, Richard W.

History Taylor's Jolly Roger pirate flag. Taylor began his piratical career in 1718 as a crewman aboard the trading sloop Buck when Howell Davis staged a mutiny, took over the ship, and convinced the crew to take up piracy. After attempting to oust Davis from command, Taylor transferred to a prize ship commanded by Jeremiah Cocklyn, who soon split with Davis to sail alongside Olivier Levasseur. They captured ships off Ouidah in 1720 after which Leveasseur left to raid the East Indies. Cocklyn and his crew transferred to the captured vessel Victory and proceeded to one of several pirate outposts at Madagascar. Taylor was elected Captain when Cocklyn died, partnering with Edward England and Jasper Seagar aboard the Fancy. England, meanwhile, had rescued Levasseur and his crew, who had been stranded after wrecking their ship. In July 1720 Fancy and Victory found the East India Company ship Cassandra at anchor off Johanna. After a lengthy and brutal engagement Cassandra's Captain James Macrae and his crew escaped inland. Macrae returned to negotiate with the pirates and was saved when some of the pirates, who had once served under Macrae, intervened on his behalf. England gave Macrae the badly damaged Fancy and let him keep some of the pirates‚Äô less-valuable loot. Taylor was enraged at England's generosity and organized a vote to remove him from command and leave him marooned. Levasseur, Seagar, and Taylor took the Victory and Cassandra, with sources differing on who was in command of which ship. They captured some Muscat ships then engaged a fleet from Bombay but were driven off. Off Malabar in late 1720 they traded with Dutch agents at Cochin before returning to Madagascar that December. There they encountered pirate trader John Plantain and fellow pirate Edward Condon. The pirates spent Easter of 1721 at the Mascarene Islands. At Reunion Island in April 1721 Taylor, Levasseur, and Seagar captured the most valuable prize in pirate history, the 700-ton Portuguese treasure ship Nossa Senhora do Cabo (Our Lady of the Cape). The ship carried gold, uncut diamonds and church regalia belonging to the retiring viceroy of Goa in Portuguese India. The Portuguese ship had been dismasted in a storm and proved to be an easy prize, captured after a brief boarding action. Levasseur, Seagar, and Taylor made off with treasure then valued at more than a million pounds sterling. The group returned to Madagascar where Seagar died. While there they intercepted letters detailing the ships of a Royal Navy squadron send to hunt them down; Taylor had the letters read aloud at the ship's mast. Levasseur took Cabo and Taylor took Cassandra, swapping ships after burning the decrepit Victory. After capturing the fort at Delagoa the combined company split up in 1722. Taylor headed for the West Indies, arriving there in 1723. The governor of Spanish Portobello pardoned Taylor and his crew in exchange for his ship the Cassandra. Taylor became an officer in the Armada de Barlovento, hunting logwood cutters in the Caribbean.

The classifier will classify all the points on one side of the decision boundary as belonging to one class and all those on the other side as belonging to the other class. A decision boundary is the region of a problem space in which the output label of a classifier is ambiguous.http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/t/CSE555/files/quiz01_solutions.pdf If the decision surface is a hyperplane, then the classification problem is linear, and the classes are linearly separable. Decision boundaries are not always clear cut. That is, the transition from one class in the feature space to another is not discontinuous, but gradual. This effect is common in fuzzy logic based classification algorithms, where membership in one class or another is ambiguous. In Neural Networks and Support Vector Models In the case of backpropagation based artificial neural networks or perceptrons, the type of decision boundary that the network can learn is determined by the number of hidden layers the network has. If it has no hidden layers, then it can only learn linear problems. If it has one hidden layer, then it can learn any continuous function on compact subsets of Rn as shown by the Universal approximation theorem, thus it can have an arbitrary decision boundary. In particular, support vector machines find a hyperplane that separates the feature space into two classes with the maximum margin. If the problem is not originally linearly separable, the kernel trick can be used to turn it into a linearly separable one, by increasing the number of dimensions. Thus a general hypersurface in a small dimension space is turned into a hyperplane in a space with much larger dimensions. Neural networks try to learn the decision boundary which minimizes the empirical error, while support vector machines try to learn the decision boundary which maximizes the empirical margin between the decision boundary and data points.

For example, random assignment in randomized controlled trials helps scientists to test hypotheses, and random numbers or pseudorandom numbers help video games such as video poker. These uses have different levels of requirements, which leads to the use of different methods. Mathematically, there are distinctions between randomization, pseudorandomization, and quasirandomization, as well as between random number generators and pseudorandom number generators. For example, applications in cryptography usually have strict requirements, whereas other uses (such as generating a \\"quote of the day\\") can use a looser standard of pseudorandomness. Early usesDivination= Many ancient cultures saw natural events as signs from the gods; many attempted to discover the intentions of the gods through various sorts of divination. The underlying theory was that the condition of, (for example), a chicken's liver, was connected with the dangerous storms or military or political fortune. Divination is still practiced and on much the same basis as formerly. = Games = Unpredictable (by the humans involved) numbers (usually taken to be random numbers) were first investigated in the context of gambling developing, sometimes, pathological forms like apophenia. Many randomizing devices such as dice, shuffling playing cards, and roulette wheels, seem to have been developed for use in games of chance. Electronic gambling equipment cannot use these and so theoretical problems are less easy to avoid; methods of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions. Modern electronic casino games contain often one or more random number generators which decide the outcome of a trial in the game. Even in modern slot machines, where mechanical reels seem to spin on the screen, the reels are actually spinning for entertainment value only. They eventually stop exactly where the machine's software decided they would stop when the handle was first pulled. It has been alleged that some gaming machines' software is deliberately biased to prevent true randomness, in the interests of maximizing their owners' revenue; the history of biased machines in the gambling industry is the reason government inspectors attempt to supervise the machines‚Äîelectronic equipment has extended the range of supervision. Some thefts from casinos have used clever modifications of internal software to bias the outcomes of the machines‚Äîat least in those which have been discovered. Gambling establishments keep close track of machine payouts in an attempt to detect such alterations. Random draws are often used to make a decision where no rational or fair basis exists for making a deterministic decision, or to make unpredictable moves. Political useAthenian democracy= Fifth century BC Athenian democracy developed out of a notion of isonomia (equality of political rights), and random selection was a principal way of achieving this fairness.Herodotus 3.80 Greek democracy (literally meaning \\"rule by the people\\") was actually run by the people: administration was in the hands of committees allotted from the people and regularly changed. Although it may seem strange to those used to modern liberal democracy, the Athenian Greeks considered elections to be essentially undemocratic.\\"... it is thought to be democratic for the offices to be assigned by lot, for them to be elected is oligarchic.\\" [Aristotle, Politics 4.1294b] This was because citizens chosen on merit or popularity contradicted the democratic equality of all citizenry. In addition, allotment prevented the corrupt practice of buying votes as no one could know who would be selected as a magistrate, or to sit on a jury. =Modern politics= Allotment, also called sortition, is today used in the selection of jurors in Anglo-Saxon legal systems like the UK and United States. Proposals have been made for its use in government such as a new constitution for Iraq and various proposals for Upper Houses chosen by allotment‚Äîsee . Scholars have studied the potential of random selection of personnel in politics and organizations.For example:  * * Science Random numbers have uses in physics such as electronic noise studies, engineering, and operations research. Many methods of statistical analysis, such as the bootstrap method, require random numbers. Monte Carlo methods in physics and computer science require random numbers. Random numbers are often used in parapsychology as a test of precognition. =Statistical sampling= Statistical practice is based on statistical theory which is, itself, founded on the concept of randomness. Many elements of statistical practice depend on randomness via random numbers. Where those random numbers fail to be actually random, any subsequent statistical analysis may suffer from systematic bias. Elements of statistical practice that depend on randomness include: choosing a representative sample of the population being examined, disguising the protocol of a study from a participant (see randomized controlled trial) and Monte Carlo simulation. These applications are useful in auditing (for determining samples - such as invoices) and experimental design (for example in the creation of double-blind trials). =Analysis= Many experiments in physics rely on a statistical analysis of their output. For example, an experiment might collect X-rays from an astronomical source and then analyze the result for periodic signals. Since random noise can be expected to appear to have faint periodic signals embedded in it, statistical analysis is required to determine the likelihood that a detected signal actually represents a genuine signal. Such analysis methods requires the generation of random numbers. If the statistical method is extremely sensitive to patterns in the data (such as those used to search for binary pulsars), very large amounts of data with no recognizable pattern are needed. =Simulation= In many scientific and engineering fields, computer simulations of real phenomena are commonly used. When the real phenomena are affected by unpredictable processes, such as radio noise or day-to-day weather, these processes can be simulated using random or pseudo-random numbers. Automatic random number generators were first constructed to carry out computer simulation of physical phenomena, notably simulation of neutron transport in nuclear fission. Pseudo-random numbers are frequently used in simulation of statistical events, a very simple example being the outcome of tossing a coin. More complicated situations are simulation of population genetics, or the behaviour of sub-atomic particles. Such simulation methods, often called stochastic methods, have many applications in computer simulation of real-world processes. Some more speculative projects, such as the Global Consciousness Project, monitor fluctuations in the randomness of numbers generated by many hardware random number generators in an attempt to predict the scope of an event in near future. The intent is to prove that large-scale events that are about to happen build up a \\"pressure\\" which affects the RNGs. Cryptography A ubiquitous use of unpredictable random numbers is in cryptography which underlies most of the schemes which attempt to provide security in modern communications (e.g., confidentiality, authentication, electronic commerce, etc.). For example, if a user wants to use an encryption algorithm, it is best that they select a random number as the key. The selection must have high entropy (i.e., unpredictability) to any attacker, thus increasing attack difficulty. With keys having low entropy (i.e., relatively easily guessable by attackers), security is likely to be compromised. To illustrate, imagine if a simple 32 bit linear congruential pseudo-random number generator of the type supplied with most programming languages (e.g., as the 'rand' or 'rnd' function) is used as a source of keys. There will only be some four billion possible values produced before the generator repeats itself. A suitably motivated adversary could simply test them all; this is practical as of 2010, using readily available computers. Even if a linear congruential RNG is used with 1000-bit parameters, it is a simple exercise in linear algebra to recover the modulus m, and the constants a and b, where x' = ax +b (mod m), given only five consecutive values. Even if a better random number generator is used, it might be insecure (e.g., the seed might be guessable), producing predictable keys and reducing security to nil. (A vulnerability of this sort was famously discovered in an early release of Netscape Navigator, forcing the authors to quickly find a source of \\"more random\\" random numbers.) For these applications, truly random numbers are ideal, and very high quality pseudo-random numbers are necessary if truly random numbers, such as coming from a hardware random number generator, are unavailable. Truly random numbers are absolutely required to be assured of the theoretical security provided by the one-time pad -- the only provably unbreakable encryption algorithm. Furthermore, those random sequences cannot be reused and must never become available to any attacker, which implies a continuously operable generator. See Venona for an example of what happens when these requirements are violated when using a one-time pad. For cryptographic purposes, one normally assumes some upper limit on the work an adversary can do (usually this limit is astronomically sized). If one has a pseudo-random number generator whose output is \\"sufficiently difficult\\" to predict, one can generate true random numbers to use as the initial value (i.e., the seed), and then use the pseudo-random number generator to produce numbers for use in cryptographic applications. Such random number generators are called cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators, and several have been implemented (for example, the /dev/urandom device available on most Unixes, the Yarrow and Fortuna designs, server, and AT&T; Bell Laboratories \\"truerand\\"). As with all cryptographic software, there are subtle issues beyond those discussed here, so care is certainly indicated in actual practice. In any case, it is sometimes impossible to avoid the need for true (i.e., hardware-based) random number generators. Since a requirement in cryptography is high entropy, any published random sequence is a poor choice, as are such sequences as the digits in an irrational number such as the œÜ or even in transcendental numbers such as œÄ, or e. All are available to an enterprising attacker. Put another way, in cryptography, random bit streams need to be not only random, but also secret and hence unpredictable. Public or third-party sources of random values, or random values computed from publicly observable phenomena (weather, sports game results, stock prices), are almost never cryptographically acceptable. Their use may be tempting, but in reality, they permit easier attacks than attacking the cryptography. Since most cryptographic applications require a few thousand bits at most, slow random number generators serve well--if they are actually random. This use of random generators is important; many informed observers believe every computer should have a way to generate true random numbers. Literature, music and art Some aesthetic theories claim to be based on randomness in one way or another. Little testing is done in these situations, and so claims of reliance on and use of randomness are generally poorly based in definite theory and more on an impression of randomness from technical fields. An example of a need for randomness sometimes occurs in arranging items in an art exhibit. Usually this is avoided by using a theme. As John Cage pointed out, \\"While there are many ways that sounds might be produced [i.e., in terms of patterns], few are attempted\\". Similarly, the arrangement of art in exhibits is often deliberately non-random. One case of this was Hitler's attempt to portray modern art in the worst possible light by arranging works in worst possible manner. A case can be made for trying to make art in the worst possible way; i.e., either as anti-art, or as actually random art. Dadaism, as well as many other movements in art and letters, has attempted to accommodate and acknowledge randomness in various ways. Often people mistake order for randomness based on lack of information; e.g., Jackson Pollock's drip paintings, Helen Frankenthaler's abstractions (e.g., \\"For E.M.\\"). Thus, in some theories of art, all art is random in that it's \\"just paint and canvas\\" (the explanation of Frank Stella's work). Similarly, the \\"unexpected\\" ending is part of the nature of interesting literature. An example of this is Denis Diderot's novel Jacques le fataliste (literally: James the Fatalist; sometimes referred to as Jacques the Fatalist or Jacques the Servant and his Master). At one point in the novel, Diderot speaks directly to the reader: Diderot was making the point that the novel (then a recent introduction to European literature) seemed random (in the sense of being invented out of thin air by the author, not in a modern technical sense). See also Eugenio Montale, Theatre of the Absurd. Randomness in music includes John Cage's chance-derived Music of Changes, stochastic music, aleatoric music, indeterminate music, or generative music. Other uses Random numbers are also used in situations where \\"fairness\\" is approximated by randomization, such as selecting jurors and military draft lotteries. In the Book of Numbers (33:54), Moses commands the Israelites to apportion the land by lot. Other examples include selecting, or generating, a \\"Random Quote of the Day\\" for a website, or determining which way a villain might move in a computer game. Weaker forms of randomness are also closely associated with hash algorithms and in creating amortized searching and sorting algorithms.

Photograph of the Holy Trinity, late 1800s Trinity City (also known as Holy Trinity Church Adelaide, and originally named Trinity Church), is an Australian evangelical Anglican church located at 88 North Terrace in the city of Adelaide, South Australia. Trinity City has four gatherings at the North Terrace location each Sunday, as well as various other meetings throughout the week.Holy Trinity Adelaide - Home History Adelaide in 1839 as viewed south-east from North Terrace, including Holy Trinity (the church tower lost its \\"peaked cap\\" in 1844) Trinity City is historically significant in that it contains elements of the earliest surviving Anglican church building in South Australia. Of special note is the William IV window that was brought to Adelaide in 1836. The land on which the church stands was donated by Pascoe St Leger Grenfell along with 40 acres of country land for a cemetery and \\"glebe\\" lands. Pascoe St Leger Grenfell, the holder of a preliminary land order, Raikes Currie and the Reverend Sir Henry Robert Dukinfield of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) who held the collective funds and, thirdly, the men to whom they were transferring their powers, namely James Hurtle Fisher, Osmond Gilles and Charles Mann. Fisher was to be resident commissioner in South Australia of the Colonisation Commission, having responsibility independent of the governor for the administration of land in the new colony; Gilles was to be the treasurer and Mann the advocate general or principal legal officer of the colony. Grenfell transferred control over order no. 171 for a town acre and over 40 acres of country land to be selected in conjunction with the town acre, later known as Trinity Gardens. The conveyance did not have to specify that Currie and Dukinfield hand over money and the portable church, but it may be presumed they did so ‚Äî alternatively they may have entrusted these resources to John Morphett, appointed as SPG's attorney in the colony. The objects of the trust were to use the town acre as a site for \\"the erection of a church where Divine Service could be celebrated according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England\\". The same acre was also to provide space for a schoolroom and a parsonage and garden for the minister of the church. The country land was to provide six to eight acres for a cemetery and the remainder to be \\"glebe land\\", in the familiar phrase of the Church of England, to provide income for the support of the minister. The church was built in three main stages. It was originally planned that the church would be a prefabricated building imported from England;Dickey, B: Holy Trinity Adelaide 1836-1988: the history of a city church, Trinity Church Trust Inc., 1988 however, when the prefabricated building arrived from England badly damaged, it was decided instead to build a stone church, Henry J. Moseley the builder. Governor Hindmarsh laid the foundation stone on 28 January 1838 and the church opened in about August that year, within two years of the settlement of Adelaide (see History of Adelaide). The building quickly became a landmark with its \\"peaked cap\\" top tower and the Vulliamy clock. (Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy 1780‚Äì1854, was the clockmaker to King William IV and Queen Adelaide.) In 1844 the church was closed for repairs and the clock was removed for safekeeping. The body of the church was rebuilt and re-roofed and the tower lost its peaked cap. It reopened in August 1845. When Bishop Short arrived in 1847, Holy Trinity assumed many of the functions of a cathedral and was - until other congregations (especially Christ Church, North Adelaide) were established ‚Äî the place of worship for the governors, many of the colony‚Äôs prominent families and the military. Memorial plaque to James Fisher, resident commissioner of the colony of South Australia, first Mayor of Adelaide and trustee of Holy Trinity Church. Placed on the east wall of the nave of the church In 1878, there was a proposal to rebuild when some money was subscribed, but this did not take place until the congregation decided in the mid-1880s to completely rebuild the church to a design by the prominent architect Edward John Woods, using the mellow sandstone which eventually weathered to match the original limestone. It was around this time that the present name of \\"Holy Trinity\\" became current. The hall and the rectory are also significant features in the precinct. The hall was built in 1887 using a donation from a parishioner. The original rectory was a prefabricated \\"Manning\\" building which arrived in better condition than the church. It was replaced by the present building in 1851 and was the home of seven successive incumbents. It is now used as offices. The Revd Lance Shilton, later Dean of Sydney, was rector of Holy Trinity from 1957 to 1973. Ministry Trinity City is a large evangelical and conservative Anglican church. Its main campus is adjacent to the University of South Australia (Uni SA), City West campus. Through its involvement with the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students on tertiary campuses it also has links to its studentsEvangelical Students, University of Adelaide at Adelaide University and the Uni SA City campuses. Members of Trinity City Church are also involved in the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and Scripture Union. Trinity has Sunday school for children in primary school, a youth group for high school students, a young adults group, a weekday women's meeting group, a large number of small Bible study groups and various other groups.

Following several successful productions, one of which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart (The Real Thing's \\"You To Me Are Everything\\") Harris and Froggy decided to launch their own label, they were offered a label deal by Morgan Khan (Streetwave) and the first release was a remix by the duo of Cerrone's 'Supernature' (his 'Music of Life' song was the inspiration for the label name). Within a few months Froggy left the label and Streetwave went out of business. Harris being active in remixing and production for many other artists and labels financed the label with his remix income. After the demise of Streetwave Harris and France decided to re-launch as a British hip-hop music label. Music of Life opened an office in London's Soho at 22 Hanway Street, Chris France and his sister Michelle spent their days in the busy Soho office whilst Simon could usually be found in his home studio 'The Bunker' producing many of the Music of Life releases. At first the label licensed new rap music from US production company Powerplay for the first compilation album 'Def Beats 1' but as an addition to the US material Harris produced an extra track, under his own 'Music of Life Productions' recorded in London by the label's A&R; man Derek Boland. 'Rock the Beat' by Derek B created a demand for British hip-hop and the demo tapes started to arrive, Music of Life signed the best artists instead of licensing more US material and Harris produced many new songs featuring artists including M.C. Duke, The Demon Boyz (Million Dan), Thrashpack, Asher D and Daddy Freddy,Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \\"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86‚Äì110.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 19, 1998. In the episode, Lisa and Bart Simpson must co-anchor a new news program, though when Bart is seen as a more successful news anchor, Lisa becomes jealous and seeks revenge. Meanwhile, in the subplot, Homer Simpson gets a monkey helper because of his laziness. \\"Girly Edition\\" was the first episode written by Larry Doyle and was directed by Mark Kirkland. Much of the subplot was inspired by the film Monkey Shines. Critics gave the episode positive reviews and it is also one of Yeardley Smith's favorite episodes of the series. Plot After Groundskeeper Willie takes away Bart's skateboard for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn as he is sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show to make room for a kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen at first, but is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge. Lisa is deemed to be boring by the channel's staff, though they are impressed by Bart's performance. Bart is then promoted to be the co-anchor, which leads to jealousy from Lisa. After Bart hears Lisa talking behind his back, he seeks advice from Kent Brockman, who teaches him about the power of human interest stories. Bart becomes successful after creating a segment called \\"Bart's People\\", which Lisa disapproves of due to its sappy, emotionally manipulative content. Out of jealousy, Lisa attempts to copy it, but is twice hampered by the Crazy Cat Lady. She eventually sends a letter acting as an immigrant who lives in a landfill who pleads to be on Bart's People, causing Bart to rush to the landfill for a live broadcast. However, he learns that the immigrant is Groundskeeper Willie, wanting revenge on Bart. Feeling guilty after seeing Willie attack Bart on camera, Lisa arrives and saves him by using similar techniques he used in his stories to stir up Willie's emotions. The siblings then decide to make a good educational news program, only to have Kidz News cancelled before their next show. In the subplot, Homer obtains a monkey helper named Mojo after learning Apu has gotten one. Eventually, Mojo becomes tired, weak, and overfed from eating junk food and drinking beer with Homer. Marge forces Homer to return the monkey. Production \\"Girly Edition\\" was the first episode Larry Doyle wrote for the show. He conceived both the main plot and the subplot. The subplot about Mojo was inspired by the film Monkey Shines; show runner Mike Scully asked the staff to consult the film for reference when they were making the episode. The animators also studied the behavior of monkeys from other resources, looking at their movements and how they interact with humans. Eric Stefani, a former animator for the show who had left and now was part of the band No Doubt, was called back by episode director Mark Kirkland to animate the scenes with Homer and Mojo. This was the final work Stefani did for The Simpsons. At the end of the episode, an incapacitated Mojo is only able to type \\"Pray for Mojo\\" into a computer; this line was written by George Meyer, who cited it as his favorite personal contribution to The Simpsons. Recurring character the Crazy Cat Lady was introduced in this episode. Analysis The show that replaces \\"Kidz News\\", a parody of corporate tie-in Saturday morning cartoons In his book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray analyses a scene from the episode in which it is announced that Kidz News has been replaced by the children's cartoon The Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour (a reference to the Mattel toys and the Mars chocolate bar). He says this mocks \\"how many children's programs have become little more than the ad to the merchandise\\". Gray also writes that The Simpsons \\"illustrates how the ad as genre has itself already invaded many, if not all, genres. Ads and marketing do not limit themselves to the space between programs; rather, they are themselves textual invaders, and part of The Simpsons parodic attack on ads involves revealing their hiding places in other texts.\\" A real-life journalist named Reid, who Gray interviewed for his book, states that \\"Girly Edition\\" mirrors well how some journalists actually work. She said the episode shows \\"the ludicrous nature of, you know, what we do in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, you see them do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that.\\" Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that \\"the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do have an impact on the minds of many intelligent members of American society.\\" Reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 19, 1998. It finished 26th in the ratings for the week of April 13‚Äì19, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.7, translating to around 8.5 million viewing households. Retrieved on April 20, 2008. The episode was the third highest rated show on Fox that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. \\"Girly Edition\\" was well received by critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, calling it \\"a great episode, full of more than the normal quota of good jokes\\", adding, \\"best of all is Lisa's revenge on Bart, and the mad cat-lady who goes around chucking her cats at people.\\" Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating and stated that he enjoyed the subplot with Mojo more than the main plot. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that \\"Girly Edition\\" takes \\"a clever concept and turns into something more than expected as it digs into the usual Bart/Lisa rivalry. I‚Äôm not quite sure why Bart reacts so sadly to Lisa‚Äôs comments about his stupidity when 'Lisa the Simpson' just delved into the dumbness of the male Simpsons. There‚Äôs enough to like here to make the episode fun, though.\\" This episode is one of Yeardley Smith's favorite episodes. She says, \\"I don't actually remember a lot of the episodes because they all blend in together for me, and I don't have a really good memory anyway, but I do remember this one and thinking that it was terrific.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Girly Edition\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:The Simpsons (season 9) episodes Category:1998 American television episodes ","title":"Girly Edition"},{"id":"2715041","text":"Marratech was a Swedish company that made software for e-meetings (e.g., web conferencing, videoconferencing). It was acquired by Google in 2007.  History  Marratech was founded in 1998, as a spin-off company from the Centre for Distance-Spanning Technology at the Lule√• University of Technology. Founders include Dr. Dick Schefstr√∂m (deceased), Prof. Peter Parnes, Johnny Wid√©n, Prof. K√•re Synnes, Mikael B√∂rjeson, Magnus Hedberg, Serge Lachapelle and Claes √Ögren. The Marratech prototype was launched 1995 as part of an EU project called Multimedia Assisted Tele-engineering (MATES) project. Marratech's first product, which offered voice, video, whiteboard and group instant messaging, was first released in November 1998. The first release required the presence of an IP Multicast network and was built as a server- less architecture. The solution has since evolved to support both traditional IP Unicast and IP Multicast, high security and multi-platform computing. For guaranteed, serverless, scalable data delivery over both Multicast and Unicast, Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) is used over the Real-time Transport Protocol, called SRRTP. In 2004, Marratech introduced support for dialing out to IP telephones, land lines and mobile phones via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In 2005, H.323 support was added to communicate with traditional video conferencing equipment. In 2005, Marratech launched Marratech Free, a freeware edition of its product to host video chats online accessible to everyone. In 2006, one of the first projects to handle remote, wireless eye examinations via video-conferencing was launched in rural India by the university of Berkeley and Intel, with Marratech providing the video- conferencing technology. In 2007, Marratech's video conference software was acquired by Google. Most engineers and key personnel have moved to Google. The financial terms of the acquisitions were not released. This acquisition was announced a few months after Cisco acquired Webex. Google plans its use for their staff members initially and later they might come out with a massive change in the software for public use. On December 12, 2009, Marratech announced that it would close down its website before the year-end. On February 19, 2010, Marratech announced on their homepage that it had suspended all its services. Its server no longer allows download of either client or server software.  Description  Some of the key features included in Marratech are: * High quality voice for groups with private audio feature * Interactive group whiteboard * Multi party video Some of the key underlying technologies are: * 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) end-to-end encryption * Support for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux on the client and server side. * Support for bandwidth saving clusters * Support for IP Unicast, IP Multicast or both * Support for H.323 (dial in and out, E.164) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) * H.264 video The solution includes a freely downloadable client and a server, called the Marratech Manager.

Our Father‚Äôs Beginning . Updated May 5, 2010 was an American businessman who is credited with commercializing the electromagnetic burglar alarm and with establishing the first burglar alarm networks. Biography Holmes was born in West Boylston, Massachusetts, to Sally Graves and Thomas Holmes. His father was from New Hampshire where he served as the town postmaster. Holmes married Eliza Ann Richardson. They had four children (two boys and two girls). One girl was Titanic survivor Ella Holmes White.Genealogy of the Holmes family Edwin started his business in 1849 in Boston, as a seller of household items and entrepreneur, and acquired skills which later helped him in establishing the burglar alarm industry. Burglar alarm The alarm was patented in 1853 by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope (1819‚Äì1858) of Somerville, Massachusetts.A. R. Pope \\"Improvement in Electro-Magnetic Alarms\\" Issued October 21, 1853 (Middle name of the author misprinted on Google) Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1500 and manufactured the device in his factory in Boston, Massachusetts. He began to sell them in 1858. His son Edwin Thomas Holmes took over his father's company after his death and documented the events in his biography, A Wonderful Fifty Years.History of the Pope/Holmes burglar alarm Initially, people were fearful of and skeptical about using electricity for alarms, and the business did not go well. Therefore, in 1859, in search of a new and bigger market Holmes moved his business to New York, which was then perceived as a place where \\"all the country's burglars made their home\\". There, by 1866 he installed 1,200 home alarms and began successful marketing among business enterprises. By 1877, he established the first network of alarms monitored by a central station in New York and sent his son to copy this system in Boston. Edwin Thomas, however, discovered that the network could use the pre-existing phone cables instead of laying its own. In this way, he quickly assembled a 700-alarm network, which his father then copied in New York. In 1878, Holmes became the president of the newly established Bell Phone Company. While he sold his interests two years later for US$100,000,John Fischer, DGA Security Systems, Inc. Protecting the Protection? . Updated May 5, 2010 he kept his rights to use the company phone lines for his alarm system. The use of electricity for street lights in 1880 changed the market, as people started accepting electrical models. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the Holmes Burglar business in 1905, linking it to emergency call systems for contacting police and fire fighting personnel. After World War II, many inventions were introduced into the business of home alarm systems. It became less expensive and more versatile for use in the 1980s and by the middle of the 1990s the system had become a standard feature. In the most advanced examples of anti-burglary systems, motion detectors, surveillance equipment and electronic tracking devices are being used.

Born at Provins (Seine-et-Marne) to Louis Bertin, a parliamentary lawyer, and Louise Mitantier, Bertin taught English before travelling to London to work as a translator. He studied Taylor shorthand during his time in Britain and, on returning to Paris in 1791, translated into French Taylor's book An essay intended to establish a standard for a universal system of Stenography, or Short-hand writing, publishing it in 1792 under the title Syst√®me universel et complet de Stenographie ou Mani√®re abr√©g√©e d'√©crire applicable √† tous les idiomes (A complete and universal system of stenography or an abbreviated manner of writing applicable to all languages). In 1795, the French National Convention gave him an annual grant to continue this work. His book went into a second edition in 1795, a third in 1796 and a fourth in 1803. He continued to work for the government during the Directory, but the Consulate and First Empire did not employ his services. Under the Restauration, he established a stenographic service for the French Parliament and took a government post in the administration of business licenses (R√©gie des Droits R√©unis). In 1817, he had become stenographer for the conservative journal Le Moniteur Universel. He died, aged 67, in Paris. Bertin's shorthand Despite its roots, Bertin's system was not especially fast, but it did have the advantage of being highly readable. Each sound had a very distinctive symbol, largely carried over from Taylor's system, and added a few more symbols for final vowels. Also, like Talyor, Bertin eliminated all vowels that were neither at the beginning nor end of a word. This caused some ambiguity, but it did enable stenographers to write at the pace of speech. Composed of 16 basic letters, plus initials and finals, Bertin's scheme was the first that could be written without ever lifting the pen. It also employed abbreviations and initials to save time with common words. His method was ultimately substantially improved by Hippolyte Pr√©vost and later by Albert Delaunay.

When the Act was first enacted, the sale of alcohol was prohibited, but liquor could still be manufactured in the province or imported. Strong support for prohibition came from religious elements of society such as the Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union, seeking to eliminate what they considered the societal ills and vices associated with liquor consumption, including violent behaviour and familial abuse. Historically, prohibition advocates in Ontario drew inspiration from the temperance movements in Britain and the United States. The Act was repealed in 1927. History Prior to the Act, two attempts failed to control or eliminate the sale of alcohol in the province. A non-binding plebiscite in 1894 failed because of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruling's that disallowed provincial control over the importation of alcohol. Another attempt in 1902 failed because of low voter turnout, with less than half of those eligible participating. However, in 1864 the Dunkin Act enabled any municipality or county in the united Province of Canada to hold a majority vote to prohibit the sale of alcohol. In 1878, the Scott Act extended \\"local option\\" to the whole Dominion of Canada.\\"Prohibition\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia In the early twentieth century, an increasing number of Ontario localities went \\"dry\\"; by 1914, 520 localities had banned the sale of alcohol, and only 322 were \\"wet\\". When the Ontario Temperance Act was passed, three Ontarian counties had used the Scott Act to implement their own prohibition laws. When William Hearst became premier of Ontario in September 1914, the temperance movement gained an ally, despite complaints from wet elements of Hearst's own Conservative Party. The onset of the First World War gave advocates further impetus to push the cause, arguing temperance would reduce waste, inefficiency, and distractions. In 1916, the Hearst government unanimously passed the Ontario Temperance Act. In March 1918, the Government of Canada passed an order-in-council that prohibited the manufacture, importation, and transportation of alcohol into Ontario and other provinces where purchase was illegal. Nonetheless, Ontarians could still acquire alcohol from doctors' offices and drugstores. In 1920 alone, Ontario doctors wrote more than 650,000 prescriptions for alcohol. Following the end of World War One, prohibition at the federal level was repealed at the end of 1919. That year, a province-wide referendum saw support of the Ontario ban on sales by a majority of 400,000 votes. The manufacture and export of liquor was made legal. In 1921, another referendum showed a slight slip in support for prohibition, but the province now became \\"bone dry\\" by banning the importation of alcohol. A subsequent referendum two years later showed a greater slip in support for the Act, with 51.5 percent for and 48.5 against. In 1926, Howard Ferguson's Conservatives won a general election in which they promised the introduction of liquor sales by the province. Repeal and government as alcohol retailer In 1927, the Liquor Control Act overturned prohibition as legislated in the Ontario Temperance Act and established the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), through which the province managed liquor distribution with government-run stores. Nonetheless, drinking in public establishments remained illegal until seven years later. Some communities maintained a ban on the sale of liquor under local option until the 1970s and The Junction neighbourhood of Toronto remained \\"dry\\" until 2000, largely because of the efforts of former Ontario CCF Member of Provincial Parliament for High Park, \\"Temperance Bill\\" William Temple. The Ontario Temperance Act failed because of changing public opinion and the inability of the Government of Ontario to effectively control consumption and importation of alcohol into the province. According to one historian, \\"the legislation seemed to be too drastic for the average citizen and not harsh enough to stop the large bootleggers.\\" It has been also noted that prohibition deprived the Government of Ontario of significant tax revenue and the getting those revenues back was a motivation in repealing it.

In 1982 he founded and led the Conservative Party of South Africa whose successes among the white electorate made him Leader of the Opposition in 1987, a position he retained until his death. He was born in Piketberg (Cape Province) and began his working life as a journalist, being editor of Die Kerkbode and Hoofstad. He was a keen sportsman, excelling on the rugby field, playing provincial rugby against the All Blacks in 1949.

He subsequently entered the Dutch Reformed Church (NG Kerk), serving various congregations as minister for 14 years. He was elected Deputy Chairman of the Cape Synod and later of the General Synod. He married Engela Dreyer on 18 January 1949. National Party career In 1971, he became the National Party MP for Waterberg. Newly appointed as Deputy Minister of Education in 1976, his instruction to implement the policy that black students should be taught half in English, half in Afrikaans triggered the Soweto Riots.

The far-right Western Goals Institute organized his London visit, and the Conservative Monday Club held a dinner in his honour, at which at least one British Conservative Party MP, Tim Janman, was present.The Daily Telegraph Court & Social page, 6 June 1989 Already nicknamed \\"Doctor No\\", in 1992, he led the opposition campaign during the referendum called by F.W. de Klerk to gain white approval for negotiations to end apartheid. This campaign marked the peak of Conservative support in South Africa, gaining just under one million votes, but the \\"No\\" vote was defeated 2 to 1 by white voters. Treurnicht was the author of no fewer than 16 books, many in the cultural field. He died on 22 April 1993, in Cape Town, during a heart operation. His death came shortly after the Conservative Party suffered a major blow with the arrest of senior member Clive Derby-Lewis for the murder of Chris Hani. His former deputy minister, Ferdinand Hartzenberg, became the last leader of the Conservative Party.

Overview Neuro-fuzzy hybridization results in a hybrid intelligent system that synergizes these two techniques by combining the human-like reasoning style of fuzzy systems with the learning and connectionist structure of neural networks. Neuro-fuzzy hybridization is widely termed as fuzzy neural network (FNN) or neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) in the literature. Neuro-fuzzy system (the more popular term is used henceforth) incorporates the human-like reasoning style of fuzzy systems through the use of fuzzy sets and a linguistic model consisting of a set of IF-THEN fuzzy rules. The main strength of neuro-fuzzy systems is that they are universal approximators with the ability to solicit interpretable IF-THEN rules. The strength of neuro-fuzzy systems involves two contradictory requirements in fuzzy modeling: interpretability versus accuracy. In practice, one of the two properties prevails. The neuro-fuzzy in fuzzy modeling research field is divided into two areas: linguistic fuzzy modeling that is focused on interpretability, mainly the Mamdani model; and precise fuzzy modeling that is focused on accuracy, mainly the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model. Although generally assumed to be the realization of a fuzzy system through connectionist networks, this term is also used to describe some other configurations including: *Deriving fuzzy rules from trained RBF networks. *Fuzzy logic based tuning of neural network training parameters. *Fuzzy logic criteria for increasing a network size. *Realising fuzzy membership function through clustering algorithms in unsupervised learning in SOMs and neural networks. *Representing fuzzification, fuzzy inference and defuzzification through multi-layers feed-forward connectionist networks. It must be pointed out that interpretability of the Mamdani-type neuro-fuzzy systems can be lost. To improve the interpretability of neuro-fuzzy systems, certain measures must be taken, wherein important aspects of interpretability of neuro-fuzzy systems are also discussed.Y. Jin (2000). Fuzzy modeling of high-dimensional systems: Complexity reduction and interpretability improvement. IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 8(2), 212-221, 2000 A recent research line addresses the data stream mining case, where neuro-fuzzy systems are sequentially updated with new incoming samples on demand and on-the-fly. Thereby, system updates do not only include a recursive adaptation of model parameters, but also a dynamic evolution and pruning of model components (neurons, rules), in order to handle concept drift and dynamically changing system behavior adequately and to keep the systems/models \\"up-to-date\\" anytime. Comprehensive surveys of various evolving neuro-fuzzy systems approaches can be found in E. Lughofer (2011). Evolving Fuzzy Systems: Methodologies, Advanced Concepts and Applications.

The fuzzification of the inputs and the defuzzification of the outputs are respectively performed by the input linguistic and output linguistic layers while the fuzzy inference is collectively performed by the rule, condition and consequence layers. The learning process of POPFNN consists of three phases: #Fuzzy membership generation #Fuzzy rule identification #Supervised fine- tuning Various fuzzy membership generation algorithms can be used: Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Fuzzy Kohonen Partitioning (FKP) or Discrete Incremental Clustering (DIC). Generally, the POP algorithm and its variant LazyPOP are used to identify the fuzzy rules.

Because of its geographic prominence and the notable ministers who have served the congregation, the church is considered to be among the most historically important in American Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism. Completed in 1861, it was designed by Arthur Gilman and Gridley James Fox Bryant to resemble James Gibbs' St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London. The main sanctuary space has 16 large-scale stained-glass windows installed by Tiffany Studios from 1899 to 1929. On May 17, 2004, the Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state- sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. History of the congregation The congregation was founded in 1729 as the \\"Church of the Presbyterian Strangers\\" and became independent in 1787, incorporating under a congregational model of polity. Until the Back Bay location was completed, the congregation was located in the Federal Street Church in downtown Boston, where William Ellery Channing, the first major American Unitarian minister, preached from 1803 to 1842. Two future presidents of the American Unitarian Association‚ÄîSamuel Eliot and Dana Greeley‚Äîserved the church during its first hundred years in the Arlington Street building. In 1935, the Second Universalist Church of Boston merged its assets with Arlington Street Church. In so doing, Arlington Street Church inherited the thinking of two great liberal theologians: Channing, called \\"the father of American Unitarianism,\\" and Hosea Ballou, called \\"the father of American Universalism.\\" In the 1960s, the congregation became active in the Civil Rights Movement. James Reeb, a minister active in the congregation, was murdered during a march in Selma, Alabama. Under the ministry of Jack Mendelsohn, the church became a center for protests against the Vietnam War. In the 1980s, the church led AIDS awareness programs and support for the homeless. In 2004, Reverend Kim K. Crawford Harvie officiated the first legal state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. Arlington Street church building Church sanctuary interior As the population of Boston grew and land became scarce, landfilled areas were created in the North End, South End, and finally the Back Bay during the 1850s. When the area around Federal Street became commercial, the congregation voted to move to newly filled land in the Back Bay neighborhood. Arlington Street Church was the first public building to be constructed there. The building was begun in 1859, and dedicated in 1861 as the American Civil War loomed. Designed by Arthur Gilman and Gridley James Fox Bryant, architects for the Old Boston City Hall, its exterior was inspired by St. Martin-in-the- Fields, London. The building is supported by 999 wooden pilings driven into the mud of Back Bay, and brownstone ashlar for its exterior was quarried in New Jersey. The bell tower stands 190 feet (58 meters) tall and contains a set of 16 bells, each with a Biblical inscription. It is one of only four sets in the city of Boston still rung by hand. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1978. Landscaping for the church was designed by Mabel Keyes Babcock. =Interior= Detail of stained glass window created by Louis Comfort Tiffany depicting John the Baptist The sanctuary, with its Corinthian columns and graceful rounded arches, was modeled after the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa, Italy. The panels on either side of the choir loft, containing the Ten Commandments and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, were brought from the Federal Street Church, as was Dr. William Ellery Channing‚Äôs pulpit, which stands in the Hunnewell Chapel. The box pews, made of chestnut with black walnut rails, were at one time deeded to members of the congregation. Enclosing each pew signified that they were privately owned, and also kept cold drafts from blowing in from the aisles during the winter season. Originally, all of the sanctuary windows were glazed with clear glass. In 1898, the congregation voted to start installation of memorial stained glass windows created by the studios of Louis C. Tiffany, and commissioned a set of designs for all 20 windows. The last of 16 Tiffany windows was installed in 1929, just before the Great Depression dried up available funds. By the time the economic crisis had eased, Tiffany Studios had been liquidated (in 1937), and new Tiffany windows were unobtainable. The Tiffany windows were designed by Frederick Wilson (1858‚Äì1932), Tiffany's chief designer for ecclesiastical windows. He made extensive use of Tiffany's special glassmaking technologies, including confetti glass, iridescent glass, 3D-textured \\"drapery glass\\", pastel colors for \\"painting in glass\\", and the trademark opalescent ‚ÄúFavrile‚Äù glass. There are as many as six or seven layers of glass in a Tiffany window, producing visual textures that would otherwise have to be painted in. Only some fine details impractical to produce in glass were hand- painted, in permanent enamel. The Arlington Street Church holds the complete set of Wilson's original watercolor design drawings for all the windows. The windows on the lower level feature incidents from the early life of Jesus, while the windows for the galleries on the upper level feature his Beatitudes, or blessings. Each window has a border of decorative acanthus-leaf scrolls, echoing the capitals of the Corinthian columns of the sanctuary. Full-color images of all the Tiffany windows can be seen at the Arlington Street Tiffany Education Center website. After vandalism destroyed a memorial dedication pane in the 1970s, plexiglas sheets were installed on the exterior side of the Tiffany windows for protection. Over time, the plastic discolored to a bluish tinge and transmitted less light, as an accumulated film of dirt also clouded the stained glass. In the 21st century, the plastic sheets have been replaced, and the glass has been cleaned to restore its original beauty. In 2015, $120,000 in funds was raised to begin restoration of the Tiffany windows. , night-time lighting is being installed, so that the Tiffany windows can be viewed from outside the building. After a 50-year period when the Tiffany windows were only viewed by the congregation, the church is now open to the general public from 10 to 3 daily from mid-May through the end of October, except Sunday and when special events are scheduled. Guided tours and self- guided tours (with optional smartphone audio) are available, as well as group tours by prearrangement. The Aeolian-Skinner organ was installed in 1955‚Äì1957. Since the Aeolian-Skinner Company was shut down in the 1970s, the organ is regarded as an irreplaceable historic instrument from the 20th century. Most of the main floor is wheelchair accessible. The fully accessible Arlington station on the MBTA Green Line is immediately adjacent to the church., at the corner of Boylston Street and Arlington Street. Governance and association Arlington Street Church is a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association, a denomination created in 1961 by the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America. The denomination is organized on the basis of congregational church government. Each congregation is self-governing, deciding on its form of worship, professional and lay leadership, programs, and business. Congregations are members of the Unitarian Universalist Association and are united by a statement of Purposes and Principles. Each congregation elects delegates to a yearly General Assembly where the congregational delegates vote on matters of denominational importance and on resolutions of social witness. Congregations are served by programs provided by the Association at the continental and regional levels. Preservation and restoration of the church building and its Tiffany windows are supported by The Foundation for the Preservation of 20 Arlington Street Inc, a separate, non-sectarian 501(c)(3) charity. In 2017, the Tiffany Windows Education Center at Arlington Street Church opened its doors to the public, offering guided tours of the church and the Tiffany windows.

R. Hehner (born 16 September 1947) is a Canadian computer scientist. He was born in Ottawa. He studied mathematics and physics at Carleton University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in 1969. He studied computer science at the University of Toronto, graduating with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in 1970, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1974. He then joined the faculty there, becoming a full professor in 1983. He became the Bell University Chair in software engineering in 2001, and retired in 2012. Hehner's main research area is formal methods of software design. His method, initially called predicative programming, later called Practical Theory of Programming, is to consider each specification to be a binary (boolean) expression, and each programming construct to be a binary expression specifying the effect of executing the programming construct. Refinement is just implication. This is the simplest formal method, and the most general, applying to sequential, parallel, stand-alone, communicating, terminating, nonterminating, natural-time, real-time, deterministic, and probabilistic programs, and includes time and space bounds. This idea has influenced other computer science researchers, including Tony Hoare. Hehner's other research areas include probabilistic programming, unified algebra, and high-level circuit design. In 1979, Hehner invented a generalization of radix complement called quote notation, which is a representation of the rational numbers that allows easier arithmetic and precludes roundoff error. He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. and of IFIP Working Group 2.3 on Programming Methodology.

Taxonomy  Its relationships are unresolved. Its closest relatives are probably, but not certainly, the Hawaiian shearwater (Puffinus newelli) and possibly the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) (Austin, 1996; Austin et al., 2004). It formerly contained the former as a subspecies and was long considered a subspecies of the latter. The relationship of the Rapa shearwater, P. myrtae in regard to these species are also in need of research; this taxon was until recently placed in P. assimilis (Austin et al., 2004), but now raised to full species status by the IOC and the NACC of the AOU.  Conservation  This species breeds around Cerro Evermann on Isla Socorro in the Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico, though formerly present on Clarion Island and San Benedicto. The main threat to this species comes from feral cats introduced to Socorro in the early 1970s. These cats usually prey on shearwaters immediately after landing, where a lack of understory renders them exposed. Sheep and goats are also destroying breeding habitat. The Isla Clari√≥n was eradicated in 1988, when habitat and nesting sites were destroyed by introduced pigs, sheep and rabbits, the final of which competed against the shearwaters for nesting burrows. Despite this, some breeding habitat remains to the north and north-west of Socorro's summit, where introduced animals have yet to ravage. The current mature population is estimated between 249-999 birds. Due to the presence of these threats, it has been classified as critically endangered. Further threat is posed by light pollution from a recently constructed airstrip and possible volcanic eruptions, the latter eradicated the San Benedicto population. Sheep and pigs have since been eradicated from Clarion, though rabbits have yet to follow. On Socorro, sheep eradication is currently in progress. The species is named for Charles Haskins Townsend (1859-1944), eminent American ornithologist and ichthyologist. References *Austin, Jeremy J.

He was a founder of scientifically informed veterinary medicine, and he created one of the earliest schools for training professional veterinarians. Life and career Bourgelat was born at Lyon. He initially studied law and worked as a barrister, but he became interested in veterinary medicine because of his interest in horses. In 1740, at the age of 28, Bourgelat became the head of the Lyon Academy of Horsemanship. An an amateur horsemanship enthusiast, he developed a style of horse riding that is still in use. In 1750 Bourgelat wrote a book on the topic of veterinary medicine, in which he considered the idea of founding a veterinary school. He followed through on the idea in 1761 (also variously given as 1762 or 1764), when he co-founded the veterinary colleges at Lyon. He founded the veterinary college specifically to combat the cattle plague (also called the rinderpest), and students trained at the Lyon veterinary college were credited with helping to cure the disease.J.L.Lupton, \\"Modern Practical Farriery\\", 1879, in the section: \\"The Diseases of Cattle Sheep and Pigs\\" pp. 1 Bourgelat was noted for being an early practitioner of scientifically informed veterinary medicine, which incorporated ideas from natural history, chemistry, clinical medicine, and comparative anatomy.

The show was written by Leonard Stadd and directed by Paul Lammers, and aired for a half-hour, five days a week, at 3:30 PM EST, right after Young Doctor Malone. The show starred former silent film icon Esther Ralston, whose career had faded with the advent of sound in the late 1920s; she had lost most of her money and had been working as a sales clerk before finding some acting roles here and there. One of them was a brief appearance on the daytime courtroom drama The Verdict Is Yours. Verdict producer Eugene Burr liked what he saw and offered her the lead role in his new soap, Our Five Daughters. Ralston played Helen Lee, mother of five daughters, whose husband Jim (Michael Keene) was critically injured in an accident. He became an invalid and the abrupt change caused havoc for his wife and children. The show did not gain a significant audience and was ended after several months, on the same day The Brighter Day ended its run. The late Jacqueline Courtney, who played daughter Ann Lee, was also a popular actress on other daytime shows such as The Edge of Night, Another World, and One Life to Live.

Rickmer Rickmers was built in 1896 by the Rickmers shipyard in Bremerhaven, and was first used on the Hong Kong route carrying rice and bamboo. In 1912 she was bought by Carl Christian Krabbenh√∂ft, renamed Max, and transferred to the Hamburg - Chile route. In World War I Max was captured by the Government of Portugal, in Horta (Azores) harbour and loaned to the United Kingdom as a war aid. For the remainder of the war the ship sailed under the Union Jack, as Flores. After World War I. she was returned to the Portuguese Government, becoming a Portuguese Navy training ship and was once more renamed, as NRP Sagres (the second of that name). In 1958, she won the Tall Ships' Race. In the early 1960s Sagres (II) was retired from school ship service when the Portuguese Navy purchased, from Brazil, the school ship Guanabara (originally launched in Germany in 1937 as Albert Leo Schlageter). In 1962, the former Guanabara was commissioned as school ship with the name Sagres (III). At the same time Sagres (II) was renamed Santo Andr√© and reclassified as depot ship. The NRP Santo Andr√© remained moored at the Lisbon Naval Base, being decommissioned in 1975.

It usually lives at an altitude of between 800m and 2500m. Its fruit is edible, sweet, and juicy. The genus is named after Nicolas E. Esposto, a renowned botanist from Lima. Espostoa nana These candle-like cacti are covered with spines and white hair. Only the older specimens can divide. In adulthood, a cephalium sometimes appears, similar to the Mexican genus Cephalocereus. They were discovered by Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland in the early nineteenth century. They are appreciated for their decorative qualities due to their white fleece. They can be propagated by seed. For full development they must be planted in the ground. The cultivated specimens very rarely flourish. Like all cacti, Espostoa requires a sunny location and well-drained soil. But in summer, it appreciates fertilizer and wetter conditions. In winter, it needs a rest, but the temperature must not drop below 12 ¬∞C.  Taxonomy  Species list = *Espostoa lanata Cactaceae Espostoa lanata (HBK) Britt & Rose.

Geography  The main A90 road runs through Crimond and is lined by Crimond Church with a village hall, Crimond Primary School, Crimond Medical Practice, Crimond Shop and Post Office, Crimond Care Home for the elderly and Crimond Motors garage.Crimond Motors The oldest houses in the village run alongside the main road with a modern estate to the west side. When standing with a clear view of the surrounding countryside the masts at the nearby Crimond Aerodrome to the east may be seen as are the telecommunications satellite receivers on Mormond Hill to the North West. The nearby Loch of Strathbeg is a RSPB owned and protected nature reserve. Around the loch there are 3 hides from which to watch the birds and other wildlife. They are accessible through the airfield and there is a car park. There is also the Starnafin Centre where you can watch the birds from and find out more information about which birds and animals are present. There is a shelter belt wood that runs parallel to the main A90 about 200 metres to the east which used to belong to the Crimonmogate estates. It is mainly beech wood and is used as a walk by the locals. There is a large grain dryer owned by Allied Grain to the east of the village. There are remains of an old camp where the workers who built the St Fergus Gas Terminal lived whilst it was being constructed to the east of the village. History In 1324, Sir Archibald Douglas was recorded as being granted the lands of Crimond. In the summer of 1297 after capturing Aberdeen, William Wallace and his army travelled through Crimond as they marched to meet another Scottish patriot commander Andrew Moray at a stronghold on the banks of the River Spey. Defence use During World War II, a Royal Naval Air Station Merganser was established near the village, close to Rattray as a training establishment, home of 714 Naval Air Squadron. A camp for military personnel, Logie Camp, occupied the land to west of the main road. After the war it was used for displaced persons until demolished and replaced by modern council housing in the late 1950s. After the war the base was closed and subsequently was used as a Royal Naval Wireless Station providing long range radio services. The radio facilities are now managed by VT Communications. The site was used for motorsports although this ceased on the establishment of the RN Wireless Station. Motorcycle races From the mid 1960s to the md 1970s the Bon Accord Motor Cycle Club of Aberdeen ran Scottish Championship motorcycle road races on a track utilising some of the main runways and peripheral tracks of the air station. The opening meeting in 1966 featured John \\"Moon eyes\\" Cooper competing on solos against double Manx GP winner George Buchan and sidecar aces Chris Vincent and Mac Hobson.. These were the most northerly races in the UK and regularly attracted competitors from the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Stockcars Crimond is home to the famous Crimond Raceway stock car track which is the most northerly in the United Kingdom. It is here that former Formula One world champion driver Jim Clark began his career. The stock cars began in the 1950s with the original tracks on the runways on the nearby Crimond Aerodrome. However the Ministry of Defence reclaimed the land to build radio masts and so the track was moved three times before settling for its current situation in 1973/1974. The track is an oval with two stands and a large tire wall around the outside to protect the spectators. Today the track hosts Scottish Hot Rod, Saloonstox, Formula Two and other local formula championships.  Religion  Crimond Church Crimond Church is the sole official religious building in the village and is part of the Christian Church of Scotland. Richard de Potton was a 13th Century Bishop of Aberdeen, who was credited with making the parish church of Crimond into Aberdeen's fourteenth prebend. The clock of Crimond Church has an extra minute between the eleven and twelve making for 61 minutes in the hour. The clock mechanism was repaired in 1948 by Zygmunt Krukowski, a former Polish soldier, who adjusted the frequency of the pendulum by adding and removing penny coins. He also repainted the clock face with the correct number of minutes. The subsequent furore resulted in a further repainting with restoration of the extra minute. The clock is electric but the original movement is kept in the church as a display in memory of the late councillor Norman Cowie OBE who raised the funds for the new electric clock. The church has a wind vane in the shape of a fish that was lost around the time of World War Two and only found in the 1990s when it was placed back on top of the spire. The wind vane has been the target of vandalism and sports bullet holes from an air rifle. \\"Crimond\\" is also the name of a hymn tune by Jessie Seymour Irvine, famous as the customary tune for \\"The Lord's my Shepherd\\", a metrical version of Psalm 23.

He is one of the few footballers to die as a result of an injury incurred while playing.  Life and career  Born in Bristol in 1870, Powell had joined the Army as a young man, and served for six years in the South Staffordshire Regiment. He played football for the regimental team, and impressed enough in a match against the then Royal Arsenal in October 1892 that the club bought him out of the Army and signed him as a professional that December. Having turned professional, Arsenal had been shunned by many other clubs and county associations, and only competed in FA Cup matches and friendlies. A strong and purposeful right back, Powell immediately became a regular in the Arsenal side. In 1893 Royal Arsenal were accepted into the Football League and joined the Second Division under the new name of Woolwich Arsenal. Powell captained the side in its inaugural match against Newcastle United on 2 September 1893. He went on to play in all but two of the club's League matches that season, and was a near ever-present for the next two seasons as well (missing three and five games respectively). Select season required. He scored his one and only League goal for Arsenal in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Loughborough on 4 January 1896. In a United League match against Kettering on 23 November 1896, Powell broke his arm. He contracted blood poisoning and tetanus, and despite having the arm amputated he died six days later at his Plumstead home at the age of 26. An inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death, with no blame attaching to anyone involved. He had played 92 League and FA Cup matches for the club.

Biography  After attending CEGEP in sciences, Jean Ouimet studied mathematics at McGill University and the Universit√© de Montr√©al before studying philosophy at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. After five years of university, research in cognitive sciences and complexity followed.

In 2001, after the resignation of Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader Lucien Bouchard, Ouimet tried to enlist as a candidate for the party leadership. His ambition was said to be motivated by his desire to spark a debate in the leadership race, which would not happen otherwise, as out of the three possible leadership contenders, Fran√ßois Legault and Pauline Marois withdrew, leaving Bernard Landry unopposed. Ouimet did not gather the necessary number of signatures in time to enter and Landry became leader. Bernard Landry's resignation of 2005 left him the opportunity to try again, one that he seized. He officially issued his candidacy on September 15, 2005 for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois leadership campaign of 2005. He ran on a series of proposals emphasising wealth redistribution, environmentalism and participatory democracy. He also proposed a collegial structure for the party and ties his vision of sovereignty to an elaboration of a social contract. Ouimet fared poorly in the contest winning 247 votes or 0.2% of ballots cast.

In the 1872 Galway County by-election, Duggan organized support for Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) John Philip Nolan who was favourably disposed towards tenant rights. Nolan was elected but lost his seat on the grounds of undue clerical influence, and Duggan was brought to trial with others before the Court of Common Pleas, but the case collapsed and he was acquitted.

The result of the battle had a radical effect on the history of Wales. The battle is recorded in the near-contemporary biography of one of the participants, The History of Gruffydd ap Cynan.Paul Russell (ed) (2006). Vita Griffini Filii Conani: The Medieval Latin Life of Gruffudd Ap Cynan. University of Wales Press. Gruffudd ap Cynan was a descendant of the traditional ruling house of Gwynedd, and had previously made an attempt to claim the kingdom in 1075, but had been defeated by Trahaearn ap Caradog and forced to take refuge in Ireland.A history of Wales from the earliest times In 1081, Gruffudd launched an invasion from Waterford in Ireland, having gathered a force of Danes and Irishmen to support his claim. He landed not in Gwynedd but further south near St David's (in what would become the Paladin of Pembrokeshire). At the church of St David's he met with Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth who had shortly before been driven from power by Caradog ap Gruffydd of Glamorgan and Gwent helped by Meilir ap Rhiwallon of Powys and Gruffudd's old nemesis Trahaearn ap Caradog of Gwynedd. Gruffudd and Rhys made a pact and set forth to give battle. The battle The battle took place about a day's march north of St David's. In the evening Gruffudd and Rhys came up with the forces led by Trahaearn and Caradog ap Gruffydd, who are reported to have had Norman arbalisters in their army. According to his biography, Gruffudd ap Cynan insisted on an immediate attack, overruling Rhys who wished to wait until the following morning. The result was a complete victory for Gruffudd ap Cynan and Rhys ap Tewdwr, with Trahaearn ap Caradog, Caradog ap Gruffydd and Meilir ap Rhiwallon all being killed.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales Aftermath Gruffudd ap Cynan gained control of Gwynedd, and despite later being captured and imprisoned by the Normans for some years, escaped and reigned until 1137 becoming one of the most successful leaders of Gwynedd. Rhys ap Tewdwr regained Deheubarth and reigned until 1093. These two were later to play a prominent part in Welsh resistance to the Normans. The immediate aftermath of the battle helped the Normans who took advantage quickly of this internal Welsh struggle which weakened all the major Welsh kingdoms and killed three of their leaders. Later that year William the Conqueror became the first Norman King to enter Wales and signalled his power by marching straight through modern day South Wales along to St David's. There he received homage from Rhys ap Tewdwr who accepted William's overlordship. The death of Caradog ap Gruffydd split his kingdom leaving it in disarray and helped ensure Norman dominance of the lowlands of Gwent and Glamorgan leading to the effective collapse of what had formerly been one of the most powerful Welsh kingdoms.

In a Guardian interview in 2008, Wilson spoke of the fact he grew up known to everyone primarily as a son of the Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Harold Wilson: \\"I hated the attention and I still dislike being introduced as Harold Wilson's son. I feel uncomfortable talking about it to strangers even now.\\" Mathematics career Wilson's academic interests lie in graph theory, particularly in colouring problems, e.g. the four colour problem, and algebraic properties of graphs. He also researches the history of mathematics, particularly British mathematics and mathematics in the 17th century and the period 1860 to 1940 and the history of graph theory and combinatorics. In 1974, he won the Lester R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his expository article An introduction to matroid theory.Paul R. Halmos ‚Äì Lester R. Ford Awards, Mathematical Association of America Due to his collaboration on a 1977 paper with the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd≈ës, Wilson has an Erd≈ës number of 1. In July 2008, he published a study of the mathematical work of Lewis Carroll, the creator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass ‚Äî Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life (Allen Lane, 2008. ). From January 1999 to September 2003, Wilson was editor-in-chief of the European Mathematical Society Newsletter.European Mathematical Society Newsletter, No 49, September 2003, He is past President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics. Other interests He has strong interests in music, including the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and is the co-author (with Frederic Lloyd) of Gilbert and Sullivan: The Official D'Oyly Carte Picture History.Knopf, 1984. In 2007, he was a guest on Private Passions, the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3.BBC Radio 3  Personal life  Wilson is married and has twin daughters Catherine Lidbetter and Jenifer Reynolds who now both have three children of their own including twins.

Each cell is equipped with a viewing window and two remote manipulators. Shielded nuclear radiation containment chambers are commonly referred to as hot cells. The word \\"hot\\" refers to radioactivity. Hot cells are used in both the nuclear-energy and the nuclear-medicines industries. They are required to protect individuals from radioactive isotopes by providing a safe containment box in which they can control and manipulate the equipment required.  Nuclear industry  Hot cells are used to inspect spent nuclear fuel rods and to work with other items which are high-energy gamma ray emitters. For instance, the processing of medical isotopes, having been irradiated in a nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, would be carried out in a hot cell. Hot cells are of nuclear proliferation concern, as they can be used to carry out the chemical steps used to extract plutonium from reactor fuel. The cutting of the used fuel, the dissolving of the fuel and the first extraction cycle of a nuclear reprocessing PUREX process (highly active cycle) would need to be done in a hot cell. The second cycle of the PUREX process (medium active cycle) can be done in gloveboxes.  Nuclear medicine industry  Hot cell in a hospital used for the preparation of Technetium-99m for use in single-photon emission computed tomography. Hot cells are commonly used in the nuclear medicines industry: * for the production of radiopharmaceuticals, according to GMP guidelines (industry) * for the manipulation and dispense of radiopharmaceuticals (hospitals). The user must never be subject to shine paths that are emitted from the radioactive isotopes and therefore there generally is heavy shielding around the containment boxes, which can be made out of stainless steel 316 or other materials such as PVC or Corian. This shielding can be ensured by the use of lead (common) or materials such as concrete (very large walls are therefore required) or even tungsten. The amount of radioactivity present in the hot cell, the energy of the gamma photons emitted by the radioisotopes, and the number of neutrons that are formed by the material will prescribe how thick the shielding must be. For instance a source of cobalt-60 will require thicker shielding than a source of iridium-192 to give the same dose rate at the outer surface of the hot cell. Also if some actinide materials such as californium or spent nuclear fuel are used within the hot cell then a layer of water or polyethylene may be needed to lower the neutron dose rate.  Viewing windows  In order to view what is in the hot cell, cameras can be used (but these require replacing on a regular basis) or most commonly, lead glass is used. There are several densities for lead glass, but the most common is 5.2 g/cm3. A rough calculation for lead equivalence would be to multiply the Pb thickness by 2.5 (e.g. 10 mm Pb would require a 25 mm thick lead glass window). Older hot cells used a ZnBr2 solution in a glass tank to shield against high-energy gamma rays. This shielded the radiation without darkening the glass (as happens to leaded glass with exposure). This solution also \\"self-repairs\\" any damage caused by radiation interaction, but leads to optical distortion due to the difference in optical indices of the solution and glass.  Manipulators  Telemanipulators or tongs are used for the remote handling of equipment inside hot cells, thereby avoiding heavy finger/hand doses.  Gloves  Lead loaded gloves are often used in conjunction with tongs as they offer better dexterity and can be used in low radiation environments (such as hot cells used in hospital nuclear medicine labs). Some companies have developed tungsten loaded gloves which offer greater dexterity than lead loaded gloves, with better shielding than their counterparts. Gloves must be regularly replaced as the chemicals used for the cleaning/sterilisation process of the containments cause considerable wear and tear.  Clean rooms  Hot cells are generally placed in clean rooms with an air classification ranging from D to B (C is the most common). It is extremely rare to find a hot cell which is placed in a class A or unclassified clean room.  Types Research and development cells= These cells are often used to test new chemistry units or processes. They are generally fairly large as they require flexibility for the use of varying chemistry units which can greatly vary in size (e.g. synthera and tracerlab). Some cells require remote manipulation. =Stack mini-cells= This type of hot cell is used purely for production of radiopharmaceuticals. A chemistry unit is placed in each cell, the production process is initiated (receiving the radioactive 18F from the cyclotron) and once finished, the cells are left closed for a minimum of 6 hours allowing the radiation to decrease to a safe level. No Manipulation is necessary here. =Production and dispense cells= Cells used to dispense products. For example once FDG has been produced from F-18 mixing with glucose, a bulk vial is put into in a dispense cell and its contents carefully dispensed into a number of syringes or vials. Remote manipulation is crucial at this stage.

He was responsible for painting several frescos in the House of Lords in London. Life and workEarly life and training= Cope was born at Park Square in Leeds, the son of Charles Cope, a watercolour landscape painter and art teacher. He was given the name 'West' after that of a celebrated painter, Benjamin West, and his only sister Ellen, given the middle-name 'Turner', after J. M. W. Turner ‚Äì both painters being friends of his father. His mother was \\"a gifted amateur\\" artist in watercolours who died shortly after Charles' birth. Charles was sent as a child to a boarding school in Camberwell, London, and afterwards to \\"Terry's school\\" (sic) at Great Marlow, where he was bullied and his elbow broken, which left him with a crooked arm for life. He then went to Leeds Grammar School, where he suffered from the attentions of a cruel teacher. In 1827, Cope's father was killed in a stage coach accident. That same year he entered Sass's Academy Sass's Academy . in Bloomsbury, London, and in 1828 became a student of the Royal Academy. He earned a silver medal from the Society of Arts in 1829, a second medal in the Royal Academy Life School, and therefore a life studentship. While at Sass's he established life-long friendship with Francis Cary and Charles Stonhouse. About 1830 he lived at lodgings in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury close to the British Museum. In 1832 Cope went to Paris and practiced his art by copying Old Masters at the Louvre such as Titian, Rembrandt and others. In 1833 he exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time ‚Äì a picture called The Golden Age. In September of the same year he travelled to Italy, where he spent two years ‚Äì earning a living for part of the time by painting pictures on commission. His painting The Firstborn was completed in Florence and exhibited at the British Institution. =Early career= Othello Relating His Adventures (etching, 1853), from The Works of Shakespere After returning to England, Cope took lodgings in Newman Street, London, then moved to 1 Russell Place, where his landlord and family became his artist's models. Here he painted Paolo and Franceses and Osteria di Campagna, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1837 and 1838 respectively, and sold shortly thereafter for a considerable sum. In 1839‚Äì40 he painted a large altar-piece (16 feet by 10) for St George's Church, Leeds, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840. Cope founded an artists' society called 'The Etching Club' which included artists such as William Holman Hunt, Richard Redgrave and Samuel Palmer. The club published several books of etchings illustrating various themes by well-known authors such as Goldsmith's \\"The Deserted Village\\", Sonnets by Shakespeare and Milton's \\"L'Allegro\\" and \\"Il ponseroso\\".Cope, H. W. \\"Reminiscences\\" (1891) p. 35 ff.The Etching Club. On 1 September 1840, Cope married Charlotte Benning, the daughter of a surgeon with a large country practice. They lived first in rented furnished lodgings in Lisson Grove, London, then moved to a house in Kensington (which Cope himself had commissioned) in 1841. In that same year his painting Poor Law Guardians: Board-day application for bread was exhibited at the Royal Academy. =Painting frescos for the Houses of Parliament= Oliver Cromwell and His Secretary John Milton, Receiving a Deputation Seeking Aid for the Swiss Protestants (1872) Cope submitted designs for a competition to decorate the interior of the Houses of Parliament.The complex history surrounding the decoration is best summarized by T. S. R. Boase, The Decorations of the New Palace of Westminster 1841‚Äì1863, in: Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 17:1954, pp. 319‚Äì358. In 1843, his drawing 'The First Trial by Jury' earned him a prize of 300 pounds. In 1844 he submitted a further design called 'Meeting of Jacob and Rachel,' and was one of the six painters commissioned in July of that year to prepare preliminary drawings, coloured sketches, and specimens of fresco painting for the decoration of the House of Lords. He also received 400 pounds for his design of Prince Henry Acknowledging the Authority of Judge Gascoigne. Cope received a commission to execute this design in fresco, and also another of Edward the Black Prince receiving the Order of the Garter. These commissions, and others, engaged Cope in fresco painting in the House of Lords for several years. He was also elected an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1843. In 1848 he became a Royal Academician (RA) after exhibiting a large work Cardinal Wolsey's Reception at Leicester Abbey. In this year he was engaged on the frescos of Griselda and Lara on the wall of the upper waiting hall of the House of Lords. In 1849 he exhibited a painting The First-born which was subsequently engraved for the Art Union of London.Art Union of London. In that year he travelled to Italy and Germany to improve his knowledge and technique of fresco painting. He visited Peter von Hess in Munich, who was working on a fresco in the Basilica of St. Boniface The Thorn (1866) In 1850, Cope showed 'King Lear and Cordelia' at the RA, and, in 1851, 'The Sisters,' and 'Laurence Saunders's Martyrdom'. In 1852, he painted the 'Marriage of Griselda' and in 1853, 'Othello relating his Adventures to Dessdemona'. In the same year he became seriously ill with an internal tumour. In 1854 he exhibited 'The Friends', and in 1855 'Royal Prisoners'. In 1856 he painted 'The Embarkation of a Puritan Family for New England' for the peers' corridor in the House of Lords, for which a fresco was afterwards substituted. The main painting was sent to America, and Cope was made an honorary member of the Philadelphian Society of Arts. In 1857 Cope exhibited Affronted and executed a fresco of The Burial of Charles I in the peers' corridor (House of Lords). In 1858 came The Stepping Stones, and in 1859 a picture of Cordelia receiving the News of her father's Ill-treatment, and the fresco of The Parting of Lord and Lady William Russell in the peers' corridor. In 1861 the fresco of 'Raising the Standard' was placed in the peers' corridor. In 1862 he painted (using the \\"water-glass method\\") the fresco of 'The Defence of Basing House,' and in 1863-64 that of the 'Expulsion of Fellows from Oxford for refusing to sign the Covenant.' In 1865 he exhibited a study of Fra Angelico in oil, afterwards executed in mosaic on a larger scale at the South Kensington Museum. In the year his large posthumous portrait of Prince Albert was hung in the large room of the Society of Arts. In 1865 and 1866 Cope finished his best frescoes in the House of Lords ‚Äì 'Meeting of Train Bands to relieve the Siege of Gloucester' and Speaker Lenthall asserting the Privileges of the Commons. In 1867 he was appointed professor of painting at the Royal Academy, and delivered six lectures a year till 1875. In 1867 also he painted a third scene (moonlight) from Othello (exhibited 1868). Cope's wife, Charlotte, died in 1868. =Final years= Cope continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1882, his most important painting of that period being The Council of the Royal Academy selecting Pictures for the Exhibition, shown in 1876. In that same year he went to America as one of the representatives of the RA at the centennial exhibition in Philadelphia. In 1879 Cope married his second wife Eleanor Smart. They settled at Maidenhead in Berkshire (on the Thames). In 1883 he retired as a professional artist though he continued to paint for his own enjoyment and also took up boating and cycling.

Aside from its church it centres on Finchley Central Underground station. Church End is an old village, now a suburban development, centred north-northwest of Charing Cross. Toponymy Church End was named in 1683. The name is formed from Middle English 'churche' and 'ende' and means 'district by the church'. The name refers to the parish church of Finchley, St Mary. Finchley Church End is the name of a ward in Barnet. Geography The entrance to St Mary's church Wards of Finchley Urban District in the 1930s Wards of Finchley Municipal Borough in the 1950s The main road runs on a south‚Äìnorth axis, and is called Regents Park Road (previously Ducksetters Lane) from the North Circular Road until it reaches the road bridge at Finchley Central station (Northern line), where the name changes to Ballards Lane. Its heart is the ancient district around St Mary's Church, where the imposing tower of Pardes House Primary School (formerly Christ's College Finchley) is a landmark. Amenities There is a public library in Regents Park Road in Gateway House, a new building facing the junction with Hendon Lane. The library was relocated in September 2017 from its former home in Hendon Lane, next to the church. To the north, along Regents Park Road and Ballards Lane, close to the station, is a retail district with a Victorian and Edwardian shopping parade as well as a couple of pubs and modern shops including Sainsbury's and Tesco. Further north, Victoria Park is the home of the Finchley Carnival, a large fun fair held every year in July, dating back to 1905. Victoria Park has a lawn bowls and croquet club with a modern clubhouse. To the southeast along East End Road are two institutions of note: Avenue House, built in 1859 and home to the Finchley Society, and a Jewish cultural centre, the Sternberg Centre. Avenue House was the home of Henry 'Inky' Stephens (1841-1918), son of Dr Henry Stephens (1796-1864) who founded the Stephens Ink Company, the first producers of \\"Blue-Black Writing Fluid\\" in 1832. A small museum - The Stephens Collection - commemorates this invention and the Stephens family, along with the history of writing materials including many photographs and artefacts. In December 2016 the museum closed temporarily in order to move to a new location within the estate's new Visitor Centre established within the former stables block. 'Inky' Stephens, a former local MP, left Avenue House to \\"the people of Finchley\\" on his death in 1918. The house and ten acres of fine landscaped gardens and parkland open to the public are now run by a local charitable trust. In February 2014 the estate was relaunched and rebranded, in conjunction with a Heritage Lottery Fund bid, as Stephens House and Gardens. South, along Regents Park Road, is College Farm, the last farm in Finchley (entrance in Fitzalan Road), and a statue, referred to locally as \\"The Naked Lady\\", but more properly named La D√©livrance.

She was built in 1980 as Viking Song by W√§rtsil√§ Perno shipyard, Finland for Rederi Ab Sally, one of the owners of the Viking Line consortium. She has also sailed under the names Braemar (for Fred Olsen Lines) and Anna Karenina (for Baltic Shipping Co.). History Viking Song in Stockholm, 1984. =Viking Line and Fred. Olsen service= Braemar in 1986. Delivered in August 1980, Viking Song was the last newbuilding delivered to Rederi Ab Sally for use on Viking Line's routes. She served alongside her sister Viking Saga on the route connecting Helsinki, Finland to Stockholm. Although she was the newer of the two ships, when SF Line brought their new Mariella to Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service in 1985, the Viking Song was withdrawn from service and sold to Norwegian Fred. Olsen Lines. After rebuilding at Blohm + Voss, Hamburg where a second storey was added to her nightclub, Viking Song emerged as Fred. Olsen's new MS Braemar. She was initially set on a route connecting Oslo, Norway with Harwich, UK, although her route varied a lot during the next five years, with Hirtshals, Denmark replacing or appearing alongside Harwich as the main destination. In December 1990 Fred. Olsen sold their ferry operations to the new Color Line, however Braemar was not included in the sale and she was laid up. =Russian Army and Baltic Line= In January 1991 Braemar was chartered to Baltic Shipping Company and renamed Baltica for planned service between St. Petersburg, Russia and Stockholm. This service was never realised however, and for the time being the only change was moving the ship to Hamburg where she was again laid up. Later in the same month the ship was sub-chartered to the Russian army for transporting troops out of former East Germany. The ship, renamed Anna Karenina, was badly vandalised by the troops transported on board, and had to be docked in Hamburg afterwards for repairs. March 1991 finally saw the beginning of a service out of St. Petersburg, when Anna Karenina started traffic on the St. Petersburg‚ÄìNyn√§shamn‚ÄìKiel route for Baltic Line. In 1995 St. Petersburg was dropped from the itinerary. In January 1996 Baltic Line was declared bankrupt and Anna Karenina (soon renamed Anna K.) returned to Fred. Olsen for laying up in Germany. =EstLine and Tallink= Anna K. was sold to EstLine (a daughter company of Nordstr√∂m & Thulin, Sweden and ESCO, Estonia) in 1996 for service between Tallinn, Estonia and Stockholm, Sweden. She was renamed Regina Baltica. In 1997 Nordstr√∂m & Thulin withdrew from Estline leaving ESCO as the sole owner of the company. ESCO later changed its name to Hansatee Shipping. At the end of 2000 the name Estline was abandoned and the Tallinn‚ÄìStockholm service became a part of Tallink. In May 2004 a call at Mariehamn was added to maintain tax-free sales on board. In spring 2005 the ship was temporarily chartered to NATO for training exercises in Norway. On 28 September 2005 the ship ran aground in Swedish waters near Kapellsk√§r. There were no victims in the accident, which happened on the day of the 11th anniversary of the sinking of the Estonia. In April 2006 Regina Baltica made three trips between Tallinn and Helsinki, due to the ice situation being so bad that all of Tallink's normal ships on the route could not traffic. On May of the same year MS Romantika replaced her on the Tallinn‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm route, and Regina Baltica was moved to Stockholm‚ÄìRiga route, where she replaced Fantaasia. In August of the same year the Regina Balticas homeport was changed from Tallinn to Riga. =Acciona Trasmediterr√°nea= The Regina Baltica was withdrawn from service with Tallink in April 2009, when she was replaced by Romantika in the Stockholm‚ÄìRiga service. Subsequently she was chartered to the Spain-based Acciona Trasmediterr√°nea and entered service their Almer√≠a‚ÄìNador route on 25 June 2009. On 20 September 2009 she was returned to Tallink and laid up in Riga. In the end of May 2010 Regina Baltica was again chartered to Acciona Trasmediterr√°nea, serving first on their Algeciras‚ÄìTangier route and from June on the Almeria‚ÄîNador route.

She began her service as a merchant vessel plying the Baltimore‚ÄìCharleston route. Not long afterward, she was sent on the first trans-Atlantic crossing by a Baltimore steamship, sailing to Southampton, England, and Le Havre, France. A short time later Tennessee was used to open the first regular passenger steamship service between New York City and Central America. During the California Gold Rush, the Tennessee transported \\"49'ers\\" to the eastern shores of Panama and Nicaragua to travel to California's Sierra Nevada mountains. The Tennessee delivered the last group of \\"immigrants\\" volunteering as mercenary soldiers for William Walker in Nicaragua, and, after defeat of Walker's forces, took home hundreds of disconsolate, defeated survivors. Tennessee for several years regularly served the Vera Cruz, Mexico‚ÄìNew Orleans route, often transporting immigrants to America as well as large sums of Mexican gold and silver. She was tied up in harbor at New Orleans when the American Civil War began on April 12, 1861. =Civil War service= At the outbreak of the Civil War, she was trapped in port at New Orleans, Louisiana, and was seized for use as a Confederate blockade runner as the CSS Tennessee in 1861, although she was never able to escape blockade of the New Orleans harbor. After the Union capture of New Orleans, the ship was put into armed Union service, including as the flagship of United States Navy Admiral David G. Farragut for the conclusion of the Mississippi Campaign. As USS Tennessee, she was not only a fast and effective blockade ship in the West Gulf Squadron, but also a powerful gunship used to bombard Ft. Morgan during the Battle of Mobile Bay. In September 1864, she was renamed USS Mobile to allow a famous Confederate armored ram ship to carry the name Tennessee after its capture. This second CSS Tennessee had been taken during a dramatic encounter at Mobile Bay. USS Mobile was damaged in a hurricane off the mouth of the Rio Grande in October 1864, and sent to New York for repair. Upon inspection, the ship was judged too expensive to refit and was taken out of U.S. Navy commission in December, 1864. She was sold at auction in March, 1865, renamed SS Republic, repaired, and soon returned to the New York‚ÄìNew Orleans route hauling passengers and cargo. She was lost on her fifth civilian voyage after the war. =Wreck= The Republic left New York on October 18, 1865, bound for New Orleans. According to her captain, she was carrying passengers and a cargo of $400,000 in coins, mostly in gold $10 and $20 pieces, intended for use as hard currency after the Civil War. The city of New Orleans, captured largely intact by the Union in 1862, had been the southern hub of Federal war efforts and was a thriving, busy city ‚Äì but due to war, \\"hard money\\" (or gold and silver coin) was in very short supply. On the fifth day of her voyage, a hurricane off the coast of Georgia proved too strong for the ship. By evening, her hull was leaking so badly that the fire in the boiler was extinguished, and she stalled in heavy seas, taking on water faster than her crew and passengers could bail her. At 4 pm on October 25, 1865, she sank. The passengers and crew escaped in four lifeboats and a makeshift raft, but 40-foot seas throughout the night made keeping them afloat a serious challenge. It was not until two days later, on October 27 that the survivors, now desperate with thirst, were found by the sailing ship Horace Beals. On October 29, the steamer General Hooker had been sent to look for the Republic, and rendezvoused with Horace Beals. The passengers were transferred and taken to Charleston. Most of the passengers and crew survived, although several were lost on the raft before they could be rescued. All the coins were lost. = Rediscovery = In August 2003 , the wreck of the Republic was located by Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc., a commercial archaeology company in Tampa, Florida. She was found about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Savannah, Georgia, in about 1,700 feet (500 meters) of water. A salvage effort recovered about one-third of the rare 19th-century gold and silver coins carried aboard, worth an estimated $75 million. Most of the hull of the ship is now gone, but the rudder, parts of the paddle wheel and the steam engine are still present. The search and recovery effort was depicted in a National Geographic Society TV documentary Civil War Gold.\\"S.S. Republic\\". National Geographic, 2003 Many artifacts, from the 14,000 salvaged, plus silver coins from the 51,000 coins collected, are on display in selected museums. Artifacts have been on display in Tampa, New Orleans, Detroit, Elberta, Hot Springs, and Oklahoma City. The displays also present video stories about passengers and crew members, and where they moved years after the wreck.\\"Odyssey's Shipwreck!\\" . Baldwin County Heritage Museum, Elberta, AL, January 2009 \\"Odyssey's 'SHIPWRECK!

SS Republic is currently the subject of a lawsuit over the gold recovery, as E. Lee Spence claims in a lawsuit that Odyssey Marine used his information in their efforts to locate the wreck. A judge in South Carolina has ruled that the case may proceed in that state, reversing his own earlier decision.

In February 2013 the line northeast of Hatfield and Stainforth station towards Thorne was blocked by the Hatfield Colliery landslip, with all services over the section halted. As a result, from Goole rail services to Doncaster & Sheffield were suspended and replaced by road transport. The line reopened to traffic in July 2013.  History  The Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway obtained authorisation in 1845 to build a railway to Goole as well as building a pier and improving the harbour. However, it was amalgamated before construction with the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1846. In 1847 the Manchester and Leeds Railway was authorised to change its name to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and in 1848 the L&YR; was Goole's first connected railway. The current station was opened by the NER on 1 October 1869 (along with their line from Thorne Junction to Gilberdyke). Passenger trains from the Knottingley direction initially ran to a terminus station next to the docks but this was closed when the NER station opened, trains then using a short curve to join the main line at Potter's Grange Junction south of the new station. The former L&Y; line into the docks remained a busy freight route for many years afterwards, but has now been lifted (though access to the remaining dock sidings is still possible from the main line).

There was a small buffet run by the Kitwood family on the up platform and a small office on the down platform serving a wholesale newspaper business run by Joe Kelbrick; nearby there is a small goods yard used by EWS steel trains. The station saw heavy redevelopment in the 1970s.

His younger brother Moray Callum is Vice President, Design, Ford Motor Company. Early years Callum was born in Dumfries, Scotland, in 1954. In 1968 (at the age of 14) he submitted a car design to Jaguar in the hope of landing a job. Callum studied at Lanchester Polytechnic's (now Coventry University) School of Transportation Design in Coventry, Aberdeen Art College and the Glasgow School of Art, where he graduated with a degree in Industrial Design. He subsequently graduated from the Royal College of Art in London with a post-graduate master's degree in Vehicle Design. CareerFord= From 1979 to 1990 he was employed by Ford, working between Dunton, Japan, Italy and Australia, mainly on \\"bits of cars, mostly steering wheels\\".‚ÄòIan Callum's Day Off‚Ä¶‚Äô by Jon Smith (pp98-104), CAR Magazine, February 2007, p. 104 As well as working on bread-and-butter Fiestas and Mondeos, he contributed to image builders such as the RS200 and Escort RS Cosworth, the last of which he is especially proud of and with which he collaborated with fellow RCA graduate Peter Horbury. He was then appointed Design Manager responsible for the Ghia Design Studio in Turin, where he worked on the Via, Zig and Zag show car concepts. =TWR= Nissan R390 After eleven years in a corporate environment, Callum left Ford in 1990 to join Peter Stevens and Tom Walkinshaw to form TWR Design. He said, In 1991 he was appointed Chief Designer and General Manager of TWR Design. During this period he was partially responsible for designing the Aston Martin DB7, which is probably the design he is currently most famous for. He also designed the Aston Martin Vanquish, the V12-powered DB7 Vantage and Aston Martin's Project Vantage concept car as well as taking responsibility for a wide range of design programs for other TWR clients, including Volvo, Mazda and HSV. He was awarded the Jim Clark Memorial Award in 1995 in recognition of his styling work on the DB7. In 1998, he designed the Nissan R390.1998 Nissan R390 GT1 , accessed 16 April 2016 =Jaguar= Jaguar XK Jaguar F-Type In 1999, on the death of Geoff Lawson, Callum was appointed to succeed him at Jaguar, which was a Ford Motor Company subsidiary at the time (now a subsidiary of Tata Group). For a short stint, Callum directed design at both Jaguar and Aston Martin and was responsible for the majority of the DB9 and Vantage, both of which are attributed to Henrik Fisker.Ian Callum: What I'd do Differently, Mike Duff, Car & Driver, April 2010 , accessed 16 April 2016 At Jaguar, since the Lawson designed 2001 X-Type and 2002 XJ were well advanced his influence was initially felt through a series of concepts, the 2001 R-Coupe and 2003 R-D6. The first production Jaguar to bear his influence was the 2004 facelift of the S-Type followed by the 2004 X-Type Estate, of which he oversaw the tailgate design. With the next generation of Jaguar models Callum took Jaguar away from the Lawson-era retroism, which produced the more traditional-looking X-Type, S-Type, and XJ, towards a new style. This began with the 2006 XK, which bears striking similarity to the Aston Martin DB9, which Callum describes as being a result of modern safety legislation. This new direction continued with the 2008 XF as previewed by the concept C-XF, which Callum describes as the 'next significant step forward' in Jaguar's design direction,‚ÄòJaguar XF‚Äô by Gavin Green (pp44-55), CAR Magazine, February 2007, p. 48 and the 2010 XJ. He also oversaw the design for the 2010 C-X75 concept car, the 2012 refresh of the Jaguar XF and introduction of Sportbrake, the 2013 F-Type, the 2015 Jaguar XE, 2015 second generation Jaguar XF (the first Callum-led design to replace another Callum-led design), the 2016 Jaguar F-Pace, and the 2018 Jaguar I-Pace. According to Callum, ‚ÄòJaguars should be perceived as cool cars and cool cars attract interesting, edgy people.‚Äô The quality of Callum's work at Jaguar has been acknowledged by twice Le Mans 24 hours winner and fellow Dumfries native, Allan McNish.Allan McNish interview part 2 on qosfc.com In early June 2019, Callum announced that he was stepping down to \\"pursue other design projects\\" but would continue with the company as a design consultant. \\"Designing Jaguar cars was a lifelong dream for me, and I‚Äôm delighted to remain involved as a consultant for the brand\\", he said in an interview.

Workman better known by her stage name, Princess Mona Darkfeather (January 13, 1882 ‚Äì September 3, 1977) was an American actress who starred in Native American and Western dramas. During the silent era of motion pictures, from 1911 to 1917, she appeared in 102 movies. She is best known for her role as Prairie Flower in The Vanishing Tribe (1914). Her career began in 1909 when she replied to a local newspaper advertisement placed by producer/director Thomas Ince's Bison Motion Pictures. During a time when studios rarely hired Native Americans, the movie studio was looking for an actress with the physical attributes to portray an American Indian and who was physically capable of doing stunts and riding horses. While she had never acted before, Workman fit the appearance that Ince wanted. She apparently embellished her riding skills, as she did not have any, but nevertheless quickly learned horsemanship. Given the stage name Mona Darkfeather (and later \\"Princess\\" Mona Darkfeather), she was cast in her first starring role as an Indian maiden named Owanee in the 1911 movie Owanee's Great Love. Early life She was born Josephine M. Workman in Boyle Heights, California, and baptized at the Plaza Church, Los Angeles, when she was four months old,\\"Old Baptismal Book In Court ‚Äì Plaza Church Tome Evidence in Million Dollar Case ‚Äì Used to Prove Age of Heir to the Workman Estate ‚Äì Many Pioneers Witnesses in Battle for Rich Lands.\\" Los Angeles Times.

Her siblings were Mary Cristina Workman (1870‚Äì1963); Agnes Elizabeth Workman (1872‚Äì1957); Marie Lucile \\"Lucy\\" Workman (1875‚Äì1944); William Joseph Workman (1877‚Äì1956); George D. Workman (1879‚Äì1903); and Nellie Workman (1886‚Äì1888). Her grandparents were William Workman (1799-1876), a native of England, and Nicolasa Urioste (1802-1892), who hailed from the (specifically Taos Pueblo) of New Mexico. See Darkfeather's profile https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201310/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm According to the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum, her paternal grandmother Nicolasa was of Taos Pueblo descent. Her mother was of Scottish and Chilean descent. Darkfeather claimed Spanish ancestry as well. She was a member of the prominent pioneer Workman family of Los Angeles. In 1870, her grandfather, William Workman (1799‚Äì1876), deeded of land, a portion of the Rancho La Puente, to his son, Joseph M. Workman. Through this deed, the land would go to Joseph's children upon his death. Her parents separated in 1893, and Josephine lived with her mother. Joseph Workman deeded his Rancho La Puente land to O.T.

Montgomery moved to Spokane, Washington to open and direct at the Frank E. Montgomery of the Spokane School of Motion Picture Acting. Darkfeather became associated with the company as an instructor. Darkfeather and Montgomery divorced in 1928. In late 1928, Darkfeather married banker and financer Alfred Wessling until their divorce in 1935. On December 23, 1937, Montgomery and Darkfeather remarried after nine years of separation and remained married until Montgomery's death in 1944. Film career The War Bonnet (1914) After replying in 1909 to a Bison Motion Pictures newspaper ad, which called for \\"exotic-looking girls\\" to play \\"Indian maidens\\", she soon became famous as \\"Princess Mona Darkfeather\\", noted for leaping onto her pinto pony, \\"Comanche\\", and galloping away bareback. Darkfeather was a noted moving picture artist who regularly starred in roles of Indian and Western dramas. Although she was mostly of European and Chilean descent, Darkfeather's early publicity claimed she was a full-blooded Blackfoot Indian. She said she was an Indian Princess and had been made a blood member of the Blackfoot Nation and given the title of princess by a \\"Chief Big Thunder\\". The Western Border starring Mona Darkfeather, 1915 (Collection of Doug Neilson) She played Indian roles in one-reel western melodrama shorts, such as A White Indian (1912) and A Blackfoot's Conspiracy (1912), as well as feature length movies. She was by then a major movie star. She also played leading roles as Spanish women in several historical dramas. Darkfeather regularly appeared in Montgomery's films through various motion picture companies that he worked for, including Bison Company, Universal, Kalem Company, and Sawyer Inc. Under the tutelage of her husband/director Frank E Montgomery, Darkfeather played Indian and several Spanish leads in many Bison Company Productions. Darkfeather made movies for Bison starting in 1909, the Selig Polyscope Company between 1909 and 1913, Nestor Studios in 1912 and for Kalem Studios beginning in 1913. Montgomery directed her in the 101-Bison two-reeler The Massacre of the Fourth Cavalry (1912).Moving Picture World, 23 November 1912, pp.729,782; The Universal Weekly, 23 November 1912, p. 28. Other films he directed her in include A Forest Romance, For the Peace of Bear Valley and Justice of the Wild, all released in 1913, in which she played opposite Harry von Meter. Darkfeather was Cecil B. DeMille's first choice to portray the Indian wife, Nat-u-ritch, in his famous western The Squaw Man (1914), but she was too busy, as she and Montgomery were producing their own movies independently for release through the Kalem Company, and she was unavailable to play the role. The San Francisco Dramatic Review, 10 January 1914, p. 11. Princess Darkfeather, Liberty Theater, Tacoma, Washington, 1918 She and Montgomery joined the Universal Film Company in 1914 and continued to collaborate on scores of westerns. Darkfeather appeared in her last movie, The Hidden Danger, in 1917, then retired from the screen. For a while after she retired as a screen actress, she performed on the stage and headlined as Princess Darkfeather. In late August 1918, she made a special appearance at the Liberty Theater in Tacoma, Washington, as actress, singer and lecturer. In her \\"rattlesnake\\" dress, she appeared after each showing of the feature movie, Eyes of the World (1917) starring Monroe Salisbury, to sing and give advice to all girls in the audience with ambition to enter show business. She and her husband, Frank Montgomery, were living at 1117 3rd Avenue in Seattle, Washington, in September 1918, when he registered with the local draft board for World War I. He gave his present occupation as photoplay star manager.World War I Draft Registration Card, Microfilm Roll: 1991892, Draft Division No. 6, Sept. 12, 1918, Seattle, Wash.

Bassett to recover an interest in the Rancho La Puente land that her father sold to Bassett's father in 1895. Although she had been 12 years of age in 1895, she was never served with a summons to quit title as an heir of the property, as were her older brothers and sisters. The decision gave her a one-ninth interest in of what was said to be the largest walnut grove in California, at Bassett Station, near El Monte, and she was awarded a cash judgment for $129,163.\\"Wins Fortune For One Slip ‚Äì Pioneer's Grand-daughter to Get Land and Cash ‚Äì Failure to Serve Child for Old Suit Held Flaw ‚Äì Three Witnesses Recall Deed of Half Century Ago.\\" Los Angeles Times.

The city is the highest in Ecuador, at above sea level. Etymology The name is a Spanish derivation of the indigenous peoples' original name Hul-Can, which means \\"Warrior\\". History Male figure Carchi style CA 1100‚Äì1400 The first known history of the aboriginal occupants of this land begins with the failed Incan conquests. Tulc√°n sits within the northernmost outpost of the Inca Empire, which according to Spanish chroniclers, was the Rumichaca Bridge, located from Tulc√†n and the present-day border with Colombia.Almeida Reyes, Dr. Eduardo (2015), \\"El Camino del Inca en las Sierra Norte del Ecuador y su Valoracion Turistica\\", Revista de Invetigacion Cientifica, No, 7, pp. 75-87 The Spanish, seeking gold, became interested in the Quillasinga (the name given to the land), meaning \\"Gold Noses\\". Quillasinga was named without distinction of the ethnic occupants including the Pastos. Upon assuming the sovereignty for the Spanish crown, the territory was divided into provinces: Quillasinga road to Quito, Quillasinga road to Popayan, Quillasinga road to Almaguer, and Quillasinga road of the mountains. Tulcan's foundation is said to have been on June 11, 1535. With the arrival of colonists and further Spanish conquistadors, its growth increased and immediately passed to serve the Township of Otavalo, until 1600 when it passed to the township of Ibarra. During the colonial age it remained under the authority of the Real Audiencia de Quito, in which it increased its economic importance, until it became the most significant locality in the region. =Independence= Independence movements and proclamations sparked through the region. The independence movement in Carchi was led by Alejandro Ruano, Antonio Baca, Cecilio Arciniegas, Esteban Baca, Leandro Campi√±o, Jos√© Mar√≠a Pava, Antonio Rueda, and Ram√≥n Montenegro. On April 14, 1814 with charges of conspiracy of fighting for independence, these men were shot in Bolivar. The population continued its rebellion and in 1820, it ratified the Declaration of Independence of 9 de Octubre. Upon Ecuador becoming a republic, Tulc√°n retained its importance because it became a border town. Proximity to Colombia Tulc√°n is just from the Colombian border; the international bridge at Rumichaca which bridges the Carchi River is shared by the two countries. Tulc√°n is bounded on the north by the municipality of Ipiales (Colombia), on the south by the San Pedro de Huaca Canton, to the east by the Amazonian provinces of Sucumbios and to the west by the coastal province of Esmeraldas. This city is known for its civic culture and modern business, similar to that of Colombia because of its proximity to and significant trade with that country. Climate Tulc√°n features a Mediterranean climate (Csb) under K√∂ppen climate classification. Transportation Tulc√°n is very well connected in terms of land and air transport: the Panamerican Highway and Luis A. Mantilla airport are located nearby.

By September 1968, WSID-FM would break-away from the AM programs for several hours each day for a separate Underground Rock format, which was gradually expanded to full-time by the end of the year. =WLPL= The call letters for the station under the new format became WLPL in the process. The WLPL call-sign was an acronym and meaning the \\"W\\"onderful \\"L\\"and of \\"P\\"leasant \\"L\\"istening. In 1969, WLPL expanded its operating hours to full-time, while shifting toward a mixture of Top-40 and Album Rock musical selections. By 1972, the station had made a transition to a full-time Top 40 format and began broadcasting in stereo. WLPL was a very popular Top 40 station in the Baltimore radio listening market while under the management of its founder, United Broadcasting Company (UBC) of Bethesda, Maryland. In 1977, WLPL-FM Program Director Bill Parris was named \\"Major Market Top 40 Program Director of The Year\\" by the Billboard magazine, largely due to his work at WLPL. Notable personalities during this period were: Kris Earl Phillips, The \\"Smoker\\", Casey Jones, Hal Martin & Michael St. John (John Moen). However, audience ratings deteriorated when WBSB launched in 1980 as \\"B104\\" with a similar Top 40 format. WLPL was forced to operate under reduced transmitter power during this period, due to a fire in the station's broadcast tower equipment. =WYST-FM= WLPL terminated its Top 40 format in the summer of 1981, becoming WYST on November 16 (the FM suffix was added the next year). WYST was an Oldies-based Adult Contemporary format under the name \\"92 Star\\". Initially, ratings were very favorable for WYST, but began slipping shortly thereafter. In February 1991, WYST shifted its format to a Hot Adult Contemporary approach. The strategy failed, primary because Baltimore already had a popular station in the Hot AC format, WWMX. WYST's ratings, which had been struggling for several years, declined precipitously. By mid-1991, WYST was among Baltimore's lowest-rated radio stations. =WERQ-FM= The history of \\"92Q\\" began in August 1991. WYST's parent company, UBC, flipped the station to a CHUrban approach, under the nickname 92Q and the WERQ call-letters gained FCC approval one month later. The original concept for 92Q was formulated by UBC's Vice-President of Programming William Parris, who had an extensive background in the Top 40 radio format. The startup Program Director of 92Q was Jeffrey Ballentine. Steven Kingston (Program Director of Z100 in New York) and David Tate (of Rantel Research, Inc., of Laurel, Maryland) were the principal consultants on this risky new venture. Ironically, both Kingston and Tate were former employees of United Broadcasting Company during the 1970s and later, they were both competitors against UBC's WYST, while serving together at WBSB- FM, during the 1980s. After the introduction of 92Q, WERQ's audience ratings increased rapidly, at the expense of WBSB's Top 40 format (WBSB changed to a Hot AC format, as WVRY, in 1992) and longtime Urban station WXYV (which abandoned the format for Top 40 in 1997). Initially, 92Q was more Dance music- oriented, with a handful of Pop records in its musical mixture, but the format would gradually shift toward \\"CHUrban\\" (a hybrid of Top 40 and Urban Contemporary) by the end of 1991. The programming strategists at United Broadcasting were systematically evolving 92Q to a pure Urban Contemporary sound. In the Fall of 1993, United Broadcasting Company began divesting its holdings in radio stations after the death of its founder Richard Eaton, and sold WERQ-FM to Radio One. By 1995, WERQ would be classified as a full-fledged Mainstream Urban format. Current WERQ management Since 1996, under the management of the Radio One company, WERQ has consistently been one of the highest-rated stations in the radio listening audience of the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, according to the Arbitron ratings company.

He also held visiting positions at Aarhus University (Denmark), University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London, Microsoft Research (Cambridge) and Queen Mary, University of London (UK). Academic work Reynolds's main research interest was in the area of programming language design and associated specification languages, especially concerning formal semantics. He invented the polymorphic lambda calculus (System F) and formulated the property of semantic parametricity; the same calculus was independently discovered by Jean-Yves Girard. He wrote a seminal paper on definitional interpreters, which clarified early work on continuations and introduced the technique of defunctionalization. He applied category theory to programming language semantics. He defined the programming languages Gedanken and Forsythe, known for its use of intersection types. He worked on a separation logic to describe and reason about shared mutable data structures. He had been an editor of journals such as the Communications of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM. In 2001, he was appointed a Fellow of the ACM. He won the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Language Achievement Award in 2003, and the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in 2010.

Because of the similarity of this name with modern Slavic name Potisje (meaning approximately \\"a land around river Tisa\\" in Slavic), which is a typical Slavic name used for surroundings of the rivers (like Podunavlje, Pomoravlje, etc.), name mentioned by Plinius might indicate an early Slavic presence in the area.Oleg Trubaƒçov, Etnogeneza i kultura drevnih Slovena, Beograd, 2005. (page 50) Between 1702 and 1751, the western part of Potisje (in the region of Baƒçka) belonged to the Tisa-Mure≈ü (Potisje-Pomori≈°je) section of the Habsburg Military Frontier. Potisje segment of the Frontier included towns near river Tisa: Beƒçej, Ada, Senta and Kanji≈æa (in present-day Serbia), Szeged (in present-day Hungary), as well as other places in Baƒçka, including Subotica, Sombor and Sentoma≈° (Srbobran). After the abolishment of this part of the Frontier in 1751, many Serbs that lived in the region emigrated to Russia (notably to New Serbia and Slavo-Serbia). To prevent this emigration, the Habsburg authorities formed autonomous District of Potisje with seat in Beƒçej. District of Potisje existed between 1751 and 1848. The three privileges were given to the district in 1759, 1774, and 1800. First privilege of the District defined its autonomous status, while the second one allowed to ethnic Hungarians to settle in the district. In the following period many Hungarians settled in Potisje and they replaced Serbs as a dominant nation in parts of the region. Ethnic groups The municipalities with Serb ethnic majority are: ≈Ωabalj (86%), Titel (85%), Novi Kne≈æevac (59%), Kikinda (76%), Novi Beƒçej (69%), and Zrenjanin (74%).

It is the capital of the WƒÖbrze≈∫no County. The population is 13,971 inhabitants (2004).  History  Along with Che≈Çmno Land, the area was part of medieval Poland, since its establishment in the 10th century. Archaeologists have discovered medieval treasures, mostly from the 11th century, confirming medieval trade with the neighboring regions of Kuyavia and Prussia. At the beginning of the 13th century, a trade route developed that crossed over an isthmus between two large lakes, the Sicie≈Ñskie lake and the Zamkowe (\\"Castle lake\\"). A defensive wall was built at this spot, and later, a settlement was constructed there as well. The place is mentioned in a twelfth-century document regarding a battle in which Henry of Sandomierz was killed. Under the Latinized name \\"Wambresia\\" the town was mentioned in a 1251 document issued at Che≈Çm≈ºa. Bishop Heidenreich of Bishopric of Che≈Çmno received the Che≈Çmno Land from the pope. The Polish duke Konrad I of Masovia turned possession of the settlement over to the bishop of Che≈Çmno. This created a problem because the Teutonic Knights were in control of the Che≈Çmno Land, and a dispute began between the Bishop of Che≈Çmno and the Knights. The Pope at the time, Innocent IV, was not keen to continue the dispute and installed the Bishop as the rightful ruler of the settlement. This disagreement was the first historical mention of the settlement. In 1251, a large church, St. Simon and Judah, was built in the town. At the beginning of the 14th century, a revitalization of the church and the city was begun, led by the then-current Bishop of Che≈Çmno, Herman von Prizna. A wall was also constructed around the city to further its protection, and a castle was constructed in the city's northwestern corner. However, the city, the wall, the surrounding villages, and the castle were all completely destroyed in the Thirteen Years' War between the Teutonic Knights and the Poles. Afterwards, all of these were reconstructed, and the castle at Wambresia served as the official residence of the Bishops until 1773. The town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In May 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toru≈Ñ.Karol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p. 76 (in Polish) After the end of the Thirteen Years' War, which ended with the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town, and recognized it as part of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Che≈Çmno Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Bishop of Che≈Çmno and Polish diplomat, Jan Dantyszek, with the consent of King Sigismund I the Old, issued a new privilege to WƒÖbrze≈∫no and granted the coat of arms in 1534. The town was plundered by the Swedes during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War in 1629, and destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655. WƒÖbrze≈∫no was hit by a plague epidemic in 1630 and a major portion of the town also burned down in a devastating fire in 1700. Remains of the old castle After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the town became a possession of the Kingdom of Prussia, and between 1807 and 1815, the town was part of the Duchy of Warsaw, before it was reannexed by Prussia. Another devastating fire destroyed much of the town in 1792, and afterwards Frederick William II of Prussia allowed the demolition of the castle to supply stones for the rebuilding of the destroyed parts of the town. The town was subjected to Germanisation policies. In 1788, the city was renamed Briesen, by which is still referred to in German. The Prussian authorities initiated German colonization, by bringing German settlers to change the region's ethnic composition. Polish inhabitants took part in 19th-century Polish uprisings, including the November Uprising, Greater Poland uprising (1848) and the January Uprising. Anti-Polish policies intensified after the town became part of the German Empire in 1871. To resist Germanisation policies, Poles founded various organizations, including a branch of the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society. The residents of the city, mostly made their living through agriculture and brewing. Industrialization arrived in the middle of the 19th century. Industrial development flourished in the city due to its location and its access to railroads. By 1900, the city contained cement factories, as well as automotive and mechanical engineering centers. Along with this the traditional industries of the town were also modernized, with state-of-the-art breweries and creameries taking shape. Our Lady Queen of Poland church Courthouse in WƒÖbrze≈∫no On January 20, 1920, the town was reintegrated with Poland, which regained independence, the historic Polish name was restored, and was made seat of its county. Polish cultural life was revived in the interbellum. WƒÖbrze≈∫no was invaded by Nazi Germany in September 1939, during World War II, and was occupied by Germany until 1945. The Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles in October 1939.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 171 (in Polish) Around 1,000 Poles were arrested and imprisoned, mostly in a temporary concentration camp, established in a local factory, but some also in the local prison.Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 178 Some of these Poles were murdered in Skrwilno between October 15 and November 15, 1939 and in Nielub on October 17, 1939,Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 174, 178 while most were murdered in large massacres in ≈Åopatki and Kurkocin (see Intelligenzaktion). Nearly 4,000 Polish residents of WƒÖbrze≈∫no and the surrounding communities were sent to Nazi concentration camps, established in Potulice and Toru≈Ñ, and expelled. The Germans banned the use of the Polish language, liquidated Polish schools and organizations, and resettled the town with German colonists, however, the Poles still organized the underground Polish resistance movement. The Red Army captured the town in January 1945, but this was hardly an improvement, as the Soviets conducted mass deportations, in which 776 people from the county, including 261 people from the town were deported to labor camps in the Soviet Union. Most of these deportees died while being transported or in the labor camps, and most were Polish citizens. The city lost its status as county seat in 1975, but regained in 1999.

The various Serbian principalities and kingdoms were organised around a number of different royal dynasties. Many of these invested in symbols of royalty which has led to a number of distinctive crowns, jewels and other treasures of incredible wealth surviving to the present day. As far as is known, there are four royal crowns once worn by Serbian kings or princes that have survived to the present day, of which just one is kept in the modern Republic of Serbia today. Nemanjiƒá Crowns The Nemanjiƒá Crown Jewels are the oldest of the surviving pieces of Serbian royal regalia. They were used in the coronation ceremonies of members of the medieval House of Nemanjiƒá. The 14th Century Crown of King Stephen III is kept at Cetinje Monastery in the Republic of Montenegro.Cetinje Another crown which had once belonged to medieval Serbian rulers is kept in the Kaiserliche Schatzkammer (Imperial Treasury) in Vienna, Austria. Also, at the Kaiserliche Schatzkammer are found two further crowns once worn by members of the medieval Nemanjiƒá dynasty; one of which was later attributed to Stephen Bocskai. Together with these is a golden mantle (buckle) of unknown origin which is believed to have been captured by the Serbs from the Ottomans at Brasov. Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá Crown The Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá Crown Jewels were created in 1904 for the coronation of King Peter I. The pieces were made from materials that included bronze taken from the cannon Karaƒëorƒëe used during the First Serbian Uprising. This gesture was symbolic because 1904 was the 100th anniversary of that uprising. The regalia was made in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellery company and is currently the only Serbian crown kept in the territory of the Republic of Serbia.

The name Rabƒ´‚Äò al-awwal means \\"the first [month] or beginning of spring\\", referring to its position in the pre-Islamic Arabian calendar. During this month, many Muslims celebrate Mawlid - the birthday of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Although the exact date is unknown, Sunni Muslims believe the date of birth of Muhammad to have been on the twelfth of this month, whereas Shia Muslims believe him to have been born on the dawn of the seventeenth day. In the Ottoman Empire days, the name of this month in Ottoman Turkish was R√®bi' ul√®vv√®l, with the abbreviation Ra. In modern Turkish it is Rebi√ºlevvel. ŸáŸáŸáŸáŸá ÿ¨ Meaning The word \\"Rabi\\" means \\"spring\\" and Al-awwal means \\"the first\\" in Arabic language, so \\"Rabi' al-awwal\\" means \\"The first spring\\" in Arabic language. The name seems to have to do with the celebration events in the month as \\"spring\\" is the end to winter (symbol of sadness) and consequently the start of happiness. The Arabic calendar being lunar calendar, the month is naturally rotating over years and Rabƒ´‚Äò al-awwal can be in spring or any other season every now and then, so the meaning can not be related to the actual season.ŸéAl-Monjed dictionary and encyclopedia - the word Rabi' al-awwal Celebrations Indian Muslims with green flags for Mawlid Although historians and scholars disagree on the exact date of Muhammad's birth,What is the Authentic Date of Birth and Death of Prophet Muhammad? it is commonly celebrated on 12th or 17th of Rabi' al-awwal. The celebration of the Mawlid is done differently depending on the country. In some areas celebrations begin as early as the first of the month and can continue till the end of the month. Muslims generally put coloured lights on roads, streets, and their homes and put green flags as well to celebrate. In many countries a procession is also conducted on 12th or 17th of Rabi' al-awwal night and day. On these occasions sweets and drinks are also distributed widely from home to home and to the general public. In some areas Muslims also exchange gifts. It is the month of blessings. For the first time in 457 years, both the 12th Rabi' al-awwal and Christmas shared the same date on December 25, 2015. Timing The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal are as follows (based on the Umm Al-Qura calendar of Saudi ArabiaUmm Al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia): {class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:right\\" +Rabƒ´' al-Awwal dates between 2017 and 2022 - !scope=\\"col\\"AH !scope=\\"col\\"First day (CE/AD) !scope=\\"col\\"Last day (CE/AD) - !scope=\\"row\\"1439 19 November 2017 18 December 2017 - !scope=\\"row\\"1440 9 November 2018 7 December 2018 - !scope=\\"row\\"1441 29 October 2019 27 November 2019 - !scope=\\"row\\"1442 18 October 2020 15 November 2020 - !scope=\\"row\\"1443 7 October 2021 5 November 2021 - !scope=\\"row\\"1444 27 September 2022 25 October 2022 } Islamic events Masjid al-Quba, the first mosque, was built in this month. * 01 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal 897 AH, the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the final Muslim kingdom of al- Andalus * 08 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, death of Imam Hassan Al-Askari Twelver ImƒÅm, Hasan al-‚ÄòAskarƒ´ (see: Chup Tazia) * 09 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, Eid e shuja * 12 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, Sunni Muslims observe Mawlid in commemoration of Muhammad's birthday * 13 Rabi al-Awwal, Death of Bibi Rubab ( Beloved Wife of Imam Hussain) * 17 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, Shia celebrate the birthday of the ImƒÅm Ja‚Äòfar al-SƒÅdiq. * 18 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, birth of Umm Kulthum bint Ali * 26 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal, death of Abu Talib ibn Abdul Muttalib * 26 Rabƒ´‚Äò al-Awwal 1333 AH, death of Khwaja Sirajuddin Naqshbandi, a Naqshbandi Sufi shaykh Other events: * The Hijra (migration) took place in this month * Eid-e-Zahra (a.k.a.

The statue was created as a celebration of the First Battle of the Marne, when the German army was stopped before capturing Paris in August 1914. A 4.9m high example of work has been displayed at Henly's Corner, at the bottom of Regents Park Road at the southern edge of Finchley in north London, now in the London Borough of Barnet, since 1927. Another example has been located in the French city of Nantes since 1927. Statue The statue was created by Guillaume in 1914, originally called La Victoire. It depicts a naked female figure standing on tip-toe with both feet on a bronze hemisphere. She lifts her face to the sky and holds both arms aloft, with a sword in her right hand. Finchley statue In 1920 Guillaume exhibited his statue at the Paris Salon, where it won the Hors Concours Medal. It was bought by Lord Rothermere, who presented the statue to the Urban District of Finchley. However Finchley Council needed a war memorial to commemorate the First World War, and intended placing the new statue at the main entrance of Finchley's recreation ground, Victoria Park. Lord Rothermere, incensed by this, informed Finchley that the statue was to be placed at its present location, so that he might see it when driving to see his mother, who lived at Totteridge, or the council could not have it at all. The statue was mounted on a granite plinth and was unveiled on 20 October 1927 in front of a crowd, believed to have been around 8,000 people, by the former Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.Photo of Lloyd George speaking at the unveiling The statue has had a number of local names including \\"Dirty Gertie\\", \\"The Wicked Woman\\", (due to corrosion before a restoration in 1938) \\"Gangrene Gertie\\" and (most popular ‚Äì to the exclusion of its real name) \\"The Naked Lady\\".Finchley local government website The statue became a Grade II listed building in April 1983, upgraded to Grade II* in February 2016.La Delivrance, War Memorial Statue, Historic England An information panel was placed in front of the statue by the Finchley Society in September 2007.

Zakouma is the nation's oldest national park, declared a national park in 1963 by presidential decree, giving it the highest form of protection available under the nation's laws. It has been managed by the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks since 2010 in partnership with Chad's government.  History  Zakouma is Chad's oldest national park, Note: Slides 1‚Äì7; 9‚Äì11. established by the nation's government in 1963. Its wildlife have been threatened by the ivory trade and poaching, including by Janjaweed members. In 2007, militia forces attacked the park's headquarters for its stockpile of 1.5 tons of ivory, and killed three rangers. The government of Chad began working with African Parks in 2010 to help manage and protect the park and its wildlife, especially elephants. The park's anti-poaching strategy includes equipping approximately 60 rangers with GPS tracking units and radios to improve communications, mobility, and safety, as well as improving mobility through the use of horses and other vehicles. The European Union pledged ‚Ç¨6.9m in 2011 to help protect the park for five years. Elephant protection efforts expanded outside the park's boundaries in 2012, and an airstrip was constructed in Heban to make monitoring of the migrating animals easier. In August, Heban rangers destroyed a camp belonging to members of the Sudanese army after four elephants were killed. Three weeks later, the poachers attacked the Zakouma outpost at Heban and shot and killed multiple guards. Following the attack, additional bases were built, a second aircraft was purchased, and a rapid response team called the \\"Mambas\\" (after the snake of the same name) was formed to enhance security. 23 guards have died protecting Zakouma since 1998, including seven in 2007, four between 2008 and 2010, and six in 2012. Chadians celebrated the park's fiftieth anniversary in February 2014. Zakouma held a ceremony to commemorate the occasion, which was attended by President Idriss D√©by and included a ceremonial destruction of ivory by burning a pyre with a ton elephant tusks to discourage poaching. African Parks and the Labuschagnes, who served as the park's managers from 2011‚Äì2017, have been credited with reducing poaching and increasing Zakouma's elephant population. African Parks took over management of ecologically valuable lands surrounding Zakouma, including the Siniaka-Minia Faunal Reserve and Bahr Salamat Faunal Reserve, in 2017.  Flora and Fauna  Zakouma National Park is part of the Sudano-Sahelian vegetation zone, and has shrubland, high grasses, and Acacia forests. Plants recorded in the park include Combretaceae and Vachellia seyal (red acacia). A variety of large mammals have been recorded in Zakouma, such as buffalo, elephant, Kordofan giraffe, hartebeest, leopard, and lion. In 2016, The Independent said there were increases to the park's buffalo, giraffe, and lion populations in recent years. The Times reported the presence of thousands of buffalo, more than 130 lions, and an \\"unknown\\" number of leopards, as well as plans to reintroduce black rhinoceros. A pack of nine African wild dogs were photographed in the southwest portion of this Zakouma National Park in Chad in November 2015. https://www.facebook.com/ZakoumaNationalPark/posts/african-wild-dogs-spotted- to-the-south-west-of-zakouma-this-is-the-first-time- we/1005665132809119/https://www.facebook.com/pg/AfricanParks/photos/?tab=album&album;_id=678372425632099 During a study of the park's terrestrial small mammals, nine rodent and two shrew species were recorded. Rodents included the African grass rat, Congo gerbil, Guinea multimammate mouse, Heuglin's striped grass mouse, Johan's spiny mouse, Kemp's gerbil, Matthey's mouse, striped ground squirrel (Xerus erythropus), and Verheyen's multimammate mouse. The shrew species reported in the study were the savanna shrew and another belonging to the genus Suncus. Birds include ostriches, cranes, eagles, egrets, herons, ibis, pelicans, and storks. Specific species include Abyssinian ground hornbills, black-breasted barbets, northern carmine bee-eaters, and red-billed queleas. =Elephants= The park's elephant population experienced significant declines during the 2000s, though reported size estimates have varied. According to National Geographic and Tech Times, Zakouma had more than 4,000 elephants in 2002, but fewer than 900 in 2005, and approximately 400‚Äì450 by 2010. China Daily said there were 3,885 and 3,020 elephants in the park in 2005 and 2006, respectively; similarly, Hindustan Times reported a population estimate of 3,500 in early 2006. The Independent reported a similar figure for 2010, following a major decline from 4,000 elephants in 2006. CNN, The New York Times, and The Times have said there were an estimated 4,300‚Äì4,350 elephants in Zakouma in 2002, and approximately 450 elephants in the park between late 2012 and April 2015. Zakouma's elephants were surveyed in 2014 as part of the Great Elephant Census. Following the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks assumption of management in 2010, and its extensive law enforcement and community engagement efforts, poaching dramatically declined and the herd has since stabilized, and has started to breed again. The park now has more than 500 elephants, as of February 2017, possibly the largest single herd in Africa. More than 100 elephants were killed in 2006. Seven elephants were reportedly killed in 2007, marking a decrease compared to previous years because of improved efforts to protect Zakouma and its wildlife. Sixty elephants were reportedly killed by Sudanese poachers in early 2010, prior to African Parks' involvement. In 2015, CNN said there were no elephants poached in the park since late 2011, and no ivory removed from Zakouma in the last five years. There were zero to very few known elephant births between 2010 and 2013 because of environmental stresses, but approximately 50 calf births in 2014 and 2015, and an additional 70 in 2016. According to The Independent, there were 23 calves born in 2013, plus another 20 in 2015. Similarly, CNN reported in April 2015 that more than 40 calves were born since late 2013. There were reportedly no elephant poaching incidents between 2016 and February 2017. =Black rhinoceros= The park's last black rhinoceros were seen in 1972. During 2015‚Äì2016, African Parks initiated plans to reintroduce black rhinos to the park. Following the signature of a memorandum of understanding between the governments of Chad and South Africa in 2017, six black rhinos were provided by the latter nation's Department of Environmental Affairs to Zakouma under a custodianship agreement. Tourism In 2016, more than 5,000 locals stayed at the park's camps. Tinga Lodge, constructed by the government, opened in 1968 and houses up to 48 people. Camp Nomade, a mobile safari camp, opened in 2016.

It currently trades as an equestrian and pet store. It is located in Regents Park Road, close to Henlys Corner on the North Circular Road. It has two residential roads running alongside it; Allandale Avenue and Fitzalan Road.  History  In 1868 George Barham, founder of Express Dairies, leased Sheephouse Farm, a property of about . In 1882/83 he had it rebuilt by Fredrick Chancellor as a model dairy farm, renaming it College Farm after the nearby Christ's College. In 1898 College Farm was the scene of the \\"Finchley Murder\\", when the head cowman Thomas Webb was shot dead. The case was investigated by Scotland Yard's Chief Inspector Henry Moore, but Thomas's killer was never identified. By the 1900s the company believed that the farm was not viable as a real farm, so it was decided to adapt it to become a visitor attraction in 1909, buying out the lease on the property of the farm buildings, and retaining a few of the adjacent fields from the original estate. By the 1930s the residue of the farm was surrounded by houses, and was open to the public, with tea rooms and an exhibition of objects related to the dairy industry. In the 1950s and 1960s cows were grazed and milked on the site by Express Dairies. In 1973 Express Dairies left the site, and the dairy museum was broken up. In 1974 the Department of the Environment purchased the estate with the intention of giving it to the London Borough of Barnet in exchange for open land at Henlys Corner intended for a flyover, which was never built. The farm was leased by Chris and Jane Ower, who ran it as a popular local attraction from 1980 until February 2001, when the site had to be closed because of restrictions caused by the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Chris Ower, with the support of some local residents and friends of the farm, set up the College Farm Trust in 2004 with the intention of re- establishing the farm as a visitor centre. The Trust now owns the whole site and is working to raise the funds to reopen to the public. College Farm is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation.

On his death in 1918 Stephens bequeathed the estate in his will to \\"the Urban District Council of Finchley, subject to the condition that the same shall be open for the use and enjoyment always of the public under such reasonable regulations as may be made by the said Council from time to time for the care and upkeep thereofWill of Henry Charles Stephens,Clause 14, dated 4 July 1918...\\" and ownership passed to Finchley Urban District Council; its freehold is now owned by a registered Charity, 'The Avenue House Estate' Charity number 210345, of which the principal trustee is the London Borough of Barnet. The house and ten acres of grounds have been leased to the Avenue House Estate Trust, registered charity 1093908, for a period of 125 years from 2002. It is also home to the Finchley Society and their archive. Since January 2014 the estate and its commercial activities have been promoted as Stephens House and Gardens. The Stephens Collection Avenue House's visitors centre is home to The Stephens Collection, a small display and archive of material relating to the Stephens Ink company and Stephens family and relevant local history; admission is free. The Bothy The Bothy in 2007 before restoration The Bothy was built as a large walled garden in the shape of a small rectangular castle sometime in the late 1870s. It is one of the earliest non- Roman concrete structures in England. A project to restore the Bothy structure and turn it into an arts centre and garden began in 1997 by the Finchley Arts Centre Trust (FACT). This was funded by local people, with money raised matched by the Heritage Lottery Fund and totalling ¬£418,000. The project was allegedly within weeks of completion in 2007 when an acrimonious dispute between Finchley Arts Centre Trust and Avenue House Estate Trust (AHET) broke out which prevented the building being opened to public use. Subsequently it remained closed for about a decade.Bothy dispute: Bill Tyler speaks By Daphne Chamberlain, The Archer , August 2007, Accessed Jan 2012 FACT was evicted and subsequently disbanded. AHET subsequently leased the Bothy to psychotherapy charity Terapia, which has converted it as a training centre, which opened partially in October 2017. The cost of completing the overhaul was some ¬£2,000,000, which Terapia funded by a further HLF grant, and a large charitable donation. Terapia now sub-lets the Bothy from AHET on a 75-year lease. The Bothy's walled garden is separately maintained by volunteers and has remained open to visitors every Friday and on the first Sunday of the month. In summer there are occasional arts events and play readings. The Gardens The grounds of the estate, originally called the Avenue House Estate, but now trading as Stephens House and Gardens, were developed as a public park during the twentieth century. They cover ten acres and include a number of rare and unusual trees and shrubs. Amenities include a children's playground, a pond, a walled garden within a structure known as The Bothy, and a caf√©. In 2011, AHET approached the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery about the possibility of seeking grant aid to restore the gardens under their joint 'Parks for People' programme. After preliminary approval late in 2011, a Phase 1 application in the summer of 2012 was not successful, but a further application submitted early in 2013 resulted in a grant of just over ¬£200,000 to enable AHET to develop a full scheme towards the restoration. AHET submitted a Phase 2 application in early 2014, and in July of that year was awarded a grant of ¬£2.1 million towards the ¬£3.1 million scheme. The scheme included work to improve the catering and play area, provide a new education centre and accommodation for volunteers and gardens staff, as well as restoring the gardens back towards their original condition. Work started in the spring of 2015 and was substantially completed by late 2017. The remaining funding came from the London Borough of Barnet, AHET itself (both in a financial contribution and by means of voluntary labour), and support from various individuals and other Trusts, notably several Livery Companies. In the arboretum, diseased and damaged trees have been removed and a programme of replanting is underway. The pond has been cleaned and rejuvenated; new drainage systems have improved water management. The children's playground has been improved and enlarged and the old stable and garage blocks have been modernised to contain a visitor centre, public toilets and a cafe. The Stephens Collection's museum and artefacts are now located in the visitor centre. Spike Milligan Statue Spike Milligan lived locally for many years up to his death in 2002. He was the first President of the Finchley Society. For a decade after his death the Society, led by Barbara Warren, raised funds - the Spike Milligan Statue Fund - to commission a statue of Spike. This was cast in bronze to a design of local sculptor John Somerville and erected by the stables block in the grounds of Avenue House. The statue of Spike sitting on a bench was unveiled on 4 September 2014 at a ceremony attended by a number of local dignitaries and showbusiness celebrities including Roy Hudd, Michael Parkinson, Maureen Lipman, Terry Gilliam, Kathy Lette, Denis Norden and Lynsey de Paul. History of the House Avenue House Grounds The first house on the site was built in 1859 by the Rev. Edward Cooper, a relative of the Allen family (Lords of the manor of Finchley) who had owned the land since the 1730s. The house takes its name from The Avenue which runs behind the house, and was originally the route between Bibbesworth manor and the church of St Mary‚Äôs Finchley. In 1874 the house was bought by the famous ink manufacturer Henry Charles Stephens. During Stephens' time in the house he purchased the adjoining ten-acre Temple Croft Field and the gardens were laid out, to designs by Robert Marnock. Stephens added a collection of rare trees which were included in the planting and form the basis of today's arboretum. The house and grounds were left to Finchley Urban District Council by Stephens in his will in 1918, with a condition that they be always open for the use and enjoyment of the public, subject to reasonable regulation. However, the Estate was used between 1919 and 1925 by the RAF as a military hospital before the grounds were opened to the public on 3 May 1928. In 1933 the House was the location for the presenting of a charter by which the UDC became a Borough. The house was used for many years as a public library and as the offices of Finchley Borough Council after Council Offices in nearby Hendon Lane were destroyed by enemy action in the Second World War. The basement was used as an air-raid shelter. In 1989 the east wing of the house was gutted by fire, but has been restored to its former condition. The house is now a meetings and events venue, while the gardens and arboretum remain open to the public free of charge. The house and gardens are now managed by an independent charitable body, the Avenue House Estate Trust which leased the Estate for 125 years in 2002. Hertford Lodge, also a Grade II listed building and adjacent to Avenue House, was built in the 1860s. It was a girls' school for many years before becoming Finchley council offices. In 2001 the owners (London Borough of Barnet) decided to sell the building. Late in 2004 it was damaged by fire but was refurbished and redeveloped (2006-7) into private luxury flats and apartments.

His most commercially successful releases were \\"Goodgroove\\" and \\"Bad Young Brother\\" in 1988.  Biography  Born in Hammersmith, London, to Trinidadian nurse Jenny Boland, he was raised in Woodford. When he was fifteen years old, he began DJing in a mobile unit around London, before joining local pirate radio stations such as Kiss FM and LWR and finally starting his own station, WBLS (not to be confused with the radio station of the same name in New York). He joined Simon Harris' Music of Life record label, as the closest thing they had to an A&R; man. When a planned compilation of US hip hop called Def Beats 1 (Music of Life, 1986) ran short of tracks, Boland stepped in to record a track called \\"Rock the Beat\\". He co-produced the track with Harris, rapped on it under the pseudonym EZQ, and also did his own deejaying under the name \\"Derek B\\". \\"Rock the Beat\\" (Music of Life, 1987) was released as a single, and was followed by three more - the most successful of which were \\"Goodgroove\\" (Music of Life, 1988), and \\"Bad Young Brother\\", both of which reached No. 16 in the UK Singles Chart. Derek B's third and final UK chart entry was \\"We've Got The Juice\\", which peaked at No. 56. Derek B was the first UK rapper to achieve pop success, appearing on BBC Television's Top of the Pops at a time when the only other rappers who had appeared were Break Machine and Doug E. Fresh. He received criticism for rapping under an assumed American accent, something which was popular in the early days of British hip-hop, but later abandoned by some artists. Following his chart success, Derek B was signed up to Rush Artist Management and released singles and the album, Bullet From a Gun (Tuff Audio, 1988). Derek B was also successful as a record producer and remixer, working with the Cookie Crew, Thrashpack, and Eric B and Rakim. In 1988, he also helped to write the Liverpool F.C. anthem, \\"Anfield Rap\\". He died of a heart attack in London on 15 November 2009, aged 44.

In 2010 it was considered \\"critically endangered\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, as there were fewer than 100 registered breeding females in the United Kingdom,Bagot goat at Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list . Retrieved 7 June 2010. but by 2012 had been upgraded to \\"vulnerable\\",Bagot goat at Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list . Retrieved 13 November 2012. where it remains as of 2019, with 200-300 breeding females known. Bagots are excellent, attentive mothers, well capable of defending their kids. They generally produce a single kid (in common with many native breeds) and seldom require intervention during the birthing process. Animals maintained domestically and maintained in higher condition than they would naturally manage, often produce twins. There have been two recorded instances of triplets, one in 1994 (Undercliff Faith, Hope and Charity) and another in 2017.  Description  It is a small goat, with a black head and neck to the withers/girth and the remainder of the body predominantly white. It may sport a white \\"star\\", \\"stripe\\" or blaze on its face, with a narrow chin stripe sometimes extending the length of the neck to the brisket. The white areas frequently sport isolated black dots, with sometimes the black extending as a \\"saddle\\" along the back. The head is delicate with either a straight or slightly dished face, often appearing triangular when viewed from the front due to wide forehead and narrow muzzle. On females, the horns tend to be straight or slightly rearward curving from the centre of the forehead. On males the horns are wider set and form large sweeping curves over the back. Unlike domesticated breeds that have been \\"improved\\" to have a leg in each corner, they are naturally \\"cow-hocked\\", which is typical of wild goats and ibex; being an advantage on rough terrain. Their top and belly lines tend to be roughly parallel in mature animals (unlike the Swiss breed milking goats which tend to have a triangular appearance), with young (particularly bucks) often appearing triangular in reverse of the milking breeds, in other words deep chested and narrow at the waist. There are also variants on the pure black/white patterning, believed to be the result of recessive genes including: * The \\"Red cheek\\" Bagot - which sports red/gold \\"blusher\\" on the cheeks but not through the coat. * The \\"Mahogany\\" Bagot - which sports gold \\"frosting\\" on the outer ears and neck, and sports \\"eyeliner\\", \\"lipstick\\" and \\"blusher\\" again in gold; the coat, whilst black from a distance has a distinct reddish tinge in bright light. * The \\"Lightbelly\\" Bagot - sports dark along the back and muzzle but white eye flashes, throat through to neck, inner ears, underbelly brisket through to perineum, inside and back of lower legs. * The \\"Eyebar\\" Bagot - sports white inner ears, a jowl spot, muzzle, face stripes extending into muzzle, throat patch that does not extend to the neck, underbelly from girth through to perineum, inner and lower legs, * The \\"Lateral Stripes\\" Bagot - Tan/white patterning to the upper legs and front of lower legs (but not inside of legs), brisket to girth, inner ears, \\"lipstick\\" and \\"eyeliner\\". These markings can be identified from historic photos of Bagots at Blithfield Hall. Whilst some breeders actively attempt to breed goats more closely resembling the Valais Blackneck and actively cull animals they consider poorly marked, the Bagot Goat Society promotes the diversity of markings as critical to maintaining the genetic diversity of the species as a whole. For that reason, Bagots are not judged based on markings, but rather on conformation.  History  Barons Bagot, featuring the Bagot goat Bagot goats were introduced to England at Blithfield Hall in the 1380s. They were probably brought back to England by returning Crusaders, and probably trace their ancestry to goats of the Rhone valley. The goats were said to have been given to John Bagot of Blithfield by King Richard II of England to commemorate good hunting the King had enjoyed at Blithfield. Whilst romantic notions on the foreign origins of the Bagot were widely promoted as true, scientific research, including DNA profilingAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE OLD BRITISH GOAT BY MEANS OF A DNA STUDY,THIS BEING IN PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE OLD IRISH GOAT RAYMOND WERNER, JANUARY, 2015 has disproved any link between the Bagot and the Valais Blacknecks, but rather identified that they originated from isolation of a population of native goats within what is now referred as the \\"Old English\\" type.Werner, R., 1978. The Origin of the Bagot Goat. Researched for the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , there were said to be less than 200 registered breeding females. By May 2018, the Rare Breed Survival Trust Watchlist reported between 200-300 registered breeding females.  Uses  Bagot goats have no commercial purpose being too small by comparison to the Boer Goat to be viable as a meat breed; producing high quality but low volumes of milk (consistent with generally producing a single kid) by comparison to the Swiss dairy breeds, and producing too little cashmere to compete with the Angora.

She was also a losing finalist to Bertha Townsend the next year. Early life and tennis Hansell was born on September 18, 1869 in Philadelphia, the daughter of Samuel Rob Hansell, an upholstery manufacturer, and Jane Martin. She battled anemia as a child and started playing tennis on advice of her doctor. She joined the Belmont Club in Philadelphia when she was 16 where she played, among others, with Margarette Ballard and Bertha Townsend. U.S. Women's National Singles Championship  In 1887 Hansell took part in the inaugural U.S. Women's National Singles Championship. The event was played on the outdoor grass courts of the Philadelphia Cricket Club and started on 27 September. She was one seven contestants who all came from the greater Delaware Valley area. Hansell, playing in a full over-draped skirt with long sleeves and her customary red hat, won her opening round against Jessie Harding for the loss of just one game. In the semifinal she lost the first set against Helen Day Harris but won the match in three sets. The final against Laura Knight was a one-sided affair which Hansell won in straight sets to become the first U.S. women's champion. According to a report she \\"employed sidearm serves, sliced ground strokes and never, but never went to the net\\". The tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year's final in which she would play the winner of the all-comers tournament. This meant that Hansell did not have to play through the 1888 tournament and only had to play the challenge round. She played Bertha Townsend who had won the all-comer's event against Marion Wright in the final, and Townsend won the match in straight sets. Hansell did not win another tournament and retired from the game in 1890. She married Taylor Allerdice and the couple had six children. Hansell was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1965.

The game is played from a first-person perspective and is set on a world whose sun has failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in caverns. The game's mechanics include the use of mouse gestures to cast spells. Arx Fatalis received mostly positive reviews from critics but was not commercially successful. On 14 January 2011, Arkane Studios released a 1.21 patch and the game's source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), though the game assets remain proprietary.  Plot  Arx Fatalis (Latin for \\"fatal fortress\\") is set on a world whose sun has failed, forcing the above- ground creatures to take refuge in subterranean caverns. The action in Arx Fatalis takes place in one of these large caves, where the members of various races, such as Trolls, Goblins, Dwarves, Humans, etc., have made their homes on various levels of the cave. The player awakens inside a prison cell and, after making his escape, eventually discovers his mission is to subvert and imprison the God of Destruction, Akbaa, who is trying to manifest itself in Arx.  Gameplay  Arx Fatalis features somewhat open-ended gameplay, allowing the player to allocate skill points for their character type in skills such as spellcasting, weapons and armour, stealth, and so on. There are several side quests that can be undertaken. A simple crafting system involves enchanting ammunition and weapons, or creating items, such as a fishing rod (fishing pole and rope), keyrings (key and ring), or pies (dough and rolling pin, optional apple and optional bottle of wine). Raw food can be cooked, like rounds of bread, chicken drumsticks, or pies. The main plot line is non-linear with the player collecting the various items to forge a sword required to defeat Akbaa in a final showdown. Additional goals come up such as dealing with the rebels of Arx, the snake women and The King of Arx. The player can resolve the conflict between them all and experience several different endings to the conflict with different consequences somewhat affecting the story. There is no dialogue system in Arx Fatalis. Rather, the player makes choices through actions which lead to different consequences. There are also multiple ways to finish quests and the player can progress through the game in several different ways. For example, the player can use force to kill enemies and break down doors, or they can use stealth and avoid enemies. One of the intuitive interfaces in Arx Fatalis is the spellcasting system. Using the mouse and the control key, runes are drawn in mid-air with mouse gestures, which must be correctly drawn in order to successfully cast a spell. The player can find or buy different runes as gameplay progresses, combinations of which unlock new spells. This gestural interface was simplified in the Xbox version to account for the limitations of the joypad. Each direction of the directional pad corresponds to a different mouse direction and different combinations of directions are entered with the directional pad to draw runes and correspondingly cast spells. A queue of up to three spells can be cast in advance, ready to be activated at the press of a button. There is also an instant magic mode that allows the player to simply select the desired spell they want to cast from a list of learned spells during gameplay. In addition, Arx Fatalis supports a stealth mode that is active when a stealth icon is visible on the interface. In stealth mode, usually when a player is in dark or shadowy areas, non-player characters cannot see them.  Development  The design of Arx Fatalis was influenced by games from the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, especially Ultima Underworld. Arkane Studios have stated that Arx Fatalis was intended to be Ultima Underworld III; however, while Rapha√´l Colantonio had support from Paul Neurath, one of the original developers of Ultima Underworld, Electronic Arts, who owned the rights, would not allow Arkane to make a sequel with their intellectual property unless he accepted some of their provisions. Colantonio refused to accept this and instead had Arkane set out on the game in the spirit of Ultima Underworld. Colantonio had difficulty in getting a publisher; with finances nearly exhausted, they had signed one small publisher who had gone bankrupt within the month, but later secured JoWooD Productions for publication, eventually releasing in 2002. Arx Fatalis was released for Microsoft Windows in 2002 and for the Xbox in 2003. In April 2007, Arx Fatalis was released on the digital distribution platform Steam, followed by GOG.com in December 2008. On 14 January 2011, Arkane Studios released a 1.21 patch and the game's source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Based upon this source code the formed Arx Libertatis-project tries to fix bugs and incompatibilities and port the game to operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD and the OpenPandora handheld. Latest iteration of Arx Libertatis is 1.1 released in July 2013. Also, several fan-made translations of the game were created, e.g. to Polish, Turkish and Korean.Arx Fatalis (plprojekt)Arx Fatalis T√ºrk√ße yama  Reception  While the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure. The PC version of Arx Fatalis received \\"generally favourable reviews\\", while the Xbox version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Arx Fatalis was released after the more successful fantasy role-playing games The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and Neverwinter Nights, with reviewers stating that although it is not as open as Morrowind, it will appeal to fans that like dungeon-crawler RPGs, paying homage to games like Ultima: Underworld. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin was pleased with the experience that the PC version offered, stating that \\"Arx Fatalis is entertaining and great looking, and it should especially appeal to fans of other atmospheric first-person games, including Thief: The Dark Project, System Shock 2, and Deus Ex, let alone this year's Morrowind. Though marred by some technical issues (many of which have already been addressed by patches) and at times confusing to navigate in, Arx Fatalis nevertheless delivers a memorable, original role-playing experience\\", and IGN's Dan Adams enjoyed the same PC version, stating that \\"The atmosphere, spell system, puzzles, voices, and story were good and interesting enough to give me a pretty enjoyable experience.\\" Arx Fatalis was nominated as 2002's best computer role-playing game by Computer Gaming World, GameSpot and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. It was also a runner-up for RPG Vault's \\"Surprise of the Year\\" and \\"Debut Game of the Year\\" awards, and for GameSpot's \\"Best Sound\\" and the Game Developers Choice Awards' \\"Rookie Studio of the Year\\" prizes. It won RPG Vault's award for sound design that year. The editors of Computer Gaming World wrote that Arx Fatalis \\"has hands-down the most annoying interface of the year, but fortunately, it also sports sharp graphics [...] and a great story\\".  Legacy  Arx Fatalis critical praise gave Arkane the opportunity to work with Valve to develop a new title on their Source engine, and Colantonio opted to make a sequel, Arx Fatalis 2. However, the poor sales of the first game made it difficult to find a publisher. Arkane was eventually approached by Ubisoft and asked to apply the Arx Fatalis game engine to their Might and Magic. This became Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, released in October 2006. It refined the first-person melee combat of Arx Fatalis with a lesser emphasis on role-playing elements. During this time, Colantonio moved from France to Austin, Texas, leaving the main studio in the hands of his colleagues while he set up Arkane Austin in June 2006. Colantonio left the studio in 2017 to concentrate on smaller projects. To celebrate Arkane Studios' 20th anniversary, the game was made available for free on PC from 28‚Äì31 May 2020.

They have a total of eleven released albums including their debut, Taste, released in 1989. History Their debut release was a split flexi disc with Loop on the Cheree label in 1988, which was given away with the Sowing Seeds fanzine. There followed their debut single, \\"Kick the Wall\\", and \\"7th# Disaster\\" also on Cheree Records. They moved to the American What Goes On Records and released their debut album Taste and \\"The Perfect Needle\\" single which is perhaps their most famous song. A live album appeared on Fierce Records and following What Goes On‚Äôs bankruptcy they signed to Creation Records. In contrast to Taste's noise-rock, a more laid back sound followed, described by journalist Alexis Petridis as having \\"an almost fragile sense of elegance and melody\\",Petridis, Alex (1991) \\"Set The Controls For The Heart of The Fun\\" (Telescopes feature), Lime Lizard, August 1991, and the band scraped the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart with the single \\"Flying\\", and released The Telescopes, their second album, in 1992. Lawrie explained the change in direction: \\"Your idea of perfection changes as you move on. I think we still hold the same approach to our music now, we still try just as many mad ideas, it's just a lot more subtle and works to a different end\\". In 2002 they made a surprise return with Third Wave on Double Agent Records. In 2005 they released their fourth album #4 on their own Antenna Records. By this time they were a much more experimental band specialising in electronic soundscapes. In July 2011, the band were invited by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror at Alexandra Palace in London, where they performed songs from their debut album.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. Carney is also an associate professor of political science at Penn State Worthington Scranton, where he has taught since 1992. In 2011, he was appointed as director of homeland security and policy strategy for BAE Systems.National Journal (2011). Former Lawmaker Lands Defense Contracting Job . Retrieved August 20, 2011. Early life, education and career Carney grew up in Coggon, Iowa, and earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, received his masters from the University of Wyoming, and completed his Ph.D in political science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Carney has been an associate professor of political science at Penn State Worthington Scranton since 1992. From 2002 to 2004, Carney served as a counterterrorism analyst for the Bush administration, under Douglas Feith in the Office of Special Plans and at the Defense Intelligence Agency, researching links between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Military service A Commander (select) in the United States Naval Reserve, Carney served multiple tours overseas and was activated for operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle. He was direct commissioned as an Ensign in 1995. He served as Senior Terrorism and Intelligence Advisor at the Pentagon. He is the recipient of the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, three Joint Service Achievement Medals, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. His awards also include the Naval Rifle Marksman ribbon and the Naval Pistol Expert Medal. In September 2007, Congressman Carney went on active duty with the Navy for his two weeks of service as a Lt. Commander in the reserves. On active duty, Carney worked on the \\"Predator\\" project near Norfolk, VA. In July 2008, Carney was promoted from Lieutenant Commander to Commander (select) in the Naval Reserve. He was one of just two members of the House to serve in the military reserves. During his unsuccessful 2010 re-election campaign Carney revealed that he had served as an interrogator at Guantanamo. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, wrote that although Carney had traveled with fellow Congressional Representatives on fact-finding trips to Guantanamo, he had never informed them that he himself had served there.

Political positionsSocial Security= While opposing proposals to privatize Social Security, he said he is open to the idea of adding private accounts in addition to (not at the expense of) traditional defined benefits. =Research= He supports federal investment in stem cell research, and is an advocate of universal healthcare. =Gun Rights= He supports gun rights. =Education= In 2009, Carney voted for H.R 2187, the 21st Century Green Schools Act, to make grants to states for the modernization, renovation, or repair of public schools, including early learning facilities and charter schools, to make them safe, healthy, high-performing, and technologically up-to-date. =War in Iraq= Carney made change of direction in Iraq policy a cornerstone of his 2006 campaign, often decrying the Bush Administration's war policies. He voted to reauthorize funding for military action in Iraq with H.R. 2206. In 2007, he voted against H.R. 2956, which would have required the removal of all US personnel from Iraq within only 120 days. He stated that since the US was already at war in Iraq, the top priority should be winning the war. =2008 Financial Crisis= Carney voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. =Health Care= Congressman Carney also voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act as well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Political campaigns2006= When Carney entered the race for the 10th, he was initially considered an underdog against Republican incumbent Don Sherwood. The 10th had been in Republican hands since 1961. The four-term incumbent had barely defeated Democrat Patrick Casey in his bid to succeed popular 36-year incumbent Joe McDade in 1998, and narrowly defeated Casey in a 2000 rematch. In hopes of protecting Sherwood, the Republican-controlled state legislature made the 10th significantly more rural and Republican after the 2000 census, and the Democrats hadn't even put up a candidate in the last two elections. However, revelations of Sherwood's five-year-long extramarital affair with a woman more than 30 years his junior, along with allegations of abuse, severely hampered Sherwood's reelection chances in the 10th, which has a strong social conservative tint. Carney also garnered the endorsement of 30 labor unions. In the election, Carney defeated Sherwood, 53% to 47%. During the campaign, Carney raised money with a wide-variety of supporters including Sen. Barack Obama, Sen Joe Biden, Rep. Jay Inslee, Rep. Jack Murtha, and Richard Perle, former Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee Douglas Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, congratulated Carney on Election Night. =2008= Carney faced Republican staffing executive Chris Hackett in his bid for a second term. On paper, Carney was one of the few incumbent Democrats to be rated vulnerable in this election cycle, because he was a freshman running in a strongly Republican district (its Cook Partisan Voting Index was R+8). The National Republican Congressional Committee advertised for Hackett, while the Service Employees International Union and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee‚Äîwhich were among those organizations identifying Carney as especially vulnerable‚Äîadvertised on his behalf, placing special emphasis on his vote for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $7.25 by 2009, a measure passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Bush on May 24, 2007. Since the summer of 2007, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and a number of other political analysts listed Carney's District as \\"slightly\\" leaning Democratic in 2008, and according to the FEC Carney has raised over $500,000 towards his re-election in the first six months of 2007. Public opinion polls conducted in January 2008 indicated a lead over Hackett (then a candidate in the GOP primary), by significant double-digit margins and even a majority of registered Republicans, 53 percent, approve of Carney's job performance. The candidates differed over Social Security. Carney opposed Bush's plan for privatization, while Hackett supported it. In the April 22 Pennsylvania primaries, enormous Democratic voter turnout, most certainly due to the presidential race, led Carney to earn over 70,000 votes in the congressional primary, despite running unopposed‚Äîmore than the combined vote in the Republican primary. Chris Carney was a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. He vowed that he would \\"wait and see how his district votes\\", hinting that he would likely issue an endorsement after the April 22 Pennsylvania primary for the candidate that wins by a \\"landslide\\"‚Äîif a huge victory by either occurs‚Äîin his overwhelmingly conservative district in which registered Democrats are few compared to Republicans. Another northeastern Pennsylvania Congressman, Paul Kanjorski, had long endorsed and actively campaigned for Clinton, alongside a number of other Democratic politicians in the state, including Governor Ed Rendell, while U.S. Senator Bob Casey, Jr. was Obama's most significant supporter. Carney endorsed Clinton on May 9 after she carried his district in the Democratic primary by a whopping 70%-30% margin. On November 4, 2008, Carney defeated Chris Hackett 56% to 44%. =2010= Carney was challenged by Republican nominee and former U. S. Attorney Tom Marino. In the 2010 election, Marino defeated Carney, 55‚Äì45%. Proving just how Republican this district still was, the Democrats have not crossed the 40 percent mark in the district, since renumbered as the 12th District, since Carney left office. Indeed, Carney is the only Democrat to cross the 40 percent mark since Scranton was drawn out of the district after the 2000 census.

Cahill, from an 1892 publication. Mabel Esmonde Cahill (2 April 1863 ‚Äì 1 January 1905) was an Irish female tennis player, active in the late 19th century, and was the first foreign woman to win a major tennis tournament when she won the 1891 US National Championships. Early life and family Mabel Cahill was born on 2 April 1863 in the family home of Ballyragget House, Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, the twelfth child of thirteen born into her family. She had 5 sisters and 7 brothers. Being part of this society resulted in having social events held by the upper class. In this case, tennis parties. During this time, it was quite uncommon for women to obtain a secondary level school degree however it has been recorded that Mabel attended Roscrea School with two of her brothers, a fee paying school. There is strong evidence to suggest that Mabel and two of her sisters enrolled in Sacred Heart Convent Secondary School. After school, Mabel moved from her family town of Ballyraggett to the city of Dublin in the year of 1886. At this point she then took part in a club that played lawn tennis which would then spark her love for the sport. Three years after moving to Dublin, Mabel then decided to emigrate to America via the ship, The Arizona which departed from Liverpool and landed in the USA where she took up residency in New York City at the age of 29. Career Cahill won the Orange Club ladies championship in 1890 and 1891. Cahill became the first foreign woman to win a major tournament when she defeated Ellen Roosevelt in the 1891 US Championships women's final at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. She successfully defended her women's singles title in 1892 and also won the women's doubles title with Adeline McKinlay and the mixed doubles title with Clarence Hobart. She did not defend her titles in 1893.

She wrote a romantic novel called Her Playthings: Men which was published in 1891 but it was not successful. She tried to write shorter stories, Carved in marble and Purple Sparkling but they too were not well received. In 1893 she contributed two articles to the Ladies Home Journal named The art of playing good tennis and Arranging a tennis tournament, respectively. She died on 1 January 1905 in Ireland. After her death, in 1936, the Irish Lawn Tennis Association placed an advert in the national press asking that a representative of hers could come forward to collect a gold medallion struck to honour her achievements in tennis in America. It is not known if the medallion was collected. In 1976, Cahill was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, where she is the only Irish representative.

Mission VMFA-211 is an F-35B Lightning II squadron assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 13, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. Its mission is to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft under all weather conditions and attack and destroy surface targets in support of Marine expeditionary forces. HistoryEarly history= Grumman F3Fs of VMF-2 VMFA-211 can trace its lineage to 1 January 1937 when Marine Fighting Squadron 4 (VF-4M) was activated at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. Although it was the second time a VF-4M had existed, the previous one was decommissioned in 1931 and it was not considered the same squadron. The squadron was decommissioned in 1933 but was recommissioned as \\"VF-8M\\" in 1935. On 1 July 1937, VF-8M was re-designated Marine Fighting Squadron 2 (VMF-2) and by the end of the year, had completely reequipped with Grumman F3F-2s which replaced their F3F-1s and a few even older F2F-1s. The squadron participated in annual Fleet Problems while at San Diego and even played a part in the making of the movie Dive Bomber. Several future Medal of Honor recipients served with the squadron during this period, including Henry Elrod, Robert Galer, and Gregory Boyington. In January 1941, the squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii and was re-designated VMF-211 on July 1, 1941. =World War II= F4F-3 after the Japanese captured Wake Island In November 1941, VMF-211 embarked 12 of its 24 F4F-3 Wildcats and 13 of its 29 pilots aboard for movement to Wake Island, the scene of the squadron's heroic battle. On December 8, 1941 the Japanese attacked Wake, destroying seven of the aircraft on the ground. Over the next two weeks, the remaining five planes repelled numerous attacks and inflicted great losses on the enemy. During the course of this defense, the Marine ground forces and VMF-211 caused the loss of at least four enemy warships, including the first major Japanese naval vessels sunk during the Pacific war. The squadron was also credited with 8 aircraft destroyed. After the loss of its last aircraft, the squadron became a ground unit and fought until the surrender of the atoll. The first Marine airman to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II was VMF-211's Henry T. Elrod. A planned operation to reinforce Wake Island was deemed too dangerous by the fleet command, and on December 23 Wake Island was finally overrun by a numerically superior enemy. VMF-211 F4U-4s on in 1952 The squadron's rear echelon at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa lost all but one of its twelve F4F-3s during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and even this lone survivor was lost when it was transferred to the Navy. In February 1942, the squadron was commanded by future Medal of Honor recipient Harold W. Bauer. Slowly rebuilding as personnel and aircraft became available, the squadron, now under the command of Major Luther S. Moore was deployed in May 1942 to Palmyra Atoll in the South Pacific and adopted the name \\"Avengers\\" in memory of those squadron members who were killed or captured on Wake Island. When first deployed, VMF-211 was equipped with the Brewster F2A-3 and it was not until July that sufficient numbers of Grumman F4F-4 Wildcats became available to re-equip the squadron. As the Pacific Campaign continued the squadron transitioned to the F4U Corsair for the remainder of the war. VMF-211 participated in the Treasury-Bougainville Campaign, Battle of the Bismarck Sea, Northern Solomon, Battle of Leyte Gulf and Southern Philippine campaigns. =After World War II= A VMA-211 AD-4N over Onslow Beach After World War II, VMF-211 participated in the occupation of China where they would eventually provide cover for American forces evacuating the country before the Communist takeover in December 1948. Following this action they returned to Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Field Edenton, North Carolina, in 1949. While operating aboard in 1952, the squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211) when they transitioned to the AD-4N Skyraider. In 1957, the squadron received its first A4D-1 Skyhawks and subsequently moved to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan in 1958. VMA-211 flew several versions of the Skyhawk, receiving the A4D-2 (A-4B) in 1958, the A4D-2N (A-4C) in 1960, the A-4E in 1964, and the A-4M in 1976. =Vietnam War= VMA-211 A-4Es in 1971 With escalation of the Vietnam War, VMA-211 moved to Iwakuni Japan in 1965 and commenced the first of four deployments to Chu Lai Air Base, South Vietnam. LtCol. F.H. Thurston became the CO of the Squadron on August 25, 1967. VMA-211 was deployed in the spring of 1972 to Naha Air Force Base on Okinawa and within three months was redeployed to Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. It reinforced the USAF 8th Special Operations Squadron flying the A-37B Dragonfly, as well as F-4s tasked from Shaw AFB in support of operations against the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Easter Offensive. The other unit at Bien Hoa was an AH-1 Cobra gunship squadron. The four different squadrons representing three branches of service were significant contributors to blunting, then rolling back the PAVN's siege of An L·ªôc, destroying significant numbers of PAVN armor being used for the first time in the war. VMA 211's A-4E were invaluable in close air support of the beleaguered ground troops in An Loc and surrounding areas.In August 1976, the squadron returned to MCAS El Toro. =Post Vietnam= In September 1987, the squadron celebrated an aviation milestone when it passed 30 years of flying the McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. After successfully completing the last overseas deployment with the A-4M Skyhawk in 1989, VMA-211 began transferring these aircraft to the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing in preparation for transition to the AV-8B Night Attack aircraft. In June 1990 the squadron began flying the Night Attack variant of the Harrier. During this time the Avengers were awarded Marine Corps Aviation Association \\"Attack Squadron of the Year\\" three times, in 1995, 1996, and 1998. In September 2000, the squadron began introduction of the latest Harrier variant, the AV-8B II+ radar aircraft. The squadron soon fielded a complement of both Radar and Night Attack Harriers. =Global War on Terror= After the September 11 terror attacks, the squadron deployed to the Arabian Sea aboard . The Avengers participated in Operation Enduring Freedom, flying combat missions against targets in Afghanistan from January to March 2002. After a short break, the following January found the Avengers aboard USS Bonhomme Richard. This time the squadron was headed for the Persian Gulf, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). In one month of combat flying, the squadron flew over 360 sorties and 640 hours of flight time. The squadron returned to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in May 2003. A VMA-211 Harrier II refueling over Iraq in October 2006 The squadron deployed to Iraq off from October 2004 through February 2005 where they were based at Al Asad Airbase. They again deployed to Al Asad from in support of OIF from October 2005 until January 2006. In September 2006, the Avengers again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to Al Asad Air Base. From January til August 2009, the squadron again deployed as part of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit on board USS Essex. In April 2012, the Avengers deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, moving from Kandahar Airfield to British-run Camp Bastion in July. While at Camp Bastion, the Avengers experienced six Harriers destroyed, and two severely damaged, during an attack on the base in September. Two Marines were also killed, including the squadron commander Lt. Col. Christopher K. Raible. Occurring during the heat of the 2012 Presidential campaign, John Gresham on the Defense Media Network called this successful Taliban attack \\"arguably the worst day in [U.S. Marine Corps] aviation history since the Tet Offensive of 1968.\\" In September 2014, the Avengers deployed to Bahrain to support the fight on terrorism in Iraq and Syria until April 2015. =Transition to F-35B Lightning II= A VMFA-211 F-35B in June 2016. The Avengers conducted their last AV-8B Harrier flight on 6 May 2016 and received their first two F-35B Lightning IIs on 9 May. On 30 June 2016, VMA-211 was redesignated as VMFA-211, becoming the second fleet squadron in the Marine Corps to operate the F-35B Lightning II as their primary aircraft. In September 2018 VMFA-211 deployed aboard USS Essex as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group deployed to the United States Central Command area of operations. On 27 September 2018 an F-35B from Essex carried out an air strike using a precision-guided bomb against a Taliban position in Afghanistan, marking the first US combat use of the F-35. On September 4, 2020 the squadron deployed to RAF Marham in the United Kingdom, with 10 F-35Bs. The squadron is scheduled to train alongside 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, in preparation for an upcoming deployment where the two squadrons will form the fixed-wing component embarked on when the carrier enters its first operational deployment in 2021.

The victory of Agrippa, admiral of Octavian, marked the end of the Pompeian resistance to the Second Triumvirate. Background After the strengthening of the bond between Octavian and Mark Antony with the Pact of Brundisium, the two triumvirs had to manage the menace of Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey. Sextus had occupied the province of Sicily, which provided much of Rome's grain supply. When Sextus had managed to bring Rome to famine, in 39 BC, Octavian and Antony sought an alliance with him, appointing him governor of Sicily, Sardinia, and the Peloponnese for five years (Treaty of Misenum). The alliance was short-lived, and Sextus cut the grain supply to Rome. Octavian tried to invade Sicily in 38 BC, but his ships were forced to go back because of bad weather.Appian: The Civil Wars. Book 5, paragraph 116-122 online copy Velleius Paterculus: The Roman History. Book 2, paragraph 79 online copyTony Jacques: Dictionary of Battles And Sieges: A Guide to 8,500 Battles from Antiquity Through the Twenty-first Century. Greenwood Publishing Group 2007, , p. 716 Agrippa cut through part of the Via Ercolana and dug a channel to connect Lake Lucrinus to the sea in order to change it into a harbor. Additionally, Agrippa dug a second, longer channel on the northern side of Lake Lucrinus to connect it to Lake Avernus, a marshy lake further inland, creating a multi-tiered port complex that was not visible from the outer bay where Sextus' ships routinely patrolled. Agrippa named this harbor Port Julius, or Iulius, after Octavian's assassinated great-uncle, Dictator Gaius Julius Caesar. The new harbor was used to specially outfit ships and secretly train the men for naval battles. A new fleet was built, with 20,000 oarsmen gathered by freeing slaves. The new ships were built much larger, in order to carry many more naval infantry units, which were being trained at the same time. Furthermore, Antony lent Octavian 120 ships under the command of Titus Statilius Taurus, for which Octavian was to give him 20,000 infantry to be recruited from northern Italy. While Antony kept his part of the bargain, Octavian did not. In July 36 BC the two fleets sailed from Italy, and another fleet, provided by the third triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, sailed from Africa, to attack Sextus' stronghold in Sicily. In August, Agrippa was able to defeat Sextus in a naval battle near Mylae (modern Milazzo); that same month Octavian was defeated and seriously wounded in a battle near Taormina. Battle In front of Naulochus promontory, Agrippa met Sextus' fleet. Both fleets were composed of 300 ships, all with artillery, but Agrippa commanded heavier units, armed with the harpax, a newer version of the corvus, that was invented by Agrippa himself. Agrippa used his new weapon to great effect, succeeding in blocking the more maneuverable ships of Sextus and, after a long and bloody fight, in defeating his enemy. Agrippa lost three ships, while 28 ships of Sextus were sunk, 17 fled, and the others were burnt or captured. Aftermath After seven years, Sicily was finally wrested from the control of the resourceful Sextus, whose large navy had created many problems for the Second Triumvirate. Sextus reached Messina with seven ships and moved to Mytilene, then from there to the East, where he was defeated in 35 BC by Antony. Octavian and Lepidus defeated the last Pompeian resistance in Sicily. Later, after a good amount of intrigue, Octavian was able to strip Lepidus of his political and military power and become the sole ruler of the west.

The Church of Sweden adopted, at the time that it was still a state church, an administrative structure largely modelled after the state. Direct elections are held to national (Kyrkom√∂tet), diocesan (stiftsfullm√§ktige) and parish assemblies (kyrkofullm√§ktige). The electoral system is the same as used in the parliamentary or municipal elections. In some cases the nationwide political parties take part in the church elections. In other cases individual members of political parties form separate associations to launch candidatures in the church elections. In general terms one can say that the former category consist of parties with historical base in the church whereas the latter consist of political tendencies that have historically been more alien to it, either as a result of secularism (Left and Greens) or being based in the so- called free churches (Liberals and Christian Democrats). A growing phenomena are various non-partisan groups putting up candidatures. Establishing a nominating group In order to form a nominating group must apply to have formed and you have to have some support from the voters. The support is confirmed by collecting signatures from eligible voters. There is a minimum: * 10 persons entitled to vote in support of elections at the local level (parish assemblies or directly elected parish councils) * 100 persons entitled to vote in support of elections at the regional level (diocesan synods) * 300 persons entitled to vote in support of elections at the national level (the Church Assembly) For nomination groups set up at local or regional level, the application, with signatures, to be pin board in the current legislation provided by 15 May election.

Alamo Heights ISD also serves Olmos Park, most of Terrell Hills, and a small portion of San Antonio. History The Alamo Heights Independent School District traces its history from the year 1909 when the first school, a two-room wooden frame building on Townsend Avenue, was built in this picturesque area as part of a rural county district. A new school building of masonry was later constructed on the site that is now Cambridge Elementary School. In 1923, just one year after the high school building was added to the growing campus, the Alamo Heights system became an independent school district of 300 students. While the hub of activity for Alamo Heights students centered at Cambridge until the 1950s, the district branched out into the neighboring community at the former cement plant near Jones-Maltsberger Road, also called \\"Cementville.\\" Known as the \\"Bluebonnet School, \\" the Alamo Heights Ward School served children whose parents worked at the plant. The present athletic stadium was built in 1938 by the Work Projects Administration. Originally, games were played at Howard Field on the present Cambridge site, where former head coach Earl \\"Mule \\" Frazier led the football team to a first district championship in 1926 - and lent Alamo Heights its mascot. World War II was responsible for a very real transition for Alamo Heights from a rural district to a suburban district, accompanied by the baby boom and opening of numerous subdivisions within district boundaries. In fact, the district almost doubled during that time. To continue to meet the needs of a growing population, the district erected Alamo Heights High School in 1949-50, the original unit of Woodridge Elementary in 1951-52, Howard Early Childhood Center in 1956, Alamo Heights Junior School in 1959, and the former Robbins Elementary School in 1964. Today, the Alamo Heights Independent School District covers 9.4 square miles and serves students from the communities of Alamo Heights, Terrell Hills, Olmos Park, and a portion of north San Antonio. The University of Texas at San Antonio is a repository for a collection of 43 flags (8.5 in x 11.5 in.) created by the students of Alamo Heights Junior School in the late 1960s. The flags, recreations of flags that have flown in Texas over the course of Texas history, were originally hung in the students' classroom, but were donated to be displayed at HemisFair '68 (1968 World's Fair in San Antonio, Texas). The collection was donated by Larry Williams, the students' teacher at Alamo Heights Junior School. Finances As of the 2010-2011 school year, the appraised valuation of property in the district was $4,838,847,000. The maintenance tax rate was $0.104 and the bond tax rate was $0.013 per $100 of appraised valuation. Academic achievement In 2011, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Forty-nine percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating. No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012. A school district in Texas can receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking).

He was a fine artist as well, who created hundreds of paintings, drawings, etchings and sketches over his 84-year lifespan. Life and early career Born in Bellefontaine, Ohio, Flora attended the Art Academy of Cincinnati from 1935 to 1939. In 1938, he met writer Robert Lowry, then a student at the University of Cincinnati, and the two launched The Little Man Press, a letterpress series of limited edition publications, for which Flora supplied illustrations, design, and layout. They collaborated on Little Man Press until 1942. (Lowry, a volatile and self-destructive literary turbine, later self-published many works under a revived Little Man imprint without Flora's involvement.) In 1941, he married his college sweetheart, artist Jane Sinnicksen. Following a brief period as a commercial artist in Cincinnati, Flora was hired at $55 a week by Columbia Records in 1942, at which time the Floras moved to Westport, Connecticut, since Columbia was then based in Bridgeport. (In 1945, the couple relocated to Rowayton, Connecticut, where they lived the remainder of their lives. They had five children.) Beginning work in the art department under Alex Steinweiss, inventor of the illustrated album cover, Flora illustrated ads, new release bulletins, and retail and trade literature. In 1943, when Steinweiss entered the navy, Flora was promoted to Art Director. Building out his creative team, he hired Richard Staples Dodge and Ginnie Hofmann whom he had known from the Art Academy of Cincinnati. That same year, Flora launched Columbia's monthly new release booklet, Coda , which he continued illustrating and designing through 1945, when he was promoted to advertising manager. His replacement as art director was Robert M. Jones who later became art director for RCA Victor (where he twice won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover - Classical; Flora and Jones remained lifelong friends, their careers sporadically intertwining). Flora's artwork began appearing on Columbia 78 rpm album covers in 1947. Flora worked as advertising manager and sales promotion manager at Columbia, but grew frustrated working a desk job while doing little art. Finally reaching his endurance of what he called \\"endless meetings, endless memos, and wrestling with budgets,\\" Flora resigned in 1950. \\"Bitten by the bug of wanderlust,\\" he drove to Mexico with his family; they remained south of the border for 15 months, during which time Jim and Jane painted, created woodcuts and lived as bohemian gringos in Taxco. Commercial art and books The couple returned to Connecticut in 1951, and Flora embarked on a freelance commercial art career in which he would thrive for decades. He illustrated covers and interior articles for dozens of mainstream magazines, Fortune, Holiday, Life, Look, Newsweek, The New York Times Magazine, Mademoiselle, Charm, Research and Engineering, Computer Design, Sports Illustrated, Collier's and Pic. From January to December, 1952, he was Art Director at Park East magazine, for which he published the first commercial illustrations by R.O. Blechman, as well as spot illustrations by the young Andy Warhol. Flora resigned at the end of 1952, and was replaced as Art Director by Robert M. Jones, who in 1945 had replaced him as Art Director at Columbia Records. In March 1953 Jones became Art Director at RCA Victor Records, where he soon began jobbing out album cover assignments to his friend Flora. This resulted in a Golden Age of Flora LP covers, including such celebrated designs as Mambo For Cats, Inside Sauter-Finegan, Lord Buckley's Hipsters, Flipsters, and Finger-Poppin' Daddies, Knock Me Your Lobes, and Shorty Rogers Courts the Count. Around this time, Flora also did spot jobs for Columbia as a freelancer, illustrating album covers and reviving Coda during 1952 and 1953. \\"Album Art of Cartoon Wit, Raptor Energy\\" * New York Times Dec. 30, 2014 Access date Sept. 29, 2019 Among his assignments in the 1950s, Flora drew a number of commercial storyboards for the pioneering animation studio, United Productions of America (UPA), on assignment from UPA Creative Director Gene Deitch. From September 1955 to August 1956 he served as Art Director for a short-lived technical monthly, Research & Engineering. He illustrated the cover of Computer Design magazine for 17 years (1960s and '70s), and frequent covers for American Legion magazine (1970s). Between 1955 and 1969, working with children's book editor Margaret K. McElderry at Harcourt Brace, Flora wrote and illustrated 11 books for young readers, including The Fabulous Firework Family (1955), The Day the Cow Sneezed (1957), Charlie Yup and His Snip-Snap Boys (1959) and Leopold, the See-Through Crumbpicker (1961). In 1971, after Harcourt Brace asked McElderry to take \\"early retirement\\" she accepted a position at Atheneum Books, which gave the editor her own imprint. She quickly reconnected with and signed Flora, who between 1972 and 1982 created six more children's books for her, including Pishtosh, Bullwash, and Wimple (1972) and Stewed Goose (1973). Later life After he retired from commercial work in the late 1970s, Flora devoted the remainder of his artistic life to painting and sketching. His nautical canvases were occasionally exhibited, and he marketed posters of some of his large-scale ship-related works. His wife, Jane, died in 1985. In 1987, he married Patricia Larsen. In 1994, Flora produced a revised (redrawn and rewritten) edition of his first children's book, The Fabulous Firework Family. However, it was a pale shadow of the 1955 edition, containing none of the artistic edge and little of the rich ethnic atmosphere. Flora-seekers should not confuse the two versions, of which the original is vastly superior. In the final years of his life, Flora continued painting and sketching at an almost frenzied rate. \\"Every day I do something,\\" he told interviewer Steven Guarnaccia in 1998. \\"I can get here [his downstairs studio] and focus and forget every little ache and pain that I have.\\" A few months later, Flora died in Rowayton, Connecticut, from stomach cancer. Evolving styles Flora had a cartoonish-style that in its earliest (1940s and 1950s) incarnations betrayed a diabolic humor and uninhibited sense of outrageousness. Despite a later reputation for \\"cuddly\\" kiddie lit and family-friendly illustrations for mainstream magazines, Flora's fine art‚Äîboth early and late‚Äîwas by turns bizarre, playful, comic, erotic and/or macabre. It could, on occasion, shock or offend. His style evolved radically over the decades; comparing his sharp, edgy commercial work of the 1940s to his middlebrow buffoonery of the 1970s sometimes leaves the impression they were done by two different artists who happened to share the same name (he was always credited as James Flora). It seems that the more popular Flora became, the less \\"threatening\\" his art appeared. This is certainly true of his commercial work, which softened and became more generic in the 1960s and 1970s. His private fine art, however, often served as an outlet for the artist's inner demons, as Flora dotted many works with images of violence and sexual excess. (The cover of The Curiously Sinister Art of Jim Flora is adorned with figures from his 1940s absurdist burlesque painting, The Rape of the Stationmaster's Daughter.) Many of his smaller temperas and pen and ink sketches, particularly from the 1940s through the 1960s, featured clusters of unrelated images interlocking like rune-shaped brickwork, every square inch of surface crammed with bizarre figures, some disturbing, some nonsensical, all intriguing. As Flora once explained, \\"I could never stand a static space.\\" Music was one of Flora's muses, and his montages radiate overtones of improvisation‚Äîa one-man band jamming on a canvas. His biographer, Irwin Chusid, said that Flora \\"crafted rhythmic design in unfathomable meters.\\" He also established a reputation in the 1980s for large canvases with nautical themes, particularly ocean liners and cruise ships‚Äîthe decks sometimes populated with tiny figures engaged in pornographic behavior. \\"When he was in his ship period,\\" said his daughter Roussie, \\"he painted lots of naughty little scenes going on inside. He would have exhibitions, and the galleries would set out a basket of magnifying glasses. You would see all these old ladies clustered around the paintings trying to see what was going on in the portholes.\\" His early illustration style has influenced many contemporary artists, including, Derek Yaniger, Shag (Josh Agle), Tim Biskup, children's book author Lane Smith (\\"I was always inspired by the spontaneity and animation in Flora's work\\"), and Pixar animator Pete Docter, along with such illustrators as J.D. King, Michael Bartalos, J. Otto Seibold, Phillip Anderson, and Terry Allen. Despite his reputation for humorous themes and penchant for caricature, and the undeniable influence of cartoon art on his work, Flora never created comics. He was, primarily, an artist, and incidentally, a humorist. J.D. King observed, \\"Even in Flora's fine art, there's a feel of the Sunday funnies, the Great American Comic Strip when it was actually great. And comical.\\" Posthumous legacy The Flora family archive contains hundreds of paintings, sketches and long-unseen commercial assignments. A few years after the artist's death, his long- neglected paintings and private fine artworks began achieving recognition, thanks to the research and cataloging of co-archivists Irwin Chusid and Barbara Economon, who have compiled four anthologies of Flora's rarely seen works: The Mischievous Art of Jim Flora (2004), The Curiously Sinister Art of Jim Flora (2007), The Sweetly Diabolic Art of Jim Flora (2009), and The High Fidelity Art of Jim Flora (2013), all published by Fantagraphics Books.Jim Flora anthologies at Fantagraphics Books Flora's second children's book, The Day the Cow Sneezed (1957), was reprinted in Fall 2010 by Enchanted Lion Books,The Day the Cow Sneezed at Enchanted Lion Books who also reprinted his fifth, Kangaroo for Christmas (1962) in Fall 2011.Kangaroo for Christmas at Enchanted Lion Books Vintage Flora images have appeared on new CD covers: Reptet's release Do This! (2006, Monktail Records) used an early 1950s Flora \\"triclops\\" figure; Whirled Chamber Music (2007, ViolinJazz Recordings) by the twice Grammy-nominated Quartet San Francisco features a detail from a 1960s Flora painting entitled Barberinni; and the album Ectoplasm (2008, Basta Audio-Visuals), a collection of late 1940s recordings by the Raymond Scott Quintet, features a 1951 Flora illustration. Many artists have been influenced by Flora's work, others have parodied his style. One of Flora's album covers, the 1955 RCA Victor release This is Benny Goodman and his Orchestra, was parodied twice: on a 1998 Pearl Jam tour poster and on the cover art for the 2000 CD Oscillate My Metallic Sonatas by the theremin band, The Lothars. The cover of the 2003 CD Conviction by slam poet Taylor Mali parodied Flora's 1947 cover art for Gene Krupa and His Orchestra. In the film Monsters, Inc. (Pixar, 2001), an abstract poster on Sullivan's bedroom wall is a distinct mimic of Flora's style.

It was founded to facilitate a number of Reform and Liberal Jewish institutions, attached to the Movement for Reform Judaism (formerly: Reform Synagogues of Great Britain), principally through education and cultural means. The centre was opened in 1981 by the Manor House Trust and is now named after Sigmund Sternberg. The founding organisations are: Leo Baeck College, the Movement for Reform Judaism and the Akiva School, the first Reform Jewish day school in England (also opened in 1981). Later the (Masorti) New North London Synagogue also located there. The Sternberg Centre also includes the offices of RSY Netzer, The Zionist Youth Movement for Reform Judaism. The centre also hosted the Jewish Museum, Finchley until 2007. Movement for Reform Judaism The Movement for Reform Judaism has had its headquarters at the site since 1981. The Movement is the national umbrella organisation of 42 autonomous synagogues. Staff based at the Sternberg Centre work to support these synagogues including work with small communities, the Reform Beit Din (religious court), education, youth work, work with students and young adults and practical support for synagogues including HR, IT and communications. Regular events are organised including a biennial Jewish music conference, residential weekends and events for people in mixed-faith relationships and those considering conversion to Judaism, a national biennial conference held at a regional venue and a northern Reform Jewish communities weekend. Akiva School Akiva School was established in 1981. It became a two-form entry voluntary aided school in 2007 and moved into a new purpose- built state-of-the-art building in January 2008. Akiva is the only voluntary- aided Progressive Jewish primary school in North West London. It is an inclusive and egalitarian learning community, teaching its children to be happy, confident and knowledgeable citizens, with a love of Israel and all aspects of Judaism. Akiva children are taught to understand and respect themselves, others and the world. http://www.akivaschool.org New North London Synagogue New North London Synagogue, Finchley, London The synagogue, which is affiliated to the Masorti movement, was founded by followers of Louis Jacobs, and located to the Sternberg Centre site after some years of nomadic existence. The congregation, which now has about 2,400 members, raised over ¬£6 million to construct a new synagogue building on the site, which was opened in 2011.website of the synagogue. Designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, the new synagogue includes three prayer venues, a nursery and teenager‚Äôs room, as well as social and administrative spaces. The synagogue's rabbi is Jonathan Wittenberg. Leo Baeck College Named in honour of Leo Baeck, the inspirational 20th-century German Reform rabbi, Leo Baeck College was founded in 1956 as a rabbinical school for training Liberal and Reform rabbis. Today, the college is a centre for the training of rabbis and teachers, an educational consultancy, helps the development of community leaders, provides access to Jewish learning for all through interfaith work. It is a degree-awarding institution, specialising in Hebrew and other Jewish related subjects. It is now based at the Sternberg Centre. Manor House Centre for Psychotherapy and Counselling  The Manor House Centre for Psychotherapy and Counselling (MHCPC) provides training for people working or planning to work in both paid and voluntary positions in the community. There are excellent teaching facilities, a library and cafeteria. The Training Programme has developed over many years experience enabling students to work effectively and creatively within the counselling field, in the community and in specific work places. The term \\"counselling\\" is used in many contexts and the variety of trainings and models can be confusing. The MHCPC offers comprehensive training in psychodynamic counselling leading to the Certificate in Counselling Skills or the Diploma in Psychodynamic Counselling and Therapy in the Community.

The squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona and is under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The squadron is best known as the Black Sheep of World War II fame and for one of its commanding officers, Colonel Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington, whose memoirs also inspired the 1970s television show Baa Baa Black Sheep, later syndicated as Black Sheep Squadron, which dramatized the squadron's exploits during the war. Mission Provide offensive air support, armed reconnaissance, and air defense for Marine expeditionary forces. History Vought F4U-1A Corsair, BuNo 17883, of Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington, the commander of VMF-214, Vella Lavella end of 1943 =World War II= Marine Fighter Squadron 214 was commissioned on July 1, 1942, at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, on the Island of Oahu. Initially called the \\"Swashbucklers\\" The squadron was moved to Turtle Bay Airfield on Espiritu Santo in August. There Major Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington (Medal of Honor, Navy Cross) took command of the 27 pilots that became the original \\"Blacksheep\\" of VMF-214. From Espirito Santo the squadron was moved forward to Guadalcanal and Henderson Airfield. From Guadalcanal they would be moved to Munda and Vella lavella. Major Boyington had just returned from a year's tour in China as a member of the 1st American Volunteer Group commonly called the Flying Tigers. He was credited with downing multiple Japanese aircraft. Boyington claimed six, but is officially credited with 3.5 kills. Wokuvits, Black Sheep, p. 89 The squadron was not assigned any aircraft or ancillary personnel at first and flew to Guadalcanal and later the Russell Islands in borrowed planes that were in less than satisfactory condition.Reed, Lost Black Sheep, p. 41. On the evening of September 13, 1943, the men of VMF-214 gathered in their commanding officer's hootch during which time it was suggested that they needed a nickname. Originally the squadron called itself \\"Boyington's Bastards\\" after its new commander, the fact that all of the pilots had been orphans and not attached to a squadron when they got together, and the fact they possessed few reliable planes and no mechanics. The following day, this new label was presented to the Marine Corps public information officer on the island at the time, Captain Jack DeChant, and found to be unacceptable because civilian newspapers would never print it. DeChant then suggested the call sign \\"Black Sheep\\" because the expression meant essentially the same thing.Reed, Lost Black Sheep, pp. 41‚Äì42. The pilots ranged from experienced combat veterans, with several air-to-air victories to their credit, to new replacement pilots from the United States. Major Boyington and Major Stan Bailey were given permission to form the unassigned pilots into a squadron, with the understanding that they would have less than four weeks to have them fully trained and ready for combat. Although they dropped the moniker \\"Boyington's Bastards,\\" the squadron still retains the black bar of bastardy across its shield.De Chant, John Devilbirds, p. 113. They chose for their badge the black shield of illegitimacy, the bar sinister, a black sheep superimposed, surrounded by a circle of twelve stars, and crowned with the image of their aircraft, the F4U Corsair. F4U-1 Corsair of 1st Lt Rolland N. Rinabarger of VMF-214 The Black Sheep squadron fought for eighty-four days. They met the Japanese over their own fields and territory and piled up a record of 203 planes destroyed or damaged, produced nine fighter aces with 97 confirmed air-to-air kills, sank several troop transports and supply ships, destroyed many installations, in addition to numerous other victories. For their actions, the original Black Sheep were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism in action. Following their first combat tour, 26 pilots from the squadron left the airfield at Munda for a week of rest and relaxation in Sydney, Australia where they holed up in the Australia Hotel.Reed, Lost Black Sheep, pp. 64‚Äì6. The Black Sheep ended their second combat tour on January 8, 1944, five days after Major Boyington was shot down and captured by the Japanese. The original Black Sheep were disbanded and the pilots were placed in the pilot pool in Marine Aircraft Group 11. Exploits of this incarnation of the unit were loosely fictionalized in the 1970s television series Baa Baa Black Sheep, later renamed Black Sheep Squadron, starring Robert Conrad as Boyington. VMF-214 was reformed on January 29, 1944 at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara near Goleta, California. They deployed aboard the aircraft carrier on February 4, 1945 to join on-going operations on Okinawa. On March 19, a Japanese bomber hit USS Franklin. The explosion and resulting fire caused 772 deaths aboard Franklin including 32 Black Sheep members. Many Black Sheep aircraft were launching for a strike on mainland Japan at the time. One, First Lieutenant Ken Linder, was given half credit for shooting down the Japanese bomber that struck Franklin. This ended VMF-214 involvement in World War II. During the course of the war, the squadron suffered 23 pilots killed in action or missing and lost 48 aircraft to accidents or enemy contact.Gamble, The Black Sheep, pp. 487‚Äì489. In April 1945, the Black Sheep were relocated to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro, California, and then to MCAS El Toro, California in October 1945. In the next few years, the Black Sheep deployed for operations on board , , , and . =Korean War= When the Korean War broke out, VMF-214 was en route to Hawaii on board USS Badoeng Strait hosting midshipmen from the Naval Academy. The squadron's commanding officer, Major Robert P. Keller, was summoned to headquarters in Hawaii where he met with then Colonel Victor Krulak. Krulak bluntly asked, \\"Major, are you ready to go to war?\\"Mersky Corsairs to Panthers, p. 4. VMF-214 F4U-4Bs on USS Sicily in late 1950 Flying eight F4U-4B Corsairs on August 3, 1950, VMF-214 became the first Marine squadron to see action in Korea, when they launched from and executed a raid against enemy installations near Inchon. After the F4Us delivered their incendiary bombs and rockets, they followed up with a series of strafing runs. Flying from USS Badoeng Strait and USS Boxer, the Black Sheep completed two combat tours in Korea. They participated in key battles, including the Inchon landing and the United Nations's defeat and withdrawal from Chosin Reservoir. In these and other battles, they provided nearly continual air cover, interdicting supply and communication lines, and inflicting heavy damage on numerous ground emplacements, and enemy armor. =Late 1950s‚Äìearly 1960s= F9F-2 Panther jets from VMF-214 flying over Oahu in 1953. Shortly before the close of hostilities in Korea, VMF-214 returned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. Here they exchanged their Corsairs for F9F Panther jets and began another training program. In the spring of 1953, the Black Sheep traded their F9s for new F2H-4 Banshees, and headed for the Hawaiian Islands. Upon their arrival, they became part of Marine Aircraft Group 13 and the First Marine Brigade. An F2H-4 of VMA(AW)-214 assigned to , 1957. In January 1956, the Black Sheep again received the order to \\"get ready.\\" This time, the circumstances were less demanding. In the ensuing fifteen months, the Black Sheep covered all aspects of Marine aviation. On December 31, 1956, the squadron was redesignated Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron-214, flying the Banshee. The buildup included instrument flying, bombing, rocketry, strafing, air-to-air gunnery, field carrier landing practice, high and low altitude special weapon drops, and carrier qualifications. VMF(AW)-214 became the first Marine squadron to be qualified in special weapons delivery, in February 1957. The period between Korea and Vietnam saw several significant changes for the Black Sheep. VMF was changed to VMA on July 9, 1957, designating the Squadron as \\"attack\\" rather than \\"fighter\\". In March 1958, the Black Sheep transitioned to the FJ-4 Fury. VMA-214 and VMF-212 became the first squadrons to deploy flying their aircraft across the Pacific. Another aircraft change occurred in January 1959, when the Black Sheep changed over to the newer FJ-4B. In the FJ-4B Fury jets, the squadron logged over 27,000 hours as an attack squadron. This included a stretch with over 20,000 accident-free flight hours. The Black Sheep were awarded, on August 29, 1961, the CMC safety award for the \\"most outstanding safety record\\" achieved among attack squadrons throughout the Marine Corps. On January 23, 1962, the Black Sheep replaced the FJ-4B Fury with the A-4B Skyhawk. This began a 27-year association between the Black Sheep and follow- on versions of the Skyhawk. In the fall of 1963, VMA-214 was selected as the first Marine Corps squadron to provide a detachment (\\"N\\") to deploy on a Westpac cruise aboard . The detachment was assigned to intercept Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 \\"Bear\\" and Tupolev Tu-16 \\"Badger\\" aircraft flying toward the anti-submarine naval task force in the Sea of Japan. They returned home to MCAS Kaneohe Bay in April 1964. A-4M Skyhawks from VMA-214 in the 1970s =Vietnam War= In May 1965, the Black Sheep were reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 12, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, and moved to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. On June 21, 1965, the first Black Sheep division flew into Chu Lai, Republic of Vietnam, landing on of SATS runway. 4,000 feet of the original had been removed to fix the \\"floating runway\\" problem during monsoon season. The A-4s were landing with MOREST and departing using the land-based catapult; C-130s were being launched with JATO assist. The Navy Seabees had 4,000 feet of aluminum runway planks stacked up on the departure end of the runway. One of the Marine generals and his \\"spit shined\\" C-130 decided, against direction from the tower, to do a full run-up on the runway prior to departure. The Seabees were hunkered down behind their heavy equipment as the planks went sailing over their heads. The Black Sheep rotated out of Vietnam in February 1966 to pick up new pilots and personnel. In April 1966, the Black Sheep deployed back to Chu Lai where they flew more combat missions to support the Republic of Vietnam. The Black Sheep squadron flew 14,000 hours in combat, 13,000 sorties, and dropped more than 10,000 tons of ordnance and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation with Bronze Star. VMA-214 returned from Vietnam in April 1967, moved to El Toro, and was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 33, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. Once in El Toro, the unit became recognized as an operational training squadron for attack pilots, many of whom were replacement pilots bound for Vietnam. During December 1970, the Black Sheep were reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 13. =The 1970s and 1980s= During the late 1970s, and into the 1980s, the squadron participated in the Unit Deployment Program, rotating between Marine Aircraft Group 12, Marine Corps Air Station, Iwakuni, Japan, and Marine Aircraft Group 13 at MCAS El Toro, California. In October 1982, the Black Sheep were awarded the Lawson H. M. Sanderson Award for Attack Squadron of the Year. In September 1987, the Black Sheep squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. On October 17, 1987, the Black Sheep became the first squadron to win the Sanderson award for a second time. In 1989, the Black Sheep completed 30,000 accident free hours and six years of accident-free flying. Also, in June 1989, the Black Sheep introduced single- seat fixed-wing \\"night attack\\" aircraft to the Marine Corps with the first operational squadron of AV-8B Night Attack Harrier IIs. =1990s= Marine Attack Squadron 214 became the first squadron to introduce the Night Attack capability into the Unit Deployment Program in October 1991, by deploying 20 Night Attack Harriers to Iwakuni, Japan, for seven months. Continuing in their traditions as pioneers, in July 1993, the Black Sheep conducted a dedicated \\"Night Systems\\" deployment to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twenty-Nine Palms, California. Ultimately, sorties were conducted throughout the night until shortly before dawn over three weeks. It also resulted in the gathering of original medical data on night flying and its effect on pilot performance. From December 1993 to July 1994, Marines of VMA-214 deployed aboard and participated in contingency Operation Restore Hope and Operation Quick Draw off the coast of Somalia. Also during this deployment, VMA-214 Det B participated in Operation Distant Runner in Burundi and Rwanda. In October 1994 a detachment from Marine Attack Squadron 214 embarked aboard to support the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (13th MEU). While deployed, the detachment supported Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia and Operation United Shield off the coast of Somalia. During April 1996, Marine Attack Squadron 214 again deployed a detachment aboard in support of the 13th MEU. The detachment supported Operation Southern Watch off the coast of Kuwait and Operation Desert Strike in Northern Iraq. In August 1997, the Black Sheep were recognized for the third time with the Lawson H.M. Sanderson Award for Attack Squadron of the Year. In 1998 and 1999, the Black Sheep Squadron prepared for and deployed aboard heading directly to the North Persian Gulf to take part in Operation Desert Fox. It was on this deployment that the Harrier community had its first operational use of night vision devices for shipboard activities to include working with helicopters on a shared deck. =Global War on Terror= AV-8Bs of VMA-214 on USS Peleliu in 2005 After the Marines grounded their Harriers, the Black Sheep split the squadron and deployed simultaneously in support of two separate Marine Expeditionary Units. The Squadron (-) deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, while Detachment Bravo sailed in support of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard . During this deployed period, the Marines of VMA-214 participated in humanitarian operations in East Timor and Indonesia. One month later, Det Bravo was off the coast of Yemen with the 13th MEU(SOC) participating in Operation Determined Response - the recovery of the destroyer . During this operation, Black Sheep Marines trained in the region and helped provide stability with a constant fixed-wing presence. VMA-214 has twice deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The first time was for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and again from February to August 2004, where they were based out of Al Asad. The squadron deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009 as part of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. They returned to MCAS Yuma in November 2009 having flown some 3,000 hours during their six-month tour. During the deployment, they were based out of Kandahar International Airport as part of Marine Aircraft Group 40 and provided close air support and aerial reconnaissance. They were part of the 17,000 troop increase announced by President Obama in mid-February 2009. Beginning in May 2009, a detachment from VMA-214 deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) with the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. During the deployment they supported the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade in southern Afghanistan and counter piracy operations off the coast of Africa. The Black Sheep were recognized for the fourth time with the Lawson H. M. Sanderson Award as the 2010 Attack Squadron of the Year as a result. = Plans = VMA-214 plans to shift to F-35Bs from 2021 to 2023.

It is a very sacred month in the Islamic calendar, one in which the ·∏§ajj (Pilgrimage) takes place as well as the Festival of the Sacrifice. \\"Dhu al-Hijjah\\" literally means \\"Possessor of the Pilgrimage\\" or \\"The Month of the Pilgrimage\\". During this month Muslim pilgrims from all around the world congregate at Mecca to visit the Kaaba. The Hajj is performed on the eighth, ninth and the tenth of this month. Day of Arafah takes place on the ninth of the month. Eid al-Adha, the \\"Festival of the Sacrifice\\", begins on the tenth day and ends on sunset of the 13th. In the Ottoman Empire times, the name in Ottoman Turkish was Zƒ´-'l-H√¨jj√© or Zil- higÃÉgÃÉe. In modern Turkish, the name is Zilhicce.  Hadiths  According to Islamic traditions, the first 10 days of Dhu al-Hijjah are the most blessed days in which to do good deeds according to Imam Ali: \\"9-10 Dhu al Hajjah are the best days for nikkah relations.\\" Narrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \\"No good deeds done on other days are superior to those done on these (first ten days of Dhu al-Hijja).\\" Then some companions of the Prophet said, \\"Not even Jihad?\\" He replied, \\"Not even Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and his property in danger (for Allah's sake) and does not return with any of those things.\\" (Reported by Tirmidhi) Muhammad used to fast the first nine days of this month, owing to their perceived virtue: One of the wives of Muhammad said: \\"Allah's Messenger used to fast the [first] nine days of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of 'Ashurah, and three days of each month.\\" (Reported by Abu Dawud)  Timing  The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Dhu al-Hijjah migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for Dhu al-Hijjah, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia, are:Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia {class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:right\\" +Dhu al-Hijjah dates between 2018 and 2023 - !scope=\\"col\\"AH !scope=\\"col\\"First day (CE/AD) !scope=\\"col\\"Last day (CE/AD) - !scope=\\"row\\"1439 12 August 2018 10 September 2018 - !scope=\\"row\\"1440 2 August 2019 30 August 2019 - !scope=\\"row\\"1441 22 July 2020 19 August 2020 - !scope=\\"row\\"1442 11 July 2021 8 August 2021 - !scope=\\"row\\"1443 30 June 2022 29 July 2022 - !scope=\\"row\\"1444 19 June 2023 18 July 2023 }  Special days  * The first 9 days of Dhu al-Hijjah for fasting * The first 10 nights of Dhu al-Hijjah for standing (Qiyaam) in Tahajjud * The 8th, 9th and 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah as the days of Hajj * The 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah as the Day of Arafah * Takbirut Tashreeq is observed from the 9 Dhu al-Hijjah till 13 Dhu al-Hijjah * The 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah as the Night of Eid * Eid al-Adha (Festival of the Sacrifice) begins on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and ends on sunset of the 13th Dhu al-Hijjah * 18th Dul al-Hijjah Eid-e- Ghadeer  Prescribed acts of worship  The following acts have been prescribed for the first nine days of Dhu al-Hijjah * A person should give extra charity Sadaqah in these 9 days * Better your Salaah in these days * Spend time in the Masjid * Perform voluntary Nafl prayer at home * Recitation, Memorization and Reading of the Qur‚Äôan * Dhikr * Dua * Fasting the first nine days sawm * I øtikƒÅf On the days of Qurbani, i.e. 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah, the greatest action is the spilling of blood of a sacrificial animal (Qurbani).  Reward for fasting and Tahajjud  According to the hadith, great rewards have been mentioned for fasting the first nine days of Dhu al-Hijjah and standing in worship (Tahajjud) in the first 10 nights of Dhu al-Hijjah: This hadith has been classed as a daeef(weak) hadith by many scholars, Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (no. 758); al-Bazzaar (no. 7816) and Ibn Maajah (1728) via Abu Bakr ibn Naafi‚Äò al-Basri, who said: Mas‚Äòood ibn Waasil told us, from Nahhaas ibn Qaham, from Qataadah, from Sa‚Äòeed ibn al-Musayyab, from Abu Hurayrah. This is a da‚Äòeef isnaad because of an-Nahhaas ibn Qaham and Mas‚Äòood ibn Waasil. Hence the scholars of hadith unanimously agreed that it is to be classed as da‚Äòeef. At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a ghareeb hadith, which we know only from the hadith of Mas‚Äòood ibn Waasil, from an-Nahhaas. I asked Muhammad ‚Äì i.e., al-Bukhaari ‚Äì about this hadith and he did not know it except via this isnaad. Some of this was also narrated from Qataadah, from Sa‚Äòeed ibn al-Musayyab, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in a mursal report. Yahya ibn Sa‚Äòeed criticised Nahhaas ibn Qaham with regard to his memory. End quote. Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its isnaad is da‚Äòeef (end quote) Sharh as-Sunnah (2/624) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is some weakness in it.

The reason for the 10 days being distinguished is due to the combination of worship in this period of prayer, fasting, charity, Takbir and Hajj. From the first nine days of Dhu al-Hijjah, it is particularly recommended to fast the Day of Arafah (9 Dhu al-Hijjah) as expiation of the sin of two years:  General events  Jabal 'Arafat during ·∏§ajj * 9 Dhu al-Hijjah, Day of Arafah * 10-13 Dhu al-Hijjah, Eid al-Adha is observed by Muslims on the hajj and around the world in commemoration of the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Isma'il (Ishmael) for Allah. = Sunni = * 18 Dhu al-Hijjah, death of Uthman ibn Affan second cousin, companion and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and Khadija.

Known as the \\"Tomcats\\", the squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). HistoryWorld War II= VMF-311 during World War II - South Pacific Born during the national call-to-arms immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Marine Fighting Squadron 311 (VMF-311) was first commissioned on 1 December 1942, assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and headquartered at MCAS Cherry Point.Sambito 1978, p. 1.3d MAW General Order 2-1942 Commissioning VMF-311 on 1 December 1942 Quickly transitioning from a training squadron flying the SNJ Texan to a combat squadron flying the F4U Corsair, VMF-311 participated in what was one of the earliest American catapult operations involving the Corsair when 21 F4Us launched from on October 6, 1943. By this time the squadron formed part of MAG-31. During World War II, VMF-311 was one of the first to utilize and develop tactics for the Corsair in a ground attack mode, foreshadowing the squadron‚Äôs future role as an attack squadron. Indicative of its combat effectiveness the squadron destroyed 71Tillman 1979, p. 152.Styling 1995, p. 80. Japanese aircraft in a four-month period during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. The end of World War II saw VMF-311 leaving Chimu Airfield on Okinawa to start occupational duty flying from Yokosuka airfield on Japan's mainland. =1946-1950= TO-1 Shooting Star from VMF-311 in 1948 Occupational duty in Japan lasted till May 1946, when MAG-31 was notified to prepare for the termination of its Japanese assignment; VMF-311 was going home.Sambito 1978, p. 11. Between July 1946 and April 1947 the squadron had a sleeping existence and being transferred to MAG-32 and later MAG-12 while consisting of one officer, but in 1949 VMF-311 became the first West Coast Marine jet squadron when it started flying the TO-1 Shooting Star. Coincidentally the squadron was re-designated Marine Fighter Squadron 311 (VMF-311) and around that time acquired the code letters WL, phonetically pronounced as \\"William Love,\\" but from which also came the nickname \\"Willy Lovers\\".Sambito 1978, p. 14. The squadron quickly transitioned to the F9F Panther in October 1949 and found itself once again preparing for war by November 1950, arriving once again at Yokusuka airfield in Japan. =The Korean War, 1950‚Äì1955= VMF-311 Logo during the Korean War Pohang during the Korean War Arriving in Korea on December 7, 1950, VMF-311 was the first land-based Marine jet squadron to be used in combat providing close air support for the Marines and Soldiers on the ground.http://collections.naval.aviation.museum/emuwebdoncoms/pages/doncoms/Display.php?irn=16001491&QueryPage;=%2FDtlQuery.php National Museum of Naval Aviation In late-June 1952 the squadron participate in the attack on the Sui-ho Dam. Additionally, the squadron pioneered strip- alert tactics still practiced today. Legendary pilots during this era included later astronaut and Senator John Glenn and baseball star Ted Williams. In over years of action in Korea the squadron amassed 18,851 combat sorties. In 1957, the squadron finally was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 311 (VMA-311). The nickname \\"Tomcats\\" was also bestowed during this era. =Vietnam War= VMA-311 A-4E over South Vietnam in 1970The first A4D-2 Skyhawk was received by the \\"Tomcats\\" in the summer of 1958, initiating 30 years of Skyhawk service. In May 1965 the squadron, now flying A-4Es, deployed to Chu Lai Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam and on June 2, they conducted their first combat mission of the Vietnam War. In August 1965, VMA-311 supported the 7th Marine Regiment in Operation Starlite‚Äîthe first major American operation of the war.Lehrack The First Battle, p.68. After almost eight years of operations in Vietnam the Tomcats totaled 54,625 combat sorties before leaving in January 1973. Among the sortie count was an amazing four-day sortie total of 240 from 5 to 8 May 1968 in support of their fellow marines during the Battle of Khe Sanh. During most of their time they were based at Chu Lai.Dorr Marine Air, p.205. The squadron flew the last Marine Corps sorties out of Chu Lai on September 11, 1970. In May 1972 VMA-311 once again deployed to Vietnam with MAG-12 Forward at Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam. Their final sortie in-country would occur on January 29, 1973, a day before they would drop the last ordnance from a Marine A-4 Skyhawk during the war. VMA-311 would fly 54,625 combat sorties during their time supporting operations in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.Mersky (1983), p.281. =The Gulf War= Some 311 Harrier pilots in 1991In 1988 VMA-311 received its first AV-8B Harrier and shortly thereafter headed into harm's way again. On August 11, 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, VMA-311 deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield, leading all other Marine fixed-wing squadrons into Saudi Arabia where they were based out of King Abdulaziz Naval Base. While there, the Tomcats were the most forward deployed fixed-wing squadron. On January 17, 1991 while in support of Operation Desert Storm the squadron became the first to utilize the AV-8B in combat when a flight of four Harriers destroyed an Iraqi artillery position in support of the Battle of Khafji. During 43 days of air combat operations, Tomcat pilots flew 1,017 combat missions and delivered 840 tons of ordnance against enemy targets throughout Kuwait and Southern Iraq. A VMA-311 Harrier landing on USS Tarawa in 2001 =Global War on Terror= On November 3, 2001, VMA-311 Harriers attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked aboard became the first Harriers to fly combat missions in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. On January 15, 2003, the Marines of VMA-311 deployed to the Northern Persian Gulf as part of Amphibious Task Force West. On March 21, 2003, almost 59 years to the day after VMF-311‚Äôs first combat sortie in World War II, the Tomcats flew their first combat sortie of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war they flew over 550 sorties while dropping 77 tons of precision ordnance, destroying or neutralizing 132 Iraqi targets while operating from two amphibious assault carriers, and . The Tomcats returned from the Persian Gulf on July 24, 2003. In 2008, they later deployed in support of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, while simultaneously sending a detachment of Marines and Harriers to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. These deployments were soon followed in 2010 with deployments again to the 15th MEU, and a Unit Deployment Program to the Pacific region. While there, the Tomcats spent over two months aboard with the 31st MEU while participating in the multilateral exercises Cobra Gold 2010 and Balikatan 2010. VMA-311 deployed to Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from April to September 2013. = Future Plans = VMA-311 plans to start transitioning to F-35Cs in 2022 and conclude its transition in 2024.

Founded in 1978 by David Mees as Semiconductor Test Solutions, the company changed its name to Credence after acquiring Axiom and ASIX in 1990. The company's initial public offering was completed on October 28, 1993. It was publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol CMOS before the merger with LTX in 2008. It was headquartered in Milpitas, California, and was established in twenty countries. Customers included integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), wafer foundries, outsource assembly and test (OSAT) suppliers and fabless chip companies. Product Lines Over the years Credence either produced or acquired many product lines including: * STS6000 and STS8000 - The earliest STS test product, these purely digital automatic IC testers started as Sentry compatible clones. The programming language was lifted from the Sentry Factor standard and renamed EnFact, for ENhanced FACTor. * AT100/STS3000/STS4000/STS5000 - These Mixed Signal (Analog and Digital) automatic IC testers were derived from the Axiom Technology AT100 located in Burlington, MA. Later this product line was renamed Domain. * SC212 - This line was derived from the ASIX digital automated IC tester acquired from Asix Systems in California. This was one of the first testers touted as having \\"zero footprint\\", there being a test head with only a tiny cabinet providing power and airflow instead of a large mainframe taking up test floor space. * Vista/Duo/Quartet - This product line was derived from the Tektronix LT1000 product offering after Credence bought the Semiconductor Test Systems division from Tektronix. * Valstar - A digital automated IC test system of up to 1024 pins. This was one of the few testers Credence made from scratch, as opposed to most of the others which were captured through acquisitions. * Sapphire - An IC test system intended primarily for production testing with multisite capabilities, i.e., the option to test multiple chips in one go. It can be scaled to varying requirements, with a top clock rate of more than 6.4 GHz. In January 2008, Credence decided to stop developing the Sapphire platform, reduce its workforce by 35%, and close the main development site for the platform in Saint-√âtienne, France (previously part of Schlumberger, then NPTest). * Diamond - comprising two system targeted at both chip development testing and production testing, primarily for applications that are cost- sensitive. * ASL - A product series of three distinct models. The entry model has very low environment requirements; it is unusual among ATEs in that is needs neither water nor specialized power supply. The ASL models are targeted at RF applications such as video, or wireless telecommunication chips. The ASL product line was acquired with the TMT, Inc. acquisition.

It is operated by ExxonMobil (40%) and also sponsored by partners forming the consortium, Petronas (35%) and Chevron (25%). The governments of Chad and Cameroon also have a combined 3% stake in the project. The project was launched on October 18, 2000, and completed in June 2003 (the official inauguration took place in October of the same year). It was largely funded by multilateral and bilateral credit financing provided by Western governments. The International Finance Corporation, the private- sector arm of the World Bank, provided $100 million of debt-based financing, and France's export credit agency COFACE and the U.S. Export-Import Bank each provided $200 million; private lenders coordinated by the IFC provided an additional $100 million. Background The original consortium of oil companies involved in the pipeline project were Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, and Elf Aquitaine. Negotiations started in 1988, with Chad and a consortium of oil companies signing a 30-year oil concession in the southern Chad region of Doba., Delescluse, Aude Chad-Cameroon: A Model Pipeline? 2004. In 1999, Royal Dutch Shell and Elf Aquitaine dropped the project due to controversies surrounding the project and volatile oil prices. As a result, Exxon opened the project up for bid to a select few corporations and in April 2000, Petronas of Malaysia and Chevron acquired stakes in the project.Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline: A Case Study from New Era, Center for Energy Economics, University of Texas at Austin Exxon then enlisted the support of the World Bank to raise support within the international community. The World Bank agreed on the condition that certain environmental and social standards were enforced both in Chad and Cameroon, and that the revenues be put towards improving social and economic conditions. ParticipantsChad= Since 1990, President Idriss Deby has been the head of government in Chad, where presidential elections are held every five years. Chad's economy is dependent mainly on agriculture and livestock. It heavily relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital, as well as international investment projects. Because of Chad's landlocked borders, its economy struggles from a lack of resources and instability between rebel groups. The country also serves as a host to thousands of refugees from neighboring Sudan and Central African Republic, as well as many victims of human trafficking. Oil exploitation is estimated at a potential 1.5 billion barrels, and Chinese companies are currently developing an oil refinery and another pipeline in the country. CIA World Factbook: Chad The Tchad Oil Transportation Company (TOTCO) manages the pipeline within Chad that is owned by the country. TOTCO is incorporated in Tchad, and is a joint venture between Chad and the Upstream Consortium. =Cameroon= The Republic of Cameroon has been ruled by President Paul Biya since November 6, 1982. A relatively peaceful and stable nation, Cameroon is a republic with a multiparty presidential regime. Although there are presidential elections every seven years, there are no term limits. A climate of intense corruption has created an unequal distribution of wealth and poor conditions for domestic and international investments.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the- world-factbook/geos/cm.html CIA World Factbook: Cameroon The portion of the pipeline owned by Cameroon is managed by the Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO). This company is incorporated in Cameroon, and is a joint venture between the governments of Cameroon and Chad, and the Upstream Consortium, an independent monitoring institution. =World Bank= The World Bank's support was very important for the Consortium of oil companies, as they believed they needed the support of the Bank in order for the project to succeed. While the project's private sponsors, the Upstream Consortium, provided about 95% ($2.2 billion) of the financing for the pipeline, the World Bank also contributed through debt financing. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided a loan of about $100 million, $85.8 million of which went to COTCO and $14.2 million of which went to TOTCO, and also helped secure an additional $300 million in private commercial lending. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) provided $92.9 million to Chad ($39.5 million) and Cameroon ($53.4 million) to finance the joint-venture pipeline companies. Last of the World Bank-provided financing was given through the European Investment Bank, which provided $46.6 million to finance Cameroon and Chad's equity in COTCO and TOTCO. Included in plans for the project was a revenue management law developed by the World Bank. This separated the oil revenues given to Chad into four required areas: a Future Generations Fund, health, education and other development projects, a fund to compensate the Doba region of Chad from where the oil was extracted and government reserves. The revenue management law also created the Petroleum Revenue Oversight Committee, which oversees how the oil revenues are spent, and includes members of both the Chadian government and civil society. CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES STATEMENT ON THE LAUNCH OF CHAD-CAMEROON OIL PIPELINE PROJECT, October 2009 On September 5, 2008, Chad fully prepaid both the IBRD and IDA components of the World Bank loan totaling $65.7 million from its \\"national coffers swollen by more than $1 billion a year in oil revenues\\". This ended its involvement in the project. The World Bank noted that, \\"over the years, Chad failed to comply with key requirements of this agreement\\", including devoting a substantial portion of the oil revenues to poverty reduction programs, and thus it \\"concluded that it could not continue to support this project under these circumstances\\". Controversy The pipeline project has been affected by persistent charges and fears about corruption and the diversion of revenues‚Äîostensibly intended for poverty reduction‚Äîtowards arms purchases, particularly by the regime of Chadian President Idriss D√©by. Delphine Djiraibe, a human rights attorney who became one of the leading critics of these arms purchases, was later awarded the 2004 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for her work against the project. Opposition leader and parliamentarian Ngarledjy Yorongar of the Front of Action Forces for the Republic (FAR) accused National Assembly President Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue of taking a bribe from Elf, then a partner in the project, in 1997. Yorongar was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and detained for nine months.IRIN- West Africa Update 221, 3 June 1998 In November 2000, the World Bank announced that $4 million of a $25 million signing bonus from the oil companies was spent by the Chadian government on weapons. The World Bank required tight restrictions on oil revenues as a condition of its loans. In January 2006, Chad moved to unilaterally increase the portion of oil revenues going to its general fund from 15 to 30 percent.Emad Mekey, Chad Dilutes Oil-For- Development Pledge , 2 January 2006 On 28 August 2006, President D√©by ordered Chevron and Petronas to quit the country.Chad oil company deadline expires, BBC News, 28 August 2006 =Environmental impacts= In Chad and especially Cameroon, through which the pipeline stretches 890 km of the total 1,070 km, there have been claims of adverse effects of the construction and maintenance of the pipeline on the indigenous communities and environment. One of the largest areas affected is in the coastal Cameroonian town of Kribi. Located off the coast of Kribi is the export terminal facility. There has been much controversy regarding the alleged degradation the coastal reefs during construction. This has not only impacted the underwater habitat, but also the livelihoods of the local people who depend on fishing as their main source of income.Shombong, Nkushi Francis, \\"Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project: Impact Assessment of the Project to the Local Community: Case Study of the Ocean Division of Cameroon\\", thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of M.Phil. degree in Resources and Human Adaptations, University of Bergen, Norway, Department of Geography, p 2. Since completion of the pipeline in 2003, there have been two known oil leaks at the transfer site off the shore of Cameroon. The first occurred on January 15, 2007. Representatives for COTCO claimed that the leak was contained within a few hours and that the amount of spilled was not sufficient to cause any harm, though local fishermen did claim to have seen traces of the oil ashore. The second oil spill was on April 22, 2010, at the same site. COTCO stated that the leaked oil amounted to less than five barrels. Cameroonian NGOs Relufa and Centre pour l'Environnement et le D√©veloppement have brought to light the inefficiencies of the oil-spill preparedness plan, as well as the lack of communication between COTCO and the surrounding communities. International involvementNon-governmental institutions= Non-governmental organizations have played a large role in mediating the concerns of the international community with the needs of the indigenous communities of Chad and Cameroon. Even before construction commenced on the pipeline project in 2000, international and local NGOs were monitoring the situation and meeting with representatives from the World Bank and the Consortium of gasoline companies. After the completion of the project, NGOs were also very involved with documentation of any problems and worked in conjunction with external independent monitoring agencies. In 2005, under the direction of the World Bank's International Advisory Group, a group of stakeholders including COTCO, the CPSP and multiple NGOs created a platform under which complaints registered with the World Bank by organizations and individuals could be resolved. According to FOCARFE (Fondation Camerounaise d'Actions Rationalisees et de Formation sur l'Environnement), more than 300 civil society complaints existed by the close of construction in 2003.FOCARFE, Minutes of the Information Day on the Social Statement on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project, 2009 In November 2006, the stakeholders involved in the project came together to discuss their views, main issues and concerns for a Forum of Information on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project. The stakeholders involved were the Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO), the Comit√© de Pilotage et de Suivi des Pipelines (the Pipelines Steering and Monitoring Committee) and a group of four Cameroonian NGOs: CED (Centre pour l'Environnement et le Developpement), RELUFA (Reseau de Lutte contra le Faim), CARFAD (African Center for Applied Forestry Research and Development) and FOCARFE (Fondation Camerounaise d'Actions Rationalisees et de Formation sur l'Environnement). The meeting was held to discuss a wide array of topics, including the monitoring of the pipeline activities, environmental and social compensation plans, CAPECE's capacity building objectives and the involvement of NGOs. *Environmental Defense *Friends of the Earth Friends of the Earth is a transnational grassroots environmental network. The organization brings together and mobilizes social and environmental advocacy groups from all over the world to rally behind certain issues. While FOE has been involved in documentation and monitoring of pipeline project since its construction, the organization more recently developed a report in 2008 condemning a World Bank initiative for \\"New Climate Funds\\". Along with four other advocacy organizations, FOE stated that the World Bank had repeatedly engaged in projects, such as the Chad- Cameroon pipeline, that actually negatively affected the environment and only added to pollution. *Centre pour L'Environnement et le Developpement The Center for Environment and Development is a Cameroon-based NGO founded and run by native lawyer Samuel Nguiffo. The CED's main purpose is to advocate and campaign against the \\"liquidation of the regions forests for short-term profit\\". Certain exploitations within the Cameroon region include logging, hunting for bushmeat, mining for natural resources and the construction of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The CED works to inform local communities about their rights to land and community forest concessions, as well as constant documentation and publications to educate the international community. *RELUFA: R√©seau de Lutte contre la Faim *CARFAD (African Center for Applied Forestry Research and Development) *FOCARFE (Fondation Camerounaise d'Actions Rationalis√©es et de Formation sur l'Environnement) *Catholic Relief Services Catholic Relief Services, an international nonprofit humanitarian organization, has been one of the key watchdogs in the pipeline project, even before construction was completed. In a statement made in October 2003, they stated their concerns for the people and environment of both Chad and Cameroon, and anticipated negative effects of the pipeline for the future. One of their main concerns for the project was the potential mismanagement of profit funds by Chad and Cameroon, as well as the ineffectiveness of policies mandated by the World Bank.CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES STATEMENT ON THE LAUNCH OF CHAD-CAMEROON OIL PIPELINE PROJECT, October 2003 The Cameroon Chad Pipeline Monitoring Project is an initiative created by CRS that supports the efforts of Cameroonian NGOs as they advocate for proper use of profits from the pipeline, as well as the communities and environment surrounding the pipeline. One of the main efforts of the Catholic Relief Services has been to review and correct compensation packages received by those located along the pipeline, as well as advocating for fair salaries for local workers contracted by the oil companies.

Specifically it is used to treat active drug resistant tuberculosis together with other antituberculosis medications. It has also been used as a second line agent to sulfasalazine in people with inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is typically taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other side effects may include liver inflammation and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with end stage kidney disease. While there does not appear to be harm with use during pregnancy it has not been well studied in this population. 4-Aminosalicylic acid is believed to work by blocking the ability of bacteria to make folic acid. 4-Aminosalicylic acid was first made in 1902, and came into medical use in 1943. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. , a course of treatment for tuberculosis costs about US$2,700. Medical uses The main use for 4-aminosalicylic acid is for the treatment of tuberculosis infections. In the United States, 4-aminosalicylic acid is indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other active agents. In the European Union, it is used in combination with other medicines to treat adults and children from 28 days of age who have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis when combinations without this medicine cannot be used, either because the disease is resistant to them or because of their side effects. =Tuberculosis= Aminosalicylic acid was introduced to clinical use in 1944. It was the second antibiotic found to be effective in the treatment of tuberculosis, after streptomycin. PAS formed part of the standard treatment for tuberculosis prior to the introduction of rifampicin and pyrazinamide. Its potency is less than that of the current five first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin) for treating tuberculosis and its cost is higher, but it is still useful in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. PAS is always used in combination with other anti-TB drugs. The dose when treating tuberculosis is 150 mg/kg/day divided into two to four daily doses; the usual adult dose is therefore approximately 2 to 4 grams four times a day. It is sold in the US as \\"Paser\\" by Jacobus Pharmaceutical, which comes in the form of 4 g packets of delayed-release granules. The drug should be taken with acid food or drink (orange, apple or tomato juice). PAS was once available in a combination formula with isoniazid called Pasinah or Pycamisan 33. 4-aminosalicylic acid was approved for medical use in the United States in June 1994, and for medical use in the European Union in April 2014. =Inflammatory bowel disease= 4-aminosalicylic acid has also been used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), but has been superseded by other drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. =Others= 4-aminosalicylic acid has been investigated for the use in manganese chelation therapy, and a 17-year follow-up study shows that it might be superior to other chelation protocols such as EDTA. Side effects Gastrointestinal side-effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) are common; the delayed-release formulation is meant to help overcome this problem. It is also a cause of drug-induced hepatitis. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should avoid taking aminosalicylic acid as it causes haemolysis. Thyroid goitre is also a side- effect because aminosalicylic acid inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Drug interactions include elevated phenytoin levels. When taken with rifampicin, the levels of rifampicin in the blood fall by about half. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigned 4-aminosalicylic acid to pregnancy category C, indicating that it is not known whether it will harm an unborn baby. Pharmacology With heat, aminosalicylic acid is decarboxylated to produce CO2 and 3-aminophenol. =Mode of action= 4-aminosalicylic acid has been shown to be a pro-drug and it is incorporated into the folate pathway by dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS) to generate a hydroxyl dihydrofolate antimetabolite, which in turn inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzymatic activity.  History  4-aminosalicylic acid was first synthesized by Seidel and Bittner in 1902. It was rediscovered by the Swedish chemist J√∂rgen Lehmann upon the report that the tuberculosis bacterium avidly metabolized salicylic acid. Lehmann first tried PAS as an oral TB therapy late in 1944. The first patient made a dramatic recovery. The drug proved better than streptomycin, which had nerve toxicity and to which TB could easily develop resistance. In the 1948, researchers at Britain's Medical Research Council demonstrated that combined treatment with streptomycin and PAS was superior to either drug alone, and established the principle of combination therapy for tuberculosis. Other names Like many commercially significant compounds, 4-aminosalicylic acid has many names including para- aminosalicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 4-ASA, and simply P.

Royal mistress In 1691, during one of his visits to the German Quarter, young Peter I of Russia became enamoured of Anna Mons, the daughter of Dutch wine merchant Johan Mons. His origins were from Westphalia in Germany . Her younger brother was Willem Mons (1688‚Äì1724), destined to be the Imperial Chamberlain to Catherine I and Matrena her sister who married Fedor Balk, Major General and Governor of Riga. Her niece was the infamous Natalia Lopukhina (1699‚Äì1763) later victim of the so-called Lopukhina Affair in 1742. As Peter's relations with the tsarina Eudoxia Lopukhina gradually worsened, Anna Mons took the place as his permanent and semi-official royal mistress. In the 1690s, he gave her 295 farms and a mansion near Moscow. The relationship lasted for 12 years. Arrest and death After Peter divorced Lopukhina, Anna had ambitions of marrying Peter herself, but by 1703 she feared he had lost interest in her and she took up a flirtation with the Prussian ambassador Keyserling in an effort to rekindle Peter's affections. Keyserling proposed marriage, provoking Peter to have Anna expelled from her estate and placed under house arrest along with her mother, sister and thirty friends. Peter later allowed the two of them to marry, which they did in 1711. Anna died three years later of consumption. Aftermath In 1707, Peter I married again, to Marta Helena Skowro≈Ñska, later to become Catherine I of Russia, who dyed her hair black so she would not resemble flaxen-haired Anna Mons. Anna's younger brother, Willem Mons, became the Secretary and friends with Catherine. He was an old friend of Peter's, having taken part in the Battle of Poltava. Willem was charged and executed for abusing his access to the Empress, along with his sister Matrena, who was beaten and exiled to Tobolsk, Siberia. Matrena's husband was given permission to remarry. The siblings were accepting bribes for their influence, according to the favour asked and position of the petitioner, despite having wealth and property bestowed upon them due to their positions. The night before the execution, Peter told Willem, although he was sorry to lose such a talented man, Willem's execution was imperative. Matrena was later restored to favour by Catherine after the death of Peter. Willem's head, preserved in alcohol, was displayed in a museum, originally the summer palace of the Tsar. It remains on display to the present day.

He was a member of the Country Liberal Party, representing the northern Darwin seat of Jingili in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1984. He briefly served as Deputy Majority Leader (the equivalent of a deputy premier in the states) under Goff Letts from 1974 to 1975. He remained on the backbench for the remainder of the First Assembly. Just months after being re-elected to the legislature, he was named leader of the CLP and Majority Leader after Letts was unexpectedly defeated in his own electorate despite the CLP comfortably winning another term in government. He thus oversaw the transition to self- government, which occurred in 1978. At that time, he became Chief Minister with greatly expanded powers. As the second and longest-serving head of government in the Territory, he led the CLP to comprehensive election victories in 1980 and 1983. During his tenure, the Northern Territory was essentially a one-party state; he never faced more than seven opposition MLAs. In mid-1984, Everingham resigned as CLP leader and from the Legislative Assembly to seek election to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for the Division of Northern Territory. He was initially heavily favoured against Labor incumbent John Reeves. However, Reeves significantly closed the gap during the campaign. On election day, the race was very close, but Everingham's first-count lead proved too much for Reeves to overcome. He was elected on the fourth count, winning by 1,800 votes. Everingham set a precedent during his single term in Canberra when he chose to sit with the Liberals. Federal CLP parliamentarians had long been expected to sit with the Nationals, since the CLP has full voting rights with the Nationals and observer status with the Liberals. Since Everingham's tenure, however, subsequent CLP members of the House of Representatives have sat with the Liberals, but CLP Senators have continued to sit with the Nationals in the Senate. After his time in the House of Representatives, Everingham had a stint as President of the Queensland Liberal Party. ReferencesExternal links *Biography for EVERINGHAM, the Hon.

The squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 31 and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing HistoryWorld War II= Marine Attack Squadron 513 was first commissioned as VMF-513 on February 15, 1944 at Marine Corps Auxiliary Field Oak Grove, North Carolina, flying the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The squadron was transferred to Marine Corps Air Facility Walnut Ridge, Arkansas in September 1944. VMF-513 logo during World War II In December of the same year, the squadron moved to Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station Mojave, California where it was re-designated VMF(CVS)-513. On June 15, 1945, VMF(CVS)-513 departed San Diego, California, aboard the USS Vella Gulf (CVE-111) and participated in carrier operations in the Pacific, making stops in Ewa, Enewetak, Saipan, and Guam. In addition, they provided close air support for the 3rd Marine Division during the Battle of Okinawa, Japan. =Korean War= Between World War II and the Korean War, VMF-513 operated from Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. Transitioning to the F4U-5N, the squadron was re-designated VMF(N)-513 (\\"Night Fighters\\"). In August 1950, the squadron deployed to Japan under operational control of the U.S. 5th Air Force. The squadron nickname \\"Flying Nightmares\\" was coined by then Commanding Officer, LtCol James R. Anderson, USMC, in March 1951 because he thought it most appropriately described his outfit . At this time the squadron, with its 15 F7F \\"Tigercats\\" and 15 F4U-5N \\"Corsairs,\\" were flying out of Pusan West (K-1) Air Base and providing the sole night fighter air defense and interdiction support to all UN forces. In this month alone, the squadron flew 2,086 hours in 604 night combat sorties, inflicting severe damage on the Chinese Forces tactical and logistical units. During the summer of 1952, VMF(N)-513 received the F3D Skyknight, the squadron's first jet aircraft. Due to losses being incurred by B-29 Superfortresses on nighttime raids over North Korea, 1st MAW was asked to assign their night fighter squadron to escort the aircraft.Bevilacqua, Allan C. (May 2009). \\"The Tale of \\"Willie the Whale\\". Leatherneck, p. 42‚Äì43. On the early morning of November 3, 1952, VMF(N)-513 made aviation history with the first radar kill on an enemy jet aircraft at night, when Maj. William T. Stratton Jr., and MSgt Hans Hoglind shot down a North Korean Yak-15. The squadron was credited with 10 confirmed night kills during the Korean War. A F4U-5N from VMF(N)-513 in 1950 during the Korean War. An F7F-3N of VMF(N)-513 at Wonsan, Korea, in 1950. Following the war, the squadron operated out of NAS Atsugi, Japan. On 26 July 1958, VMF-513 received the F4D Skyray aircraft. In October 1962, VMF(AW)-513 was relocated from NAS Atsugi Japan to MCAS El Toro, California. The outfit was effectively disbanded in Japan and reformed in El Toro under a new CO, who organized new pilots and maintenance Marines to operate the now \\"old\\" F-4D Skyrays while the Flying Nightmares awaited delivery of the brand new F-4 Phantom II. This occurred in early 1963 and most of the Nightmare pilots did their transition training at nearby NAS Miramar, at the Navy's replacement squadron. =The 1960s= F-4Bs of VMFA-513 in 1964 On August 1, 1963, the squadron was re-designated VMFA-513 and by the end of the year, the Nightmares were exclusively flying F-4's, the third Phantom II squadron in the Marine Corps. They trained in the F-4B at MCAS El Toro through October 1964, when they deployed once again to NAS Atsugi, Japan. In June 1965, the Nightmares replaced VMFA-531 at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam for five months of combat and, for a while, were the only Marine jet fighters in country. In August 1965, VMFA-513 supported the 7th Marine Regiment in Operation Starlite‚Äîthe first major American operation of the war.Lehrack The First Battle, p.68. This one-year overseas deployment ended in October 1965 and the squadron executed another wholesale personnel rotation, this time reforming at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. =The 1970s and 1980s= The first USMC AV-8As went to VMA-513 in 1970. The squadron flew the F-4B \\"Phantom\\" until June 30, 1970, when it was re-commissioned as cadre, awaiting delivery of the first Marine AV-8A Harrier on April 16, 1971 and re-designation as VMA-513. Upon reassignment to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, VMA-513 departed the U.S. during July 1974 aboard the for MCAS Iwakuni, and a six-plane detachment left in September 1974 for a six-month Mediterranean cruise aboard the . During November 1976, VMA-513 returned to the United States and was assigned to Marine Combat Crew Readiness Training Group 10 at MCAS Yuma, Arizona (re- designated Marine Aircraft Group 13 on October 1, 1987). VMA-513 deployed as part of HMM-265 (REIN) ‚ÄòDragons‚Äô aboard USS Tarawa (LHA-1) as part of Task Group 76.3/Amphibious Ready Group Alfa/Amphibious Squadron Seven, from 14 October 1980, visiting Subic Bay, PI and participating in exercises Valiant Blitz in the Philippines, Amphibious Squadron Seven spent almost a week at Phattaya Beach, from 22 to 27 December, before moving on to Singapore where she arrived on the 30th. After operations in Diego Garcia where Amphibious Squadron Seven's embarked Marines carried out a landing exercise between 28 and 30 January, they headed south east for exercise Valiant Usher 81-3 off Lancelin, Western Australia with units of the Australian Military. After Valiant Usher off Western Australia, VMA-513 and Amphibious Squadron One conducted an R&R; visit to Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 8‚Äì13 February 1981. The squadron later took part in exercises Team Spirit 81 and Valiant Flex 81-2 at Pusan (Busan) South Korea. VMA-513 arrived back at MCAS Yuma, AZ on or about 16 April 1981. In October 1987, the squadron received the improved AV-8B Harrier II. =The Gulf War= VMA-513 during the Gulf War In February 1991, VMA-513 deployed for operations in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield, employing their new Harrier II's in support of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit; logging 103 combat sorties with no losses. At this time, VMA-513 effectively conducted combat operations from austere sites in Southwest Asia. The Nightmares returned home with all of their assets and no loss of life or major injury. Throughout the 1990s and early 21st century the squadron continued to support Marine Expeditionary Units aboard ship for normal six-month-long deployments to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf. =Global War on Terror= Squadron CO's AV-8B Harrier II in June 2007. From October 2002 to September 2003, VMA-513 (-) (REIN) deployed to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan for combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Throughout their year in sustained combat, the Marines and Sailors of VMA-513 (-) (REIN) provided close air support, armed reconnaissance, and combat escort for the United States and over 20 Coalition countries of the Combined Joint Task Force 180. Throughout its time in combat in Afghanistan, the squadron amassed 1,250 combat sorties and 3,763.6 flight hours with only six aircraft while operating from a remote austere forward combat base. Additionally, VMA-513 (-) (REIN) flew 1,833.7 nighttime hours; thus, providing day and night precision strike capability for American and Coalition units with the newly introduced Litening II Targeting Pod. VMA-513 (-) (REIN) supported numerous US and Coalition operations that led to the capture or destruction of many Al Queda and Taliban enemy forces. While the squadron minus was deployed to Afghanistan, a six plane detachment was also deployed twice with Marine Expeditionary Units aboard ship and flew combat missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and operations on the Horn of Africa. In February 2006, the Flying Nightmares were again deployed to Al Asad Airbase, Iraq, to provide close air ground support for ground units in the Iraq area. The squadron flew 4519 combat hours with a sortie completion rate of over 95%. On May 11, 2006, VMA-513 became the first Harrier unit to drop a JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) in combat when it struck targets with a GBU-38 500 lb JDAM. =Decommissioning and Recommissioning= On July 12, 2013, VMA-513 was decommissioned after 69 years of service. The squadron's remaining aircraft were transferred to sister squadron, VMA-214. The squadron was recommissioned on June 26, 2020 as Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 502.

Name The name \\"Vojvodina\\" (–í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞) in the Serbian language simply means \\"voivodship\\" or \\"duchy\\". Its original historical name (from 1848) was \\"Serbian Voivodship\\" (Serbian Vojvodina). The Serbian language uses two more varieties of the word Vojvodina. These varieties are Vojvodovina (–í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞), and Vojvodstvo (–í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ), the latter being an equivalent to the Polish word for province, wojew√≥dztwo (voivodship).

Since 2006, the region is part of independent Serbia. An autonomous region named Serbian Vojvodina was proclaimed in the May Assembly, which was organized by local Serbs in 1848. Due to the advance of the Hungarian army in 1849 and disagreements between Serb leaders, the autonomous Serb region ceased to exist in 1849 and the remains of its army joined the Austrian imperial army. Later in that year (1849), after the Austrian and Russian armies defeated the Hungarians, a separate Habsburg crownland named the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was formed. It existed from 1849 to 1860 and covered a larger territory than the original Serbian Vojvodina. After World War I, in 1918, the Assembly of local Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja declared the secession of these regions from the Kingdom of Hungary and the creation of an administrative province named Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja, which joined the Kingdom of Serbia. Its borders with newly independent Hungary were defined by the Treaty of Trianon (1920). In 1929 the region became a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia named Danube Banovina. From 1944 to 1945 until the breakup of Yugoslavia it was an autonomous province, of socialist Serbia and Yugoslavia. Together with Kosovo and Metohija, it enjoyed highly autonomous status between 1974 and 1990. Early history Ancient peoples (Illyrians, Dacians, Celts, Sarmatians, and others) in the territory of modern Vojvodina. The territory of present-day Vojvodina has been inhabited since the Paleolithic period. Indo-European peoples moved into this area during three migration waves, in 4200 BC, 3300 BC, and 2800 BC. Before the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of Illyrian, Thracian and Celtic origin inhabited the region. Some of the important tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina were: Agatirses, Dacians (Thracian tribes), Amantini, Breuci, Pannonians (Illyrian tribes), and Skordisces (Celtic tribe). The later Roman province of Pannonia was named after one of the Illyrian tribes from the region ‚Äì the Pannonians. Romans The Romans conquered this region in the 1st century BC. Opposing Roman rule, the Illyrian tribes started an uprising in 6 AD. The leaders of this uprising were Baton and Pines, the first named individuals known to be from the present-day Vojvodina territory. The Banat region was a part of the Roman province Dacia, while the Syrmia region was part of the province Pannonia. Sirmium (today Sremska Mitrovica) was an important Roman town. It developed into the economic capital of Roman Pannonia and later became one of the four capital cities of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy. Six Roman Emperors were born in this city or in its surroundings: Decius Traian (249‚Äì251), Aurelian (270‚Äì275), Probus (276‚Äì282), Maximianus Herculius (285‚Äì310), Constantius II (337‚Äì361) and Gratian (367‚Äì383). These emperors mostly were Romanized Illyrians by origin. Although the southern and eastern parts of present-day Vojvodina (Syrmia and Banat) were part of the Roman Empire, the north-western parts (Baƒçka) were inhabited and ruled by the Iazyges, an Iranian tribe.

Image:Prefecture_of_Illyricum_map.pngSirmium, capital of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and one of 4 capitals of the Roman Empire. Migrations The Huns drove the Romans out of Pannonia after A.D. 395. The rule of the Huns lasted a little over half a century, and the region then became part of the Byzantine Empire. Much of Syrmia was part of the Byzantine province of Pannonia in the 6th century; its capital was Sirmium. The area was later conquered by the Gepids and, for a short time, Sirmium became a capital of the Gepid Kingdom. In 567, the Gepids were defeated by the Avars who established their rule over the region. Slavs Voivodship (duchy) of Salan, 9th century. Slavs (Severans, Abodrites, Braniƒçevci, Timoƒçani, and Serbs) settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries AD, but pockets of Romanized population remained in the area. Serbs were recorded in northern Banat from the year 567. In the beginning of the 9th century, Syrmia was for the short time part of the state of Ljudevit Posavski (Pannonian Duchy or Pannonian Croatia) and after the Frankish conquest of the region, the Bulgarian Empire conquered its eastern part. In the 9th century, the territory of present-day Vojvodina became a part of the Bulgarian Empire. Salan, a Bulgarian voivod (duke), ruled the territory of Baƒçka, and his capital city was Titel. Another Bulgarian voivod, Glad, ruled in Banat. His descendant was Ahtum, a voivod of Banat, the last ruler who opposed the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary. Ahtum was an Orthodox Christian. In the 11th century, the ruler of Syrmia was Sermon, a vassal of the South Slavic emperor Samuil, who ruled from Ohrid. Sermon produced his own golden coins in present-day Sremska Mitrovica. After the Slavic Empire was defeated by the Byzantine Empire, Sermon was captured and killed because he chose not to co-operate with the new authorities. Kingdom of Hungary and medieval Serbs The Hungarians (or Magyars) arrived in the Pannonian Plain during the last decade of the 9th century. Hungarian rule was established in parts of the territory of present-day Vojvodina, beginning from the 10th century. Baƒçka came under Hungarian rule in the 10th century after the Hungarians defeated Salan. Banat came under Hungarian rule in the 11th century after the defeat of Ahtum, while Syrmia came under Hungarian rule in the 12th century after the Kingdom of Hungary conquered it from the Byzantines. Before the Hungarian conquest, a province of the Byzantine Empire named Theme Sirmium existed in the territory of Syrmia. In the 13th century, the territory of present-day Vojvodina was divided into several counties: Baƒç (Bacsensis) and Bodrog (Bodrogiensis), both in the region of Baƒçka, Syrmia (Sirmiensis) and Vukovar (Vukovariensis), both in the region of Syrmia, and Kovin (Covinum) in the region of Banat. =Kingdom of Syrmia= Stefan Dragutin, king of Syrmia (1282‚Äì1316). Between 1282 and 1316 the Serbian King Stefan Dragutin ruled the Kingdom of Syrmia, which consisted of the north- western parts of present-day Central Serbia (including Maƒçva, Braniƒçevo, Podrinje, etc.), south-western part of present-day Vojvodina (northern part of the region of Maƒçva),http://www.rodnikraj.eu/index_htm_files/239.png as well as Usora and Soli in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. His capital cities were Debrc (between Belgrade and ≈†abac) and Belgrade. At that time, the name Syrmia was a designation for two territories: Upper Syrmia (present-day Syrmia) and Lower Syrmia (present-day Maƒçva). The Kingdom of Syrmia under the rule of Stefan Dragutin was located in Lower Syrmia. Another local ruler, Ugrin ƒåak, ruled over Upper Syrmia, Slavonija, Baƒçka and Banat, and his residence was in Ilok. At first, Stefan Dragutin was a vassal of the Hungarian king, but after the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, both, Stefan Dragutin and Ugrin ƒåak became de facto independent rulers. Stefan Dragutin died in 1316, and was succeeded by his son, King Vladislav II (1316‚Äì25), while Ugrin ƒåak died in 1311. Vladislav II was defeated by the king of Serbia, Stefan Deƒçanski, in 1324, and after this, Lower Syrmia became a subject of dispute between the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Hungary. After the death of Ugrin ƒåak, Upper Syrmia, southern Baƒçka and south-western Banat were placed under authority of the Hungarian king. =Serbian despots= Though Serbs were part of the aboriginal Slavic population in the territory of present-day Vojvodina (especially in Syrmia), an increasing number of Serbs began settling from the 14th century onward. By 1483, according to a Hungarian source, as much as half of the population of the territory of Vojvodina consisted of Serbs. Serbian despots Stefan Lazareviƒá and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá also had their personal possessions in the territory of present-day Vojvodina (and Pannonian part of present-day Belgrade), which included Zemun, Slankamen, Kupinik, Mitrovica, Beƒçej, and Veliki Beƒçkerek, which were given to the despot Stefan Lazareviƒá (who was a tertiary vassal or a majordomo of Sigismund) in 1404 by Hungarian king Sigismund. https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082638/http://www.slankamen.org.yu/slankamen/ss.html In 1417, Apatin is also mentioned among his personal possessions. Later in the 15th century, the Serbian despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá became the single largest landowner in the Kingdom of Hungary, possessing estates as far afield in the Banat, Transylvania and the region around Debrecen. For that he received the title of baron in the Kingdom of Hungary. However, after Brankoviƒá's dealings with the Turks were discovered in 1455 (leading among other things to Hunyadi's defeat at the battle of Kosovo), his estates were confiscated and placed under the stewardship of Hunyadi (who was acting regent at the time). After the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbian Despotate (in 1459), titular despots of Serbia has received from Hungarian kings territory of late ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and they have continued to control parts of the territory of present-day Vojvodina until Ottoman conquest in 1526. The residence of the despots was Kupinik (today Kupinovo) in Syrmia, while other important places that were in possession of the despots included Slankamen, Berkasovo, Beƒçkerek, etc. The Serbian despots in Syrmia were: Vuk Grgureviƒá (1471‚Äì85), ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá (1486‚Äì96), Jovan Brankoviƒá (1496‚Äì1502), Ivani≈° Berislav (1504‚Äì14), and Stevan Berislav (1520‚Äì35). The last two titular despots of Serbia, Radiƒç Bo≈æiƒá (1527‚Äì28) and Pavle Bakiƒá (1537) did not rule in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but had possessions in the territories of present-day Romania and Hungary. According to people's tradition, Stefan ≈†tiljanoviƒá was also an (unofficial) Serbian despot (from 1537 to 1540). His residence was in the town of Moroviƒá in Syrmia. The fact that titular Despots of Serbia controlled the territory of present-day Vojvodina, but also the presence of large Serb population, are the reasons because in many historical records and maps, which were written and drawn between 15th and 18th centuries, territory of present-day Vojvodina was named Rascia (Serbia) and Little Rascia (Little Serbia). See also Rascians. Ottoman Empire, Jovan Nenad and Radoslav ƒåelnik Monument to Emperor Jovan Nenad in Subotica. Jovan Nenad, 1526‚Äì27. citation needed The Ottoman Empire took control of the territory of present-day Vojvodina following the Battle of Moh√°cs of 1526 and the conquest of Banat in 1552. This turbulent period caused a massive depopulation of this region, with most of the Hungarians and Catholic Croats (≈†okci) fled to the north, and were replaced by Serb and Muslim inhabitants. Soon after the Battle of Moh√°cs, Jovan Nenad, a leader of the Serb mercenaries, established his rule in Baƒçka, northern Banat and a small part of Syrmia. He created an ephemeral independent state, with Subotica as its capital. At the pitch of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the assassination of Jovan Nenad, the general commander of his army, Radoslav ƒåelnik, moved with part of the former emperor's army from Baƒçka to Syrmia, and acceded into the Ottoman service. Radoslav ƒåelnik then ruled over Syrmia as Ottoman vassal and took for himself the title of the duke of Syrmia, while his residence was in Slankamen. During the Ottoman rule, most of the inhabitants of the territory of present-day Vojvodina region were Serbs. During that time, villages were mostly populated with Serbs, while cities were mostly mixed with various Muslim populations including islamized Serbs. Eyalet of Teme≈üvar (Turkish province) existed in Banat after 1552, while the Sanjak of Syrmia and the Sanjak of Szeged existed in Syrmia and Baƒçka. In 1594 Serbs in Banat staged an uprising opposing Ottoman rule. This was one of three largest Serbian uprisings in history, and the largest before the First Serbian Uprising led by Karaƒëorƒëe. Habsburg RuleHungarian Crown Land (1699-1849)= The Habsburg Monarchy took control of the territory of present-day Vojvodina among other lands by the treaties of Karlovci (1699) and Po≈æarevac (1718). The areas adjacent to the Ottoman territory (entire Syrmia and eastern Baƒçka) were incorporated into the Military Frontier (its Slavonian, Tisa, and Danube sections), while western Baƒçka was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. The Banat of Temeswar was established as a separate military province of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1718, and remained under military administration until 1751, when Maria Theresa introduced a civil administration. The Banat province was abolished in 1778. The southern part of the Banat remained inside the Military Frontier (Banat Krajina) until it was abolished in 1871. In 1745, northern Syrmia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Slavonia, a Habsburg land, mainly inhabited by Serbs and Croats. (According to 1790 data, population of the Kingdom of Slavonia was composed of: Serbs (46.8%), Croats (45.7%), Hungarians (6.8%), etc.) The south-eastern parts of Syrmia remained within the Military Frontier. The end of the Ottoman rule dramatically altered the demographic character of the territory of present-day Vojvodina region, as much of the ethnic Serb population had been decimated through warfare. The Muslim population also fled from the region and some of them found refugee in Ottoman Bosnia. The Serbian patriarch, Arsenije III ƒåarnojeviƒá, fearing the revenge of the Ottomans for the Serbian rebellion, immigrated in the last decade of the 17th century to the Habsburg Monarchy with about 60‚Äì70,000 Serb refugees, but they mostly settled in the territory of what is now Republic of Hungary and only small part of them settled in western Baƒçka in present-day Vojvodina. However, because of this event, the Habsburg Emperor promised religious freedom to all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy, as well as the right to elect their own \\"voivod\\" (military and civil governor). Much of the territory of present-day Vojvodina where Serbs lived was incorporated into the Military Frontier. Serbian (Illyrian Nation) privileges in the Habsburg Monarchy - a book from 1732. Serbs were a recognized nation in the Habsburg Monarchy. The emperor also recognized Serbs as one of the official nations of the Habsburg Monarchy and he recognized the right of Serbs to have territorial autonomy within one separate voivodship. This right, however, was not realized before the revolution in 1848‚Äì49. The immigration of Serbs to the Habsburg Monarchy was maintained during the 18th century. In 1687, the northern parts of the region were settled by ethnic Bunjevci. During the Kuruc War (1703‚Äì11) of Francis II Rakoczi, the territory of present-day Vojvodina was a battlefield between Hungarian rebels and local Serbs who fought on the side of the Habsburg Emperor. Serbs in Baƒçka suffered the greatest losses. Hungarian rebels burned Serbian villages and many Serbs were expelled from Baƒçka. Darvas, the prime military commander of the Hungarian rebels, which fought against Serbs in Baƒçka, wrote: \\"We burned all large places of Rascia, on the both banks of the rivers Danube and Tisa\\". It is estimated that Hungarian forces killed about 100,000 Serbs. During the Habsburg rule many non-Serb colonists also settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina. They were mainly (Catholic) Germans and Hungarians, but also Ruthenians, Slovaks, Romanians, and others. The Donauschwaben, or Danube Swabians established many settlements in the area during the reign of Maria Theresa. Because of this colonization, Serbs lost the absolute ethnic majority in the region, and territory of present-day Vojvodina became one of the most ethnically diverse regions of Europe. However, there was also some emigration from the territory of present-day Vojvodina: after the Tisa-Mori≈° section of the Military Frontier was abolished, many Serbs from the north-eastern parts of Baƒçka left this region and immigrated to Russia (notably to Nova Serbia and Slavo-Serbia) in 1752, and this region was then populated with new Hungarian settlers. Many Hungarians came after 1867, when Austro-Hungarian Compromise was reached and Austria-Hungary as a dual monarchy was established. Serbs, however, remained the single largest ethnic group in the territory of present-day Vojvodina, until the second half of 20th century, when they became the absolute majority again. \\"The long 19th century\\" (1789‚Äì1914) was marked by rapid population increase, prosperity, sustained economic development, expansion of the transportation infrastructure, and despite the birth of the various national and reform movements also of relatively peaceful inter-ethnic relations and the reconstruction of the educational system. It was a period of integration into Europe, both economically and spiritually. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, territory of present-day Vojvodina was the cultural centre of the Serbian people. Especially important cultural centres were: Novi Sad, Sremski Karlovci, and the monasteries of Fru≈°ka Gora. In the first half of the 19th century, Novi Sad was the largest Serb city; in 1820 this city had about 20,000 inhabitants, of whom two-thirds were Serbs. Novi Sad had an elected mayor that was alternately German or Serb. The Matica Srpska moved to that town from Budapest in 1864. The Serbian gymnasiums of Novi Sad and Sremski Karlovci were at the time considered to be among the best in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Novi Sad has been referred to as \\"the Serb Athens\\" for this reason. Revolutions and Serbian autonomy Proclamation of Serbian Vojvodina in 1848 in Sremski Karlovci. Proclaimed borders of the Serbian Voivodship in 1848. Economical and cultural development was only interrupted by the Revolutions in 1848‚Äì49. The human and material losses in the Baƒçka and Banat regions were the greatest in the entire Austrian Empire. During the Revolution, the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Kingdom of Hungary at that time; according to data from 1842, only 38% of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Hungary were Hungarians, with the rest of the population being Slavs, Romanians, and Germans. Wishing to express their national individuality and confronted with the new Hungarian authorities, Serbs declared the constitution of the Serbian Voivodship (Serbian Duchy) at the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (May 13‚Äì15, 1848). The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Syrmia, Baƒçka, Banat, and Baranja regions. The Serbs also formed a political alliance with the Croats \\"based on freedom and perfect equality\\". They also recognized the Romanian nationality. The metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, Josif Rajaƒçiƒá, was elected patriarch, while Stevan ≈†upljikac the first voivod (duke). A National committee was formed as the new government of the Serbian Voivodship. Instead of the old feudal regime a new reign was founded based on the national boards with the Head Serbian National Board presiding. The Hungarian government replied by the use of force: on June 12, 1848, a war between Serbs and Hungarians started. Austria took the side of Hungary at first, demanding from the Serbs to \\"go back to being obedient\\". Serbs were aided by volunteers from Serbia. A consequence of this war, was the expansion of the conservative factions. Since the Austrian court turned against the Hungarians in the later stage of revolution, the feudal and clerical circles of the Voivodship formed an alliance with Austria and became a tool of the Viennese government. Serbian troops from the Voivodship then joined the Habsburg army and helped in crushing the revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary. With the help of Imperial Russia, the forces of reaction smothered the revolution in the summer of 1849, defeating all the national and social movements in the Habsburg Monarchy. =Austrian Crown Land (1849-1860)= After the defeat of the revolution, by a decision of the Austrian emperor, in November 1849, a separate Austrian crown land known as the Voivodship of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat was formed as the political successor of the Serbian Voivodship. The crown land consisted of the parts of Banat, Baƒçka and Syrmia regions. An Austrian governor seated in Temeswar ruled the area, and the title of voivod (duke) belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \\"Grand Voivod of the Voivodship of Serbia\\" (German: Gro√üwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien). Even after this crown land was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918. The Voivodship's two official languages became German and \\"Illyrian\\" (what would become Serbo-Croatian), but in practice it was mainly German. Voivodship of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat, surrounded in green (Wojwodowina und Banat), 1849‚Äì1860. The ethnic composition of the Voivodship looked as follows: *Serbs, Bunjevci, ≈†okci and Croats = 386,906 **Serbs only = 321,110 **Bunjevci and ≈†okci = 62,936 **Croats = 2,860 *Romanians = 347,459 *Germans = 335,080 *Hungarians = 221,845 *Rusins = 39,914 *Slovaks = 25,607 *Bulgarians = 22,780 *Jews = 15,507 *Gypsies = 11,440 *Czechs = 7,530 *Greeks and Cincars = 2,820 The Voivodship was ethnically very mixed, since the southern parts of Syrmia, Banat and Baƒçka with compact Serb settlements were not included into it, while eastern Banat, with a Romanian majority was added to it. Some Serbs saw this as a divide and rule tactic by Vienna to dilute the Serbs in the Voivodship and create an autonomous region Serbian only in name, precisely by leaving out the regions with the most Serbian concentration. Yet, Serbian (Illyrian) language was official in the Voivodship, and Serbs participated in large number in the regional administration. After the abolishment of the Voivodship, both, Serbs and Romanians protested against this act, while Hungarians and Germans supported the abolishment. Vojvodina remained Austrian Crown land until 1860, when Emperor Franz Joseph decided that it will be a Hungarian Crown land again. =Hungarian Crown Land (1860-1918)= In 1860, the Voivodship of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Baƒçka) was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, when the Kingdom of Hungary gained autonomy within the newly formed Austria-Hungary. Unlike Banat and Baƒçka, the Syrmia region was in 1860 incorporated into the Kingdom of Slavonia, another separate Habsburg crown land. However, the Kingdom of Slavonia was too incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary in 1868. By 1881, territory of the former Voivodship of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat was administratively divided into five counties: Baƒçka-Bodrog (B√°cs-Bodrog), Syrmia (Szer√©m), Torontal (Toront√°l), Tami≈° (Temes), and Kara≈°-Severin (Krass√≥-Sz√∂r√©ny). Syrmia county was part of the autonomous region Croatia-Slavonia. After the Voivodship was abolished, one Serb politician, Svetozar Miletiƒá, appeared in the political sphere. He demanded national rights for Serbs and other non-Hungarian peoples of the Kingdom of Hungary, but he was arrested and imprisoned because of his political demands. During the second half of the 19th century the region's Serb, Hungarian, German, Croat, and Slovak farmers turned it into the most productive agricultural region of the Kingdom; its excellent products were exported all over Europe. Serbia and Yugoslavia parts of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja recognized as a territory of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes at a 1919‚Äì20 Paris Peace Conference. Danube Banovina in 1931. At the end of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. On October 29, 1918, Syrmia became a part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On October 31, 1918, the Banat Republic was proclaimed in Timi»ôoara, and the government of Hungary recognized its independence. This republic was short- lived; after several days, Serbian troops entered Banat and crushed the Republic. On November 25, 1918, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other Slavs of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina (Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja) with the Kingdom of Serbia (The assembly numbered 757 deputies, of whom 578 were Serbs, 84 Bunjevci, 62 Slovaks, 21 Rusyns, 6 Germans, 3 ≈†okci, 2 Croats, and 1 Hungarian). Most deputies of the assembly were Serbs, and other local Slavs, since they mostly came from Slavic- inhabited parts of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja, and not from areas with non- Slavic (Romanian, German or Hungarian) populations. The assembly also formed a local provincial government (People's Administration) and parliament (Great People's Council), which administered Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja until March 11, 1919. One day before the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other Slavs of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja, on November 24, the Assembly of Syrmia also proclaimed the unification of Syrmia with Serbia. On December 1, 1918, Vojvodina became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Treaty of Versailles of 1919 and the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 defined the borders of the Kingdom with Romania and Hungary. Vojvodina itself was internationally recognized as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the Treaty of Saint-Germain in September 10, 1919. According to these treaties, the Banat region was divided between Romania, Kingdom of SCS, and Hungary, while Baƒçka and Baranja were divided between the Kingdom of SCS and Hungary. These peace agreements would assign most Hungarian-inhabited and most Romanian-inhabited parts of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja to Hungary and Romania respectively. In 1921, unsatisfied with the decision of the 1920 peace treaty to assign these territories to Hungary, the South Slavic population of Baranja and north-west Baƒçka proclaimed the short-lived Baranya-Baja Republic. Between 1929 and 1941, the region was known as the Danube Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The capital city was Novi Sad. Danube Banovina consisted of Syrmia, Baƒçka, Banat, Baranja, ≈†umadija, and Braniƒçevo regions. The population of this province was composed of: Serbs and Croats (56.9%), Hungarians (18.2%), Germans (16.3%), and others. =World War II= Monument in Novi Sad dedicated to Serb and Jewish civilians killed in 1942 raid. The Axis Powers occupied the region between 1941 and 1944. Baƒçka and Baranja were attached to Horthy's Hungary, while Syrmia was attached to the Independent State of Croatia. A smaller Danube Banovina (including Banat, ≈†umadija, and Braniƒçevo) existed as part of Serbia between 1941 and 1944. The administrative centre of this smaller province was Smederevo. Banat itself was a separate autonomous region ruled by its German minority. The occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the civilian population, especially against Serbs, Jews and Roma; the Jewish population of Vojvodina was almost completely killed or deported. During the four years of occupation, about 50,000 people in Vojvodina were murdered, while more than 280,000 people were interned, arrested, violated or tortured. Most of them were civilians and were not members of the resistance movement. Due to anti-German sentiment caused by the war crimes of the German army in Yugoslavia during the war, most of the ethnic Germans were expelled from the country (Vojvodina included) after the end of the war. =Post war period= Vojvodina map. The region was politically restored in 1944 (incorporating Syrmia, Banat, Baƒçka, and Baranja) and became an autonomous province of Serbia in 1945. Instead of the previous name (Danube Banovina), the region regained its historical name of Vojvodina, while its capital city remained Novi Sad. When the final borders of Vojvodina were defined, Baranja was assigned to Croatia, while the northern part of the Maƒçva region was assigned to Vojvodina. At first, the province enjoyed only a small amount of autonomy within Serbia, but it gained extensive rights of self-rule under the 1974 constitution, which defined Vojvodina as one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation, and also gave it voting rights equivalent to Serbia itself on the country's collective presidency. Under the rule of Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Vojvodina and Kosovo lost most of their autonomy in September 1990. After this, the Vojvodina was no longer a subject of the Yugoslav federation, but again only the autonomous province of Serbia, with limited autonomy. The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars contributed to the increase of ethnic tensions, with many refugee Serbs, Romani and Ashkali who were driven from Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo being resettled in Vojvodina. On May 13, 2000, Bo≈°ko Pero≈°eviƒá, the President of the Provincial Executive Council of Vojvodina, was assassinated in Novi Sad by Milivoje Gutoviƒá, a supposedly mentally ill security guard at an agricultural fair Pero≈°eviƒá was opening that day. As Gutoviƒá was an alleged member of the anti-Milo≈°eviƒá organization Otpor!, it became a pretext for a government crackdown on the organization. The fall of Milo≈°eviƒá in 2000 created a new climate for reform in Vojvodina, with the province's ethnic minorities strongly supporting the new government in Belgrade. Following talks between the parties, the province was given increased autonomy by the omnibus law in 2002. Vojvodina adopted a new flag in 2004.

Hendon Lane and the Church West ward of Finchley Urban District in the 1930s. The entrance to St Mary's church Finchley's oldest church, St Mary-at-Finchley, was established sometime in the 12th century, early documents mention it from the 1270s, and by 1356 it was dedicated to St Mary. The building has been altered many times since its foundation and the oldest parts, the north wall and the tower (which seems to have had a steeple during the 16th and 17th centuries), date from the reign of Henry VII. The organ, which dates from 1878, was from Henry Willis & Sons, the famous organ builders. In the churchyard are the graves of Thomas Payne, the radical and bookseller, and Major John Cartwright the political reformer. Next to the church in Hendon Lane stood the Old Queen‚Äôs Head, which took its name from Queen Anne, and was owned by the Finchley Charities. In 1833 the original inn burned down and was rebuilt, surviving until the lease on the house came up in 1857. The rector of Finchley, Thomas Reader White, refused to renew the lease on the house and the inn did not move to its present location as the New Queen‚Äôs Head, in East End Road until the 1860s. White renamed the buildings Finchley Hall and used it to house a school of the same name which later became Christ's College Finchley. In 1902 Finchley Council took over the hall for offices but bomb damage (1940) made the building unsafe and they were demolished shortly after. Church End Library (1960) now occupies the site. From 1787 to 1880 a cage for criminals stood between the Church and the Old Queen‚Äôs Head. The Anglican community established a National school in 1813 which was rebuilt as St Mary's School in 1852. In 1990 the school was re- established near to the brook at Dollis Park and now only the infants' section, built in 1902, remains on the original location. The site of the main school building is now occupied by Barnet Civil and Family Courts Centre, which opened in 1993. It was announced in 2014 that the adjacent former infants' section building, having survived a threat of demolition, would enjoy a change of use and become a synagogue. Finchley's old rectory, first mentioned in 1476, also stood near the church and in 1810 was chiefly built of timber, with roofs of slate and tiles. Ralph Worsley, rector 1794‚Äì1848, went to live at Moss Hall in Nether Street, which his wife had inherited, whereupon the rectory house was leased. One of the first actions of Thomas Reader White, rector 1848‚Äì77, was to replace the old house with one to the north, built in stock brick to the design of Anthony Salvin. In 1974 a smaller rectory was built to the west and the Victorian one was demolished. During the English Civil War, the church's old Norman font was buried in the rectory garden; it was rediscovered in Victorian times and now stands in the church. Consulted 3 September 2016. In 1888 Finchley Council established a voluntary fire brigade in Hendon Lane near the top of Gravel Hill which remained at this location until 1933 (see Long Lane). In 1904 Finchley obtained the first motorised fire engine in Great Britain (see picture and article). Gravel Hill gets its name from the gravel pits which dotted the area in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At the top of Gravel Hill a house, now converted into apartments, stands on the site of the old village pond, which was filled in around 1900. Close by is Finchley Garden Village which was developed around a green in 1910 as a small garden suburb. At the bottom of Hendon Lane is a lane curiously named Crooked Usage. Originally a part of Hendon Lane, its picturesque name dates from the straightening of Hendon Lane in 1911‚Äì12. Regents Park Road and Ballards Lane Until the 1820s the only route north from Temple Fortune to Finchley was along a road called Ducksetters Lane (known as such by 1475). This ran close to the present Regents Park Road, and terminated where the junction with Gravel Hill is today. The road then passed along the very top part of Hendon Lane, before continuing north as Ballards Lane (known as such since 1424). There had been a number of larger houses in Ballards Lane since the 15th century of which only the 18th-century Cornwall House in Cornwall Avenue, now remains. The King of Prussia public house was a licensed property by the middle of the 18th century and may have originally been the King‚Äôs Head. It was substantially rebuilt in the 1960s and was later called The Dignity. The pub closed in October 2016 and was replaced by a chicken restaurant. In June 2019, after a largely local campaign, the restaurant closed and was turned into a pub again, retaking the name The King Of Prussia. It occupies the ground floor of a six-storey block containing offices and the Travelodge Finchley. In 1826 an Act of Parliament meant the construction of a new turnpike road between Marylebone and North Finchley which, in Church End, is now called Regents Park Road and replaced Ducksetters Lane. The people of Finchley continued to use the old lane as the tollgate, situated in Ballards Lane at the junction of Nether Street, meant that parishioners had to pay to use their main thoroughfare. After much protest the gate was moved to just south of the junction of East End Road and was shortly afterwards removed. It was commemorated with a blue plaque put up at the Queen‚Äôs Head by the Finchley Society, but the pub closed in 2012 and is now apartments. By 1845 Peter Kay had established a garden nursery on Ballards Lane, which was closed by 1895 (see also Long Lane), and in 1874 William Clements started a nursery on a triangular plot at the junction of Regents Park Road and Hendon Lane. Ford Madox Brown lived at 1 Grove Villas on Regents Park Road between 1853 and 1855 where he painted a number of agricultural scenes and, most notably, \\" The Last of England\\". In 1867 Finchley and Hendon station was opened by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway which became later Finchley (Church End) station and finally, in 1940, Finchley Central station. The establishment of a railway and the removal of the tollgates enabled the development of residential streets and a row of shops, Albert Terrace and The Railway Hotel. This was demolished in 1962 and replaced with an office block, and on the ground floor a pub called The Minstrel, which became The Central and then a wine bar and restaurant, now (2019) closed. The area was still a village until news of a possible tramline between Golders Green and North Finchley encouraged suburban development. From the railway station north as far as Long Lane parades of shops were built from 1893 onwards, and were well established when in 1909 the trams were introduced. In 1911 King Edward's Hall replaced Clements' nursery and was used as a VAD hospital during World War I. The Alcazar Cinema (1913) between Princes Avenue and Redbourne Avenue was renamed the Bohemia in 1915 and during the 1920s relocated south to where Gateway House was later built. Gateway House was demolished at the end of 2015 and the site has been redeveloped, now containing a new public library and a small supermarket, with five floors of apartments above. At the northern end of the shopping area is Finchley Police Station, which closed in 2012 and in 2019 still awaits redevelopment. There had been a police station in Finchley from 1873 but the present location dates from 1886 when Wentworth Lodge in Ballards Lane was bought. The old police station continued from 1889 until 1965 when it was rebuilt. Across the road from the police station is Victoria Park (approx 18 acres). Opened in 1902, it was intended to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and was Finchley's first public park. It contains a playground, tennis courts, a cafe and a lawn bowls and croquet club with two greens. From 1905 Victoria Park was the location of the Finchley Carnival. Finchley Manor and surrounding district Wards of Finchley Municipal Borough in the 1950s. Running west to east from Church End to East Finchley is East End Road. This was possibly Piryton Lane (known in 1423). Midway along this road is the manor house for the Bibbesworth estate, Finchley's principal manor house. Bibbesworth was a sub-manor which had been born from an earlier estate owned by a family styling itself the Finchleys during the 13th century (although whether the area takes its name from the family or the other way round has never been entirely clear). By 1319 it was being called a manor. Richard Rook had a court in 1364 and these court leets and baron continued until the last was held in 1936. There was certainly a manor house by 1253 but this burnt down and was replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries. Of the original building only a ditch, possibly a moat, remains. The only Lord of note is William Hastings, Lord Hastings (d. 1483), whose family held the manor until 1527. From 1622 until 1830 the manor was controlled by the descendants of Edward Allen, a London merchant. The last to hold the manor was Edward Cooper Arden and the last court was held in 1936. The manor house seen today, now the Sternberg Centre, was built in 1723 by the Allens. The house was used as a boys‚Äô school between 1819 and 1857. Between 1863 and 1882 it was the residence of George Plucknett, a magistrate, who used the main hall to hear cases. Between 1921 and 1981 the order of Ste Marie Auxiliatrice used the building as a girls' school. Until the beginning of the 20th century a curious oblong pond with a central island existed opposite the manor and was known locally as the ‚Äúmoat‚Äù; however these are more likely to have been fish ponds or openings created by the extraction of clay for making bricks for the building of the 16th-century building. The lane known as The Avenue, which runs behind Avenue House, is derived from a line of trees planted by Elizabeth King whose husband was lord of the manor in the 1600s. Built in 1859, Avenue House and ten acres of grounds were bought in 1874 by the ink manufacturer, philanthropist and later MP Henry 'Inky' Stephens and left on his death to the people of Finchley in 1918, the grounds later becoming a public park. The estate is now (2014) known as Stephens House and Gardens. East of the manor house was Manor Farm where details of the calf and the cart in Dante Gabriel Rossetti‚Äôs painting \\"Found\\" was painted. Finchley Cricket Club and an LA Fitness now occupy the site. Long Lane Another road running from Church End to East Finchley is Long Lane (known as such by 1719) which may have been known in medieval times as Ferrours Lane. Roughly halfway along its route at a crossroads is Squires Lane which runs from the manor house to the High Road, the traditional division between East Finchley and Church End. Behind the large houses which fronted the west side of Ballards Lane, Squires Lane and Long Lane, was Claigmar Vineyards, started in 1874 by Peter Edmund Kay. By the 1890s the vinery‚Äôs 161 greenhouses were producing ‚Äú100 tons each of grapes and tomatoes and 240,000 cucumbers a year‚Äù. In 1903 Finchley Electric Light Company opened a generating station on the vineyard site which was purchased by the Finchley Council two years later and later still, in 1955, by the Eastern Electricity Board. Sir Charles Redvers Westlake, who was engineer at the works between 1935‚Äì1948, was later responsible for the building of the Owen Falls dam, Uganda. The site is now the headquarters of the Pentland Group of companies. Also on Squires Lane, Finchley Urban District Council opened its first swimming pool in 1915, which was closed in the 1990s. The swimming baths were demolished and replaced by terraced housing. Further along the road Squires Lane School was built in 1906; this became Manor School in 1932 and Manorside School in 1936. Nether Street and West Finchley Nether Street was recognised by the mid-14th century as an old street, sometimes called ‚ÄúLower Street‚Äù in later periods. Essentially an access road to properties and land, the most important of which were Moss Hall (see North Finchley) and Brent Lodge. Brent Lodge was built on land which had been part of ‚ÄúWarren‚Äôs Gift‚Äù, a charitable estate, sometime between 1817 and 1824. It was a substantial property whose grounds were considerably reduced during the 1920s. The house was demolished in 1962 despite efforts by the comedian Spike Milligan and the Finchley Society. West Finchley station on the LNER railway opened on 1 March 1933 and became part of the London Underground upon electrification on 14 April 1940. Nether Street has one claim to fame as the childhood home of the actor Terry-Thomas who received some of his early education at Fernbank School in Hendon Lane. West of Nether Street is Dollis Brook, a tributary of the River Brent which forms the western boundary between the ancient parishes of Finchley and Hendon. The viaduct carrying the Mill Hill East branch of the Northern line at the bottom of Dollis Road was built between 1863 and 1867 to designs by Sir John Fowler. It has thirteen arches and is, at 80 feet high, the highest point above sea level on the London Underground system. Beyond is a very large house called Nether Court. This estate was originally in the Mill Hill district of Hendon, but was brought into Finchley during boundary changes made in 1933. The house was built for local businessman Henry Tubbs in 1883 to the design of architect Percy Stone. Tubbs allowed Finchley Golf Club to use the grounds in 1892. The club ceased after 1914 but returned in 1930. A row of California redwood sequoia trees may be seen nearby. At 60 Court House Road there is a plaque placed by the Finchley Society to Harry Beck, designer of the London Underground tube map, who lived here from 1936 until 1960 and used Finchley Central tube station where a replica map and commemorative plaque may be seen on the southbound platform.

Random House, Inc. 13 Jan. 2015. Definition and meanings R. Bruce Hoadley wrote that grain is a \\"confusingly versatile term\\" with numerous different uses, including the direction of the wood cells (e.g., straight grain, spiral grain), surface appearance or figure, growth-ring placement (e.g., vertical grain), plane of the cut (e.g., end grain), rate of growth (e.g., narrow grain), and relative cell size (e.g., open grain).Hoadley, R. Bruce. \\"Glossary.\\" Understanding Wood: A Craftsman's Guide to Wood Technology. Newtown, Conn.: Taunton, 1980. 265. Print. Physical aspects Perhaps the most important physical aspect of wood grain in woodworking is the grain direction or slope (e.g. against the grain). The two basic categories of grain are straight and cross grain. Straight grain runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of the piece. Cross grain deviates from the longitudinal axis in two ways: spiral grain or diagonal grain. The amount of deviation is called the slope of the grain. In describing the application of a woodworking technique to a given piece of wood, the direction of the technique may be: * with the grain (easy; giving a clean result) * against the grain (heavy going; giving a poor result such as chipping or tear-out) * across the grain (direction of cut is across the grain lines, but the plane of the cut is still aligned with them) * end grain (at right angles to the grain, for example trimming the end of a plank) Grain alignment must be considered when joining pieces of wood, or designing wooden structures. For example, a stressed span is less likely to fail if tension is applied along the grain, rather than across the grain. Grain direction will also affect the type of warping seen in the finished item.Wood Movement, WoodworkDetails.com In describing the alignment of the wood in the tree a distinction may be made. Different tree species may have one of the following basic grain descriptions and types: * straight - grain which runs in a single direction, parallel to the axis of the tree. Woods with this grains are the easiest to work. * spiral - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree. * interlocked - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree, but reverses its direction for periods of years resulting in alternating directions of the spiral grain. On quartersawn surfaces the change in grain direction creates a ribbon stripe figure. These are the most difficult to work. * wavy - grain which grows in a wavy fashion up the trunk; seen best in flatsawn sections of wood. * irregular - grain that swirls or twists. It can be found in a number of different patterns. This can be caused by factors such as knots, burls or \\"crotch\\" wood - where large branches separate from the trunk. Sketch of A--Quarter-sawn & B--flat-sawn typically figured red gum table fiddleback figure Aesthetic aspects In its simplest aesthetic meaning, wood grain is the alternating regions of relatively darker and lighter wood resulting from the differing growth parameters occurring in different seasons (i.e., growth rings) on a cut or split piece of wood. Causes including fungus, burls, stress, knots, special grain alignments, and others produce figure in wood. Their rarity often promotes the value of both the raw material, and the finished work it becomes a part of. These include: * bird's eye * quilted * fiddleback * curly The way a given piece of wood has been sawn affects both its appearance and physical properties: * flat-grain: flat-sawn, slab-sawn, plain sawn, bastard-sawn,Punmia, B.C., Ashok Kumar Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain.

Biography Background = His first musical training was at the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts. After high school, he studied saxophone at the University of Southern California and graduated from California State University at Long Beach where he studied clarinet. Early mentors include clarinetists Kenny Davern, Tony Scott and soprano saxophonist George Probert. =Career= Tours with singer-songwriter A.J. Croce in the early 1990s brought Christopher to New Orleans. He moved to Crescent City in 1994 and enjoyed varied work before leaving to join the Jim Cullum Jazz Band in San Antonio, Texas in 1996. For nearly three years, he appeared nightly as their featured clarinetist and recorded episodes of the syndicated radio program Riverwalk Jazz. He returned to New Orleans but was forced to leave in 2005 when the federal levees failed because of Hurricane Katrina. He traveled continuously and lived briefly in Paris at the invitation of the French government. During this residency, he formed the Jazz Traditions PROJECT and Django √† la Cr√©ole. The latter fused Gypsy jazz with New Orleans grooves. Tours with Irvin Mayfield's New Orleans Jazz Orchestra made it possible for Christopher to return to New Orleans. He is a charter member of jazz composer guild, NOLA ArtHouse Music, and the Seahawk Modern Jazz Orchestra in southern California. Christopher published research on the New Orleans style of clarinet. In 2002 he began pursuing a degree in musicology at Tulane University.

Constantine-Silvanus is considered to be its founder. They flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and Eastern Anatolia and since then in Theme of Thrace of the Byzantine Empire. They had a widespread political and military influence in Asia Minor, including a temporary independent state in the mid-9th century centered in Tephrike, because of which were continuously persecuted by Byzantine emperors since the mid-7th century. They were also persecuted because of religious reasoning but were not during the periods of Byzantine Iconoclasm or their activity was ignored in exchange for military duties. Between the mid-8th and mid-10th century, Byzantine emperors forcibly moved many Paulician colonies to Philippopolis in Thrace to defend the empire's boundary with the First Bulgarian Empire as well to weaken Paulician influence in the East, where they were eventually brought to the Catholic Church at the time of emperor Alexios III Angelos. In Armenia the movement evolved into Tondrakism, while in Europe influenced the formation of Bogomilism, Catharism and other heretic movements. In Europe they are the ancestors of the Roman Catholic Bulgarians, specifically of Banat Bulgarians, and Muslim Bulgarians, specifically the Pomaks. History Middle Ages and move to Byzantine Empire = The sources show that most Paulician leaders were Armenians.Nersessian, Vrej: The Tondrakian Movement, Princeton Theological Monograph Series, Pickwick Publications, Allison Park, Pennsylvania, 1948, p.53. The founder of the sect is said to have been an Armenian by the name of Constantine, who hailed from Mananalis, a community near Samosata, Syria. He studied the Gospels and Epistles, combined dualistic and Christian doctrines and, upon the basis of the former, vigorously opposed the formalism of the church. Regarding himself as having been called to restore the pure Christianity of Paul the Apostle (of Tarsus), he adopted the name Silvanus (one of Paul's disciples), and about 660, he founded his first congregation at Kibossa, Armenia. Twenty-seven years later, he was arrested by the Imperial authorities, tried for heresy and stoned to death. Simeon, the court official who executed the order, was himself converted, and adopting the name Titus, became Constantine‚Äôs successor. He was burned to death (the punishment pronounced upon the Manichaeans) in 690. The adherents of the sect fled, with Paul at their head, to Episparis. He died in 715, leaving two sons, Gegnaesius (whom he had appointed his successor) and Theodore. The latter, giving out that he had received the Holy Ghost, rose against Gegnaesius but was unsuccessful. Gegnaesius was taken to Constantinople, appeared before Leo the Isaurian, was declared innocent of heresy, returned to Episparis, but, fearing danger, went with his adherents to Mananalis. His death (in 745) was the occasion of a division in the sect; Zacharias and Joseph being the leaders of the two parties. The latter had the larger following and was succeeded by Baanies in 775. The sect grew in spite of persecution, receiving additions from some of the iconoclasts. The Paulicians were now divided into the Baanites (the old party) and the Sergites (the reformed sect). Sergius, as the reformed leader, was a zealous and effective converter for his sect; he boasted that he had spread his Gospel \\"from East to West; from North to South\\".Petrus Siculus, \\"Historia Manichaeorum\\", op. cit., 45 At the same time the Sergites fought against their rivals and nearly exterminated them. The massacre of the Paulicians in 843/844, from the Madrid Skylitzes. Baanes was supplanted by Sergius-Tychicus in 801, who was very active for thirty-four years. His activity was the occasion of renewed persecutions on the part of Leo the Armenian. Obliged to flee, Sergius and his followers settled at Argaun, in that part of Armenia which was under the control of the Saracens. At the death of Sergius, the control of the sect was divided between several leaders. The Empress Theodora, as regent to her son Michael III, instituted thoroughgoing persecution against the Paulicians throughout Asia Minor,Leon Arpee. A History of Armenian Christianity. The Armenian Missionary Association of America, New York, 1946, p. 107. in which 100,000 Paulicians in Byzantine Armenia are said to have lost their lives and all of their property and lands were confiscated by the empire until 843.Norwich, John Julius: A Short History of Byzantium Knopf, New York, 1997, page 140 Paulicians, under their new leader Karbeas, fled to new areas. They built two cities, Amara and Tephrike (modern Divriƒüi). By 844, at the height of its power, the Paulicians established a principality of the Paulicians centered in Tephrike. In 856, Karbeas and his people took refuge with the Arabs in the territory around Tephrike and joined forces with Umar al-Aqta, emir of Melitene (who reigned 835‚Äì863).Digenis Akritas: The Two-Blooded Border Lord. Trans. Denison B. Hull. Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1972 Karbeas was killed in 863 in Michael III's campaign against the Paulicians and possibly was with Umar at Malakopea before the Battle of Lalakaon (863). Karbeas's successor, Chrysocheres, devastated many cities; in 867, he advanced as far as Ephesus, and he took many priests as prisoners. In 868, Emperor Basil I dispatched Petrus Siculus to arrange for their exchange. His sojourn of nine months among the Paulicians gave him an opportunity to collect many facts, which he preserved in his History of the empty and vain heresy of the Manich√¶ans, otherwise called Paulicians. The propositions of peace were not accepted, the war was renewed, and Chrysocheres was killed at Battle of Bathys Ryax (872 or 878).  Rise and fall to power and influence  The power of the Paulicians was broken. Meanwhile, other Paulicians, sectarians but not rebels, lived in communities throughout the Byzantine Empire. Constantine V had already transferred large numbers of them to Thrace. According to Theophanes, part of the Paulicians of Armenia were moved to Thrace, in 747, to strengthen the Bulgarian frontier with a reliable population.Nersessian, Vrej: The Tondrakian Movement, Princeton Theological Monograph Series, Pickwick Publications, Allison Park, Pennsylvania, 1948, p.51. By 872, the emperor Basil I conquered their strongholds in Asia Minor (including Tephrike) and killed their leader, and the survivors fled elsewhere in the Empire. One group went to the East to the Byzantine-Arab border - in Armenia, where in the 10th century the Tondrakian sect emerged. Others were transferred to the Western frontier of the empire. In 885, Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder had a military detachment of Paulicians serving in Southern Italy. In 970, some 200,000 Paulicians on Byzantine territory were transferred by the emperor John Tzimisces to Philippopolis in Theme of Thrace and, as a reward for their promise to keep back \\"the Scythians\\" (in fact Bulgarians), the emperor granted them religious freedom. This was the beginning of a revival of the sect in the West, however the policy of transfer besides limited economical and military benefits for the empire's Western frontier was disastrous to the empire. Not only Paulicians did not assimilate among the natives, but successfully continued the conversion of natives to their heresy. According to Anna Komnene, by the end of 11th century, Philippopolis and its surroundings were entirely inhabited by heretics and they were joined by new groups of Armenians. According to Annales Barenses, in 1041 several thousand were in the army of Alexios I Komnenos against the Norman Robert Guiscard but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison. By some accounts, Alexios Komnenos is credited with having put an end to the heresy in Europe. During a stay at Philippopolis, Alexios argued with the sect, bringing most, if not all, back to the Church (according to his daughter Anna Komnene in her \\"Alexiad\\", XV, 9). For the converts the new city of Alexiopolis was built, opposite Philippopolis. After that episode, Paulicians, as a major force, disappear from history, but as a powerless minority, they would reappear in many later times and places. During the First Crusade some, called as \\"Publicani\\", were present in the Muslim army, but sometimes also helped the Crusaders. When Frederick Barbarossa passed near Philippopolis during the Third Crusade, on the contrary to the Greek inhabitants, they welcomed him as a liberator. In 1205 cooperated with Ivan Asen I to turn the city to the Second Bulgarian Empire. The term \\"Publicani\\" would be generally used for any heretic, even a political traitor, through Europe, often identified with the Bogomils, Cathars and Albigensians, because of which became a widespread consideration that Paulicians were the ancestors of Western Neo-Manichaean sects. = Modern age and Bulgarian Paulicians = According to the historian Yordan Ivanov, some of the Paulicians were converted to Orthodoxy, and Islam (Pomaks), the rest to the Roman Catholicism during the 16th or 17th century. At the end of the 17th century, the Paulician people were still living around Nikopol, Bulgaria and persecuted due to religious reasons by the Ottoman Empire. After the uprising of Chiprovtsi in 1688, a good part of them fled across the Danube and settled in the Banat region. There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarian Paulicians in Romania and Serbia today. However, they no longer practice their original religion since they converted to Roman Catholicism. After Bulgaria's liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878, a number of Banat Bulgarians resettled in the northern part of Bulgaria. In Russia, after the war of 1828‚Äì29, Paulician communities could still be found in the part of Armenia occupied by the Russians. Documents of their professions of faith and disputations with the Gregorian bishop about 1837 (Key of Truth, xxiii‚Äìxxviii) were later published by Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare. It is with Conybeare publications of the Paulicians disputations and The Key of Truth that Conybeare based his depiction of the Paulicians as simple, godly folk who had kept an earlier Adoptionistic form of Christianity. Doctrines Little is known of the tenets of the Paulicians except for the reports of opponents and a few fragments of Sergius' letters they have preserved. Some argue that their system was dualistic, while others add that it was also adoptionist in nature. They might have also been nontrinitarian, as Conybeare, in his edition of the Paulician manual The Key of Truth, concluded that \\"The word Trinity is nowhere used, and was almost certainly rejected as being unscriptural.\\"The Key of Truth. A Manual of the Paulician Church of Armenia. Page xxxv Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare \\"The context implies that the Paulicians of Khnus had objected as against those who deified Jesus that a circumcised man could not be God. ... The word Trinity is nowhere used, and was almost certainly rejected as being unscriptural.\\" In dualistic theology, there are two principles, two kingdoms. The Evil Spirit is the demiurge, the author and lord of the present visible world; the Good Spirit, of the future world. The Paulicians accepted the four Gospels (especially of Luke); fourteen Epistles of Paul; the three Epistles of John; the epistles of James and Jude; and an Epistle to the Laodiceans, which they professed to have. They rejected the First Epistle of Peter and the whole Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, as well as the Orthodox-Catholic title Theotokos (\\"Mother of God\\"), and they refused all veneration of Mary. They believed that Christ came down from heaven to emancipate humans from the body and from the world. Their places of worship they called \\"places of prayer\\", small rooms in modest houses. Although they had ascetic tendencies, they made no distinction in foods and practiced marriage. They called themselves \\"Good Christians\\" and called other Christians \\"Romanists\\". Due to iconoclasm they rejected the Christian cross, rites, sacraments, the worship, and the hierarchy of the established Church, because of which Edward Gibbon considered them as \\"worthy precursors of Reformation\\". Although the Paulicians have been traditionally and overreachingly labeled as Manichaeans, because of identification with Cathars and Waldensians as their ancestors, as Photius, Petrus Siculus, and many modern authors have held, they were not a branch of them.Charles L. Vertanes. The Rise of the Paulician Movement in Armenia and its Impact on Medieval Europe. Journal of Armenian Studies, NAASR, Cambridge, 1985-86, vol.II, No.2, p. 3-27. Mosheim was the first to give a serious criticism of identification with Manichaeans, as although both sects were dualistic, the Paulicians differed on several points, and themselves rejected the doctrine of the prophet Mani. Gieseler and Neander, with more probability, derived the sect from Marcionism, considering them as descendants of a dualistic sect reformed to become closer to Early Christianity yet unable to be freed from Gnosticism. Others doubted the resemblance and relation to both Manichaeism and Marcionism. Mosheim, Gibbon, Muratori, Gilles Quispel and others regard the Paulicians as the forerunners of Bogomilism, Catharism and other \\"heretic\\" sects in the West. By the mid-19th century the mainstream theory was to be a non-Manichaean, dualistic Gnostic doctrine with substantial elements of Early Christianity, closest to Marcionism, which influenced emerging anti-Catholic groups in Western Europe. However, it was primarily based on Greek sources, as later published Armenian sources did indicate some other elements, but the general opinion did not change. Conybeare studying Armenian sources concluded that they were survivors of Early Adoptionist Christianity in Armenia, and not dualism and Gnosticism, which consideration Garso√Øan related to earlier by Chel'tsov which argued their doctrine was not static yet showed marked evolution. Garso√Øan in a comprehensive study of both Greek and Armenian sources confirmed such conclusions, and that the new Byzantine Paulicianism independently manifested features of Docetism and dualism because of which could be called as Neo-Paulicianism. Another theory was held by Soviet scholars since 1940s who instead of theological origin rather argued a proletarian revolt which was expressed in the theological sense. Such an approach is supported by both Greek and Armenian sources, but it is very limited in explanation and description of the sect. The Paulicians were branded as Jews, Mohammedans, Arians, and Manich√¶ans; it is likely that their opponents employed the \\"pejorative\\" appellations merely as terms of abuse.John Goulter Dowling. A letter to S. R. Maitland. On the Opinions of the Paulicians, London, 1835. p. 50. They called themselves Christians,John Goulter Dowling. A letter to S. R. Maitland.

It is the third-largest winery in the state. History Mount Pleasant Winery was founded in 1859 by immigrant Georg Muench (1801‚Äì1879), a younger brother of Friedrich M√ºnch.Georg Muench, muenchfamilyassociation.comFINAL REPORT: SURVEY OF AUGUSTA, MISSOURI, dnr.mo.gov The Muench brothers chose this area because it reminded them of their former home in Nieder-Gem√ºnden, Upper Hesse, Germany. The winery had to close in 1920 because of Prohibition. It was reopened for production in 1966, the second winery in the state to open in the current era.Our Heritage, mountpleasant.com It has the third-largest wine production in the state. All wines are produced and bottled at the estate. In 1980, the Augusta AVA was the first American Viticultural Area designated by the United States government. The winery is situated on a south-facing bluff overlooking the Missouri River Valley. It has of vines in cultivation, growing 16 varieties of grapes. The winery has constructed a public wine garden and terraces that use the view to good advantage. In 1991, the owners were fined by the State of Missouri for allegedly importing an excessive amount of grape juice for inclusion in their wines.Lindecke, Fred W., \\"Missouri winery fined for importing too much California juice\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch (September 22, 1991) p. 3BPollack, Joe, \\"Mt.

The following year, the winery's owners, Lucian and Eva Dressel, were divorced, and as a result the winery was sold at auction. The winery stayed in the Dressel family, as the winning bid of $660,000 was made by Lucian Dressel's brother, Phillip, who promptly announced that Lucian would continue to manage the winery.\\"Bad debt squeezes St. Charles winery; Sale of property schedule for June 12\\", Kansas City Star (June 3, 1992) p.

It marked the end of the \\"Phoney War\\" and the beginning of World War II in Western Europe. A German fleet led by the cruiser Bl√ºcher was dispatched up the Oslofjord to begin the German invasion of Norway, with the objective of seizing the Norwegian capital of Oslo and capturing King Haakon VII and his government. The fleet was engaged in the fjord by Oscarsborg Fortress, an ageing coastal installation near Dr√∏bak, that had been relegated to training coastal artillery servicemen, leading the Germans to disregard its defensive value. However, unbeknownst to German military intelligence, the fortress' most powerful weapon was a torpedo battery, which would be used to great effect against the German invaders. The fortress' armaments worked flawlessly despite their age, sinking the Bl√ºcher in the sound and forcing the German fleet to fall back. The loss of the German flagship, which carried most of the troops and Gestapo agents intended to occupy Oslo, delayed the German occupation long enough for King Haakon VII and his government to escape from the capital. Before the battle As the political situation was chaotic, the 64-year-old commander, Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen, had not received any clear orders and had received no notice as to whether the approaching warships were German or Allied. He was well aware that Norway was officially neutral, but that the government was inclined to side with the British in case of direct Norwegian involvement in the war. Apart from the officers and NCOs, almost all the soldiers manning the fortress were fresh recruits, having only been conscripted seven days before, on 2 April. Because of the influx of 450 fresh recruits, the fortress' naval mines were not deployed on 9 April. Part of the recruits' training was to lay the mine barrier, a process planned for a few days later. =Torpedo battery= The commander of the torpedo battery at Oscarsborg had at the time of the battle been on sick leave since March 1940. Due to this, the retired Kommand√∏rkaptein (Commander Senior Grade) Andreas Anderssen, who lived in nearby Dr√∏bak, had been assigned as temporary commander for the battery. As an unidentified flotilla started forcing its way past the outer fortifications in the south of the Oslofjord, late at night on 8 April, Oberst Eriksen called Anderssen in and had him come down to the fortress. Kommand√∏rkaptein Anderssen donned his old uniform and was transported by boat over the fjord to the torpedo battery.Hansen 2005: 49 Anderssen would show himself worthy of the important task of leading the fortress' most lethal weapon system; having first served at the torpedo battery in 1909, he knew the ageing weapons intimately. When Anderssen had been called back into duty a month previously, he had been a pensioner for 13 years, having originally retired from his post as commander of the torpedo battery in 1927.Hansen 2005: 48 The battery had three torpedo tunnels which could fire six torpedoes without reloading and a total of nine torpedoes were stored and ready for use. BattleMain Battery rounds= One of the three main battery guns at Oscarsborg While the main combat station for the Main Battery and the commander of Oscarsborg fortress was on the island H√•√∏ya north-west of South Kaholmen, due to the special circumstances in 1940, Oberst Eriksen took position in the backup station on the eastern flank of the main battery at South Kaholmen. At 04:21 on 9 April, Eriksen gave the Main Battery guns the order to fire at the lead ship of the unknown flotilla forcing its way towards Oslo. Upon giving the command, Eriksen was questioned. He responded with his now famous response; \\"Either I will be decorated or I will be court martialled, Fire!\\" Two rounds from the Krupp guns Moses and Aron engaged the German cruiser at range. The two Norwegian guns had been loaded with live, high-explosive shells;Hauge 1995: 35 firing them \\"in anger\\" was a violation of the pre-war Norwegian rules of engagement which dictated warning shots be fired first, as had been the case at Oslofjord Fortress further down the fjord. Colonel Eriksen later explained his decision by alluding to the fact that the German naval force already had forced their way past the Oslofjord Fortress' forts and had received both warning shots and live rounds from these more outlying coastal fortifications. As the vessels had continued up the fjord toward the capital, Eriksen was of the opinion that he had the right to consider them enemy warships and to engage them as such. Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen, the commander of Oscarsborg, 9 April 1940 Map of Oslofjord and the fortress of Oscarsborg The first 28 cm shell hit Bl√ºcher right in front of the aft mast,Ribsskog 1998: 50 and set the midship area up to the fore mast on fire.Ribsskog 1998: 50‚Äì51 The second 28 cm round hit the base of the forward gun turret shortly thereafter, throwing large parts of it into the fjord and igniting further fires on board.Ribsskog 1998: 51 There was only time for the Main Battery to fire these two rounds, due to their slow reload time with only 30 untrained recruits manning them at the time. Only one gun crew of actual artillerymen was available, and two guns could only be made operational by splitting the real gunners between the two guns and using non- combatant privates to assist the gunners. The personnel pressed into service on the main guns included cooks woken up to man the Main Battery. There was no time to reload; there was not even time to fire the third gun, Josva, which was loaded but unmanned. The reason for the significant effect of the two 28 cm rounds on Bl√ºcher was that the first round penetrated the side of the ship and exploded inside a magazine containing cans of oil, smoke dispensers, incendiary bombs, aircraft bombs for the cruiser's Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes and depth charges. The bulkheads on that deck were blown out and the burning oil developed into an intense fire. The second 28 cm shell also knocked out the electricity central for the ship's main guns, rendering them unable to return fire. =Kop√•s and Husvik batteries= While fire raged aboard Bl√ºcher, the secondary Norwegian coastal batteries fired at her with guns ranging in calibre from the two small pieces at Husvik, intended to protect the fortress' missing mine barrier, to the three guns of the Kop√•s Battery on the eastern side of the fjord. The larger guns wrought havoc on board Bl√ºcher, while the 57 mm guns concentrated on the cruiser's superstructure and the anti-aircraft weapons,Fjeld2 1999:36 and were partially successful in suppressing the fire from her light artillery as Bl√ºcher slowly sailed past the fortress. The Husvik battery had to be abandoned when Bl√ºcher passed in front of it and fired her light AA guns directly down into the positions. Although the main building at the battery caught fire, the Norwegians suffered no casualties. In all, thirteen 15 cm rounds and around thirty 57 mm shells hit the German cruiser as it passed the guns of the fortress' secondary batteries. One of the 15 cm rounds from Kop√•s disabled Bl√ºchers steering gear and forced the cruiser's crew to steer her using the engines to avoid running aground. Bl√ºchers fire-fighting system was also knocked out by shell fragments from the two Norwegian batteries, making attempts to control the fires aboard the ship and rescue the many wounded much more difficult. =Identity of the intruders becomes known= As the now crippled Bl√ºcher passed the fortress guns, a sudden outburst of voices from the burning cruiser could be heard above the battle noises; Norwegian sources state that the crew broke into singing Deutschland, Deutschland √ºber alles.Hauge 1995: 36Tamelander&Zetterling; 2001: 87Berg 1997: 13 Only at this point did it become clear to the men of the fortress whom they were fighting.Berg 1997: 12‚Äì13Ribsskog 1998:45‚Äì50Grimnes 1990: 7‚Äì8 Later, at 04:35, Oberst Eriksen received a message from the Norwegian minesweeper HNoMS Otra confirming that the intruding ships were German. The message had been sent to the naval base in Horten at 04:10, but the massive communications problems that severely hampered the efforts of the Norwegian military throughout the Norwegian Campaign had prevented it from reaching Oscarsborg in time.Berg 1997: 10 The return fire from Bl√ºcher was ineffective, with the light artillery mostly pointing too high and the main batteries, 20.3 cm guns, unable to fire due to the damage caused by the second 28 cm round from Oscarsborg's Main Battery. The shelling lasted only for five to seven minutes. When the guns on both sides silenced, with all the \\"passengers\\" still under deck‚Äî\\"there was a dead silence on board the whole ship, no movement whatsoever was identified\\".Binder 2001: 77 =Kommand√∏rkaptein Anderssen launches the torpedoes= After passing the line of fire of the fortress' gun batteries, the cruiser was burning and severely damaged, but her captain still hoped he would be able to save his ship. At this point, however, Bl√ºcher entered the sights of Kommand√∏rkaptein Anderssen as she slid past the torpedo battery at a range of only .Hauge 1995: 37 The retired torpedoes the officer was aiming at the cruiser were 40-year-old Whitehead weapons of Austro-Hungarian manufacture. These torpedoes had been practice-launched well over 200 times before, but no one was certain if they would function or not. As Kommand√∏rkaptein Anderssen pushed the firing mechanism button for the torpedoes, at approximately 04:30, the weapons turned out to work perfectly; first one and then another torpedo raced out of their underwater exit tunnels at below the surface toward the burning warship. As Anderssen had overestimated the speed of his target slightly, the first torpedo hit near Bl√ºchers forward turret (nicknamed \\"Anton\\"), creating only inconsequential damage. The aim was corrected for the second torpedo launch and the torpedo struck Bl√ºcher amidships, hitting the same general area as the first 28 cm shell. This caused catastrophic damage to the cruiser and blew open many of her bulkheads, allowing water to flood her decks while she was burning furiously. The third torpedo launcher was left loaded in case more ships were to follow close behind Bl√ºcher. After firing, the two other tubes were reloaded and readied for the next target. =End of Bl√ºcher= Bl√ºcher on fire and sinking in Dr√∏bak Sound With all engines knocked out by the second torpedo hit, the cruiser anchored near the Askholmene islets just north and out of the arc of fire of the fort's guns to try to fight the ferocious fires raging throughout the vessel. Bl√ºchers torpedoes were fired against land to avoid them exploding in the uncontrolled fires aboard.Hauge 1995: 38 The crew's struggle ended when, at 05:30, fires reached a midship ammunition hold for the Flak guns, blowing a large gap in the ship's side.Williamson 2003: 33‚Äì34Tamelander&Zetterling; 2001: 88 The magazine blast ruptured the bulkheads between the boiler rooms and tore open the cruiser's fuel bunkers, igniting further fires. By this point, Bl√ºcher was doomed. At 06:22, Bl√ºcher sank bow first into the depths of the Oslofjord, first laying over on her port side, then turning upside-down and finally succumbing with her screws the last to disappear below the surface. After the ship had disappeared from the surface, large quantities of oil floated up and covered the close to two thousand sailors and soldiers fighting for their lives in the freezing water. The oil rapidly caught fire, killing hundreds more Germans. Obergefreiter G√ºnther Morgalla‚Äîwho survived the sinking‚Äîlater said that, swimming toward his shivering crew mates onshore, he heard someone defiantly singing the Deutschlandlied followed by \\"Das kann doch einen Seemann nicht ersch√ºttern.\\" (\\"That cannot shake a sailor\\").Binder 2001: 89 German survivors, with the sinking Bl√ºcher in the background In all, 650‚Äì800 Germans died, and 550 of the approximately 1,400 wet and cold survivors of Bl√ºcher were captured by soldiers from Company no. 4 of the Norwegian Royal Guards under the command of Kaptein (Captain) A. J. T. Petersson. In total, some 1,200 of the survivors had made it ashore at Frogn near Dr√∏bak. The guardsmen were supposed to take all the Germans prisoner, but mainly focused on caring for the many wounded and dying.Hansen 2005: 71 Around 1,000 of the Germans, including Generalmajor Erwin Engelbrecht and Admiral Oskar Kummetz, were eventually moved to a nearby farm and placed under light guard. None of the prisoners were interrogated. By 18:30, the Norwegian soldiers withdrew from the area, abandoning the Germans. Engelbrecht and Kummetz then made their way to Oslo.Arneberg 1989: 62, 65 The leading German officers reached Oslo at 22:00, moving into the Hotel Continental, though without most of the troops intended to occupy the capital.Arneberg 1989: 65Hansen 2005: 72 Many of the German wounded were initially taken to √Ösg√•rden summer hotel in √Ösg√•rdstrand for medical care, where Norwegian wounded had already been brought. The hotel was the temporary improvised location for the Royal Norwegian Navy Hospital, which had been evacuated from Horten at midnight on 8 April.Sivertsen 2001: 78 Remaining ships retreat By the time Bl√ºcher sank, the remaining naval force destined for Oslo had long since turned around and retreated back down the fjord. Seeing the geysers of water from underwater explosions on Bl√ºcher, and unaware of the torpedo battery, the commander of the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow (the recently renamed 'pocket battleship' Deutschland) assumed the flagship had hit mines and at 04:40 the decision was made for the flotilla to turn back and land the invasion forces out of range of the Oscarsborg batteries. The planned coup against Oslo to force the surrender of the Norwegian government was replaced by a land advance up the Oslofjord.Grimnes 1990: 14 As the force made good its escape, the fortress managed to damage L√ºtzow, the 15 cm guns of the Kop√•s battery scoring three hits and knocking out the ship's forward 28 cm turret (\\"Anton\\"). Kop√•s kept firing at the retreating ships until they disappeared in the mist at a range of around . After pulling out of range of the fortress guns, L√ºtzow employed her remaining turret \\"Bruno\\" to bombard the defenders from a range of down the fjord. During the battle, another burning ship was spotted in the distance from Oscarsborg, leading the Norwegian defenders to believe they had sunk another German warship in addition to Bl√ºcher. For some time after the battle, the belief was that Oscarsborg had sunk the artillery training ship . The reality, however, was that the burning ship was the Norwegian cargo cutter that had stumbled into the battle while on her way from Moss to Oslo with a cargo of paper. As the small ship had mistaken the events as a military exercise, she kept going until fired upon and set ablaze by the German minesweepers R-18 and R-19. S√∏rland sank with two of her six-man crew near the village of Skiphelle in Dr√∏bak, as the first civilian Norwegian ship lost during the invasion. Brummer was indeed lost in connection with the invasion, but only when she was on her way back to Germany on 14 April, when she was torpedoed by the Royal Navy submarine and sank the next day.German-navy.de: Brummer Luftwaffe bombing Oscarsborg's Hoved√∏ya under Luftwaffe attack The fortress was subjected to heavy Luftwaffe bombing later on the same day, to which the fortress could only reply with two Bofors 40 mm L/60 anti-aircraft (AA) guns and three Colt M/29 AA machine guns at Seiersten Battery, as well as another four Colt M/29 7.92 mm AA machine guns at H√•√∏ya Battery,Grimnes 1990: 15 but again there were no Norwegian casualties. Initially, four machine guns on the roof of the Main Battery also returned fire, but these had to be abandoned early on. One of the two 40 mm guns became unserviceable after only 22 rounds; the other gun kept firing until 12:00, but to little effect. After a break in the attacks from 12:00 to 13:30, during which time L√ºtzow bombarded Hoved√∏ya, the Luftwaffe bombers returned at 13:30 and soon strafed the remaining Norwegian anti-aircraft guns, forcing the crew to seek shelter in the nearby forest at around 14:00. In all, the fortress was subjected to nearly nine hours of air attack, during which time around five hundred bombs‚Äîranging from in size‚Äîwere dropped on Oscarsborg.Fjeld 1999: 191 Amongst the bombers that attacked Oscarsborg were twenty-two long-range Junkers Ju 87R \\"Stuka\\" dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 under the command of Hauptmann Paul-Werner Hozzel, operating from Kiel-Holtenau airport in northern Germany.Weal 1997: 34‚Äì35 Surrender Although the German naval attack on Oslo had been thwarted by the actions of Oscarsborg, the city was seized later that day by forces that were airlifted into Fornebu Airport. In light of the fall of the capital, and with news of German landings at the village of Son south of Dr√∏bak, Colonel Eriksen decided that further fighting without adequate infantry support was in vain, and agreed to a ceasefire in the evening of 9 April. The fortress was surrendered intact on the morning of 10 April.Fjeld 1999: 192 The garrison at the main battery and at H√•√∏ya were treated separately by the Germans from those captured from the mainland batteries, and were released a week after the battle. The soldiers and non-commissioned officers captured at the mainland batteries were released three days after the fortress' surrender, while the officers were held as prisoners of war at Fredriksten Fortress. The reserve officers were released on 15 May, while the full-time officers were transferred to Grini prison camp and released in late May 1940. Aftermath In one of the more peculiar battles of the war, a hundred year old fortification, manned by raw recruits and pensioners and armed with 40- to 50-year-old weaponry of German and Austro-Hungarian manufacture, had destroyed a ship so new, its crew was still finishing training. Oscarsborg had fulfilled its mission and denied an invader access to the capital. Even though it and the country were ultimately captured and occupied, the effects of delaying the German advance were immediate and considerable. On board Bl√ºcher were troops specially designated to capture the King, the Norwegian cabinet, the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) and the national gold reserve; the delay made it possible for all these to escape. On 9 April, the Storting was able to convene at Elverum and give the cabinet a wide authorization to govern until a Storting could again assemble. Thus, the Norwegian government was able to continue the defence of Norway until it had evacuated to exile in the United Kingdom on 7 June, with the Norwegian Army laying down their arms on 10 June.

Origins There is no evidence of Roman settlement in Finchley. Its few early medieval inhabitants maintained extensive woodlands that were cultivated to provide fuel and pigs for London. During the 12th and 13th centuries proper farming began, and by the 16th century the woods on the eastern side of the parish were cleared to form Finchley Common. By the 1270s there was a church and settlement at Church End. Finchley, as an ancient parish, is around (see plan). It was originally in the county of Middlesex, and included parts of what is now Hampstead Garden Suburb and Whetstone. Finchley is a Saxon place name, although its earliest recorded use is 13th century. The end of the name, \\"ley\\", suggests an opening in woodland, and the beginning, \\"Finch\\", refers either to the bird, or a person called Finch. It is not recorded in the Domesday book but by the 11th century the lands were already included in those of the Bishop of London, and probably formed part of the manor of Fulham. A road north, later the Great North Road, was rerouted through the Bishop of London's estates at the end of the 13th century to pass through Finchley, and a small settlement developed in East Finchley during the following century. By the 16th century the Great North Road passed across Finchley Common, and by the 17th century there was a large hog market as well as a number of inns and other trades associated with transport in the period along its route. From around 1547 Finchley had a parish vestry, which became a local board in 1878, an urban district in 1895, and finally a municipal borough (see coat of arms and description) between 1933 and 1965. It is now subsumed into the London Borough of Barnet. By the 18th century Finchley was well known for the quality of its hay, which was the dominant agricultural activity until the second half of the 19th century. North Finchley only began to develop after the enclosure of the common during the 1820s. 19th century Wards of Finchley Urban District in the 1930s. Wards of Finchley Municipal Borough in the 1950s. In the late 1820s the Finchley Road was built from Marylebone to the Great North Road at Tallyho Corner, North Finchley. It became possible, through the use of an omnibus from 1827, for a small number of wealthy individuals to commute between London and Finchley, and the area acquired a number of villas and houses. In 1867 the Great Northern Railway constructed a railway from Finsbury Park to Edgware, which passed through East Finchley and Church End. In 1872 a branch line was built between Church End and Barnet, and a further station was opened, later called Woodside Park. This in turn led to development of suburban houses, and a gradual increase in population. In 1905 a tramline from Archway to Whetstone via East Finchley was opened, joined in 1909 by another line running from New Southgate, through North Finchley and down Ballards Lane. These forms of cheap mass transportation enabled Finchley to become a proper suburb of London by 1914 (see plan of urban growth). Small industries were established in the tram period, the first being small motor works on East End Road, at East Finchley (now a carpet store).

More specifically, it usually means a sequence defined by the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, but with different initial conditions causing all members of the sequence to be composite numbers that do not all have a common divisor. To put it algebraically, a sequence of this type is defined by an appropriate choice of two composite numbers a1 and a2, such that the greatest common divisor GCD(a1,a2) is equal to 1, and such that for n > 2 there are no primes in the sequence of numbers calculated from the formula :an = an ‚àí 1 + an ‚àí 2. The first primefree sequence of this type was published by Ronald Graham in 1964. Wilf's sequence A primefree sequence found by Herbert Wilf has initial terms :a1 = 20615674205555510, a2 = 3794765361567513 . The proof that every term of this sequence is composite relies on the periodicity of Fibonacci-like number sequences modulo the members of a finite set of primes. For each prime p, the positions in the sequence where the numbers are divisible by p repeat in a periodic pattern, and different primes in the set have overlapping patterns that result in a covering set for the whole sequence. Nontriviality The requirement that the initial terms of a primefree sequence be coprime is necessary for the question to be non-trivial. If we allow the initial terms to share a prime factor p (e.g., set a1 = xp and a2 = yp for some x and y both greater than 1), due to the distributive property of multiplication a3 = (x + y)p and more generally all subsequent value in the sequence will be multiples of p. In this case, all the numbers in the sequence will be composite, but for a trivial reason. The order of the initial terms is also important. In Paul Hoffman's biography of Paul Erd≈ës, The man who loved only numbers, the Wilf sequence is cited but with the initial terms switched. The resulting sequence appears primefree for the first hundred terms or so, but term 138 is the 45-digit prime 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344721. Other sequences Several other primefree sequences are known: :a1 = 331635635998274737472200656430763, a2 = 1510028911088401971189590305498785 (sequence A083104 in the OEIS; Graham 1964), :a1 = 62638280004239857, a2 = 49463435743205655 (sequence A083105 in the OEIS; Knuth 1990), and :a1 = 407389224418, a2 = 76343678551 (sequence A082411 in the OEIS; Nicol 1999). The sequence of this type with the smallest known initial terms has :a1 = 106276436867, a2 = 35256392432 (sequence A221286 in the OEIS; Vsemirnov 2004).

She was given an elementary education in Latin and religion, but a high education in music, likely by Orlando di Lasso. On 26 August 1571 in Vienna, Maria Anna married her maternal uncle, Charles II of Austria. The marriage was arranged to give Charles political support from Bavaria, and Bavaria an agent in Vienna. The relation between Maria Anna and Charles are described as good. Maria Anna was described as confident, ambitious and a great lover of pomp and power, but foremost as a devoted Catholic. She participated in the affairs of state, and successfully benefited a powerful counter reformation in the domains of her spouse. She continued her education in music, benefited the Jesuit school in Graz, and spent her time in religious worship and religious charity. Maria Anna was widowed in 1590.

(2014) Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised Edition). Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. . Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) technology, normally referred to as UASB reactor, is a form of anaerobic digester that is used for wastewater treatment. The UASB reactor is a methanogenic (methane-producing) digester that evolved from the anaerobic clarigester. A similar but variant technology to UASB is the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) digester. Process description UASB uses an anaerobic process whilst forming a blanket of granular sludge which suspends in the tank. Wastewater flows upwards through the blanket and is processed (degraded) by the anaerobic microorganisms. The upward flow combined with the settling action of gravity suspends the blanket with the aid of flocculants. The blanket begins to reach maturity at around three months. Small sludge granules begin to form whose surface area is covered in aggregations of bacteria. In the absence of any support matrix, the flow conditions create a selective environment in which only those microorganisms capable of attaching to each other survive and proliferate. Eventually the aggregates form into dense compact biofilms referred to as \\"granules\\".What are sludge granules? UASB Homepage Biogas with a high concentration of methane is produced as a by-product, and this may be captured and used as an energy source, to generate electricity for export and to cover its own running power. The technology needs constant monitoring when put into use to ensure that the sludge blanket is maintained, and not washed out (thereby losing the effect). The heat produced as a by-product of electricity generation can be reused to heat the digestion tanks. The blanketing of the sludge enables a dual solid and hydraulic (liquid) retention time in the digesters. Solids requiring a high degree of digestion can remain in the reactors for periods up to 90 days. Sugars dissolved in the liquid waste stream can be converted into gas quickly in the liquid phase which can exit the system in less than a day. UASB reactors are typically suited to dilute waste water streams (3% TSS with particle size >0.75mm). Design UASB reactor shown is the larger tank. Hiriya, Tel Aviv, Israel With UASB, the process of settlement and digestion occurs in one or more large tank(s). The effluent from the UASB, which has a much reduced biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration, usually needs to be treated further, for example with the activated sludge process, depending on the effluent quality requirements.

In the 13th century, the Lords of the Manor moved their seat and formed a new settlement, at the junction of two major roads. It was then that Ulverlei was being referred to as ‚ÄòOulton‚Äô (meaning ‚Äòold town‚Äô) to distinguish itself from nearby Solihull. Historically within the county of Warwickshire, the village has gradually become contiguous with Solihull to the southeast, though it retains the character of a large independent village. It is located on the A41 between Solihull town centre , Acocks Green, and Birmingham . Dating back over a 1,000 years, it is a now a residential suburb. Many of the large houses built in St. Bernard's Road, Grange Road and Kineton Green Road during the Victorian and Edwardian period form part of one of Solihull's conservation areas. Olton carries the motto ‚ÄòThe Town in the Country‚Äô.  History  Olton means 'old town' and is the site of the manor of Ulverlei from where Solihull was founded. Ulverlei has been translated to mean Wulfhere's clearing or meadow.In the Forest of Arden, John Burman, 1948 Wulfhere was the first Christian king of all of Mercia, from the end of the 650s until 675. Wulfhere's father, Penda, was killed in 655 fighting against Oswiu of Northumbria. Penda's son Peada became king under Oswiu's overlordship, but was murdered a year later. Wulfhere came to the throne when Mercian nobles organised a revolt against Northumbrian rule in 658, and drove out Oswiu's governors.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, translated and edited by M.J. Swanton (1996), paperback, As he was a youth, Wulfhere had been kept in hiding until he came of age.Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Bede, 731 After the absorption of Mercia into the rest of England, Ulverlei became the property of the Earls of Mercia, who if not descendants of the royal house were their successors. The first of these was Leofric, husband of Godiva, heroine of the Coventry legend, and the earldom descended through his son √Ülfgar to Edwin, his grandson, who was in possession at the time of the Norman conquest. Perhaps, because of the royal connection, William I granted the lands to Christina, who was granddaughter of King Edmund Ironside. The Domesday Book records Ulverlei as part of the lands of Christina, sister of Edgar the √Ütheling, the last male of the house of Cerdic of Wessex, the original ruling dynasty of England. It states, \\"In Coleshill Hundred Christina holds 8 hides in Ulverlei from the King. Land for 20 ploughs. In lordship 1; 3 slaves. 22 villagers with a priest and 4 smallholders have 7 ploughs. Meadow, 12 acres; woodland 4 leagues long and 1/2 league wide; when exploited, value 12s. The value was ¬£10; now ¬£4. Earl Edwin held it.\\"Domesday Book for Warwickshire, Phillimore edited by John Morris Shortly after the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, Christina \\"took the veil\\" entering the nunnery of Romsey Abbey in Hampshire. Her lands were granted to Ralph de Limesy whose family held Ulverlei until his great grand daughter married Hugh de Odingsells, whose family were thought to be of Flemish origin. William De Odingsells succeeded his father in 1238 and it was in his time that the new village of Solihull began to develop. That Ulverley stood where Olton now does is evident from the survival of the place names of Ulverley Green and the Ulleries. Ulverley Green close to the Birmingham-Warwick Road is the probable site of the original Saxon manor house. The site was described by William Hutton > \\"Four miles from Birmingham on upon the Warwick Road, entering the parish of > Solihull in Castle Lane, is Ulverley, in doomsday Ulverlei. Trifling as this > place now seems it must have been the manor house of Solihull, under the > Saxon heptarchy, but went to decay so long ago as the conquest. The manor > was the property of the Earls of Mercia, but whether their residence is > uncertain. The traces of a moat remain, which are triangular, and enclose a > wretched farmhouse of no note; (named Manor House Farm)19thc O.S Map one of > the angles of the moat is filled up and becomes part of Castle Lane, which > proves that Ulverley went into disuse when Hogg's moat was erected; it also > proves that the lane terminated here, which is about 200 yards from the > turnpike road. The great width of the lane, from the road to Ulverley, and > its singular narrowness from thence to Hogg's moat, is another proof of its > antiquity. If we pursue our journey half a mile further along this lane > which, by the way, is scarcely passable, it will bring us to Hogg's > moat.\\"History of Birmingham, William Hutton, 1782 This site is now the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Hobs Moat, standing back from Lode Lane. The Hugford family occupied it after the Odingsells, Burman suggested that the name could as easily come from the Hugfords as the Odingsell's, as Hutton calls it Hoggs Moat in his 1782 description. However, Dugdale believed it derived from \\"Odingsells moat\\" and states he has seen Odingsells incorrectly written as \\"Hodingsells\\" and believes the corruption came from that.The Antiquities of Warwickshire, William Dugdale, 1656 The Reverend Pemberton wrote that, \\"the moat, surmounted as it would have been by a stockade, would have been a formidable obstacle to assault\\"Solihull and its church, Rev. Robert Pemberton, 1905 The Odingsells name is still to be found in the modern road name of Odensil Green built on the site of Odensil Farm. Probably due to the relocation of the Lords of the Manor to the new settlement of Solihull, Olton declined in comparison and remained largely agricultural until the opening of the railway station in 1869 and the development of St Bernard's Road. Part of this road appears on the 1839 Tithe map and, in 1869, a new road was constructed to link this road with the Warwick Road. Originally named Windmill Road, it had become St Bernard's Road by 1872, named after the seminary that was being built then. The first house to be constructed in the road is thought to be Elmhurst (no. 21), which was used for a gathering of 200 people in 1872.Solihull Council Web site  Housing  Many of the properties in Olton (B91) are detached and from the Victorian and Edwardian era's, these form part of Solihull conservation areas. Data revealed that the most expensive postcode in the Birmingham area was Olton in Solihull.  Landmarks  Olton Clock Olton Mere The Scheduled Monument of Hob's Moat, the derivation of its name is discussed above, is situated in Lode Lane, on the north-facing slope of a low hill and includes a moated site and the earthwork remains of a section of a hollow way. The moated site has external dimensions of approximately 137 metres north to south and 115 metres east to west. The steep-sided moat ditches are dry and measure up to 7 metres wide and 2.5 metres deep. External banks are visible on all four sides of the moated site and although the northern and eastern banks have been lowered they can be traced on the ground surface. The banks are approximately 12 metres wide at their base and have an average height of 1.8 metres. The moated island is 0.65 hectares in area and slopes gradually from south to north. There is an internal enclosure bank on the west, north and east sides of the island, running parallel to the moat ditches. An excavation across a section of the inner bank in 1985 provided evidence for the bank's construction; deposits of stony clay mounded up over a sandy gravel core. A second bank was located beneath the inner one which consists of a sandy bank revetted on either side by bands of cobbles set in clay. This feature is earlier to date than the inner bank and employs a different construction technique. An excavation in the southern half of the moated island has indicated that the structures which originally occupied the island will survive as buried features. The remains of a small structure, bounded by walls set within shallow foundation slots, were located. Excavations within the moat have recovered evidence for a collapsed sandstone wall and suggested a late 13th-century date for its construction. The remains of the wall had been overlain by the base of a later structure. Immediately alongside the north side of Hob's Moat are the earthwork remains of a hollow way which is medieval in origin. Excavation, geophysical and field survey carried out between 1985‚Äì86 revealed pottery found in a trench excavated across the inner rampart and interior indicating a 13th-century construction date, with later modifications to the enclosing earthworks. The remains of a number of medieval buildings were found and in addition a late medieval/early post-medieval shed-like structure. The activity on the site during the 17th century and later appears to be agricultural.Moated Sites Research Group report 13 Page(s)21-3Medieval Settlement Research Group: annual report 2 Page(s)25-6 A survey carried out in October 1997 by RCHME concluded that the site was probably a homestead or hunting lodge.Field Investigators Comments G Brown/31-OCT-1997/RCHME Hobs Moat Survey Olton Mere was created as a reservoir to act as a feeder for the Grand Union Canal, which was opened in 1799. The Mere was formed from marshland fed by Folly Brook (now Hatchford Brook) and was designed to hold 150 locks full of water, but this was not achieved until the Mere was extended in 1834. It is the largest of the few areas of open water in Solihull and supports a large number of waterfowl. The woodland surrounding the Mere has remained undisturbed for many years, providing an important habitat for plants and animals. Sailing on the Mere started in 1900 when five residents of St Bernard's Road leased the reservoir from the canal company. A club was formed for sailing, fishing and shooting, although shooting was suspended in 1926 owing to a shortage of wildfowl.  Governance  Politically, the Olton ward has recently leaned towards liberalism. Since 1973, the three seats on Solihull Council have been shared by Conservative and Liberal (later, Liberal Democrat) councillors. Honor Cox of the Liberal Democrats held the ward from 1991 until her death on 1 November 2010.Article at Solihull.News.net However, for several years now all three seats have been held by the Liberal Democrats. Olton has a strong residents' association that liaises with Solihull Council and other bodies to improve the locality. Nationally, Olton is a ward of the Solihull constituency whose Member of Parliament is Julian Knight, (Conservative), who replaced Lorely Burt, the first Liberal Democrat MP for Solihull, at the 2015 election. Olton was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament.

The concept of location may extend to a larger area such as a village, town or clan territory. The practice has been found in around 70 percent of the world's modern human cultures that have been described ethnographically. Archaeological evidence for patrilocality has also been found among Neanderthal remains in Spain and for ancient hominids in Africa. Description In a patrilocal society, when a man marries, his wife joins him in his father's home or compound, where they raise their children. These children will follow the same pattern. Sons will stay and daughters will move in with their husbands' families. Families living in a patrilocal residence generally assume joint ownership of domestic sources. The household is led by a senior member, who also directs the labor of all other members. Matrilocal residence may be regarded as the opposite of patrilocal residence. However, since the majority of societies exhibit at least some degree of patriarchy, in most matrilocal groups the brothers (or mothers' brothers) are the authority figures, not the wives or mothers themselves. Prevalence of Patrilocal marriage Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (e.g., Lewis Henry Morgan, Edward Tylor, or George Peter Murdock) connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, to date, cross-cultural tests of this hypothesis using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, Korotayev's tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal (as opposed to patrilocal) residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal polygyny which effectively destroys matrilocality, and pushes a social system toward patrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple regression model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected. Linguistic traces In some Slavonic languages, verbs for marrying show evidence of patrilocality. In Polish the verb for \\"to marry\\", when done by a woman, is while in Russian it is (vyjti zamuzh). Both mean literally \\"to go out and behind the husband\\". In comparison, a man in Polish can simply and in Russian he is able to , both meaning \\"to wife oneself\\". (In Polish, , \\"to take a woman for a wife\\", is another possibility). The verbs for marriage in the Hungarian language show evidence of patrilocality. The verb for \\"to marry\\", when done by a woman, is , literally meaning \\"to leave [the family home] for the husband\\". However, the verbs and , meaning \\"to house oneself\\", and \\"to house together\\", can be used by both males and females. Similarly the Spanish term for \\"to marry\\", casarse, is gender-neutral and literally means \\"to house oneself\\" (from the Spanish casa, \\"house\\".) \\"A married couple\\" is una pareja casada, which translates as \\"a housed couple\\". Indeed, in many European languages including English, the verb \\"to marry\\" may ultimately come from a past participle of Proto-Indo European *mari, for young woman - as in, provided with a *mari. Neanderthals and early hominins It is claimed that the practice was also prevalent in some Neanderthal populations. A 49,000-year-old grave was found in Spain in 2010 which contained three related-to-each-other males, with three unrelated-to-each- other females, suggesting they were the partners of the males. A 2011 study using ratios of strontium isotopes in teeth also suggested that roughly 2 million years ago, among Australopithecus and Paranthropus robustus groups in southern Africa, women tended to settle farther from their region of birth than men did.

After the Soviet Red Army took Budapest in early 1945, they found all the city's five bridges had been blown up by retreating German troops. (√Årp√°d hid was not blown-up, it was just incomplete, under construction). Soon, a pontoon bridge was created for military logistical purposes but its capacity proved insufficient and presence of winter icepacks on the Danube made it impossible to maintain a permanent link across the 290-metre-wide river with a floating bridge. A decision was made to build a spar-type bridge in record time. The total destruction of industry and lack of raw materials in Hungary required cannibalizing several dozen oil wells in the oil fields of Zala county for the construction project. Steel piping was pulled from the depths and used as the main spars for the bridge. It is said some steel from gunbarrels from abandoned and destroyed World War II battle tanks were incorporated in the structure. Because of the tight schedule and design restrictions dictated by available substandard materials, the bridge was built with numerous concrete pylons, with smallish, 30 and 40-metre-wide openings between them. The construction project was entirely carried out by Soviet military engineering troops, with some 15 fatalities due to hurry and harsh work conditions. This claim (Soviet troops erecting) is incorrect. The design collective was led by Hilvert Elek and Endre Misteth engineers. The erection project management were done by Zsigmondy, B√©la; Erd√©lyi and Vajda; valamint F√°bi√°n, Somogyi and Gy√∂rgy companies. The top overseer, chief project manager was Sz√©chy, K√°roly. The steel structure was manufactured by Weiss Manfr√©d Rt., and the Gy≈ëri Waggongy√°r. The permanent link, built right at the southern corner of Budapest's Parliament Building, was often referred to as the \\"Link of Life\\", especially in the leftist press. Indeed, for six months - until 20 August 1946 - it was the only connection between the two halves of the city, Buda and Pest. Officially inaugurated as the \\"Lajos Kossuth Bridge\\", it was named after the patriot leader of Hungary's 1848-49 revolution. Due to its hasty construction, the Kossuth bridge had several restrictions on use. It was used mainly for pedestrian crossing. Heavier trucks could cross at 20 km/h and in only one direction at a time. During sessions of parliament, it was sometimes shut down for noise and security reasons. Both bus and truck traffic was on the bridge, numerous photographs and news film clips attest to that. In three years following World War II all of the demolished Danube bridges were rebuilt, except Elizabeth bridge, easing the traffic situation. The Kossuth Bridge gradually became a maintenance problem and its low span more of an obstacle to shipping on the River Danube. It was finally shut down in 1957 and dismantled in 1960, and not replaced. Nowadays only two plaques embedded in the riverbanks remind visitors of the bridge's former location. It is thought that a bridge will be erected in the same place around 2020 as part of the long-term Budapest infrastructure modernization program.

The railway was a precursor of parts of London Underground's Northern line and was, in the 1930s the core of an ambitious expansion plan for that line which was thwarted by the Second World War. Parts of the line were closed in the 1950s and have since been removed. Establishment The company was established by a private act of parliament passed on 3 June 1862. The route, measuring , ran through parts of rural Middlesex (now suburban north London) from Finsbury Park through Stroud Green, Crouch End, Highgate, Finchley and Mill Hill to Edgware. Additional acts in 1864 and 1866 granted powers to construct branch lines from Highgate to Muswell Hill and from Finchley to High Barnet respectively. The railway was sponsored by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King's Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north. Before the line to Edgware was opened, it was purchased in July 1867 by the GNR and was opened as a single track line on 22 August 1867.Clive's Underground Line Guides, Northern Line, Dates At first, services ran from Edgware to Finsbury Park, King's Cross and, via Snow Hill tunnel, to Ludgate Hill, Blackfriars and Loughborough Road on the south of the Thames. After 1869, trains terminated at Moorgate. Services could also run from Finsbury Park via the North London Railway to Broad Street after the Canonbury-Finsbury Park link opened in 1875. 21 trains a day ran to Finchley, usually in 24 minutes from Kings Cross, and 14 continued to Edgware. In 1870 the track between Finsbury Park and Finchley & Hendon (now Finchley Central) was doubled in preparation for the opening of the High Barnet branch and Muswell Hill branch. Because of the rapid rise and fall of the terrain in the area traversed by the railway, the line made extensive use of cuttings, embankments and viaducts. Particularly notable were the cutting in Highgate Hill in which Highgate station was constructed with tunnels on either side, and the viaducts over the Dollis Brook and at Muswell Hill. Branch lines The High Barnet branch opened on 1 April 1872 with two intermediate stations at Woodside Park and Totteridge & Whetstone (West Finchley did not open until 1933). The line to Barnet stopped short at Underhill, south of the main village located at the top of the hill. As Barnet was a larger village than Edgware and new residential development at Finchley grew at a faster pace than on the original line, the branch line quickly became the dominant route. Direct services from London ran to High Barnet and a shuttle service was operated between Finchley and Edgware for most passenger journeys on that section, which remained a single track. The Muswell Hill branch from Highgate to Alexandra Palace was constructed by a separate company, the Muswell Hill Railway Company and opened on 24 May 1873 along with the Palace. However, when the Palace burned down only two weeks after opening, the service was considerably reduced and then closed for almost two years whilst the Palace was rebuilt. It reopened in May 1875. Another separate company, the Watford and Edgware Railway (W&ER;), was established in the 1860s and had various plans to build a link from the EH&LR; near Edgware to Watford in Hertfordshire. The W&ER; was unable to attract sufficient funds for the project and the company and the right of way that it had obtained passed through the ownership of a number of other railway companies until plans were made in the 1930s to make use of its route (see below). Development, overcrowding and competition: 1900-1918 By the 1900s the whole line was under pressure from overcrowding. The populations of areas along the line, particularly at Hornsey, Highgate, Muswell Hill, and Finchley, had increased considerably with the rapid Victorian expansion of London, but the GNR service had not been expanded to cope. The line was also congested with goods traffic, mostly coal and building materials. By 1903 the morning trains from Barnet were full by the time they arrived at East Finchley. As the doors of the compartments in the carriages were in those days locked with aid of a simple square key, some passengers took to purchasing these keys from local ironmongers, and locking the doors from the inside. It was not unknown for harsh words and even, on odd occasions, for blows to be exchanged. New stations were opened at Cranley Gardens (1902, between Highgate and Muswell Hill) and Mill Hill (1906, between Mill Hill East and Edgware). In 1905 tram services were established in both Hendon and Finchley, and extended shortly after to Barnet. This combined with motor transport alleviated some of the problem. This relief was also competition, and the GNR introduced new engines, specially designed to manage the steep inclines on the routes which slowed up the services. Further competition came from the opening of the new underground Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;) to Archway (then named Highgate) and Golders Green in June 1907 a move that stimulated large scale house building to the south of the Edgware branch spreading out from Golders Green. The GNR took over the Muswell Hill Railway (renamed to the Muswell Hill and Palace Railway) in September 1911 and merged it with the rest of the line. Further developments were halted by the First World War. Amalgamation: 1918-1939 In 1923 as a consequence of the railway grouping instigated by the 1921 Railways Act, the GNR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In January 1924 the newly enlarged company announced that the line would be electrified, although little was done. Meanwhile, the CCE&HR;, now part of the London Electric Railway (Underground Group), was using plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway to construct an extension of its line from Golders Green through Hendon to a new station at Edgware where it would be in direct competition with the LNER line. The Underground Group had also bought up the rights of the W&ER; and published proposals to further extend the line to Bushey and Watford although nothing was done immediately. Following the nationalisation of the Underground Group in 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board announced the 1935-1940 New Works Programme which included the following proposals for the Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Muswell Hill lines: # Upgrade the line to allow electric tube trains on all the lines and double the line from Finchley to Edgware. # To run the LNER Edgware line into Edgware Underground station where the trains from East Finchley could terminate. # To connect the Underground from Archway to East Finchley via a new tunnel under the LNER's Highgate station. # To activate the dormant proposals to extend the line from Edgware to Bushey Heath with intermediate stations at Brockley Hill and Elstree South. Much of the work was carried out, with East Finchley and Highgate stations being completely rebuilt and the electrification works were well advanced before the Second World War put a stop to progress. Passenger services on the Finchley Central to Edgware line were ended in September 1939. 1930 OS map showing branch from Mill Hill East to Edgware End of the line: 1939 onwards Underground trains took over from LNER steam services between East Finchley and High Barnet on the 14th April 1940. LNER Services were withdrawn between Highgate and East Finchley in March 1941 (both services having briefly operated to the latter station from the two parts of Highgate station). Underground trains began serving Mill Hill East in May 1941 but never ran to Edgware as planned. In 1942 the Finsbury Park - Highgate - Alexandra Palace line was reduced to a peak service shuttle to Finsbury Park, ending through running to central London. After the war, the introduction of London's Metropolitan Green Belt made the project to continue the line to Bushey unnecessary as the intended housing development proposed in the area was prevented by the new legislation. The plan was formally cancelled in October 1950. In 1953 the modernisation and electrification of the remaining sections of track between Mill Hill East to Edgware also Finsbury Park to Alexandra Park were also abandoned. The last regular passenger service between Finsbury Park, Highgate and Alexandra Palace was run on 3 July 1954. In 1957 the goods yards at Cranley Gardens and Muswell Hill were closed and the line from Park Junction (Highgate Station) to Alexandra Palace was abandoned. The line from Finsbury Park to Edgware continued to be used for goods traffic, primarily coal, milk and building materials, even into the period when diesel engines had replaced steam locomotion. However, the introduction of the Clean Air Act 1956 established a shift away from coal as a fuel for domestic heating and the demand for coal slumped. At the same time, the expansion of road haulage reduced the demand for rail transportation of other bulk loads and the line closed completely between Edgware and Mill Hill East in 1964 with equipment and track removed by the following year. London Underground regularly moved stock for the Northern City Line along the old lines between Highgate Wood Depot, Finsbury Park and Drayton Park Depot until September 1970. The movements ran regularly on Tuesdays, and occasionally on Mondays and Wednesdays. The tracks were removed in 1971 following which the Northern City Line empty stock movements ran from Neasden via King's Cross (York Road) and the Widened Lines. The sections of the line from Finsbury Park to the southern portals of the southern tunnels at Highgate station and between the sites of Cranley Gardens and Muswell Hill stations now form a linear urban park known as Parkland Walk. Stretches of the Mill Hill East to Edgware line are now local nature reserves: Copthall Railway Walk and Mill Hill Old Railway Nature Reserve. The stations of the line Woodside Park Station - typical of the buildings erected on the High Barnet branch in the 1870s All listings are with original names. Stations on the Finsbury Park to Edgware line, from south to north: * Finsbury Park station * Stroud Green - Opened in 1881. * Crouch End * Highgate - Rebuilt prior to the take-over by Underground services. * East End, Finchley - Renamed to \\"East Finchley\\" in 1886. The station was completely rebuilt prior to the take-over by Underground services. * Finchley & Hendon - Renamed twice: to \\"Finchley (Church End)\\" in 1894 and \\"Finchley Central\\" in 1940. It was the main goods yard for the Finchley area, with two separate yards in operation. * Mill Hill - Now Mill Hill East. The station was important for two reasons: North Middlesex Gas Company established a works in 1862, with coal being carried on the line to feed the works in increasing quantity up until 1961. The Mill Hill Barracks were established in 1905. * Hale - Opened in 1906 as a halt for milk from Mill Hill farms. But as suburban dwellings, in what is now called Mill Hill Broadway, began to appear after 1910 the platform was extended and a ticket office was established with a station master. It was renamed \\"The Hale for Mill Hill\\" no later than 1919, supplying mostly coal and commuters. In preparation for the proposed electrification during the late 1930s the station platform was extended with concrete and was closed in 1939 to allow work to be accelerated but it was never reopened and subsequent work was aborted. * Edgware - There was a small engine shed, but after damage from \\"the great blizzard of January 1881\\" it was demolished and never replaced. Not to be confused with Edgware Underground station 200 yards to the north. All has been demolished. On the Highgate to Alexandra Palace branch: * Cranley Gardens - Opened in 1902. * Muswell Hill * Alexandra Palace On the Finchley Central to High Barnet branch: * West Finchley - Opened in 1933 by the LNER to serve new developments that had taken place between Church End, Finchley and the Dollis Brook. The station was built from material of older stations the company had further north in Yorkshire. The result is that the station is in keeping with the style of other stations on the same route. The footbridge, for example, comes from Wintersett and Ryhill, Barnsley. * Torrington Park - Renamed \\"Woodside Park\\" in 1889 when the station was rebuilt. Coal sidings were built by 1906. * Whetstone and Totteridge - Now \\"Totteridge and Whetstone\\". Pickfords had a horse hospital and stables here, and the nursery gardeners Sweets also used the station. * High Barnet - Opened on the site of the old Barnet Fair. The name is not, as is popularly thought, a railway name, and has been in use since at least the 16th century. There was a cattle pound in the station yard. Other notable structures were: Dollis Viaduct * Dollis Viaduct - 13 arches each with a span of , and high (the highest point above ground on the present underground). It was designed by Sir John Fowler and Walter Marr Brydone to span Dollis Brook and was built between 1863 and 1867. * Muswell Hill viaduct - Carried trains high on brick pylon on the way to Muswell Hill station. Affords excellent views of central London. * United Dairies sidings - Came into use in the early 1920s and was originally owned by Manor Dairies. It had sidings of its own, and was used as a distribution depot. It was closed in 1960. In fiction The Alexandra Palace branch features in the novel The Horn of Mortal Danger (1980). The book begins with two children exploring Cranley Gardens station and the tunnel to Highgate; they discover a \\"secret railway\\" which can be accessed by a gate in the wall of the tunnel.

Rate becomes Don Mon\\"Mon Rivera, compositor de plenas\\", El Mundo, 7 June 1960, p.19 Don Mon was born in Mayag√ºez (at the Rio Ca√±as Arriba \\"barrio\\" in the outskirts of the city, close to the place Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos was born) in 1899, and lived in the working class Barcelona barrio of the city proper. He was a janitor and handyman at the nearby University of Puerto Rico - Mayag√ºez for more than 40 years, and was well loved by the campus community. Known as \\"'Rate\\" by his closest friends, Don Mon gained a strong reputation as a composer of plenas, a musical genre considered the \\"musical newspaper of the barrio\\". He assembled impromptu plena jams in the neighborhood, which were so widely known that they were preserved for posterity in the documentary film (1956) by Amilcar Tirado (Don Mon appears at the last segment, improvising lyrics). Curiously enough, at the time don Mon was illiterate and had no formal musical training. Two of Don Mon's most famous plenas, \\"Askarakatiskis\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"Karacatis Ki\\") and \\"El Gallo Espuel√©rico\\" (loosely translated as \\"The Spurless Rooster\\") were humorous takes on real life events. On the first one Don Mon told the story of Rafael, a gambler who loses all his money rolling dice and is then assaulted by his wife Luz Mar√≠a with a broomstick, while their daughters laugh the incident off (one of the girls' laughter is the basis for the song's name). \\"El Gallo Espuel√©rico\\" tells the story of Am√©rico, a guy who brags boastfully about a gamecock he carried with him to a fight. The bird is killed soon after the fight starts (Don Mon claimed once that the winner was his rooster \\"Espuel√©rico\\", although this is disputed), to the amusement of his friends, who tell him the gamecock would be more fierce as part of a chicken rice soup (in reality, they ended up eating the soup). However, a plena standard to this day was born when seamstresses of a local handkerchief factory struck against the factory's owner, Lebanese industrialist William Mamary, and Mamery hired replacement workers (whom the seamstresses considered to be scabs). Don Mon wrote \\"Al√≥, ¬øQui√©n √ëama\\" (loosely translated as \\"Hello, Who' Calling?\\", sometimes referred to as \\"Qu√© Ser√°\\") as a musical description of the strike. Since the seamstress' strike was organized by local labor leader John Vidal, and patronized by local assemblywoman Mar√≠a Luisa Arcelay, they are mentioned in the song. The seamstresses are reportedly calling each other as to raise mutual concern about the poor pay they're getting. Near the end, Don Mon breaks into what his son later called \\"trabalenguas\\" (tongue twisters), which in fact is a style of scat singing where some of the syllables of the actual song are slurred nasally and delivered quickly along with the scatting. The skill was passed from father to son; Efra√≠n became so adept at using \\"trabalenguas\\" that he eventually was called \\"El Rey del Trabalengua\\" (\\"The Tongue Twister King\\") once he became famous. Efra√≠n's early days Efra√≠n's mother died when he was a little boy, and Don Mon remarried a few years after, fathering a total of twelve children. Since the family's economic situation was precarious, Efra√≠n had to support and look after his younger brothers by taking various odd jobs. The one that he was most successful at, besides music, was as shortstop for the Indios de Mayag√ºez, the local winter league baseball team, for which he had been the bat boy at an earlier age. He played with them between 1943 and 1945. To this date, he still holds the league record for most triples in a game (three) and most consecutive doubles in a double-header (five). Efra√≠n was trained as a multi-instrumentalist: he played timbales, congas, bongos, saxophone, trumpet, trombone and bass guitar. In his beginnings as a musician, Efra√≠n and Germ√°n V√©lez (father of Wilkins V√©lez) formed \\"El D√∫o Huasteco\\", and sang Mexican folk songs that were popular in Latin America at the time (they even dressed the part). Santos Colon joined the duo occasionally and made it a trio. Their talent moved Gilbert Mamery to feature them as part of musical reviews staged at Mayag√ºez's San Jos√© Theater. Later, Mon became a percussionist and singer with various local bands, working with bandleaders Juan Ram√≥n Delgado, better known as \\"Moncho Le√±a\\"Profile: Who is Moncho Le√±a?, 1996 and William Manzano, both of whom he persuaded to allow him to arrange some of his father's plenas for a full orchestra. A full orchestral version of \\"Al√≥, ¬øQui√©n √ëama?\\" was a sleeper hit in 1954. Efra√≠n (by now widely called \\"Moncito\\", or \\"Little Mon\\", and later called just \\"Mon\\") began to popularize his father's plenas. One of them, \\"La Plena de Rafael Martinez Nadal\\" was written in admiration for the Puerto Rican lawyer and legislator, who was extremely successful in local courts. Another one, \\"Carb√≥n de Palito\\", described the route followed by street vendors of wood charcoal (then used as cooking fuel) through most of Mayag√ºez. Almost all sections of the city at the time are mentioned in the lyrics. Both plenas were local hits, and along with Rafael Cortijo's rendition of \\"El Bomb√≥n de Elena\\", they helped to revive the genre during the late 1950s. Efra√≠n started writing his own material just as this happened. By the mid-1950s, Efra√≠n was an accomplished singer in Puerto Rico, but since the island is rather small, he did as many other local performers and emigrated to New York City, as to guarantee a living playing music, given the sizeable Latino population there. When Moncho Le√±a's orchestra moved to New York City in November 1953, he moved along with them. He went to the extreme of arranging a plena version of Hava Nagilah for the Italian and Jewish clubgoers who danced to their music at New York's Palladium Ballroom.Ibid. He also sang with Joe Cotto and H√©ctor Pellot. He was featured in the second television music special by the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico in 1960. The trombanga sound Rivera organized his own orchestra by 1961, when he started working on his album Que gente averigu√° (What nosey people), which was released in 1963. The lineup for this record included Charlie Palmieri and Eddie Palmieri on piano, Barry Rogers, Mark Weinstein, and Manol√≠n Pazo on trombones, and Kako on percussion, among others. Like most Latino orchestras of the time, Rivera's orchestra didn't play plenas exclusively. Most of Rivera's plena numbers broke into a salsa section in mid- song, and he would sing or play any genre at dances and shows. This explains his experiments mixing plena with pachanga, mambo and Dominican merengue, such as the album's title track, a song where he mocked people who openly criticized that he was a miser, recycling old clothes until they wore thin, keeping his money hidden in a barrel or wearing an old hat from his Mayag√ºez days down 8th Avenue in Manhattan. Cheo Feliciano admits being Efra√≠n's roadie once around this time. There are conflicting theories that list either Rivera or his record producer, Al Santiago, as being the inventor of the all-trombone brass section (four trombones, in this case). An early example of this is the earliest recording Rivera made of \\"Askarakatiskis\\". This led to a more aggressive, bottom-heavy sound that was a novelty at the time. The sound lent itself well to plenas but did not catch on in salsa circles until Eddie Palmieri experimented with a similar lineup almost simultaneously (Santiago produced both artists). By the end of the decade, the all-trombone brass section was part of the standard salsa vocabulary, popularized particularly by Willie Col√≥n, who adopted it most successfully than any other bandleader. Rivera could make a living with his orchestra but migrating to New York disconnected him from his fan base in Puerto Rico. Health problems including bouts with alcoholism and drug addiction, along with serving some prison time (which limited his contribution to the album Dolores, recorded with Joe Cotto and Mike Casino, and released in 1963), eventually forced a reduction in his workload causing his popularity to wane, but only temporarily. Mon The Younger revives his career By the mid-1970s, however, Willie Col√≥n encountered Efra√≠n in Puerto Rico, during one of his visits to the island. At the time, Efra√≠n was a patient at an Hogar Crea, a drug rehabilitation program local to Puerto Rico. He had become a part-time refrigeration technician. Col√≥n, who had admired Efra√≠n's multiple trombone sound strongly enough to model his own band after Rivera's, persuaded Efra√≠n to record an album with him, for which he would perform and produce. The album, named \\"Se Chav√≥ El Vecindario/There Goes The Neighborhood\\", was issued by Col√≥n's current label, Fania Records. For the album sessions, Col√≥n assembled a solid lineup that consisted of Willie's band, as well as Rub√©n Blades (and in at least two songs, H√©ctor Lavoe) as part of the vocal chorus section. Following the release of \\"Se Chav√≥\\", Efra√≠n performed live with Vicky Soto on congas, Gilberto Col√≥n on piano, Goodwin Benjamin on bass, and Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, Marco Katz, Frankie Rosa, and Frank Figueroa on trombones. \\"Se Chav√≥\\" became a seminal work in the history of Puerto Rican plena, essentially revived Efra√≠n's career and made him famous in a few Latin American countries, particularly in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The album had three smash hits, a semi-autobiographical plena named \\"Ya Lleg√≥\\" (written for him by fellow Puerto Rican composer and singer Felito Felix) and another called \\"Julia Lee\\", the story of a bully who terrorized San Juan's Barrio Obrero neighborhood. A third hit was a medley of \\"Qu√© Ser√°\\" and \\"Askarakatiskis\\". In Puerto Rico, two additional plenas written by Tite Curet Alonso, one called \\"La Humanidad\\" (\\"The Humanity\\"), in which Tite criticizes people's pettiness that have ruined the friendship between two buddies, and \\"Tinguilikit√≠n\\", which describes Mayag√ºez's old horse-pulled tram and its bell, were minor hits. Soon after his mid-1960s albums were re-released. Death and legacy The increasing demand for his services, a relapse in his drug addiction, and his ill health combined to strike Efra√≠n in the peak of his popularity. He died on March 12, 1978 in Manhattan, New York City, of a heart attack. He was soon buried in Mayag√ºez's Old Municipal Cemetery, gathering the second largest funeral crowd assembled in the city, second only to that of the 1993 burial procession for Benjamin Cole, the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. An impromptu plena band played his songs during the walk between the religious service and his burial place. Fania Records released a posthumous album with unreleased tracks from the \\"Se Chav√≥\\" sessions and newer material, called \\"Forever\\". The album, produced by Johnny Pacheco, granted Efra√≠n one last hit, the rather fitting \\"Se Dice Gracias\\" (aka \\"¬°Bravo, Mon!\\"). A remastered version of \\"Se Chav√≥\\" was released in May 2007. Since Efra√≠n died intestate, legal disputes among family members, as well as between his estate and the publishers of his songs (and his fathers') prevent most of his music to be performed publicly by Latino media. Nonetheless, both Mons have left a legacy of plena standards that are popular to this day. Efra√≠n was regarded as one of the best g√ºiro players of his day (Tite Curet Alonso claimed he was only surpassed by Patricio Rijos, \\"Toribio\\", the legendary guiro player that accompanied Puerto Rican composer Felipe Rosario Goyco, \\"Don Felo\\", and whose statue can be found at the intersection of Tanca and San Francisco streets in Old San Juan). An example of Efra√≠n's g√ºiro playing can be heard at the end of the first percussion solo part of \\"Ya lleg√≥\\". The all-trombone brass lineup, on the other hand, persists in much of Willie Col√≥n's work, as well as in many plena bands, most notably in Puerto Rico's most successful plena band ever, Plena Libre. In 1976, while Efra√≠n was alive, a tribute song to him, \\"Cuch√∫ Cuch√°\\" became a sleeper hit in the Dominican Republic. The same song was later versioned by Jossie Esteban and his former group, Patrulla 15, and became a huge merengue hit in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and New York City. Just after Efra√≠n's death, the Puerto Rican plena collective Los Pleneros del Quinto Olivo recorded a tribute song, ¬øD√≥nde estar√° Mon? (\\"Where would Mon be?\\") that spoke fondly of Efra√≠n (although the song did have some inaccuracies concerning him). Celia Cruz recorded Efra√≠n's plena \\"A Pap√° Cuando Venga\\" (\\"When Dad Comes Back\\", a song describing a girl's experience with sexual harassment by a neighbor from her perspective, threatening him with a beating once her dad comes back from running errands) in bomba style with Willie Col√≥n, and had a huge hit with it in Puerto Rico. In the song \\"El Telefonito\\", from his 1981 album with Willie Col√≥n \\"Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos\\", Rub√©n Blades pays a tribute to Efra√≠n in the soneos section, parodying \\"Al√≥ ¬øQuien √ëama?\\" and its \\"trabalengua\\" style. So does H√©ctor Lavoe in the studio recording of \\"Mi Gente\\", written by Johnny Pacheco and recorded in 1973. A street in the \\"Rio Hondo\\" section of Mayag√ºez is named in Efra√≠n's honor.

Having made a name for himself at Athletic Bilbao, appearing in nearly 300 official games for the club in seven years, he subsequently earned himself a transfer to Barcelona, but failed to establish himself in three years, being used sparingly. Over 13 seasons in La Liga, Ezquerro amassed totals of 278 matches and 55 goals. Club careerOsasuna / Atl√©tico= Born in Calahorra, La Rioja, Ezquerro emerged through the youth ranks of CA Osasuna, playing two second division seasons with the Navarrese before signing with Atl√©tico Madrid for the 1996‚Äì97 campaign. He made his La Liga debut on 21 September 1996 in a 3‚Äì0 away win against CD Logro√±√©s, but was mainly registered with the club's B-side during his spell. =Athletic= Lack of playing opportunities with the Colchoneros prompted a January 1998 move to RCD Mallorca, which Ezquerro helped achieve runner-up accolades in the Copa del Rey in his six-month stint. Subsequently, he joined Athletic Bilbao, with whom he appeared in his first UEFA Champions League games while establishing as one of the most promising forwards in Spain's top flight, notably scoring in a 3‚Äì0 derby home victory over Real Sociedad on 9 April 2005. His stellar form in 2004‚Äì05 ‚Äì 47 official matches, 19 goals, including a hat-trick in a 7‚Äì1 away rout of Standard Li√®ge for the season's UEFA Cup group stage‚Äì led to Ezquerro signing for FC Barcelona in a period of 3+1 years, on a free transfer. =Barcelona= Ezquerro was never able to establish himself in Barcelona's first team, his progress at the club being further hindered after the emergence of youth graduate Lionel Messi. His best league output consisted of 12 games in his first year (two goals, three starts, in 469 minutes of play). In 2007‚Äì08, Ezquerro was not given the free transfer by the Catalans and, not being signed by any team in the summer on in the January transfer window, was virtually absent for the duration of the campaign, although he did score twice in January against lowly CD Alcoyano for the domestic cup's round of 32, in a 2‚Äì2 second leg home draw and 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. =Osasuna return / Retirement= In July 2008, Ezquerro was released by Bar√ßa and, late in the month, rejoined Osasuna in a 2+1-years deal. During his first season after his return he struggled with injuries and also failed to fit newly appointed coach Jos√© Antonio Camacho's plans, failing to make the squad of 18 in any of the team's final matches. Ezquerro was released after just one year ‚Äì earning ‚Ç¨1.4 million ‚Äì and retired at 33, after not being able to find a new club in the following months. International career During his debut season for Athletic, Ezquerro won his sole cap for Spain, in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Cyprus, which ended with a 2‚Äì3 away loss and the sacking of coach Javier Clemente, on 5 September 1998.

Description The Danxia area is formed from a reddish sandstone which has been eroded over time into a series of outcrops surrounded by spectacular cliffs and many unusual rock formations known as Danxia landform. There are a number of temples located on the mountains and many scenic walks can be undertaken. There is also a river winding through the mountains on which boat trips can be taken. =Rock formations= Among other attractions that make the Danxia range interesting, the area has the following characteristic stone formations: *Yang Yuan Stone, (' \\"male/father stone\\") bearing a remarkable resemblance to a phallus *Yin Yuan Stone or ' hole, which somewhat resembles a vulva. *Breasts Stone, human breast-shaped rocky outcrops on a cliff hanging 30 m above the ground.Guangdong - Danxia Mountain Pictures *Sleeping Beauty, a rocky range resembling a sleeping maiden.Danxia Range - Sleeping Maiden  Geology  Mount of Danxia is identified by multi-layered red sedimentary rocks of sandstone and conglomerate, and the area of was formed by the fluvial deposition through the basin 140-65 million years ago. The weather in Danxia area assist the oxidation reaction in rocks, and turned the color of them into red. Then these sediments were uplifted and condescend by water, and being accreted during the process. Finally, the area of Danxia was formed. Since the 6 million years ago, the basin of Danxia area has experienced several intermittent rises, which average increase of about 1 meter per 10,000 years. With the favor of water washing by the river, the mount of Danxia is cut into many layers, and formed the mount of Danxia nowadays.  Climate  Mount of Danxia locate at the southern side of the Nan Mountains, and it is in the subtropical southern margin, which is the humid subtropical climate. = Temperature = The annual average temperature of Danxia Mountain is 19.7 ¬∞C, the extreme minimum temperature is -5.4 ¬∞C, the extreme maximum temperature is 40.9 ¬∞C, and the maximum monthly average day is 18.8 ¬∞C.

After his sister's fall from favour, Willem joined the Russian army and took part in the Battle of Poltava. In 1711, he was appointed personal adjutant to the tsar. His other sister Matryona Balk had in the meantime become the closest friend of Catherine, whom Peter married in 1712. In 1716, at Catherine's behest, Peter entrusted Willem with administering her estates. After Catherine's coronation as consort in 1724, he was promoted to the rank of imperial chamberlain. A few months later, however, Willem Mons was arrested on charges of peculation (embezzlement) and breach of trust and, after a brief and brutal inquiry by Pyotr Tolstoy, he was publicly beheaded on November 27. His head was preserved in alcohol and is still kept in the Kunstkamera. There is a legend that Peter forced his wife to contemplate this gruesome exhibit for hours. The true causes of Willem's downfall are obscure. It was rumoured that Peter was enraged by his intimacy with the Empress. Many courtiers regarded Mons as Catherine's lover and his sister Matryona as their matchmaker. The affair did not affect Catherine's position as empress, however. Just months after his execution, Catherine succeeded to the throne and lavished honours on Matryona (who had been publicly flogged during her brother's trial) and her Lutheran daughter, Natalia Lopukhina, who would later give her name to the Lopukhina Conspiracy (1742‚Äì43).

The fuselage was completely redesigned by Canadair, going from the pressure cabin of the Britannia to an unpressurised one with bomb bays fore and aft of the wings. The powerplant was also changed from the Bristol Proteus turboprop engines to Wright R-3350 compound (piston) engines, which had lower fuel consumption necessary for extended missions at low level. At the design stage the other possible engine was the Napier Nomad, another turbo compound engine, although the Nomad was later cancelled. Testing From July 1960, a CP-107 Argus underwent hot weather testing at Eglin AFB, Florida.\\"Canadian Plane Now Undergoing Tests At Eglin.\\" The Okaloosa News-Journal (Crestview, Florida), Volume 46, Number 28, 14 July 1960, p. A-3. Operational history The Argus replaced the RCAF Lancaster and Lockheed P-2 Neptune aircraft types previously flown in the maritime roles. One of the most effective anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft of its day, the Argus was a mainstay for the RCAF. A large amount of equipment was carried, including: search radar, sonobuoys, electronic counter measures (ECM), explosive echo ranging (EER) and magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). Up to 8,000 lb (3,632 kg) of weapons could be carried in the bomb bays, including torpedoes and depth charges. A flight crew of 15 consisting of three pilots, three navigators (Observer Long range), two flight engineers and six radio officers (observer rad) until the early 1960s when the crew included both commissioned officers (tactical navigator/radio navigator) and non commissioned officers (observers), the number of which was dependent on the mission. Four crew bunks and a galley were provided to extend the efficiency of the crew on long patrols (average 18 hrs). The CL-28 had an endurance of approximately 26¬Ω hours with full armament. An Argus flown by 407 Maritime Patrol Squadron held the Canadian military record of slightly over 31 hours for the longest flight by an unrefuelled aircraft.Skaarup 2009, p. 88. The principal difference between the Mark I and Mark II was primarily in the different navigation, communication and tactical electronic equipment fitted internally. Externally, the Mk II exhibited a redesigned smaller nose radome and additional ECM antenna above the fuselage.\\"Canadair CP-107 Argus 2.\\" Canada Aviation and Space Museum.

It was created in 1985 when Tenneco bought selected assets of the agricultural division from International Harvester and merged it into its J.I. Case Company (IH itself then became Navistar.) Today Case IH is owned by CNH Industrial, which in turn is financially controlled by the Italian investment company Exor, which belongs to the Agnelli family. Products Case IH offers agricultural equipment, financial services, as well as parts and service support for farmers and commercial operators through a network of dealers and distributors. Productivity enhancing products include tractors; combines and harvesters; hay and forage equipment; tillage tools; planting and seeding systems; sprayers and applicators; and site-specific farming tools. Case IH has won many AE50 awards from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, ASABE, for their products. Some of Case IH's most famous equipment models include Axial-Flow combines, Magnum tractors, Steiger and Farmall.  History  Case IH history began when, in 1842, Jerome Case founded Racine Threshing Machine Works on the strength of his innovative thresher. In 1869 Case expanded into the steam engine business and, by 1886, Case was the world's largest manufacturer of steam engines. The company's founder died in 1891 at the age of 72. In 1892, Case was the first company to build a diesel-powered tractor. In 1911, The J.I. Case Company had three cars in the first Indianapolis 500. In 1967, Tenneco purchased J.I. Case, continuing to market the products under the Case name.

They changed their brand name to Case International at first, and then abbreviated that to Case IH. International Harvester had been in economic turmoil since 1980, but was still one of the largest tractor manufacturers in the world. Merging the two lines brought together the best of both traditions, offering a full line of agricultural equipment, and probably saved both companies from becoming a victim of the 1980s farming recession. In 1986, Case IH purchased Steiger Tractor and began producing their 4-wheel drive tractors under the Case IH name. In 1987, Case IH released the Case IH Magnum series, creating the first tractor to be built by Case and International Harvester together. In 1989, Case IH released the first Maxxum series tractor. In 1995, Case IH becomes the first agricultural manufacturer to release Advanced Farming Systems with global positioning system technology. In 1996, Case IH released the first Steiger Quadtrack. In 1997, Case IH took over Fortschritt. Fortschritt was an East German brand of tractors, combine harvesters and other agricultural machines made by VEB Fortschritt (part of the IFA) in Neustadt, Saxony. ;Merging with New Holland to create CNH Global In 1999, Case IH merged with New Holland Ag to form a new parent company, CNH Global. The majority owner of CNH Global is Fiat Industrial. In 2005, a STX500 Steiger Quadtrac tractor shattered the World Plowing Record, turning of farmland in just 24 hours.March 22, 2005 news release In 2006, the Case IH logo was displayed on a pair of Ferraris as part of the Ferrari Panamerican 20,000‚Äîa journey that took new Ferraris through 16 countries and across 20,000 miles (32,000 km) during a 15-stage, 84-day tour.August 4, 2006 news release The International Harvester \\"IH\\" logo in Case IH represents the head-on view of a farmer driving a tractor. The \\"I\\" symbolizes the driver of a tractor and is known as the red driver \\"I\\". 2007 was the Steiger tractor's 50th anniversary. At present, CNH Global continues to manufacture the tractors branded Case IH.

Perry (born 4 June 1952) is an English musician, songwriter, and author. He came to prominence in the mid-1970s as the guitarist for the English rock band the Only Ones. The Only Ones came out of London during the first wave of punk (1976‚Äì77) and, rather like the New York bands the Heartbreakers and Television with whom they later toured, suffered from being too musical for lumpen-punk but too \\"new\\" for conservative record business sensibilities. Though they were lumped in with the new wave vanguard, the band were too musically literate - not to mention long in the tooth - to be punks. Rather they were sophisticated guitar rockers whose sound embraced all flavors of 1950s and 1960s rock. Although never a huge commercial success, the band are highly influential. Perry's guitar style is noted for a combination of attack and melody, a mixture that the UK music magazine Sounds described as being \\"very superb\\".Sounds, May 1978 Music career John Perry was born in Bristol, England, and began to play the guitar at the age of 12. In his early teens he played roles in BBC Radio Drama and for the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Well paid, and a Beach Boys fan, he was torn between buying a surfboard or a guitar. He chose the latter and started his music career with local bands in Bristol. At 20 he joined a loose bunch of musicians centred on the Pink Fairies, Hawkwind and other UK Underground bands. After appearing at the 1971 Glastonbury Fayre (the first with the pyramid stage), he played in a series of British and European tours and festivals in Pilton, Oxford, Trentishoe etc. His bands include the Ratbites from Hell (pre-Only Ones) and Decline and Fall (post-Only Ones). He has also worked with Johnny Thunders, Marianne Faithfull, Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, Alejandro Escovedo, the Sisters of Mercy, Mick Green (Pirates), Robert Palmer, Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, Martin Stephenson and the Daintees, Wayne Kramer, Screaming Lord Sutch, James Williamson, Nick Kent & The Subterraneans, Michael Nyman, JC Carroll, The Members, Freddie Stevenson and Jayne County. He acted as musical director on the Johnny Thunders/Patti Palladin album Copycats. In late 1975, Perry hooked up with Peter Perrett, recording demos in South London. Over the next twelve months this collaboration evolved into the band the Only Ones. After a self-produced single, \\"Lovers of Today/Peter and the Pets,\\" the Only Ones signed a recording contract with CBS in January 1978. The band also received offers from Sire, Anchor and Island. According to reliable sources Island owner Chris Blackwell made several impassioned pleas to the band, culminating in a helicopter dash to a Midlands gig where he made a final appeal for the band sign to Island. The band's first major label single, \\"Another Girl, Another Planet,\\" appeared on CBS to immediate and almost universal critical acclaim but crawled no higher than the lower reaches of the Top 60, achieving only #56 UK. Despite frequent re-releases over three decades in various formats, sizes, and coloured vinyls the record never became a hit, even after frequent appearances in films and in a major European TV and cinema advertising campaign for Vodafone. The single appears in several critical volumes such as Paul Williams' Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles but has remained a \\"turntable hit\\". Working with producer Colin Thurston, the band later achieved a top forty album with Baby's Got a Gun (#37 UK). Between 1976 and 1980, the band recorded three studio LPs for CBS Records (Epic Records in the US) and also made sufficient appearances on BBC Radio and TV to release two albums: The John Peel Sessions and a double CD, Darkness & Light: The Complete BBC Recordings. John Perry cites The Peel Sessions as his favourite of all the bands' releases. \\"We were a great live band and the Peel recordings represent that. In bigger studios some band-members went overboard, filling all 48 tracks 'because they were there'; the Peel Sessions were live performances recorded on 8 track. Four songs in an afternoon. Less piddling around.\\"Interview with Pete Makowski, Sounds The Only Ones split in 1980 during an eventful US tour supporting the Who, which saw the arrests of several band members in separate events in California. In late February 2007, the Only Ones reformed, appearing at All Tomorrow's Parties and a sold-out show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. That summer they played huge outdoor festivals; they were second on the bill in London's Hyde Park to The White Stripes, and appeared at Harewood House in Yorkshire, and Inveraray Castle in Scotland where they played with Big Star, Primal Scream, Johnny Marr and many others. The band's tour schedule throughout 2008‚Äì10 took them to France, Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and twice to Japan. They returned to play Japan for a third time in November 2014. Despite packed concerts and great reviews, sources close to the band confirmed that the new songs heard in concert were not scheduled for release. These shows in Tokyo mark the band's final appearance. Perry, who played lead guitar on the Lemonheads' album Varshons, joined Evan Dando onstage at the Ben & Jerry's Summer Sundae festival at Clapham Common, London on 27 July 2008. More recently, Perry has played live and recorded with Martin Stephenson and the Daintees, Mark Keds' East London band Deadcuts, The Members frontman JC Carroll and Texan singer Alejandro Escovedo. Perry and Perrett appeared on Alejandro Escovedo's album The Crossing and, in January 2019, Perry joined guests Wayne Kramer (MC5), James Williamson (Stooges), and Joe Ely for the tour's opening night at The Paramount in Austin, Texas. Books Perry has written three books of musicology. First Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy on the Who's classic singles; and second an account of the making of the Rolling Stones' double album Exile on Main St.. His third book, on Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, was one of the earliest titles commissioned for the 33‚Öì series of books on music topics.

Life Tulindberg was born in V√§h√§kyr√∂ in Western Finland. He studied in Turku and then worked as a civil servant in Oulu from 1784 to 1809 and thereafter in Turku. He played the violin and cello and was appointed a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1797. He died in Turku at the age of 53. Music From his compositions only a violin concerto in B-flat major, six string quartets, and a polonoise with five variations for solo violin remain. He wrote the violin concerto before 1784 during his youth in Turku. The work shows \\"simplicity and occasional clumsiness\\" and the influences of Mozart, Haydn and the Mannheim School of music. His string quartets are more mature works and are better known today than the violin concerto. The string quartets are in the tradition of Haydn. A copy of Haydn's string quartets was found among Tulindberg's possessions after his death. Perspective Tulindberg was a contemporary of Mozart and, like Mozart, he was part of the Classical era in music. His importance stems largely from his pioneering position in the music of Finland. No Finnish composer is known from the Renaissance or Baroque eras. The compositions of Tulindberg were not rediscovered until 100 years after his death.

It is used in the Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo Carnival baterias and in the baterias of Bahia, where it is known as repique. It is equivalent to the tom-tom in the non-Brazilian drum kit or to the tenor drum in marching bands. It is tuned very high to produce a tone that cuts through the sound of the rest of the bateria and it is a lead and solo instrument. Typically its body is made of metal. The heads, made of nylon, are tightened through the use of metal tuning rods. The instrument is usually smaller in diameter than the Brazilian caixa (snare drum) but several inches longer in height and lacking a snare. It is carried using a shoulder strap attached to one of the tuning rods. In Rio-style samba it is played with one wooden stick and one hand. In Bahia it is played with two wooden sticks usually but in some cases also like the Rio-style (the bloco afro Il√™ Aiy√™ for example). It may also be played with two thin plastic \\"whippy\\" sticks. Shoulder Strap The repinique was established in samba percussion in the 1950s. Then, this drum was made out of wood with natural heads made from goatskin. Also the manner of playing was different. For example, in the soundtrack to the movie Black Orpheus one may hear the sound at that time. Baterias commonly include a group of repinique players whose patterns set the tempo to which the rest of the bateria plays by elaborating on the basic \\"1-2-3-4\\" rhythmic structure typical of samba. The repinique is also often used by the musical director as a lead instrument, producing calls to which the rest of the bateria responds in a set fashion. It is often played with the hand or stick and is used to alert the percussion section of rhythmic changes with chamadas (calls). In samba, it is also used to assist the dancer keep the tempo and rhythm of the piece The repinique is also used in American classical music as well.

It was fought 55 miles north of Valparaiso, Chile, near the coastal town of Papudo. Background Until November 1865, Chile had been the only country firm in its declaration of war against Spain, which desired to recapture its lost South American colonies. Through the efforts of its president, Mariano Ignacio Prado, Peru was subsequently galvanized into action against Spain. Familiar with Spanish naval movements, the Chilean corvette Esmeralda, under the command of Juan Williams Rebolledo, and whose crew included Arturo Prat, Juan Jos√© Latorre and Carlos Condell, waited for any Spanish ships to appear between Coquimbo and Valpara√≠so. The Chileans hoisted a British flag on their ship and maneuvered themselves close to the Spanish ship Virgen de Covadonga, under the command of Luis Fery (or Ferry), who thought that the ship may have been one of the similarly built British vessels Shearwater, Colombina, or Mutine. The Esmeralda opened fire on the Covadonga, which returned fire, but the Chilean gunners proved more skillful. After the Covadonga received severe hits that incapacitated its crew, the Spaniards attempted to escape, but it was too late. The Esmeralda followed her, continuing to fire. Fery called out his surrender to Williams Rebolledo, who ordered Manuel Thomson to take possession of the Spanish ship. Chilean engineers then worked to save the captured vessel. All in all, the battle lasted only half an hour. In addition to Commander Fery, six Spanish officers, and 115 sailors were taken as prisoners. The Chileans also captured the correspondence of Spanish Admiral Juan Manuel Pareja. This action, together with the general failure of Spanish operations during the Chincha Islands War, led to Pareja committing suicide on board his flagship a few days later. Covadonga, now a vessel in the Chilean Navy, later saw combat in the Battle of Iquique during the War of the Pacific.

She was a daughter of Matryona Balk, who was sister of Anna Mons and Willem Mons. She is famous for the Lopukhina Affair, an alleged conspiracy engineered by the diplomacy of Holstein and France at the Russian court and centered on the person of Lopukhina. By marriage to Stepan Vasiliyevich Lopukhin (a cousin of Eudoxia Lopukhina and a favourite of Eudoxia's husband Peter the Great) she was a member of the Lopukhin family. During the reign of Anna of Russia (1730‚Äì40), Natalia Lopukhina was described as \\"the brightest flower of St Petersburg court\\". Her liaisons with some of the most powerful courtiers and her arrogance toward Peter I's neglected daughter Elizaveta Petrovna must have fed the latter's jealousy. Elizaveta's accession to the throne in 1741 was a huge blow to Lopukhina. It was owing to her friendship with Anna Bestuzheva, wife of Mikhail Bestuzhev, that she managed to maintain her position at court. In 1742, however, the French agents de la Ch√©tardie and Lestocq arranged a complicated intrigue to slander both Lopukhina and Bestuzheva, thereby securing the downfall of the Austrophilic chancellor Aleksey Bestuzhev (Mikhail's brother). Lopukhina's affection for the exiled Count von L√∂wenwolde being well-known, her correspondence with this odious courtier was brought to light and presented to the Empress in the most unflattering light. Simultaneously, it was reported that her son Ivan Lopukhin, being drunk in a tavern, denounced Elizaveta's taste for English beer and mumbled several phrases which were interpreted calling for restoration of Ivan VI of Russia. The inquiry that followed established that the Lopukhin house used to be frequented by the Austrian agent Marquis Botta d'Adorno, who allegedly promised his support for restoration of Ivan VI on the Russian throne. After a rigid inquisition of twenty-five days, during which every variety of torture was freely employed against the accused, \\"the terrible plot,\\" wrote the British minister, Sir Cyril Wych, \\"was found to be little more than the ill- considered discourses of a couple of spiteful passionate women.\\" Nevertheless, Lopukhina and Bestuzheva were publicly punished on September 11, 1743. They were brought onto a scaffold in front of the Twelve Collegia in Saint Petersburg, stripped naked, and flogged with birch rods and the knout on their buttocks.–ö–∞—Ä—Ä–µ—Ä –î' –ê–Ω–∫–æ—Å—Å –≠–ª–µ–Ω. –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü–∞ –∏ –∞–±–±–∞—Ç Olma Media Group, , c.177-178–õ–æ–ø—É—Ö–∏–Ω–∞ –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞ - biografija.ru Bestuzheva bribed the executioner to give her only a mock flogging.Bain, Robert Nisbet. The Daughter of Peter the Great. Adamant Media Corporation, , p.94-95. The two women escaped execution, because before her accession in 1741, Elizaveta had vowed not to sign any death warrants as Empress. Lopukhina and Bestuzheva then had their tongues publicly torn out, and were exiled to Siberia. The Russian ambassador to Austria was instructed to demand Botta's condign punishment. This demand was presented at a special audience; whereupon Empress Maria Theresa declared that she would never admit the validity of extorted evidence, and issued a manifesto to all the Great Powers defending Botta and accusing the Russian court of rank injustice.Nisbet Bain (1854‚Äì1909), Russia under Anna and Elizabeth, public domain. It is generally believed that the savage reprisal was prompted primarily by Elizaveta's personal jealousy of Lopukhina's beauty and hostility towards the Mons family, who had blocked the ascension of her mother Catherine I of Russia to the throne. Lopukhina was allowed to return to the Russian capital only after Elizaveta's death on January 5, 1762.

Early life Sim√©us was born in Pont-Sond√© in Haiti's Artibonite Valley, the son of peasant rice farmers who never had a chance to get a school education. He grew up helping his parents work the land in Haiti to feed himself and his 11 siblings. In 1961, his family sold some land so he could fly to the United States to pursue a college education at Florida A&M; University. Sim√©us transferred to Howard University in Washington, DC, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering. In 1970, he became a US citizen.\\"Would-be candidate fights for chance to change Haiti\\", Boston Globe, October 19, 2005 In 1972, he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.University of Chicago Business School Career He worked his way up the corporate ladder.

In 1984, Sim√©us started working for TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., the $2.1 billion, black-owned food processing and distribution company. He served as president and CEO for two years before leaving in 1992 to buy and run his own business. In 1996, with $55 million financing, Sim√©us bought Portion-Trol Foods from Flagstar Corp in Mansfield, Texas, and renamed it Sim√©us Foods International Inc. Sim√©us Foods, based south of Fort Worth, manufactures value-added food products for national multichain restaurants and large institutions such as El Pollo Loco, Denny's, T.G.I. Friday's, and Burger King in the United States and Canada. Sim√©us Foods Intl. now generates $155 million a year. In 1999, Sim√©us established Org. Sov√© Lavi www.sovelavi.org, a nonprofit foundation to provide medical care, education, and clothing to Haitians. Between October 2004 and February 2005, he served on Florida Governor Jeb Bush's advisory board for Haiti. The group made a series of recommendations for Ha√Øti's security, economic development, and disaster preparedness. A group of about 40 U.S.-based Haitian business and civic leaders has urged him to run for president. Run for Haitian presidency After months of speculation, Sim√©us decided to contest the Haitian presidency in August 2005.\\"Businessman returns to Haiti to run for president\\", USA Today, 17 August 2005 Sim√©us' political platform includes making it easier for companies to invest in Haiti, promoting jobs, and rooting out corruption by making government accountable. Sim√©us said, \\"I want to create a Haiti where people are proud to stay because there are opportunities.\\" ...\\"I want a Haiti where there is access to capital for the average guy, for the poor guy who was born in a hut like I was born in.\\" During his campaign, he ran into a few challenges. His status as a dual citizen became a challenge. Sim√©us said that he still has Haitian citizenship, despite taking the US oath of allegiance. The Haitian Electoral Board disagreed. Eventually, this matter was taken to the Supreme Court of Haiti, which recently ruled that Sim√©us could place his name on the ballot, but he still faces election council challenges to his candidacy and a threat of prosecution alleging false candidacy claims on election papers. Article 135 states a presidential candidate must \\"be a native-born Haitian and never have renounced Haitian nationality\\" and have resided in the country for five consecutive years before the election. Another challenge is his public acceptance. Sim√©us was essentially unknown in Haiti prior to 2004 and many viewed him as an outsider. At a campaign rally, he was cordially received in Solino, a crumbling and crime-plagued neighborhood of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, but when his tour reached the Bel Air neighborhood, a stronghold for supporters of ex-president Aristide, dozens of angry men and women rushed onto the streets, hurling rocks and chunks of concrete at Sim√©us' car, forcing him to flee.\\"A Bitterly Divided Haiti Is Lurching Toward an Election\\", New York Times, 30 Oct 2005 On September 27, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on a 6-hour visit to Haiti, publicly and pointedly called on Haiti's interim government to hold \\"inclusive\\" elections.

La Florida formed part of the Captaincy General of Cuba, the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and the Spanish Empire during Spanish colonization of the Americas. While its boundaries were never clearly or formally defined, the territory was initially much larger than the present-day state of Florida, extending over much of what is now the southeastern United States, including all of present-day Florida plus portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Spain's claim to this vast area was based on several wide-ranging expeditions mounted during the 16th century. A number of missions, settlements, and small forts existed in the 16th and to a lesser extent in the 17th century; eventually they were abandoned due to pressure from the expanding English and French colonial projects, the collapse of the native populations, and the general difficulty in becoming agriculturally or economically self-sufficient. By the 18th century, Spain's control over La Florida did not extend much beyond a handful of forts near St. Augustine, St. Marks, and Pensacola, all within the boundaries of present-day Florida. Florida was never more than a backwater region for Spain and served primarily as a strategic buffer between Mexico (New Spain) (whose undefined northeastern border was somewhere near the Mississippi River), Spain's Caribbean colonies, and the expanding English colonies to the north. In contrast with Mexico and Peru, there was no gold or silver to be found. Due to disease and, later, attacks by the British and their Native American allies, the native population was not large enough for an encomienda system of forced agricultural labor, so Spain did not establish large plantations in Florida. Large free-range cattle ranches in north central Florida were the most successful agricultural enterprise and were able to supply both local and Cuban markets. The coastal towns of Pensacola and St. Augustine also provided ports where Spanish ships needing water or supplies could call. Beginning in the 1630s, a series of missions stretching from St. Augustine to the Florida panhandle supplied St. Augustine with maize and other food crops, and the Apalachees who lived at the missions were required to send workers to St. Augustine every year to perform labor in the town. The missions were destroyed by the British and Creeks in a series of raids from 1702-1704, further reducing and dispersing the native population of Florida and reducing Spanish control over the area. Britain took possession of Florida as part of the agreements ending the Seven Years' War in 1763. The new colonial ruler divided the territory into East and West Florida, but despite offers of free land to new settlers, was unable to increase the population or economic output, and Britain traded Florida back to Spain after the American War of Independence in 1783. Spain's ability to govern or control the colony continued to erode, and, after repeated incursions by American forces against the Seminole people who had settled in Florida, finally decided to sell the territory to the United States. The parties signed the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1819, and the transfer officially took place on July 17, 1821, over 300 years after Spain had first claimed the Florida peninsula. Establishment of Spanish Florida Narv√°ez expedition in 1528, Apalachee Bay. Spanish Florida was established in 1513, when Juan Ponce de Le√≥n claimed peninsular Florida for Spain during the first official European expedition to North America. This claim was enlarged as several explorers (most notably P√°nfilo Narv√°ez and Hernando de Soto) landed near Tampa Bay in the mid-1500s and wandered as far north as the Appalachian Mountains and as far west as Texas in largely unsuccessful searches for gold. The presidio of St. Augustine was founded on Florida's Atlantic coast in 1565; a series of missions were established across the Florida panhandle, Georgia, and South Carolina during the 1600s; and Pensacola was founded on the western Florida panhandle in 1698, strengthening Spanish claims to that section of the territory. Spanish control of the Florida peninsula was much facilitated by the collapse of native cultures during the 17th century. Several Native American groups (including the Timucua, Calusa, Tequesta, Apalachee, Tocobaga, and the Ais people) had been long-established residents of Florida, and most resisted Spanish incursions onto their land. However, conflict with Spanish expeditions, raids by the English and their native allies, and (especially) diseases brought from Europe resulted in a drastic decline in the population of all the indigenous peoples of Florida, and large swaths of the peninsula were mostly uninhabited by the early 1700s. During the mid-1700s, small bands of Creek and other Native American refugees began moving south into Spanish Florida after having been forced off their lands by English settlements and raids. They were later joined by African-Americans fleeing slavery in nearby colonies. These newcomers ‚Äì plus perhaps a few surviving descendants of indigenous Florida peoples ‚Äì eventually coalesced into a new Seminole culture. Contraction of Spanish Florida The extent of Spanish Florida began to shrink in the 1600s, and the mission system was gradually abandoned due to native depopulation. Between disease, poor management, and ill-timed hurricanes, several Spanish attempts to establish new settlements in La Florida ended in failure. With no gold or silver in the region, Spain regarded Florida (and particularly the heavily fortified town of St. Augustine) primarily as a buffer between its more prosperous colonies to the south and west and several newly established rival European colonies to the north. The establishment of the Province of Carolina by the English in 1639, New Orleans by the French in 1718, and of the Province of Georgia by Great Britain in 1732 limited the boundaries of Florida over Spanish objections. The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739‚Äì1748) included a British attack on St. Augustine and a Spanish invasion of Georgia, both of which were repulsed. At the conclusion of the war, the northern boundary of Spanish Florida was set near the current northern border of modern-day Florida. Other European powers Great Britain temporarily gained control of Florida beginning in 1763 as a result of the Anglo-Spanish War when the British captured Havana, the principal port of Spain's New World colonies. Peace was signed in February, 1763, and the British left Cuba in July that year, having traded Cuba to Spain for Florida. But while Britain occupied Florida territory, it did not develop it further. Sparsely populated British Florida stayed loyal to the Crown during the American Revolutionary War, and by the terms of the Treaty of Paris which ended the war, the territory was returned to Spain in 1783. After a brief diplomatic border dispute with the fledgling United States, the countries set a territorial border and allowed Americans free navigation of the Mississippi River by the terms of Pinckney's Treaty in 1795. France sold Louisiana to the United States in 1803. The U.S. claimed that the transaction included West Florida, while Spain insisted that the area was not part of Louisiana and was still Spanish territory. In 1810, the United States intervened in a local uprising in West Florida, and by 1812, the Mobile District was absorbed into the U.S. territory of Mississippi, reducing the borders of Spanish Florida to that of modern Florida. In the early 1800s, tensions rose along the unguarded border between Spanish Florida and the state of Georgia as settlers skirmished with Seminoles over land and American slave-hunters raided Black Seminole villages in Florida. These tensions were exacerbated when the Seminoles aided Great Britain against the United States during the War of 1812 and led to American military incursions into northern Florida beginning in late 1814 during what became known as the First Seminole War. As with earlier American incursions into Florida, Spain protested this invasion but could not defend its territory, and instead opened diplomatic negotiations seeking a peaceful transfer of land. By the terms of the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819, Spanish Florida ceased to exist in 1821, when control of the territory was officially transferred to the United States.  Discovery and early exploration  Florida from the 1502 Cantino planisphere = European discovery = Juan Ponce de Le√≥n is generally credited as being the first European to discover Florida. However, that may not have been the case. Spanish raiders from the Caribbean may have conducted small secret raids in Florida to capture and enslave native Floridians at some time between 1500 and 1510. Furthermore, the Portuguese Cantino planisphere of 1502 and several other European maps dating from the first decade of the 16th century show a landmass near Cuba that several historians have identified as Florida. This interpretation has led to the theory that anonymous Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to map the southeastern portion of the future United States, including Florida. This view is disputed by at least an equal number of historians. Juan Ponce de Le√≥n Expedition Juan Ponce de Le√≥n claimed Florida for Spain in 1513In 1512 Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, governor of Puerto Rico, received royal permission to search for land north of Cuba. On March 3, 1513, his expedition departed from Punta Aguada, Puerto Rico, sailing north in three ships.Proclamation presented by Dennis O. Freytes, MPA, MHR, BBA, Chair/Facilitator, 500TH Florida Discovery Council Round Table, American Veteran, Community Servant, VP NAUS SE Region; Chair Hispanic Achievers Grant Council In late March, he spotted a small island (almost certainly one of the Bahamas) but did not land. On April 2, Ponce de Le√≥n spotted the east coast of the Florida peninsula and went ashore the next day at an exact location that has been lost to time. Assuming that he had found a large island, he claimed the land for Spain and named it La Florida, because it was the season of Pascua Florida (\\"Flowery Easter\\") and because much of the vegetation was in bloom. After briefly exploring the area around their landing site, the expedition returned to their ships and sailed south to map the coast, encountering the Gulf Stream along the way. The expedition followed Florida's coastline all the way around the Florida Keys and north to map a portion of the Southwest Florida coast before returning to Puerto Rico. Ponce de Le√≥n did not have substantial documented interactions with Native Americans during his voyage. However, the peoples he met (likely the Timucua, Tequesta, and Calusa) were mostly hostile at first contact and knew a few Castilian words, lending credence to the idea that they had already been visited by Spanish raiders. Popular legend has it that Ponce de Le√≥n was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he discovered Florida. However, the first mention of Ponce de Le√≥n allegedly searching for water to cure his aging (he was only 40) came after his death, more than twenty years after his voyage of discovery, and the first that placed the Fountain of Youth in Florida was thirty years after that. It is much more likely that Ponce de Le√≥n, like other Spanish conquistadors in the Americas, was looking for gold, land to colonize and rule for Spain, and Indians to convert to Christianity or enslave. Other early expeditions Other Spanish voyages to Florida quickly followed Ponce de Le√≥n's return. Sometime in the period from 1514 to 1516, Pedro de Salazar led an officially sanctioned raid which enslaved as many as 500 Indians along the Atlantic coast of the present-day southeastern United States. Diego Miruelo mapped what was probably Tampa Bay in 1516, Francisco Hern√°ndez de Cordova mapped most of Florida's Gulf coast to the Mississippi River in 1517, and Alonso √Ålvarez de Pineda sailed and mapped the central and western Gulf coast to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in 1519. =First colonization attempts= In 1521, Ponce de Le√≥n sailed from Cuba with 200 men in two ships to establish a colony on the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula, probably near Charlotte Harbor. However, attacks by the native Calusa drove the colonists away in July 1521. After the skirmish, Ponce de Le√≥n was wounded as he had an arrow sticking out of his thigh. However, that was not the only injury he had during the battle. Ponce de Le√≥n died of his injuries upon the expedition's return to Havana. In 1521 Pedro de Quejo and Francisco Gordillo enslaved 60 Indians at Winyah Bay, South Carolina. Quejo, with the backing of Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n, returned to the region in 1525, stopping at several locations between Amelia Island and the Chesapeake Bay. In 1526 de Ayll√≥n led an expedition of some 600 people to the South Carolina coast. After scouting possible locations as far south as Ponce de Leon Inlet in Florida, the settlement of San Miguel de Gualdape was established in the vicinity of Sapelo Sound, Georgia. Disease, hunger, cold and Indian attacks led to San Miguel being abandoned after only two months. About 150 survivors returned to Spanish settlements. Dominican friars Fr. Antonio de Montesinos and Fr. Anthony de Cervantes were among the colonists. Given that at the time priests were obliged to say mass each day, it is historically safe to assert that Catholic Mass was celebrated in what is today the United States for the first time by these Dominicans, even though the specific date and location remains unclear. = Narv√°ez expedition = In 1527 P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez left Spain with five ships and about 600 people on a mission to explore and to settle the coast of the Gulf of Mexico between the existing Spanish settlements in Mexico and Florida. After storms and delays, the expedition landed near Tampa Bay on April 12, 1528, already short on supplies, with about 400 people. Confused as to the location of Tampa Bay (Milanich notes that a navigation guide used by Spanish pilots at the time placed Tampa Bay some 90 miles too far north), Narv√°ez sent his ships in search of it while most of the expedition marched northward, supposedly to meet the ships at the bay. Intending to find Tampa Bay, Narv√°ez marched close to the coast, through what turned out to be a largely uninhabited territory. The expedition was forced to subsist on the rations they had brought with them until they reached the Withlacoochee River, where they finally encountered Indians. Seizing hostages, the expedition reached the Indians' village, where they found corn. Further north they were met by a chief who led them to his village on the far side of the Suwannee River. The chief, Dulchanchellin, tried to enlist the Spanish as allies against his enemies, the Apalachee. Seizing Indians as guides, the Spaniards traveled northwest towards the Apalachee territory. Milanich suggests that the guides led the Spanish on a circuitous route through the roughest country they could find. In any case, the expedition did not find the larger Apalachee towns. By the time the expedition reached Aute, a town near the Gulf Coast, it had been under attack by Indian archers for many days. Plagued by illness, short rations, and hostile Indians, Narv√°ez decided to sail to Mexico rather than attempt an overland march. Two hundred and forty-two men set sail on five crude rafts. All the rafts were wrecked on the Texas coast. After eight years, four survivors, including √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, reached New Spain (Mexico). = De Soto expedition = Hernando de Soto had been one of Francisco Pizarro's chief lieutenants in the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, and had returned to Spain a very wealthy man. He was appointed Adelantado of Florida and governor of Cuba and assembled a large expedition to 'conquer' Florida. On May 30, 1539, de Soto and his companions landed in Tampa Bay, where they found Juan Ortiz, who had been captured by the local Indians a decade earlier when he was sent ashore from a ship searching for Narv√°ez. Ortiz passed on the Indian reports of riches, including gold, to be found in Apalachee, and de Soto set off with 550 soldiers, 200 horses, and a few priests and friars. De Soto's expedition lived off the land as it marched. De Soto followed a route further inland than that of Narv√°ez's expedition, but the Indians remembered the earlier disruptions caused by the Spanish and were wary when not outright hostile. De Soto seized Indians to serve as guides and porters. The expedition reached Apalachee in October and settled into the chief Apalachee town of Anhaica for the winter, where they found large quantities of stored food, but little gold or other riches. In the spring de Soto set out to the northeast, crossing what is now Georgia and South Carolina into North Carolina, then turned westward, crossed the Great Smoky Mountains into Tennessee, then marched south into Georgia. Turning westward again, the expedition crossed Alabama. They lost all of their baggage in a fight with Indians near Choctaw Bluff on the Alabama River, and spent the winter in Mississippi. In May 1541 the expedition crossed the Mississippi River and wandered through present-day Arkansas, Missouri and possibly Kansas before spending the winter in Oklahoma. In 1542 the expedition headed back to the Mississippi River, where de Soto died. Three hundred and ten survivors returned from the expedition in 1543. = Ochuse and Santa Elena = Although the Spanish had lost hope of finding gold and other riches in Florida, it was seen as vital to the defense of their colonies and territories in Mexico and the Caribbean. In 1559 Trist√°n de Luna y Arellano left Mexico with 500 soldiers and 1,000 civilians on a mission to establish colonies at Ochuse (Pensacola Bay) and Santa Elena (Port Royal Sound). The plan was to land everybody at Ochuse, with most of the colonists marching overland to Santa Elena. A tropical storm struck five days after the fleet's arrival at the Bay of Ochuse, sinking ten of the thirteen ships along with the supplies that had not yet been unloaded. Expeditions into the interior failed to find adequate supplies of food. Most of the colony moved inland to Nanicapana, renamed Santa Cruz, where some food had been found, but it could not support the colony and the Spanish returned to Pensacola Bay. In response to a royal order to immediately occupy Santa Elena, Luna sent three small ships, but they were damaged in a storm and returned to Mexico. Angel de Villafa√±e replaced the discredited Luna in 1561, with orders to withdraw most of the colonists from Ochuse and occupy Santa Elena. Villafa√±e led 75 men to Santa Elena, but a tropical storm damaged his ships before they could land, forcing the expedition to return to Mexico.  Settlement and fortification  The establishment of permanent settlements and fortifications in Florida by Spain was in response to the challenge posed by French Florida: French captain Jean Ribault led an expedition to Florida, and established Charlesfort on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina, in 1562. However, the French Wars of Religion prevented Ribault from returning to resupply the fort, and the men abandoned it. Two years later, Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re, Ribault's lieutenant on the previous voyage, set out to found a haven for Protestant Huguenot colonists in Florida. He founded Fort Caroline at what is now Jacksonville in July 1564. Once again, however, a resupplying mission by Ribault failed to arrive, threatening the colony. Some mutineers fled Fort Caroline to engage in piracy against Spanish colonies, causing alarm among the Spanish government. Laudonni√®re nearly abandoned the colony in 1565, but Jean Ribault finally arrived with supplies and new settlers in August. At the same time, in response to French activities, King Philip II of Spain appointed Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s Adelantado of Florida, with a commission to drive non-Spanish adventurers from all of the land from Newfoundland to St. Joseph Bay (on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico).Bushnell:2‚Äì3. In 1573 Men√©ndez de Avil√©s' territory was extended to the P√°nuco River, in New Spain. Men√©ndez de Avil√©s reached Florida at the same time as Ribault in 1565, and established a base at San Agust√≠n (St. Augustine in English), the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in what is now the continental United States.National Historic Landmarks Program ‚Äì St. Augustine Town Plan Historic District Men√©ndez de Avil√©s quickly set out to attack Fort Caroline, traveling overland from St. Augustine. At the same time, Ribault sailed from Fort Caroline, intending to attack St. Augustine from the sea. The French fleet, however, was pushed out to sea and decimated by a squall. Meanwhile, the Spanish overwhelmed the lightly defended Fort Caroline, sparing only the women and children. Some 25 men were able to escape. When the Spanish returned south and found the French shipwreck survivors, Men√©ndez de Avil√©s ordered all of the Huguenots executed. The location became known as Matanzas. The 1565 marriage in St. Augustine between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville, and Miguel Rodr√≠guez, a white Segovian conquistador, was the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in what is now the continental United States. Following the expulsion of the French, the Spanish renamed Fort Caroline Fort San Mateo (Saint Matthew). Two years later, Dominique de Gourgues recaptured the fort from the Spanish and slaughtered all of the Spanish defenders. However, he did not leave a garrison, and France would not attempt to settle in Florida again. To fortify St. Augustine, Spaniards (along with forced labor from the Timucuan, Guale, and Apalache peoples) built the Castillo de San Marcos beginning in 1672. The first stage of construction was completed in 1695. They also built Fort Matanzas just to the south to look for enemies arriving by sea. In the eighteenth century, a free black population began to grow in St. Augustine, as Spanish Florida granted freedom to enslaved people fleeing British colonies to the north. Fort Mose became another fort, populated by free black militiamen and their families, serving as a buffer between the British and Spanish.  Missions and conflicts  In 1549, Father Luis de C√°ncer and three other Dominicans attempted the first solely missionary expedition in la Florida. Following decades of native contact with Spanish laymen who had ignored a 1537 Papal Bull which condemned slavery in no uncertain terms, the religious order's effort was abandoned after only 6 weeks with de Cancer's brutal martyrdom by Tocobaga natives. His death sent shock waves through the Dominican missionary community in New Spain for many years. In 1566, the Spanish established the colony of Santa Elena on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina. Juan Pardo led two expeditions (1566-1567 and 1567-1568) from Santa Elena as far as eastern Tennessee, establishing six temporary forts in interior. The Spanish abandoned Santa Elena and the surrounding area in 1587. In 1586, English sea captain Francis Drake plundered and burned St. Augustine, including a fortification that was under construction, while returning from raiding Santo Domingo and Cartagena in the Caribbean.A. Burkholder, Mark; L. Johnson, Lyman Colonial Latin America. Oxford University Press, 1990. p. 145. His raids exposed Spain's inability to properly defend her settlements. The Jesuits had begun establishing missions to the Native Americans in Florida in 1567, but withdrew in 1572 after hostile encounters with the natives.M. McAlister, Lyle Spain and Portugal in the New World, 1492‚Äì1700. University of Minnesota Press, 1984. In 1573 Franciscans assumed responsibility for missions to the Native Americans, eventually operating dozens of missions to the Guale, Timucua and Apalachee tribes. Middleton, Richard; Lombard, Anne Colonial America: A History to 1763. Wiley-Blackwell 4th Edition, 2007. Chap 15, sec 1. The missions were not without conflict, and the Guale first rebelled on October 4, 1597, in what is now coastal Georgia. The extension of the mission system also provided a military strategic advantage from British troops arriving from the North. During the hundred-plus year span of missionary expansion, disease from the Europeans had a significant impact on the natives, along with the rising power of the French and British. M. A. Young, Gloria The Expedition of Hernando De Soto West of the Mississippi, 1541‚Äì1543. University of Arkansas Press, 1999. p. 24. During the Queen Anne's War, the British dismantled most of the missions. By 1706, the missionaries abandoned their mission outposts and returned to St. Augustine.  Period of friendship  An excerpt from the British‚ÄìAmerican Mitchell Map, showing northern Spanish Florida, the old mission road from St. Augustine to St. Mark's, and text describing the Carolinian raids of 1702‚Äì1706. Spanish Governor Pedro de Ibarra worked at establishing peace with the native cultures to the South of St. Augustine. An account is recorded of his meeting with great Indian caciques (chiefs). Ybarra (Ibarra) in 1605 sent √Ålvaro Mex√≠a, a cartographer, on a mission further South to meet and develop diplomatic ties with the Ais Indian nation, and to make a map of the region. His mission was successful. In February 1647, the Apalachee revolted. The revolt changed the relationship between Spanish authorities and the Apalachee. Following the revolt, Apalachee men were forced to work on public projects in St. Augustine or on Spanish-owned ranches. In 1656, the Timucua rebelled, disrupting the Spanish missions in Florida. This also affected the ranches and food supplies for St. Augustine. The economy of Spanish Florida diversified during the 17th century, with cattle ranching playing a major role. Throughout the 17th century, English and Scottish colonists from the Carolina and Virginia colonies gradually pushed the frontier of Spanish territory south. In the early 18th century, French settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast encroached on the western borders of the Spanish claim. Starting in 1680, English and Scottish soldiers from Carolina and their Native American allies repeatedly attacked Spanish mission villages and St. Augustine, burning missions and killing and enslaving Indians. In 1702, James Moore led an army of colonists and a Native American force of Yamasee, Tallapoosa, Alabama, and other Creek warriors under the Yamasee chief Arratommakaw. The army attacked and razed the town of St. Augustine, but could not gain control of the fort. Moore in 1704 made a series of raids into the Apalachee Province of Florida, looting and destroying most of the remaining Spanish missions and killing or enslaving most of the Indian population. By 1707 the few surviving Indians had fled to Spanish St. Augustine and Pensacola, or French Mobile. Some of the Native Americans captured by Moore's army were resettled along the Savannah and the Ocmulgee rivers in Georgia. In 1696 the Spanish had founded Pensacola near the former site of Ochuse. In 1719, the French captured the Spanish settlement at Pensacola. Some Spanish men married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek, or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the southern British colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. King Charles II of Spain issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around St. Augustine, but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spain as early as 1683. During the 18th century, the Native American peoples who would become the Seminoles began their migration to Florida, which had been largely depopulated by Carolinian and Yamasee slave raids. British Carolina's power was damaged and the colony nearly destroyed during the Yamasee War of 1715‚Äì1717, after which the Native American slave trade was radically reformed. Spanish Florida was a destination for escaped slaves from the British colonies. Spain offered them freedom if they converted to Catholicism. (Some, such as those from Angola, were already Catholic.) This policy was formalized in 1693.  Possession by Britain  The expanded West Florida territory in 1767. In 1763, Spain traded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for control of Havana, Cuba, and Manila in the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. As Britain had defeated France in the war, it took over all of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, except for New Orleans. Finding this new territory too vast to govern as a single unit, Britain divided the southernmost areas into two territories separated by the Apalachicola River: East Florida (the peninsula) and West Florida (the panhandle). The British soon began aggressive recruiting to attract colonists to the area, offering free land and backing for export- oriented businesses. In 1764, the British moved the northern boundary of West Florida to a line extending from the mouth of the Yazoo River east to the Chattahoochee River (32¬∞ 22‚Ä≤ north latitude), consisting of approximately the lower third of the present states of Mississippi and Alabama, including the valuable Natchez District. During this time, Creek Indians began to migrate into Florida, leading to the formation of the Seminole tribe. The aboriginal peoples of Florida had been devastated by war and disease, and it is thought most of the survivors accompanied the Spanish settlers when they left for other colonies (mostly French) in 1763. This left wide expanses of territory open to the Lower Creeks, who had been in conflict with the Upper Creeks of Alabama for years. The Seminole originally occupied the wooded areas of northern Florida. Under pressure from colonists and the United States Army in the Seminole Wars, they migrated into central and southern Florida, to the Everglades. Many of their descendants live in this area today as one of the two federally recognized Seminole tribes in the state. Britain retained control over East Florida during the American Revolutionary War, but the Spanish, by that time allied with the French who were at war with Britain, recaptured most of West Florida. At the end of the war the Peace of Paris (1783) treaties (between the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Spain) ceded all of East and West Florida to Spanish control, though without specifying the boundaries.  Second Spanish period  Under Spanish rule, Florida was divided by the natural separation of the Suwannee River into West Florida and East Florida. (map: Carey & Lea, 1822) Spain gained possession of West Florida and regained East Florida from Britain in the Peace of Paris of 1783, and continued the British practice of governing the Floridas as separate territories: West Florida and East Florida. When Spain acquired West Florida in 1783, the eastern British boundary was the Apalachicola River, but Spain in 1785 moved it eastward to the Suwannee River. The purpose was to transfer San Marcos and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida. After American independence, the lack of specified boundaries led to a border dispute with the newly formed United States, known as the West Florida Controversy. The two 1783 treaties that ended the American Revolutionary War had differences in boundaries. The Treaty of Paris between Britain and the United States specified the boundary between West Florida and the newly independent U.S. at 31¬∞.Article 2, Treaty of Paris (1783). However, in the companion Peace of Paris between Britain and Spain, West Florida was ceded to Spain without its boundaries being specified. The Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain, claiming that the northern boundary of West Florida was at the 32¬∞ 22‚Ä≤ boundary established by Britain in 1764 after the Seven Years' War. The British line at 32¬∞ 22‚Ä≤ was close to Spain's old claim of 32¬∞ 30‚Ä≤, which can be justified by referring to the principle of actual possession adopted by Spain and England in the 1670 Treaty of Madrid. The now independent United States insisted that the boundary was at 31¬∞, as specified in its Treaty of Paris with Britain. After American independence, Spain claimed far more land than the old British West Florida, including the east side of the Mississippi River north to the Ohio and Tennessee rivers. This expanded claim was based on Spain's successful military operations against the British in the region during the war. Spain occupied or built several forts north of the old British West Florida border, including Fort Confederaci√≥n, Fort Nogales (at present-day Vicksburg), and Fort San Fernando (at present-day Memphis).Fort Tomb√©cbe, Alabama Forts\\"Fort San Fernando De Las Barrancas\\" , The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Spain tried to settle the dispute quickly, but the U.S. delayed, knowing that time was on its side. By Pinckney's Treaty of 1795 with the United States, Spain recognized the 31st parallel as the border, ending the first West Florida Controversy. Andrew Ellicott surveyed this parallel in 1797, as the border between the United States and Spanish territories. In 1798, Ellicott reported to the government that four American generals were receiving pensions from Spain, including General James Wilkinson. Spain, beset with independence movements in its other colonies, could not settle or adequately govern Florida by the turn of the 19th century, its control limited to the immediate vicinity of towns and forts dotted across the north of the territory.Tebeau, p. 103 Tension and hostility between Seminoles and American settlers living in neighboring Georgia and over the Florida border grew steadily. Slaveholders wanted to reclaim fugitive slaves, and slave raiders frequently entered the territory, attacking Seminole villages and attempting to capture Black Seminoles. British agents working in Florida provided arms and other assistance to Native Americans, resulting in raids across the border that sometimes required intervention by American forces.Tebeau, p. 104-105 Several local insurrections and filibuster campaigns against Spanish rule flared, some with quiet support from the U.S. government, most notably the Patriot War of East Florida of 1810‚Äì1812 led by George Mathews. In 1817, a confused attack by a motley force of American and Scottish adventurers, Latin American revolutionaries, and pirates from Texas on Fernandina, temporarily claimed the whole of Amelia Island for the revolutionary republic of Mexico (not yet independent) for several months before U.S. forces retook the island and held it \\"in trust\\" for Spain until they could \\"properly police and govern it\\".Tebeau, p. 112 U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams called on Spain to gain control of Florida, calling the territory \\"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\\"Alexander Deconde, A History of American Foreign Policy (1963) p. 127 The United States Army led increasingly frequent incursions against the Seminoles in western Florida, most notably during an 1817‚Äì1818 semi-authorized campaign led by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War.Tebeau, p. 113 During the conflict, Jackson occupied Pensacola, leading to protests from Spain until it was returned to Spanish control several weeks later. By 1819, the United States effectively controlled much of the Florida panhandle, and Spain was willing to negotiate a transfer of the entire territory.Tebeau, p. 114 The Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty was signed between the United States and Spain on February 22, 1819, and took effect on July 17, 1821. According to the terms of the treaty, the United States acquired Florida and all Spanish claim to the Oregon Country. In exchange, the U.S. renounced all its claims to Texas and agreed to pay all Spanish debts to American citizens, which totaled about $5 million. Hundreds of Black Seminoles escaped from Cape Florida to the Bahamas in the early 1820s, to avoid US slave raiders.

He was the host of WindTunnel with Dave Despain on Speed Channel, and NASCAR Inside Nextel Cup, until the former was cancelled during the demise of Speed and the latter underwent a format change at the beginning of the 2008 NASCAR Season. On 14 December 2013 Despain announced on Twitter that he would be moving to MAVTV in 2014 to provide color commentary during races held on the channel and host a show called The Dave Despain Show. Early life and career A native of Fairfield, Iowa, Despain worked for a time at KMCD-AM, the local radio station. His earliest work included a program called \\"Dave Despain's Record- Go-Round\\". Eventually he worked in all phases of KMCD's programming, and became known for a unique broadcasting style in which he vigorously nodded and bobbed his head while speaking. Despain, a former motorcycle racer, later joined the American Motorcycle Association in the public-relations department. One day in the 1970s, producers of ABC's Wide World of Sports asked him to appear on camera for its coverage of a prestigious bike race at Daytona International Speedway. Despain agreed, and a new career was launched. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Despain was a pit reporter for both motorcycle and NASCAR races on WTBS and CBS, including the 1982 World Speedway Final at the LA Coliseum, the only time the World Final was held in the United States.http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?racerid=62 ESPN He then moved to ESPN as host of its prerace show, NASCAR 2Day. His final appearance on 12 November 2000. After that race, ESPN stopped carrying NASCAR races after being outbid for a new contract (although ESPN returned to NASCAR in 2007). Despain also hosted Motor Week and filled in for Bob Jenkins on SpeedWeek, and hosted some programs featuring drivers walking away from spectacular crashes. Speedvision/Speed Channel Despain joined Speed Channel in 2000 (then known as Speedvision). For some time Despain was one of several anchors of Speed News, Speed's racing newscast broadcast every weekend. In 2003, WindTunnel with Dave Despain debuted, in which Despain presided over an hour racing-centric call-in show. Wind Tunnel ran from 2003 until 2013, when it was cancelled during Speed Channel's transition to Fox Sports 1. Despain became host of NASCAR Inside Nextel Cup in 2005, replacing the panel show's longtime host Allen Bestwick. Despain hosted the series until its cancellation in 2008, when it was replaced by This Week in NASCAR. Dave Despain hosts a series of specials called Dave Despain On Assignment that has documented the history of the Daytona Beach course and Daytona International Speedway, and the Talladega Superspeedway. The episodes have appeared on the weekends of the Daytona 500 and the Pepsi 400, and the fall AMP Energy 500. MAVTV On 1 December 2013 Despain announced on Twitter that he would be moving to MAVTV in 2014. His first event with the network was to be the Chili Bowl on 18 January.

They were considered heretical by the Byzantine Church. Constantine was born in Mananali, near Samosata, Commagene. About 653 A.D., Constantine became friends with a traveling Armenian who had been held captive by the Saracens. The traveler gave Constantine a copy of the four gospels and the letters of Paul. Reading the gospels and epistles caused Constantine to change his name to Silvanus, after the companion of Paul, and begin preaching, gathering around him a group of followers who rejected what they considered the image worship and superstition of the Byzantine Church. Silvanus founded his first congregation, who became known as Paulicians, in Kibossa, near Colonia, in Armenia. For thirty years he traveled extensively, along the Euphrates valley, across the Taurus Mountains, and into the western parts of Asia Minor, making converts on the way. His missionary activities came to the attention of the Byzantine Emperor, Constans II, known as Constantine Pogonatus (the bearded). The Emperor issued a decree condemning the teachings of Silvanus and sentenced him to death by stoning. Simeon, the officer sent to carry out the execution, ordered Silvanus‚Äô friends and followers to stone him. The followers refused and dropped their stones, except for one young man, Justus, whom Silvanus had raised like an adopted son, who cast a stone at Silvanus and killed him. Simeon was impressed with the piety of Silvanus‚Äô followers and joined them, taking the name Titus. Justus betrayed Titus and the Paulicians by informing on them to the bishop. Emperor Justinian II ordered Titus and all the Paulicians to be burned to death as heretics in 690.E. H.

He was most notable for his four-year spell at Swindon Town, which was disrupted by various injuries and misfortunes. In addition to Swindon, his career saw him play for Cardiff City, Hereford United, Drogheda United, Exeter City, Bristol City, Maesteg Park and Haverfordwest County. He was predominantly a winger, usually playing on the right wing, but he also played as a striker. CareerEarly career= Christian made a name for himself at Exeter City where he scored 18 goals in 67 appearances before Bristol City decided to snap him up. He had joined Exeter from Cardiff City where he began his career as a trainee. However, he never fully established himself in the squad and was sold after being loaned out to Hereford United and Drogheda United. During his time at Bristol City, memorable moments include a hat-trick against Barnsley and the winner in a thrilling 5‚Äì4 win over Mansfield Town (his second of the game). He was also part of the side that won the 2003 Football League Trophy Final. =Swindon Town= After a deal for Darius Henderson fell through, Swindon Town's manager Andy King signed Roberts from local rivals Bristol City, initially for ¬£20,000, with an extra ¬£30,000 being paid in installments based on appearances and performances. Roberts made his debut the following Saturday, scoring the winner for the Town in a 1‚Äì0 win over Oldham Athletic on 16 October 2004. His second goal came just a week later, in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Barnsley Prior to the Football League Trophy match against Bristol City, his car was hit by a bus, then crashed into another car as he pulled out of a petrol station, resulting in Roberts suffering minor whiplash and bruising, and causing him to miss both the Bristol game, and the following FA Cup tie with Notts County. Shortly afterwards, however, he sustained what was the worst injury of his career. Initially believed to be a groin injury, it was eventually diagnosed as a hernia, requiring surgery, and Roberts was ruled out for two months. At the end of the season, Roberts had played 21 league games, scoring 3 goals. His second season would prove to be less successful. In January 2006, it was announced that Roberts had been admitted to the Sporting Chance clinic, suffering from alcohol dependence. He made 21 appearances in the league that season, scoring 3 goals ‚Äì but only started four games, as opposed to the seventeen of the previous season. The 2006/07 season started much more brightly, with Roberts winning the League Two Player of the Month award for August, for which he thanked former Swindon manager Iffy Onuora for keeping faith in him. Following Paul Sturrock's decision to convert Roberts into a striker, he had his most successful Swindon season, scoring 13 goals in all competitions, and signing a new two-year contract. This season would prove to be less successful, with Roberts suffering a knee injury that required surgery early in the season, Although recovering from the injury and returning to the team, scoring his fifth league goal of the season in January 2008 against Luton (a goal which took Swindon's unbeaten run to ten games), he was once again forced out with a knee injury in March. He finished the season having played 27 league games, with five goals. On 25 September 2008, Roberts announced that he was retiring from professional football after he failed to recover from the knee injury, with an attempted surgery being unsuccessful. Roberts had a testimonial match on the 11 February 2009, held between Swindon and an all-star Chelsea team, containing Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Di Matteo, amongst other ex-Chelsea players, with the money raised going to Cancer Research UK. The game finished with the Chelsea All- Stars winning 3-2, Zola scoring a hat-trick. =Return to Wales= In August 2009, Roberts joined Welsh Football League Division Two side Maesteg Park. In January 2011, he signed for Welsh Premier side Haverfordwest County. He retired from football, for the second time, at the end of the season, departing football for a period of time, before returning as an anti-racism ambassador. =International= Roberts was called up to the senior Wales squad in May 2003 to play United States but was unused and ultimately never capped at that level. Other works In 2010, Roberts published his biography \\"Life Is A Game of Inches\\". He also works as a Sessional education worker with anti-racism charity ‚Äì Show Racism the Red Card.http://www.barrycomp.com/news/news1011/srtrcwork.html ReferencesExternal links * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Cardiff Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales under-21 international footballers Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Drogheda United F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Maesteg Park A.F.C. players Category:Haverfordwest County A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Christian Roberts"},{"id":"2717014","text":"Goodwood may refer to:  Events  * Goodwood Festival of Speed, a motorsport event in the United Kingdom * Glorious Goodwood, a horseracing event in the United Kingdom * Goodwood Revival, a historical motorsport event in the United Kingdom  Places and structuresAustralia= * Goodwood, South Australia, Australia **Electoral district of Goodwood, a former electoral district in South Australia * Goodwood, Tasmania, Australia =Canada= *Goodwood, Nova Scotia *Goodwood, Ontario =New Zealand= *Goodwood, New Zealand, a farming community near Palmerston =South Africa= * Goodwood, Cape Town, South Africa =United Kingdom= * Goodwood, Leicestershire, England * Goodwood House, West Sussex, England - the estate includes: ** Goodwood plant, of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars ** Chichester/Goodwood Airport, West Sussex, England ** Goodwood Circuit, West Sussex, England ** Goodwood Racecourse, West Sussex, England ** Goodwood Cricket Club, West Sussex, England =United States= *Goodwood Plantation, Tallahassee, Florida *Goodwood (Richmond, Massachusetts), a historic house  Other uses * Operation Goodwood, a World War II British military operation during the Battle of Normandy, July 1944 * Operation Goodwood (naval), a series of Royal Naval attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz in August 1944 during World War II * Operation Goodwood (1968‚àí1969), actions fought between the 1st Australian Task Force and the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War ","title":"Goodwood"},{"id":"2717021","text":"Salem is a compact rural community and unincorporated place in the incorporated township of Centre Wellington, Wellington County, in southwestern Ontario, Canada.

The game takes place in a slightly cyberpunk futuristic setting in 2021. It was ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1993, allowing use of the 6-button CD32 gamepad. A remake of the game with improved graphics called D/Generation HD was released for Microsoft Windows by West Coast Software on October 23, 2015 and for the Nintendo Switch on March 27, 2018 in North America. and in Europe on April 3, 2018. Plot D/Generation's plot begins in Singapore on June 27, 2021. A French company called Genoq has developed a series of new genetically engineered bioweapons, which have run out of control and taken over Genoq's Singaporean lab. The main character is a courier making an emergency delivery by jetpack of an important package to one of Genoq's top researchers, Jean- Paul Derrida (a name likely inspired by the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida), and who is happily oblivious to the carnage until the lab's doors lock behind him. His customer is ten floors away, all of them crawling with bioweapons. Gameplay The game presents an isometric point of view of different interconnected, mazelike rooms that the player passes through floor by floor. Each room can require brains, brawn or both. All bioweapons present in a room must be killed and all air duct vents that they enter through sealed before proceeding further. The building's paranoid security system has predictably gone haywire, leaving rotating grenade launcher turrets, land mines, electrified floors and laser fences targeting humans. Less hostile puzzle elements are doors, the switches and computers that control them, keycards, infrared electric eyes and teleporters. The courier is soon armed with a laser gun that holds unlimited ammunition and a great puzzle value: its shots bounce off walls, trip switches and travel in teleporters. Finally, surviving Genoq employees and some special items are scattered around the floors. Rescuing a survivor by clearing a room of bioweapons and getting him/her to its entry point in one piece earns an extra life. Bombs are the most prominent item; they can blast through doors and destroy some hazards, making them a kind of a \\"get out of puzzle free\\" coupon. The number of lives is limited. Losing one restarts the room if any are left, the floor if not. Saving is available, loading returns to the start of the floor. Development D/Generation was originally developed for the 128K Apple IIe (utilizing Double-Hi-Res mode) under the name D-Generation. An early preliminary version for that platform exists and is dated 1989. According to the Prince of Persia journals by Jordan Mechner, the game was completed in 1990 but the MS-DOS version from 1991 appears to be the first public release. While the original Apple II version was fully playable and well polished, it was never publicly released. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Amiga CD32 version a 7.25 out of 10. They criticized that the Amiga CD32 controller does not work well with the game's isometric perspective, but praised the combination of action and puzzles, describing the game as both addictive and challenging. The game was ranked the 40th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 In 1994, PC Gamer US named D/Generation the 32nd best computer game ever. The editors wrote that its \\"clever mix of puzzle-solving and arcade action hooked nearly everyone who did get a chance to try it out.\\" That same year, PC Gamer UK named it the 44th best computer game of all time, calling it the \\"best game of its type on the PC.\\" In 1998, PC Gamer US declared it the 38th-best computer game ever released, and the editors wrote that its \\"gameplay is still as fresh and inviting as the day it was first released.\\"  References External links * *Now available to play online at archive.org/details/msdos_D-Generation_1991 *Video of opening sequence, music, and gameplay on Youtube *Italian fan translation of the game at OldgamesItalia.net Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:Atari ST games Category:CD32 games Category:DOS games Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:Video games scored by Mark Knight Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Science fiction video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Video games set in 2021 Category:Single-player video games Category:Cyberpunk video games ","title":"D/Generation"},{"id":"2717024","text":"Artemisia Geyser is a geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States.

Often such social intuitionism is based on \\"moral dumbfounding\\" where people have strong moral reactions but fail to establish any kind of rational principle to explain their reaction. Social intuitionism proposes four main claims about moral positions, namely that they are (1) primarily intuitive (\\"intuitions come first\\"), (2) rationalized, justified, or otherwise explained after the fact, (3) taken mainly to influence other people, and are (4) often influenced and sometimes changed by discussing such positions with others. This model diverges from earlier rationalist theories of morality, such as of Lawrence Kohlberg's stage theory of moral reasoning. Inspired in part by Antonio Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt's (2001) Social Intuitionist Model de- emphasized the role of reasoning in reaching moral conclusions. Haidt asserts that moral judgment is primarily given rise to by intuition, with reasoning playing a smaller role in most of our moral decision-making. Conscious thought-processes serve as a kind of post hoc justification of our decisions. His main evidence comes from studies of \\"moral dumbfounding\\" where people have strong moral reactions but fail to establish any kind of rational principle to explain their reaction.Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 539, Kindle ed. In footnote 29, Haidt credits the neology of the term moral dumbfounding to social/experimental psychologist Daniel Wegner. An example situation in which moral intuitions are activated is as follows: Imagine that a brother and sister sleep together once. No one else knows, no harm befalls either one, and both feel it brought them closer as siblings. Most people imagining this incest scenario have very strong negative reaction, yet cannot explain why.Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 763 Kindle ed. Referring to earlier studies by Howard Margolis and others, Haidt suggests that we have unconscious intuitive heuristics which generate our reactions to morally charged-situations, and underlie our moral behavior. He suggests that when people explain their moral positions, they often miss, if not hide, the core premises and processes that actually led to those conclusions.Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 1160 Kindle ed. right Haidt's model also states that moral reasoning is more likely to be interpersonal than private, reflecting social motives (reputation, alliance-building) rather than abstract principles. He does grant that interpersonal discussion (and, on very rare occasions, private reflection) can activate new intuitions which will then be carried forward into future judgments. Reasons to doubt the role of cognition Haidt (2001) lists four reasons to doubt the cognitive primacy model championed by Kohlberg and others. # There is considerable evidence that many evaluations, including moral judgments, take place automatically, at least in their initial stages (and these initial judgments anchor subsequent judgments). # The moral reasoning process is highly biased by two sets of motives, which Haidt labels \\"relatedness\\" motives (relating to managing impressions and having smooth interactions with others) and \\"coherence\\" motives (preserving a coherent identity and worldview). # The reasoning process has repeatedly been shown to create convincing post hoc justifications for behavior that are believed by people despite not actually correctly describing the reason underlying the choice. This was demonstrated in a classic paper by Nisbett and Wilson (1977). # According to Haidt, moral action covaries more with moral emotion than with moral reasoning. These four arguments led Haidt to propose a major reinterpretation of decades of existing work on moral reasoning: Objections to Haidt's model Among the main criticisms of Haidt's model are that it underemphasizes the role of reasoning. For example, Joseph Paxton and Joshua Greene (2010) review evidence suggesting that moral reasoning plays a significant role in moral judgment, including counteracting automatic tendencies toward bias. Greene and colleagues have proposed an alternative to the social intuitionist model ‚Äì the Dual Process Model ‚Äì which suggests that deontological moral judgments, which involve rights and duties, are driven primarily by intuition, while utilitarian judgments aimed at promoting the greater good are underlain by controlled cognitive reasoning processes. Augusto Blasi emphasizes the importance of moral responsibility and reflection as one analyzes an intuition. His main argument is that some, if not most, intuitions tend to be self-centered and self-seeking. Blasi critiques Haidt in describing the average person and questioning if this model (having an intuition, acting on it, and then justifying it) always happens. He came to the conclusion that not everyone follows this model. In more detail, Blasi proposes Haidt's five default positions on intuition. * Normally moral judgments are caused by intuitions, whether the intuitions are themselves caused by heuristics, or the heuristics are intuitions; whether they are intrinsically based on emotions, or depend on grammar type of rules and externally related to emotions. * Intuitions occur rapidly and appear as unquestionably evident; either the intuitions themselves or their sources are unconscious. * Intuitions are responses to minimal information, are not a result of analyses or reasoning; neither do they require reasoning to appear solid and true. * Reasoning may occur but infrequently; its use is in justifying the judgment after the fact, either to other people or to oneself. Reasons in sum do not have a moral function. Because such are the empirical facts, the \\"rationalistic\\" theories and methods of Piaget and Kohlberg are rejected. Blasi argues that Haidt does not provide adequate evidence to support his position. Other researchers have criticized the evidence cited in support of social intuitionism relating to moral dumbfounding, arguing these findings rely on a misinterpretation of participants' responses.

Renaissance Men by Dave Rhea, SWORDs TODAY, JANUARY 2011.HACA's Research Trip to England: Visiting England's leaders in historical swordsmanship by Adrian Ko, Sword Forum Magazine Online, 1999 . ARMA was formed in 2001 under director John Clements as a continuation of the Historical Armed Combat Association (HACA, since 1992). As of 2006, the ARMA claimed a number of close to 500 paying members.Year in Review 2005 - \\"Our membership is now rapidly approaching the 500 mark...\\" They also list a number of \\"Academic Consultants\\".Experts This page lists the consultants with which ARMA maintains a relationship.  History  The ARMA began in 1992 as the Historical Armed Combat Association (HACA), a group led principally by Hank Reinhardt, an avid sword enthusiast. Reinhardt's idea was to provide an umbrella organization for individuals interested in Western swords and historical weaponry.History of ARMA In 1993, John Clements took over the HACA, 1993 saw the beginning of reforms within the organization and the foundation of its first Study Group. HACA began focusing more intently on the study and interpretation of the historical source literature of Renaissance Martial Arts, much of which was presented on the websiteManuals A list of historical texts offered for free on the ARMA website. along with example training methods. In 2001, the decision was made for the HACA to expand and evolve into what was believed would be a more effective educational organization for the study and practice of Medieval and Renaissance fencing. An efficient study curriculum for practice had also been developed at this time using the source literature.The ARMA System for Historical Fencing and Study As one of the changes, the organization was renamed \\"the ARMA.\\" 2001 also saw the introduction of a \\"national training program\\" (a series of seminars and workshops), ranking and certifications in the curricula, and the implementation of the basic philosophy and methodology used by the ARMA today. The ARMA's conceptualization was also influenced by the work of Sydney Anglo, as presented in his work, The Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe (Yale University Press 2000), hailed as the first academic treatment of Western martial arts in English.Review: The Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe by Greg Mele. During the ARMA International Event in August, 2009, ARMA Director John Clements introduced to the ARMA membership a new curriculum for the Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe (MARE), referred to within ARMA as the \\"Rosetta Stone\\". Clements intended this new curriculum as based on \\"how the historical masters were teaching the art\\".Our New Rosetta Stone Advancing Reconstruction of Forgotten European Fighting Arts In September 2010 the ARMA became an official representative for the Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe (MARE) to the World Martial Arts Union (WoMAU).ARMA Inducted into the World Martial Arts Union. World Martial Arts Union: ARMA(the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts) . The WoMAU is a nonprofit organization affiliated with the Foreign Ministry of South Korea, founded in 2001 at Konkuk University, Chungju, with the aim to \\"make Chungju a mecca of martial arts\\". Curriculum The ARMA aims at a reconstruction of historical techniques, avoiding \\"borrowings\\" from living traditions of martial arts or classical fencing.The Return of Western Sword Fighting by Jason M. Taylor, Black Belt Magazine, February 2010 Wooden wasters and steel feather swords (Federschwert) are used for basic drilling and technique work, up to and including free-play. Padded contact-weapons, along with helmets and appropriate padding, were previously used for more intense free-play, including sparring at full speed and power, though these have fallen out of favor. Sharp replica swords are used only for testcutting and to teach students proper edge control and cutting technique.Methods -\\"The ARMA Training Methodology consists of using 4 tools for a well-rounded comprehensive understanding: blunt swords, wooden wasters, padded contact- weapons, and sharp blades.\\" The body of training techniques and methods used by the ARMA is referred to as Armatura and includes distance and timing drills, footwork and cutting drills, striking and counter-strike exercises, grappling elements, and flourish drills. The ARMA curriculum encompasses a variety of weapons and weapon combinations, armored and unarmored, including longsword, greatsword, single sword (cut & thrust), sword & buckler, sword & dagger, Messer, rapier, rapier & dagger, single dagger, polearm, and short staff. Kampfringen, a historical system of unarmed combat, is also taught, both as it relates to fighting with weapons and as a separate discipline.  Organization Associate Members and Study Groups= Upon joining the ARMA, new members receive learning material. Lone members are Associates and three or four members who work together locally may apply to form official Study Groups. Non-members are allowed limited practice with members and Study Groups, but are encouraged to join the organization. In addition, regional Study Days, member Workshop events, and National Training Program Seminars are frequently held, and members in a given area will probably have the opportunity to attend at least one annually. Larger international gatherings are held less frequently. In both cases, senior students and expert instructors are invited to present classes, lectures, and National Training Program seminars to attendees. ARMA members are given priority in these events, and non-members may be prohibited from participating in certain Workshops. However, one- and two-day \\"open workshops\\" are offered in which non-member may attend.Seminars - \\"We offer full 1 or 2-day ARMA Seminar events for non-members worldwide. ARMA open Seminars are open to ANYONE to attend, not just members.\\" Outside the USA, there are Study Groups in Poland, Mexico, and Greece. ARMA Practice Partners List; an affiliated group is listed in Chile. ARMA's forum is also an important means of community discussion within the organization, and currently contains over one thousand registered users.Forum - The automated activity log reads \\"We have 1074 registered users\\" as of July 23, 2007. =National Training Program= The National Training Program acts as the core instructive curriculum of ARMA, offering basic fundamental knowledge to participants so that they may study and progress on their own. The program content is a composite approach derived from the teachings of a variety of historical masters, and specifically designed for students and practitioners over extended distances who are without the benefit of competent instruction or practice partners. All of the knowledge required for rank advancement within the ARMA is covered in the NTP.ARMA National Training Program The National Training Program provides training in six main areas, each featuring some subsets. These are the Longsword (NTP 1.x), the Sword and Dagger (NTP 2.x), the Rapier (NTP 3.x), unarmed fighting (NTP 4.x), dagger fighting (NTP 5.x), and armoured fighting (NTP 6.x). However, the ARMA currently focuses on the Longsword, Sword and Dagger, and the Rapier as foundational instructional principles. The NTP currently focuses on three main areas: Medieval Long-Sword, Renaissance (cut & thrust) Short Sword, and Rapier. Other weapons and skills follow from these. =Uniform and Rankings= The uniform worn by members of the ARMA consists of a red T-shirt and black sweatpants. Non-members who practice with ARMA study groups are encouraged to wear a white T-shirt and black sweatpants. ARMA members of Provost rank wear instead a black T-shirt with red pants. (Senior students may also assume this uniform when offering instruction at official seminars.) There is also a recognized but optional ARMA formal \\"dress uniform,\\" which consists of period- style clothing in the same color scheme. ARMA ranking is somewhat informal, and is based on the four-tiered system employed by the London Company of Masters, \\"Scholar\\", \\"Free Scholar\\", \\"Provost\\" and \\"Master\\". All ARMA members are considered to possess the rank of \\"Scholar\\". Scholars who achieve sufficient command of the Armatura and basic principles of the ARMA program, and a matching knowledge of the fighting manuals and historical masters, are advanced to the rank of \\"Scholar Adept\\". Scholar Adepts who demonstrate considerable expertise in all areas of the ARMA training program and an advanced knowledge of the source material are considered for \\"Free Scholar\\" rank. Testing for either rank involves an extensive oral examination and the physical demonstration of technique, as determined by the instructors conducting the test. Qualifying for Free Scholar rank also requires a Prize Playing. Free Scholar testing may be administered by any Free Scholar. Free Scholar certification requires the oversight of two or more Free Scholars or the Director; by custom, as many Free Scholars as can be gathered are present to oversee such a test. Unlike rankings in most martial arts organizations, Free Scholar rankings must be renewed; if a scholar has not advanced to a higher rank within four years of playing his prize, he must be retested in order to retain his current status. Free Scholar rankings are earned in a specific weapon, and a candidate must achieve a rank with the longsword before testing for any other weapon. At the present time, there are seven Free Scholars in the longsword, and no rank has been awarded in any other weapon (though such rank likely will be once the curricula for other weapons is fully established). Above Free Scholar are the ranks of Provost, Senior Provost, and Master. At present the only holder of the rank Provost is former ARMA Deputy Director Aaron Pynynberg (now no longer part of ARMA). The ARMA considers it highly inappropriate at this juncture to consider naming any ARMA practitioner a \\"Master\\" of these extinct arts, as the ARMA believes that the restoration of Medieval and Renaissance martial arts is still in its infancy and no modern practitioner has contributed to the art enough to claim the title of \\"Master\\". Modern \\"Masters\\" \\"It is a historical fact that there are not now, nor have there been for several centuries, any \\"Masters\\" of Medieval or Renaissance fighting arts.\\" Outside of this system, there is a purely academic distinction called \\"Senior Researcher\\" that is granted to ARMA scholars who contribute significantly to the general body of knowledge on historical fencing. The ARMA also has over a dozen \\"Expert Consultants\\" from different fields who have offered their knowledge and expertise to its efforts.

She has also been known as Joan Boucher or Butcher, or as Joan Knell or Joan of Kent. Life Bocher's origins are unclear, but it is known that families named Bocher and Knell lived in the area round Romney Marsh. She was associated with Anabaptists in Kent, some of them immigrants who had fled persecution in the low countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). In the 1530s and 1540s she was \\"much in favour in reforming circles\\" in Canterbury.Andrew Hope, Joan Bocher in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) Her first conflict with church and state came after she spoke against the sacrament of the altar, but she was released from imprisonment by a commissary of Thomas Cranmer and Christopher Nevinson. This leniency was held against Nevinson when he was charged in 1543 with involvement in the Prebendaries' Plot. Bocher developed an interest in Anabaptist ideas, and took up the idea of Christ's celestial flesh, \\"not incarnate of the Virgin Mary\\".Benjamin Evans, The Early English Baptists (London 1864) quoting Gilbert Burnet's History of the Reformation (1682) She was arrested as a heretic in 1548 and convicted in April 1549. Then followed a year's imprisonment during which various well-known religious figures were enlisted to try to persuade her to recant. She was unmoved, and Cranmer was involved in bringing her to the stake on 2 May 1550, though accounts of him forcing Edward VI to sanction this‚Äîwith Edward \\"driven to pen the mandates\\", as Wordsworth put itWilliam Wordsworth, Edward signing the warrant for the execution of Joan of Kent‚Äîmay be inaccurate. John Foxe approached royal chaplain John Rogers to intervene to save Joan, but Rogers refused with the comment that burning was \\"sufficiently mild\\" for a crime as grave as heresy. Rogers himself was later burnt during the Marian persecutions. Anecdotes Some well-known stories about Bocher were first recounted by Robert Parsons in 1599: for instance, Joan's friendship with Anne Askew and her involvement in smuggling Tyndale's New Testament into England, and into the royal court under her skirts. According to Parsons in A temperate ward-word, he had learned these things from someone who had been present at her trial.

History By 1900, a hotel, blacksmith shop and a few houses were located at the settlement. In 1903, Joseph and Ellen House opened a store there in a small room of their house. The Canadian Pacific Railway completed a line from Guelph to Goderich in 1907, passing through the settlement. A large two-story railway station with living quarters for the stationmaster was established there. Italian labourers were employed to build the rail line, living in a caboose which followed the line's construction. The labourers purchased goods at the House's store, and bought produce from local farmers. The settlement had no official name prior to the railway being built, and was often called Weissenburg, which was the same name as a settlement located west. Railway officials therefore chose the name Weissenburg for their new station at the settlement. Postal officials objected because the Weissenburg settlement to the west had a post office, and they did not want a post office--and a railway station with the same name--located so far apart. Postal officials instead decided to open a new post office at the settlement near the new train station. Names for the new post office were suggested by residents and included \\"Martindale\\", after David Martin, who had owned the land where the railway station was established, and \\"Ariss\\", after Mrs. Ariss, the settlement's oldest resident. When Ariss was selected as the name for the new post office, the railway renamed their station Ariss. Ellen House served as postmaster for 20 years, with the post office located in the family store. Ellen House would carry mail to and from the train station each day. In 1913, two rural mail delivery routes were established from the Ariss post office. The post office and store were sold to Frank Schuett in 1928. The Ariss railway station was used to ship locally grown hogs, cattle and turnips, while feed and coal were shipped to the Ariss station from Goderich. The station never developed into a significant shipping point, and by the 1920s, not all passenger trains were stopping there. The post office used a \\"catch pole\\" so mail could be picked up without the train needing to stop. When the railway station burned down in the 1930s, it was replaced by a much smaller building. Passenger use along the line decreased as a result of the Great Depression and increased ownership of automobiles. Passenger rail service on the line ended in 1955, and the rail line was abandoned in 1988 and the rails removed. In 1998, the County of Wellington and the Regional Municipality of Waterloo leased of the former railway bed to create a recreational rail trail. The Kissing Bridge Railtrail ran from Millbank to Guelph, passing through Ariss. The railtrail was lengthened in 2013, and renamed the Goderich to Guelph Rail Trail. Ariss Valley Golf and Country Club is located south of Ariss.

ACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin (1‚Äì7) (a vasodilator). ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.  Structure  Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells. ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain. ACE2 is a single- pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues. The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted as urine.  Location within the body  ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs. ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem. The expression of ACE2 in cortical neurons and glia make them susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 attack, which was the possible basis of anosmia and incidences of neurological deficits seen in COVID-19.Baig AM. Neurological manifestations in COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. CNS Neurosci Ther. 2020;26(5):499‚Äì501. doi:10.1111/cns.13372 As anosmia and dysgeusia are seen early in many COVID-19 patients, it was suggested to be considered to be a heralding clue in COVID-19,Baig AM, Khaleeq A, Ali U, Syeda H. Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS: Tissue Distribution, Host-Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic Mechanisms. ACS Chem Neurosci. 2020;11(7):995‚Äì998. doi:10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00122 which subsequently was declared as \\"significant symptoms\\" in COVID-19 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery.  Function  The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II. ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH). ACE2 can also cleave numerous peptides, including , apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin. ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.  Coronavirus entry point  As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells. This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic. It has also been shown that disruption of S-protein glycosylation significantly impairs viral entry, indicating the importance of glycan-protein interactions in the process. This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection. On the other hand, ACE2 has been shown to have a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury by increasing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1‚Äì7. Furthermore, according to studies conducted on mice, the interaction of the spike protein of the coronavirus with ACE2 induces a drop in the levels of ACE2 in cells through internalization and degradation of the protein and hence may contribute to lung damage. Both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that are used to treat high blood pressure have been shown in rodent studies to upregulate ACE2 expression, possibly affecting the severity of coronavirus infections. A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that \\"use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with controls.\\" Moreover, \\"the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure. Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia.\\" An April 2020 study of patients hospitalized in Hubei Province in China found a death rate of 3.7% for patients suffering from hypertension and were taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The death rate was compared with 9.8% of hospitalized patients with hypertension not taking such drugs, suggesting that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not harmful and may help against the coronavirus. Despite lack of conclusive evidence, some have advocated for and against the cessation of ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy. An in vitro study focused on the early stages of infection found that clinical- grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. Virtual screening of the 1930 FDA- approved drugs followed by molecular dynamics analysis predicted ritonavir and naloxegol block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the human ACE2 receptor, much more effectively than those drugs undergoing clinical trials, including remdesivir, lopinavir, sofosbuvir, and daclatasvir.  Recombinant human ACE2  Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is surmised to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary blood flow and oxygen saturation in piglets with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours. Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin- angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

According to egyptologist Kim Ryholt, Renseneb was the 14th king of the dynasty, while Detlef Franke sees him as the 13th ruler and J√ºrgen von Beckerath as the 16th.Detlef Franke: Zur Chronologie des Mittleren Reiches.

Attestations Renseneb is known primarily thanks to the Turin King List where he appears in Column 7, line 16 (Gardiner col. 6 line 6). He is credited a reign of four months. Renseneb is otherwise known from a single contemporary object, a bead of glazed steatite, last seen by Percy Newberry in an antique dealer shop in Cairo in 1929.Kim Ryholt: A Bead of King Ranisonb and a Note on King Qemaw, Gottinger Miszellen - Beitrage zur Agyptologischen Diskussion 156 (1997), p. 95‚Äì100. The bead reads \\"Ranisonb Amenemhat, who gives life\\". The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt interprets this double name as meaning \\"Ranisonb [Son of] Amenemhat\\" thereby showing that he was a son of a king Amenemhat. The closest predecessor of Renseneb whose nomen is known to have been Amenemhat was Seankhibre Ameny Antef Amenemhet VI, who ruled about 10 years earlier. However, the nomina of three intervening kings, Sehetepibre, Sewadjkare and Nedjemibre, are unknown and could have been Amenemhat. One of them could thus be Renseneb's father, or (older) brothers in succession. Other researchers such as Stephen Quirke do not follow him in this interpretation.Stephen Quirke: In the Name of the King: on Late Middle Kingdom Cylinders, in Czerny (editor): Timelines, Studies in Honour of Manfred Bietak, Leuven (2006), , p. 263‚Äì274. Renseneb's successor, Hor, could have been of non-royal birth since he never reported his parentage. Consequently, Ryholt proposed that Hor usurped the throne. In any case the ephemeral reigns of the rulers of the early 13th Dynasty point to the general political instability of the time.

It is expected that by comparing the genomes of humans and other apes, it will be possible to better understand what makes humans distinct from other species from a genetic perspective. It will also aid in the study of diseases that affect (or, conversely, do not affect) various primate species. Chimp-human chromosome differences. The major structural difference is that human chromosome 2 (green color code) was derived from two smaller chromosomes that are found in other great apes (now called 2A and 2B ). Parts of human chromosome 2 are scattered among parts of several cat and rat chromosomes in these species that are more distantly related to humans (more ancient common ancestors; about 85 million years since the human/rodent common ancestor Starting the chimpanzee genome project Human and chimpanzee chromosomes are very similar. The primary difference is that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than do other great apes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes and other great apes have 24 pairs of chromosomes. In the human evolutionary lineage, two ancestral ape chromosomes fused at their telomeres, producing human chromosome 2. There are nine other major chromosomal differences between chimpanzees and humans: chromosome segment inversions on human chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18. After the completion of the Human genome project, a common chimpanzee genome project was initiated. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes such as the forkhead-box P2 transcription factor, which is involved in speech development, are different in the human lineage. Several genes involved in hearing were also found to have changed during human evolution, suggesting selection involving human language-related behavior. Differences between individual humans and common chimpanzees are estimated to be about 10 times the typical difference between pairs of humans. Draft genome sequence of the common chimpanzee Analysis of the genome was published in Nature on September 1, 2005, in an article produced by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, a group of scientists which is supported in part by the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the National Institutes of Health. The article marked the completion of the draft genome sequence. A database now exists containing the genetic differences between human and chimpanzee genes, with about thirty-five million single- nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. Gene duplications account for most of the sequence differences between humans and chimps. Single-base-pair substitutions account for about half as much genetic change as does gene duplication. Typical human and chimp homologs of proteins differ in only an average of two amino acids. About 30 percent of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. As mentioned above, gene duplications are a major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material, with about 2.7 percent of the genome now representing differences having been produced by gene duplications or deletions during approximately 6 million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. The comparable variation within human populations is 0.5 percent. About 600 genes have been identified that may have been undergoing strong positive selection in the human and chimp lineages; many of these genes are involved in immune system defense against microbial disease (example: granulysin is protective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) or are targeted receptors of pathogenic microorganisms (example: Glycophorin C and Plasmodium falciparum). By comparing human and chimp genes to the genes of other mammals, it has been found that genes coding for transcription factors, such as forkhead-box P2 (FOXP2), have often evolved faster in the human relative to chimp; relatively small changes in these genes may account for the morphological differences between humans and chimps. A set of 348 transcription factor genes code for proteins with an average of about 50 percent more amino acid changes in the human lineage than in the chimp lineage. Six human chromosomal regions were found that may have been under particularly strong and coordinated selection during the past 250,000 years. These regions contain at least one marker allele that seems unique to the human lineage while the entire chromosomal region shows lower than normal genetic variation. This pattern suggests that one or a few strongly selected genes in the chromosome region may have been preventing the random accumulation of neutral changes in other nearby genes. One such region on chromosome 7 contains the FOXP2 gene (mentioned above) and this region also includes the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which is important for ion transport in tissues such as the salt-secreting epithelium of sweat glands. Human mutations in the CFTR gene might be selected for as a way to survive cholera. Another such region on chromosome 4 may contain elements regulating the expression of a nearby protocadherin gene that may be important for brain development and function. Although changes in expression of genes that are expressed in the brain tend to be less than for other organs (such as liver) on average, gene expression changes in the brain have been more dramatic in the human lineage than in the chimp lineage. This is consistent with the dramatic divergence of the unique pattern of human brain development seen in the human lineage compared to the ancestral great ape pattern. The protocadherin-beta gene cluster on chromosome 5 also shows evidence of possible positive selection. Results from the human and chimp genome analyses should help in understanding some human diseases. Humans appear to have lost a functional Caspase 12 gene, which in other primates codes for an enzyme that may protect against Alzheimer's disease. Human and Chimpanzee genomes. M stands for Mitochondrial DNA Genes of the chromosome 2 fusion site Diagramatic representation of the location of the fusion site of chromosomes 2A and 2B and the genes inserted at this location. The results of the chimpanzee genome project suggest that when ancestral chromosomes 2A and 2B fused to produce human chromosome 2, no genes were lost from the fused ends of 2A and 2B. At the site of fusion, there are approximately 150,000 base pairs of sequence not found in chimpanzee chromosomes 2A and 2B. Additional linked copies of the PGML/FOXD/CBWD genes exist elsewhere in the human genome, particularly near the p end of chromosome 9. This suggests that a copy of these genes may have been added to the end of the ancestral 2A or 2B prior to the fusion event. It remains to be determined if these inserted genes confer a selective advantage. *PGML. The phosphoglucomutase-like gene of human chromosome 2. This gene is incomplete and may not produce a functional transcript. *FOXD. The forkhead box D4-like gene is an example of an intronless gene. The function of this gene is not known, but it may code for a transcription control protein. *CBWD. Cobalamin synthetase is a bacterial enzyme that makes vitamin B12. In the distant past, a common ancestor to mice and apes incorporated a copy of a cobalamin synthetase gene (see: Horizontal gene transfer). Humans are unusual in that they have several copies of cobalamin synthetase-like genes, including the one on chromosome 2. It remains to be determined what the function of these human cobalamin synthetase-like genes is. If these genes are involved in vitamin B12 metabolism, this could be relevant to human evolution. A major change in human development is greater post-natal brain growth than is observed in other apes. Vitamin B12 is important for brain development, and vitamin B12 deficiency during brain development results in severe neurological defects in human children. *CXYorf1-like protein. Several transcripts of unknown function corresponding to this region have been isolated. This region is also present in the closely related chromosome 9p terminal region that contains copies of the PGML/FOXD/CBWD genes. *Many ribosomal protein L23a pseudogenes are scattered through the human genome.

Educated in Constantinople, Nicholas spent much of his early years in Pisidian Antioch, where it is believed he took his monastic vows. He eventually left the city around 1068 when it was threatened by Seljuk Turkish raids. Moving to Constantinople, he founded a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist. In 1084, Alexios I Komnenos selected him to replace the deposed patriarch Eustratius Garidas. By nature a conciliarist, Nicholas was immediately presented with a number of delicate and difficult issues. He took the emperor's side in the case of Leo of Chalcedon, who protested over Alexios' confiscation of church treasures to alleviate the financial strain the Byzantine-Norman Wars had caused, which was resolved when he presided over the Council of Blachernae. He was also prominent in the fight against doctrinal heresy, for instance Nicholas condemned as heretical the Bogomil leader Basil the Physician. But he was very cautious in the ongoing conflict between the provincial metropolitans and the Patriarchate. In spite of some hostile opposition from the clergy of Hagia Sophia, he ended up supporting Niketas of Ankyra against the emperor's right to elevate metropolitans, and exerted a great deal of energy trying to restrict the influence of the Chartophylax. Nicholas was also very concerned with ecclesiastical discipline. He wrote a monastic Rule for Mount Athos monastery, while ordering the removal of the Vlachs from Mount Athos. He also rigorously enforced the regulations around fasting. Meanwhile, the ongoing political situation in the Byzantine Empire especially in Anatolia after the disaster of the Battle of Manzikert forced Nicholas to seek a union with Pope Urban II, though he was firm in his views about the major contentious issues of the day, principally the Filioque, the azymes, and Papal Primacy.

They reside in rural northeastern North Carolina, near the river of the same name on the Virginia-North Carolina border. Historically the Iroquoian-speaking tribe had lived in the Piedmont of Virginia but moved south in the early 18th century under pressure of English colonists' encroachment on their territory. Assigned a reservation in the area of Hertford County, North Carolina in the early 18th century, they lost most of their land to encroachment by colonial settlers. They had maintained cultural continuity through supporting independent churches and schools. In the late 20th century, the people reorganized and established a government. In 1986 the Meherrin Nation was recognized by the state of North Carolina. The Meherrin have an enrollment of 900+ people.Brenda Linton and Leslie S. Stewart, \\"Economic Development Assessment for the Meherrin Tribe\\", University of North Carolina, Jul 2003. Accessed: October 26, 2009. History The Meherrin are among the Native American tribes that traditionally spoke an Iroquoian language and as such, are connected in the distant past to the nations of the Iroquois League in New York around the Great Lakes. Today the first language of the Meherrin is English. They are also related to the Tuscarora, who were a neighboring Iroquoian tribe in historic times in Carolina. After destructive warfare, the surviving Tuscarora migrated north to New York in the early 18th century. The nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, historically based in New York and Pennsylvania, are the best-known Iroquoian peoples and were the most powerful in the colonial era. The Meherrin inhabited the Piedmont region of Virginia above the fall line at the time of European encounter. They moved south into North Carolina in the early 18th century to evade encroachment by Anglo- American colonists. Linguistic evidence indicates that the Meherrin share common ancestry with the Tuscarora and the Nottoway, and likely spoke the same Iroquoian language or a similar dialect. Common origins are also indicated in Tuscarora oral history.Rudes, Blair A. \\"Cowinchahawkon/ Akawƒôƒç?√°:ka:?: The Meherrin in the Nineteenth Century\\", Algonquin and Iroquoian Linguistics. 6 (3) p. 32-34. London, Ontario In 1705 the Virginia Colony established a reservation for the Meherrin at Maherrin Neck (later renamed Manley‚Äôs Neck), in an area claimed by both Virginia and Carolina. It was finally assigned to Carolina, and in 1706 Carolina ordered the Meherrin out of her territory, threatening violence to expel them. The Meherrin asked for more time, a year in order to harvest their crops, and asked for help from the Virginia colonists to make their case. Virginia took their side in the quarrel, but in August 1707 Carolinian official Thomas Pollock, leading a troop of 60 men, attacked Meherrin Town, destroying crops, homes, and all belongings; his forces seized 36 men, depriving them of water for two days. In September the Virginia militia met with the chiefs, promising Virginia‚Äôs protection to prevent them from retaliating against Carolina. Col. Edmond Jennings, Virginia Council President, wrote a harsh reprimand to leaders of Carolinia. By 1707 the Meherrin had resettled on lands previously occupied by the Chowanoke near the mouth of the Meherrin River.Meherrin Nation official website. Accessed: October 26, 2009. In 1711‚Äì1712 the Meherrin were allies of the Tuscarora against the English colonists and allies during the Tuscarora War. In 1713 they had to deliver two of their paramount chief‚Äôs sons as hostages to be kept by the English at William and Mary‚Äôs College in Bufferton to ensure that they would keep the peace. In 1720 they made a treaty of peace with the Susquehanna, another Iroquoian tribe. In 1717 the Meherrin were given a reservation along the western shore of lower Chowanoc River, not far from its mouth in Albermarle Sound, near modern Colerain (Bertie County, N.C.). At the time, Governor Charles Eden thought that the reservation only contained 10,000 acres, but Surveyor Col. Edward Moseley later discovered that the reservation contained more than 40,000 acres. In 1723, the Virginia Colony confirmed the Meherrin right to the reservation land and severely criticized North Carolina for an illegal taking of Meherrin land. Most of the Tuscarora were driven off after many were killed and taken captive in the above war. The North Carolina authorities reviewed petitions by the Meherrin and by English squatters on their land. Although by 1726 the Meherrin reservation had been greatly reduced in size and relocated to the old and abandoned Chowanoke fields, the North Carolina Colony confirmed in a treaty that it belonged to the Meherrin. The Meherrin lived in cohesive, distinct communities through the 19th and 20th centuries, maintaining their own schools and churches as part of their identity as a people. In 1975, Meherrin descendants reorganized the tribe and reclaimed its identity under Chief Wayne Brown. It became chartered in 1977 after increasing activism by members. They were recognized by the state in 1986. Many Meherrin can trace their ancestry to Sally M. Lewis (1838‚Äì1904), who sold several tracts of reservation land. The Meherrin tribal seat is Winton, North Carolina. The Nation's residents principally reside in and around the \\"Little California/Pleasant Plains/Union\\" area of Hertford County, North Carolina. They work in a wide variety of professional fields, as a high proportion of the tribe have college degrees compared to the general population in the county.

BiographyEarly life and career= The self-taught Keller broke into comics in 1941, a year after graduating from West Reading High School, creating a single- appearance feature called \\"The Whistler\\" (no relation to the radio-show character) in Dell Comics' War Stories #5 (1942; no cover date). This led to work the following year with Quality Comics, where he worked in lesser or greater capacities on such comic-book series as Blackhawk and such features as \\"Man Hunter\\" and \\"Spin Shaw\\". As well, Keller drew backgrounds for Will Eisner's eight-page newspaper Sunday-supplement comic The Spirit, working with serviceman Eisner's World War II fill-in artist, Lou Fine. Keller additionally drew for the publisher Fiction House, including the feature \\"Suicide Smith\\" in the aviation-themed Wings Comics.Jack Keller at the Grand Comics Database Original artwork for a Jack Keller splash page: Kid Colt, Outlaw #92 (Sept. 1960) In 1950, Keller became a staff artist at Atlas, publisher Martin Goodman's 1950s predecessor to Marvel Comics. The dependable, unflashy Keller drew Western, horror and, working with writer Carl Wessler, crime stories. =Kid Colt and hot rods= Keller began his long association with Kid Colt in Kid Colt, Outlaw #25 (March 1953). He stayed with the character for at least a dozen years in that signature title, as well as in such anthology series as All Western Winners, Two-Gun Western and Gunsmoke Western. In 1955, Keller also began freelancing for the low-budget Charlton Comics, based in Derby, Connecticut, drawing Western and war stories for titles including Billy the Kid, Cheyenne Kid, Battlefield Action, Fightin' Air Force, Fightin' Army, Fightin' Marines and Submarine Attack. Following the near-demise of Atlas' comic-book line in 1957, and the accompanying cutbacks and firings, Keller supplemented his income by working in a car dealership in his home town. Within two years, he would be back freelancing for Atlas / Marvel. By this time, Keller was also indulging his love of race cars and model cars by writing and drawing such Charlton comics as Grand Prix, Hot Rod Racers, Hot Rods and Racing Cars, Teenage Hotrodders, Drag 'n' Wheels, Surf 'n' Wheels and World of Wheels. He stopped drawing for Marvel Comics by 1967, when Kid Colt, Outlaw had become mostly reprints, then drew a small number of stories for DC Comics from 1968 to 1971, including for the licensed toy-car comic Hot Wheels. He also continued to draw for Charlton, where his last known comics work was the cover and the accompanying eight-page story \\"The Rescuers\\" in the combat title Attack #14 (Nov. 1973). Comics writer and historian Tony Isabella wrote that Keller =Later career and death= Keller returned to selling cars at Marshall Chevrolet in Reading, Pennsylvania and later was a part-time salesperson for Fun Stuff Hobbies and for Kiddie Kar Kollectibles.

Fox was born in Cumberland. He moved to the Isle of Wight in 1862 to take up the post of curate at the Parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Brixton (now known as Brighstone). He resigned his post in 1867 but continued to live in the area to carry on his collecting. In 1875, he became curate of nearby Kingston, near Shorwell.p15 The Complete Dinosaur by James Orville Farlow, M. K. Brett- SurmanBlows W.

Archives of Natural History, 11: 299-313 Although lacking formal scientific training Fox was remarkably astute and discussed his findings with eminent palaeontologists of the day including John Hulke (1830-1895) and Sir Richard Owen. Fox had easy access to Brighstone Bay from his home, Myrtle Cottage in Brighstone, and so spent many an hour collecting fossils, much to the detriment of his pastoral work; in fact, it was said of him at the time, by the wife of the vicar, that it was \\"always bones first and the parish next\\". He is also quoted as having written in a letter to Owen \\"I cannot leave this place while I have any money left to live on, I take such deep [sic] in hunting for old dragons\\". In 1882 Fox's collection of more than 500 specimens was acquired by the Natural History Museum after his death. Fox is credited with the finding of several species, most described by his friend Owen, and named by him after their finder. These include Polacanthus foxii, Hypsilophodon foxii, Eucamerotus foxi, Iguanodon foxii, Calamosaurus foxii (formerly Calamospondylus) and Aristosuchus.

Such unions may take on many forms, including a united church and a federation.  United churches  A united church is the result of a merger of churches of various denominations. One of the first of these occurred in 1817, when Lutheran and Reformed churches in Prussia merged into the Prussian Union. The nineteenth century saw a number of unions between churches of the same tradition. For example, the United Secession Church in Scotland was formed in 1820 by a union of various churches which had seceded from the established Church of Scotland. All these were Presbyterian in both doctrine and practice. In the twentieth century many churches merged as a result of the Ecumenical movement. One of the earliest such unions was in 1925, and formed the United Church of Canada. Other examples include like- minded bodies with a common theological history such as the United Methodist Church ‚Äì a merger of the Evangelical United Brethren Church and the Methodist Church in the United States.  Federation  A federation is a less centralized union. One example includes the Presbyterian Churches of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, which joined together to form the Presbyterian Church of Australia on July 24, 1901. The structure was similar to the Federation which formed the Commonwealth of Australia on January 1 of that same year. In his inaugural moderatorial address, John Meiklejohn made it clear that the ecclesiastical union consciously reflected the political union of the Australian colonies: \\"We have, by forming this Assembly, formed a Court whose jurisdiction is, as regards territory, equal to, and coterminous with that of the Federal Parliament, and like it, is representative in its character.\\" This union linked churches of the same denomination in different locations into one body without forming a monolithic national church. The individual state churches also kept their individual identities, rights, and privileges.  The Uniates and the Edinoverie  The term \\"union\\" (e.g., the Union of Brest of 1596) is also used for the arrangement when a group of Orthodox Christians enters communion with the Catholic Church's Pope of Rome, while wishing to maintain their Eastern rites. Such groups are known generically as Eastern Catholic Churches. Their adherents are occasionally referred to as uniates. In a somewhat parallel way, but on a much smaller scale, Russian Orthodox Church has integrated certain Old Believer communities, allowing them to keep their rites while recognizing the authority of the national church. This arrangement is known as Edinoverie.

The school unit was run by the city of Espoo. Prior to the opening of the school unit, the Montessori method had only been used in preschools. The school was first founded as a separate Montessori subdivision of the primary school in Lintuvaara, Espoo. In the middle 1980s it moved to its own building in Perkkaa, Espoo. The school building was a mint green wooden one- storey building divided into a large central \\"living room\\", two main classrooms and a teachers' area. The school housed all six classes of the Finnish primary school (ala-aste) system. Because of the low number of students -- only about 30 in the entire school -- the classrooms were divided among the classes so that classes 1--3 had one room and classes 4--6 had another. The students also had free access to the teachers' area during breaks. The central \\"living room\\" housed the school library and the school's pets: a couple of guinea pigs and some budgerigars. The school building had to be torn down because of the mildew infested in the wooden walls in the late 1990s. A new standard (non-Montessori) school was built in its place and the Montessori classes moved to the Ruusutorppa primary school (Ruusutorpan ala- aste).

Originally a monk and a doctor, Basil became a teacher within the Bogomil sect around 1070.Kazhdan, pg. 268 He first came to the attention of the emperor after imperial officers had tortured a member of the Bogomil sect, named Diblatius, to reveal the identity of their leader. He admitted that Basil was their leader and that he had selected twelve teachers to act as his apostles. This sect, noted for their Manichaean tendencies, iconoclastic principles and their detestation of the Orthodox hierarchy, had been rapidly gaining adherents throughout Alexius‚Äô reign, and began to cause alarm among the Byzantine clergy. Eager to confront this threat, he was ordered to appear before the emperor.Kazhdan, pg. 268; Finlay pg. 83 Although promised a private hearing with Alexius, Basil was deceived by the emperor into giving a full confession which was recorded by an imperial clerk.Kazhdan, pg. 268; Finlay pg. 84 On the basis of this confession, and with Basil refusing to renounce his opinions, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nicholas the Grammarian, together with a synod of bishops declared Basil a heretic. Alexius then pronounced a sentence of death on Basil, by being burnt at the stake.Kazhdan, pg. 268 Prior to the sentence being carried out, Alexius attempted on several occasions to have Basil recant, but each time Basil refused to change his mind, stating that angels would descend from heaven to release him from the stake.Komnena, 15.10 Finally, Basil was burned as a heretic in the hippodrome of Constantinople.Kazhdan, pg. 268 The date of Basil‚Äôs execution has been a matter of some speculation due to the muddled narrative of that section of the only primary document that detail‚Äôs Basil‚Äôs trial and death, the Alexiad. Alexander Kazhdan has dated the execution to around the year 1111.Kazhdan, pg. 268 According to the 19th century historian George Finlay, however, although the sentence was passed in 1110, the execution was delayed for eight years, and performed at the end of Alexius‚Äôs reign.Finlay, pgs. 84-85 Finlay used the following passage from Anna Komnena‚Äôs, The Alexiad to support his argument: > Later, the godless ones were transferred to another very strong prison into > which they were cast and after pining away for a long time died in their > impiety.

Modern Hellenic languages In addition, some linguists use the term \\"Hellenic\\" to refer to modern Greek in a narrow sense together with certain other, divergent modern varieties deemed separate languages on the basis of a lack of mutual intelligibility. Separate language status is most often posited for Tsakonian, which is thought to be uniquely a descendant of Doric rather than Attic Greek, followed by Pontic and Cappadocian Greek of Anatolia.Ethnologue: Family tree for Greek.

In contrast, Yevanic (Jewish Greek) is mutually intelligible with standard Greek but is sometimes considered a separate language for ethnic and cultural reasons.

Born in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, Lunn was raised as a devout Methodist and gained a place at Horncastle Grammar School. He attended Headingley College, Leeds, for instruction to become a church minister and was ordained in 1886. He also trained as a medical doctor at Trinity College, Dublin. His marriage to Mary Ethel Moore, the daughter of a canon, produced four children: alpine skiing pioneer Arnold Lunn, writers Hugh Kingsmill Lunn and Brian Lunn, and a daughter who predeceased him. After one year of missionary service in India, he was forced to return in 1888 to Lincolnshire after contracting an illness. His criticism of the conditions for Methodist missionaries in India led him to conflict with his fellow ministers, and he sought to explore wider horizons. He concentrated on his religious belief of Christian unity and cooperation, which was a forerunner of the Ecumenical Movement. As such, he was the founder of the Co-operative Educational Tours in 1893 and organized meetings of predominantly English church leaders at the annual Grindelwald Reunion Conferences, between 1892 and 1896. In 1902, he organised his first inclusive tours at Adelboden and Wengen, Switzerland, which started the trend for British visitors to combine a religious/health retreat with winter sports. Many Anglican churches were established at fashionable winter resorts. In 1905 he formed the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club which secured the use of major hotels and the sanatorium at Le Beauregard. With Lord Bryce, he founded the Hellenic Travellers Club in 1906 and this success led his second company, Alpine Sports Limited, founded two years later, to open up many winter sports resorts by organising tours. In 1908 he convened a meeting at the Devonshire Club to found the Alpine Ski Club, a gentleman‚Äôs club for ski-mountaineers. He was a vocal opponent of the Boer War but remained in the confidences of leading politicians. He became a Knight Bachelor in 1910 and was active in Liberal politics, forming a strong friendship with Asquith. He stood twice for Parliament in 1910 for Boston and 1923 for Brighton, but was unsuccessful. In 1924 he was the first Editor of \\"The Review of The English Churches\\". The first edition was published in January of that year and included an article on Birth Control and Prohibition in The United States. He helped form the Irish Protestant Home Rule Association. Although he continued to travel and promote his vision of the union of churches with the League of Nations, his company (renamed as Sir Henry Lunn Travel) grew to become one of the largest travel agents in Britain. During the 1960s the company was merged with the Polytechnic Touring Association to form Lunn Poly. He wrote two autobiographical works: Chapters from My Life (1918) and Nearing Harbour (1934). He died at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in St John's Wood.

Similarly, political graft occurs when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to private interests. Description Political graft functions when the public officer is directed to purchase goods or services from a specific private interest at a cost far above regular market rates. The private interest then siphons some of the gratuitous profits to government officials that are able to ensure that future government spending continues in the same fashion so that this lucrative relationship continues. A member of a government may misappropriate directly from government funds, but they may also make decisions benefiting their own private economic interests by using inside knowledge of upcoming government decisions to their benefit, in a manner similar to insider trading. Although the conflict between public and private interests is common to all forms of corruption, the term \\"graft\\" is specific to the intentional misdirection of official funds. Although not the original usage of the term, graft in the modern context is commonly, but mistakenly, used as a blanket term for political embezzlement, influence peddling, or other forms of corruption. While embezzlement and influence peddling are elements sometimes present in graft, the relationship is not deterministic. In popular culture Graft is exemplified in the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington: A local political boss has insider knowledge of a government dam building project that will necessitate the purchase of certain tracts of land. In order to make a hefty profit, he purchases the land in advance so that he may charge the government exorbitant prices to buy the land it needs to complete the dam.

He was burned at the stake in 1300. Sources In the 1280s, Salimbene di Adam wrote an account of Segarelli and the Brethren. While contemporary and detailed, scholars note the Franciscan's bias against the upstart group attempting to imitate the Franciscan idea of poverty.Pierce, Jerry B., Poverty, Heresy, and the Apocalypse: The Order of Apostles and Social Change in Medieval Italy 1260-1307, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012, p. 77 Biography Gerard was born at Segalara near Parma. As a youth he applied for admission to a Franciscan monastery in Parma but was apparently refused because, according to Salimbene, he was ignorant, foolish, illiterate, and low-born. Nevertheless, he remained around the monastery for some time, often visiting the convent and the church to sit or kneel before the altar. Influenced perhaps by a representation over the altar of the twelve Apostles, Segarelli allowed his beard and hair to grow, and wore a coarse grey robe with a white mantle in imitation of the apostles. In 1260, in accord with Matthew 19: 21 (\\"If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to [the] poor...‚Äù), Gerard sold his possessions and went to the market of Parma and distributed his earnings. Segarelli wandered about the streets calling the people to repentance (penitentiam agite). He continued this activity for three years until one \\"Robert\\"‚Äîwho had been a servant of the Franciscans‚Äîjoined him; before the end of that year about thirty more individuals had joined them. Segarelli started preaching in other cities and the number of his followers grew, drawn from among the poor. After some initial hesitation he agreed to be elected their leader. The group walked about the streets chanting hymns, preached to those who would listen and ate what the people gave to them, sharing it with the poor. The movement eventually spread not only throughout Lombardy but also Germany, France, Spain, and England. Some Apostles were traduced at a council in W√ºrzburg and a decree was issued which forbade them to preach and beg and the people were warned against encouraging them by giving food or water. Other Apostles were proscribed in England at a council at Chichester in 1289; it is not certain if these sects were directly connected to that of Segarelli, there are however many analogies between them. At a later point in 1300 followers of the Apostles were found in Spain where one Richard of Alexandria was successful in his preaching, particularly in Galicia. In 1320, Peter of Lugo ‚Äî an Apostle follower of Richard ‚Äî was brought before the Inquisition in Toulouse. It was in Lombardy where the disciples of Segarelli had great success and started to attract enemies. The bishop of Parma was informed in 1280 that Segarelli was directing invectives against the Church so he had him apprehended immediately. After examination the authorities concluded that he was a poor, demented visionary and released him. In 1286 however, probably pressed by the Inquisition, the Bishop banned him from the city. It appears that he broke the ban in 1294, returning clandestinely to his hometown. He was again brought before the Bishop, abjured and condemned to perpetual imprisonment while four of his followers were burnt alive. It is not clear why, but in 1300 he was interrogated again by the Grand Inquisitor of Parma: found guilty of relapsing into errors formerly abjured, he was thus burnt at the stake.

She was also a regular presenter of Sport on Friday, and of the children's programme Newsround during the 1980s. Born in London, Rollason studied to become a PE teacher before entering radio broadcasting in 1980. After directing sport related content for Channel 4, where she helped to bring American football to British television, she anchored coverage of the 1987 World Student Games and 1988 Summer Olympics. Her work on Grandstand proved popular with viewers, and led to a number of other sports presenting roles for Rollason throughout the 1990s. As well as covering mainstream events such as the 1996 Summer Olympics, she became a champion of disability sports, helping to raise its profile and change its public and media perception. She presented sports bulletins for BBC Breakfast News and BBC News, and in 1996 was named as Sports Presenter of the Year. Rollason was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1997, and fought a two-year battle with the disease. A 1998 documentary, Hope for Helen, followed her treatment, and won her much public support for her courage. She continued to work throughout her illness, and shortly before her death was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours. Later that year, the BBC established an award in her memory which is presented at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. A cancer charity was also founded in her name. Rollason's television career also helped to open up the way for other women to enter the world of sports broadcasting, with presenters such as Sue Barker and Gabby Logan following in her footsteps.

Her father was an engineer who later became a lecturer at Bath College, and her mother a biology teacher. She attended the Bath High School for Girls, and after developing an early interest in sport, was a member of Bath Athletics Club, as well as playing hockey for Somerset. Although she was keen to follow a career in broadcasting, careers advisors at school steered her towards teaching instead. After leaving school she studied at the University of Brighton's Chelsea College of Physical Education in Eastbourne, where she became Vice-President of the Students Union. During her second year at the college she spent a term as an exchange student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She graduated in 1977. After completing her studies she became a PE teacher, and spent three years teaching the subject to secondary school students. She worked initially at Henry Beaufort School in Winchester, Hampshire, before moving to Essex, where she was a supply teacher. It was while she was teaching PE that she met her future husband, a fellow teacher named John Rollason. The couple were married in 1980. Their daughter, Nikki, was born in 1983. The couple divorced in 1991. Broadcasting career Rollason continued to aspire to a career in broadcasting, and while still teaching did screen tests for BBC Wales and BBC South, but she was unsuccessful in both auditions. In 1980, she took a holiday job as a volunteer presenter at Basildon Community Radio after seeing an advertisement in Basildon town centre and offering her services to them. A year later she joined the team of Essex Radio as a sports reporter when the commercial station went on air. She was subsequently appointed as the station's deputy sports editor. Three years later she became a producer- director for Cheerleader Productions, making sports content for Channel 4. Among the events for which she helped to provide coverage were the final of the 1984 Davis Cup, held in Sweden, and Super Bowl XIX, which took place in 1985. Additionally, she worked on the US Masters and US Open. After just over a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to concentrate on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogot√°, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen. In 1990, Rollason joined BBC Sport and became the first female presenter of Grandstand, where her down-to-earth presenting style quickly made her popular with viewers, and earned her a regular presenting role on BBC Two's Sport on Friday, as well as a raft of other sporting programmes. Among her credits with the BBC are coverage of the Wimbledon Championships, the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona and 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, together with the 1994 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Victoria, British Columbia. She was an advocate of disability sports, and helped to alter its public and media perception with her coverage of the 1996 Summer Paralympics. Britain's Olympic team had been fairly unsuccessful at that year's Olympics, prompting Rollason to urge viewers and the media to support what she called the \\"real\\" Olympics. Jane Swan, General Secretary of the British Paralympic Association later described how Rollason's support for the event had helped to change its image. \\"Until then, the Paralympics had been treated as documentary material, focusing mainly on disability. Helen made people realise that it was sport.\\" Other disability sporting events she covered include the 1990 World Disabled Championships, 1991 Blind Golfers' Championships, and the 1992 Summer Paralympics. She also fronted sports bulletins for BBC Breakfast News. In 1996, she was named as the Television and Radio Industries Sports Presenter of the Year. Later career, illness and death Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 during an eight-week assignment to the US, where she was covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She was diagnosed with cancer of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. \\"I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house ‚Äì even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed.\\" She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, \\"I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this\\". In April 1999, the BBC announced plans to overhaul its Six O'Clock News bulletin, and that an in- depth sports preview fronted by Rollason would be included in the programme's Friday edition. She began presenting the slot in May, and made her last onscreen appearance on 18 June. Rollason was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours for her services to broadcasting and charities, and in July 1999 attended a ceremony at Buckingham Palace to be presented with the honour by the Queen. Speaking about the occasion, Rollason said, \\"I cried when I received the news. I don't feel I deserve it but I'm very thrilled that so many women are coming through in sport broadcasting now.\\" Also in July, she received an honorary degree from the University of Brighton, which was presented to her at her home after she became too ill to attend the ceremony. Shortly before that she was honoured with an award for courage at the 1999 Pride of Britain Awards. Rollason became involved in charity work, raising ¬£5 million for a cancer wing at North Middlesex Hospital, which was named in her honour. She died on 9 August 1999 at the age of 43, in Brentwood, Essex. On 17 August, a service of thanksgiving was held for Rollason at a church near her home, and attended by friends and colleagues. Later that month, the BBC aired Helen Rollason: The Bravest Fight, a 30-minute documentary presented by Peter Sissons in which friends and colleagues paid tribute to her. Her autobiography, Life's Too Short, was published posthumously in 2000. Legacy As the first female presenter of Grandstand, Helen Rollason was a pioneer of British sports broadcasting, an industry that was predominantly male at the time, and she established a precedent that allowed others to follow. Sue Barker, Hazel Irvine, Gail McKenna, Shelley Webb and Gabby Logan all followed in Rollason's footsteps to become noted UK sports presenters, with Logan joining ITV as their first female sports presenter in the late 1990s, where she co-hosted the football show On the Ball and was a contributor to The Premiership. Logan paid tribute to Rollason shortly after her death, saying she would be \\"an icon for young girls who want to go into that field because she showed what could be done. She was a great example to everyone.\\" On 4 November 1999, the BBC announced the establishment of a Helen Rollason Award, to be given at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony in recognition of \\"outstanding achievement in the face of adversity\\". Its first recipient was retired National Hunt trainer Jenny Pitman, who was herself diagnosed with cancer, and was presented with the award at that year's ceremony on 12 December. Other Helen Rollason Award recipients include yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur in 2001 for her courage in becoming the fastest woman to circumnavigate the globe, footballer Geoff Thomas in 2005 for raising in excess of ¬£150,000 for the Leukaemia Research charity by cycling, following his own battle with the disease, and in 2014, the competitors of the inaugural Invictus Games, a multi-sport event for sick and injured service personnel, which made its debut that year. The 2016 award was presented to Ben Smith, who completed 401 marathons in 401 days in support of the anti bullying charities. The Sunday Times created the Helen Rollason Award for Inspiration as part of their Sportswomen of the Year Awards. Jenny Pitman was its first recipient in 1999. Others to receive the award include student Joanna Gardiner in 2007 for her work with Football for Peace, a charity that provides football coaching to children from Jewish and Palestinian communities in Israel, Claire Lomas in 2012 who, having been paralysed following a riding accident completed that year's London Marathon with the aid of a robotic suit, and Mel Woodards in 2014, chair of the Somerset-based Milton Nomads junior football club who established a local football league for children. The Helen Rollason Cancer Charity was established in her name in 1999. The charity funds and operates three cancer support centres ‚Äì in Essex, Hertfordshire and London. Lord Coe, who had known Rollason since her days in radio broadcasting, is the charity's patron. The first Helen Rollason Cancer Care Centre was opened in Chelmsford, Essex in April 2002. in 2011, a new research centre named after Rollason and offering treatment for patients as part of clinical trials of new cancer therapies was opened at Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital. In April 2006, Brentwood Borough Council announced that a new housing development would include a road named Rollason Way in her memory. Additionally, eleven apartment blocks within the development would be named after people associated with Rollason or winners of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The building names on Rollason Way include Adlington House, Boardman Place, Radcliffe House, Christie Court, Redgrave Court, Botham House, Faldo Court, Whitbread Place, Torvill Court, and MacArthur Place.

As of 2016 the Animax Mobile service is discontinued worldwide. = Game arenas = Sony Pictures Television International signed a deal with developer Arkadium on January 7, 2009, to provide game arenas for Sony Pictures Television International websites, including Animax, with more than forty games licensed.  Programming  Animax's programming is dedicated to anime, and it has been acknowledged as the largest 24-hour anime-only network in the world. In its original network in Japan, it has exclusively premiered several anime, which have aired first on Animax, including Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Hungry Heart: Wild Striker, Aishiteruze Baby, Wangan Midnight and the 2010 anime adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man by Madhouse Studios. In addition, its English language network, Animax Asia, aired the first ever anime simulcast with their simulcast of Tears to Tiara on the same time as the Japanese premiere and the new Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood series, on the same week as the Japanese premiere. Its viewer reach has been quoted as spanning over 89 million homes. across 62 countries and 17 languages. Other series it has broadcast both in Japan, often being nationwide premieres, as well as its networks worldwide, include Blood+, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, the entire Mobile Suit Gundam series, Honey and Clover, InuYasha, Fullmetal Alchemist, Eureka Seven, Urusei Yatsura, Ranma ¬Ω, Rurouni Kenshin, the Dragon Ball series, Cardcaptor Sakura, Tsubasa Chronicle, Chobits, The Vision of Escaflowne, Death Note, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ouran High School Host Club, Wolf's Rain, Future Boy Conan, Haikara-san ga T≈çru, Emma - A Victorian Romance, Darker than Black, Wangan Midnight, and Kyo Kara Maoh! as well as several OVA series and anime films, such as Steamboy, Metropolis, Memories, Tokyo Godfathers, Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, Nasu: Summer in Andalusia, Blood: The Last Vampire, Appleseed, Escaflowne, Spooky Kitaro, Pumpkin Scissors, and Fate/Stay Night. = Translation and dubbing teams = Animax have utilized numerous translation and dubbing studios for the broadcast of numerous of its anime series across its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia, some of which were not licensed by North American distributors and do not have any English adaptation counterparts, such as Detective School Q, Dokkiri Doctor, Twin Spica, Absolute Boy, Emma: A Victorian Romance, Future Boy Conan, numerous installments of the World Masterpiece Theater series, InuYasha: The Final Act, and numerous others. Animax have also produced and aired uncensored English versions and dubs of anime series, among the most notable of them being their dub of Cardcaptor Sakura, which was shown uncensored and retained all of the original names, plot details and dialogue, and numerous others. For broadcast across its English-language networks, Animax has also broadcast English dubs produced by other enterprises, such as Bandai Visual, Ocean Productions, Animaze, Funimation, Bang Zoom!

Types of technology do not differ between nonprofit and for profit organizations. Nonprofit technology is differentiated by specific strategies and purposes. Numerous nonprofit organizations approach technology with an emphasis on cost effectiveness due to limited budgets. Information technology in particular offers low-cost solutions for non profits to address administrative, service and marketing needs. Technology deployment grants nonprofits the opportunity to better allocate staff resources away from administrative tasks to focus on direct services provided by the organization. Definitional Issues Due to the topic's inherent breadth of reach and the constantly changing nature of technology in general, the sphere of nonprofit technology is somewhat difficult to define. Despite this, in order to provide a stable foundation upon which the remainder of this discussion can stand, it is necessary to engage in laying a groundwork of both baseline and integrated definitional constructs. Nonprofit technology can be generally defined as any technological tool that assists a nonprofit organization by helping it to work with greater social impact in forwarding the overall organizational mission. Technology is essential to effectively advancing and managing a nonprofit, playing an important role in the advertisement of goods and services offered, the communication of mission, and the recruitment of volunteers among other things. From thoughtful utilization to enhance both internal and external organizational communication efforts, to increased ability to measure, evaluate, and more successfully track and engage specific initiatives, the use of technology within the nonprofit sector is wide-ranging. Technology use associated with nonprofits is not dedicated in nature, that is, technologies and specific uses of such technology by nonprofits cannot be linked solely to the nonprofit sector. Because of this, constructing a definition of nonprofit technology is based in large part on use. Uses Nonprofit organizations use computers, Internet and other networking technology for a number of tasks, including volunteer management and support, donor management, client tracking and support, project management, human resources (paid staff) management, financial accounting, program evaluation, research, marketing, activism and collaboration. Nonprofit organizations that engage in income-generation activities, such as ticket sales, may also use technology for these functions. Some technology programs are created specifically for use by nonprofit organizations. For instance, there are more than 30 software packages designed for nonprofits to use to analyse donations, manage volunteers. There is software designed to help in the management of animal shelters, software to help nonprofit manage pets, animal rescue, county code management software to help nonprofit performing arts groups sell tickets and manage donors, software to manage sports clubs, and on and on. Nonprofit organizations also use both proprietary and open-source software, as well as various online tools (the World Wide Web, email, online social networking, wikis,volunteer web blogs micro-blogging, etc.), that are also used by for-profit businesses. Nonprofit groups may leverage web-based services in their media outreach, using online newswires such as Nonprofit Newswire.com to disseminate their press releases.\\"Make Me Media Savvy: The Art of Working With the Press Because of their limited budgets, nonprofit organizations may not be able to upgrade their hardware or software, buy computers or Internet tools, or provide technology training for staff to the degree of for-profit businesses. This means that, often, nonprofit organizations can be on the wrong side of the digital divide. Benefits of technology Implemented correctly, technology stands to benefit nonprofits in a variety of ways. One obvious benefit is the dissemination of information. Technological tools (e.g., computers and cellular telephones) and platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) allow for the aggregation and wide-scale distribution of knowledge and information. To the extent that tools and platforms can be integrated, nonprofits may better serve themselves and their clients. Krause and Quick discussed a melding of this sort in the area of \\"maternal health interventions\\". By combining Facebook's social networking platform with SMS text messaging, the Women's Refugee Commission (WRC) was able to launch a new initiative, which it dubbed \\"Mama.\\" Mama's mission is to bring clinical practitioners together in a virtual forum (i.e., their Facebook page) for purposes of information sharing and support. Given the remote locales of many maternal health workers, regular access to the Internet can prove difficult, if not impossible. But with the help of SMS messaging, this problem becomes entirely manageable. The Mama platform readily accepts text messages sent from anywhere in the world. These messages then appear, automatically, on the Mama Facebook page, allowing practitioners with more reliable access to the Internet a chance to appraise the situation and respond. Once the Mama community arrives at a consensus, a text message is dispatched back to the original practitioner. Although this process is a bit deliberative, it is nonetheless instrumental in achieving beneficial outcomes for both the organization and the population it aims to serve. Without an SMS- Facebook linkage, maternal health workers embedded deep within the field would effectively be cut off from both colleagues and information. Technology, it would seem, is aptly suited for bridging this spatial divide. Cost reductions and efficiency improvements may also encourage nonprofits to adopt new digital and information technologies. According to Luksetich et al., administrative expenses are particularly bothersome for nonprofits and their stakeholders. To the extent, then, that technology can be viewed as a long-term administrative cost-saver, it becomes increasingly likely that nonprofits will become adopters of information technology. Hamann and Bezboruah advanced this premise in a recent study, noting that nonprofits may have greater incentive to deploy technology for the accomplishment of administrative tasks as opposed to provision-of-care tasks. A final and largely unquantifiable benefit of nonprofit technology is the degree to which these tools can and do save lives. Mama, in particular, has developed a \\"Lives Saved Counter\\" to allow members to document each time they save a \\"woman's, girl's, or newborn's life\\". The Counter is significant because it acknowledges both individual achievement and evidence-based best practices. Moreover, it stands as a constant reminder and celebration of life, contrasting markedly with the conventional practices in this field, which tend to document only the deaths of mothers. Social media The use of social media by nonprofits should follow a stewardship model that includes acts of reciprocity, responsibility, and accountability in an effort to nurture nonprofit relationships and place supporters at the forefront. Referencing organizational partners and supporters is one way in which these ideals can be expressed through social media use. Furthermore, listing the nonprofits specific use of donations and volunteers as well as posting the names of board members and mission statement can cover the responsibility and accountability components. And although most social media sites provide free services, for social media to be most effective, organizations must provide on-going interactional experiences for users, which requires additional man-hours. It is estimated that for a mid-size nonprofit with revenue between $1 and $5 million annually, having a social media presence will cost, on average, $11 thousand annually to attain an adequate level of interaction. Examples of such interactional components for a nonprofit website might include: downloadable video, RSS feeds, chat rooms, polls or surveys, linked publications and always, contact information. In a poll conducted with mid-sized nonprofit organizations, 51 percent reported that between one and five hours were spent weekly attending to social media. Additionally, as the nonprofits social media presence grew, more hours were required to sustain the same level of interaction. Yet, these same nonprofit respondents, that had been using social media for at least 12 months, reported less than stellar results for attracting new donors or volunteers, which had been one of the main motivations for establishing a social media presence. Therefore, if a nonprofit organization is insistent on an established social media presence, it is advised to continue direct channels of communication such as direct mailings which still outperforms email and social media marketing. Practitioners/sources of training and support Whereas a for- profit business may have the budget to hire a full-time staff member or part- time consultant to help with computer and Internet technology use, nonprofit organizations usually have fewer financial resources and, therefore, may not be able to hire a full-time staff person to manage and support technology use. While there are nonprofits that can afford to pay staff devoted to managing and supporting the nonprofits technology needs, many of those who support nonprofits in their technology use are staff members who have different primary roles (called accidental techies) and volunteers. Those providing support to nonprofit organizations regarding their use of computers, the Internet and networking technologies are sometimes known as eRiders or circuit riders, or more broadly as NTAPs (nonprofit technology assistance providers). A membership association for people volunteering or working for pay to support nonprofit technology is NTEN: The Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network. Sources of hardware and software A variety of organizations support NPOs' acquisition of technology, either hardware or software. Certain NPOs (for example Free Geek or Nonprofit Technology Resources) support local NPOs with discounted refurbished personal computers. In the United States and Canada, a web-based membership association that provides non-profit organizations with discounts on products and services, including technology providers, is the Non-Profit Purchasing Group. For developing areas or nations, technology may be available from organizations mentioned in Computer technology for developing areas. Best practices/guiding principles for effective adoption A number of contributing factors have effected non-profits' ability to adopt information technology in recent history. Cutbacks in public sector services, decreases in government spending, increased scrutiny on the public sector, increased competition and increased financial transparency are all issues facing non-profit organizations today.Adams , Carolyn T. , and Felice D. Perlmutter, 1995. Leadership in Hard Times: Are Nonprofits Well Served? Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly 24 ( 3 ): 253 ‚Äì 62 Due to these issues, it has become increasingly important for non-profits to be aware of best practices and potential pitfalls when adopting effective IT practices in the public sector. Planning has become one of the most important practices for the successful strategic utilization of information technology.Buhalis , Dimitrios . 1998 . Strategic Use of Information Technologies in the Tourism Industry. Tourism Management 19 ( 5 ): 409 ‚Äì 21 A 2003 study found that 79 percent of organizations in 2003 (up from 55 percent in 2000) had some sort of \\"strategic plan\\" specifically for the use of the Internet, tending to be \\"medium-sized charities with medium income and larger Web budgets, as well as those that set their sites up earlier and update them more frequently.\\"Spigelman , Ariel , and Elisha Evans . 2004 . Virtual Promise ‚Äî From Rhetoric to Reality: A Report on Charities' Use of the Internet between 2000 ‚Äì 2004 London: nfpSynergy www.nfpsynergy.net Among the most important practices in IT planning are budgeting, training and staffing. A 2007 study from the Public Administration Review shows that the majority of nonprofits budget for purchasing and upgrading hardware (57 percent) and software (58 percent), as well as computer maintenance (63 percent), but only 36 percent budget for computer-related training. However, these planning methods receive only 9 percent of the budget after personnel costs are removed, which is of particular importance because 56 percent of nonprofits report that less than 2 percent is available for these essential IT activities. The amount set aside for training varies considerablydepending on overall budgets, making training a luxury for lower-budget organizations.Hackler, Darrene; Saxton, Gregory D. Public Administration Review. May2007, Vol. 67 Issue 3, p474-487. 14p.

Prominent casesMartin Luther King cases= Pepper has stated Martin Luther King Jr. contacted Pepper after seeing his photo essay, The Children of Vietnam, which was published in the January 1967 issue of Ramparts magazine. It depicted victims of napalm in Vietnam.http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2003/02/4025.shtml Pepper, who supported the communist cause later wrote \\"it was not then clear to Dr. King that Ho-Chi Minh‚Äôs reverence for Jefferson, Lincoln, and American democracy, as he idealized it, made him the legitimate father of a unified Vietnam\\" Pepper later stated that the contact contributed to King's more adamant position against the Vietnam War. Pepper has said he was present at King's April 4, 1967 Riverside Church speech in which King launched a strong campaign against the war. James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to King's assassination but soon recanted his confession. Pepper, who was Ray's last attorney, has postulated that Ray was not the shooter but was framed by the FBI, the CIA, the military, the Memphis police, and organized crime figures from New Orleans and Memphis. Pepper represented James Earl Ray in a televised mock trial where Ray was found not guilty. Pepper's appeals to higher courts, and even the Supreme Court, failed. According to Pepper, \\"It looked like we were at the end of the road and then I came up with an idea, 'Well, look, why don't we try to have a real trial on television?\\" A mock trial was broadcast on HBO. The television jury found Ray not guilty.Johnson, Carrie. \\"Despite Swirl Of Conspiracy Theories, Investigators Say The MLK Case Is Closed.\\" National Public Radio, April 4, 2018. King's youngest son, Dexter King, met with Ray on March 27, 1997, at the Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility. King subsequently said, \\"In the name of truth and justice, our family is calling for a trial, a trial James Earl Ray never had. ... I don't think his trial‚Äîif he is granted a trial‚Äîwill necessarily give us the unequivocal proof, but at least in regard to new evidence, we will know more than we do now.\\" Bragg, Rick. \\"King Family Seeks Trial for Ray Before He Dies With His Secrets.\\" The New York Times, February 4, 1997. In June 1997, Pepper appeared on ABC's Turning Point. He discussed the theory from his book Orders to Kill: The Truth Behind the Murder of Martin Luther King Jr. This theory that held that a hit team from the 20th special forces group was to kill King if a police sharpshooter failed. This group was supposedly led by a man named Billy Eidson, whom Pepper claimed had since been killed in a cover up. Eidson was then brought on camera and refused to shake Pepper's hand. Eidson brought a $15 million dollar lawsuit against Pepper's publisher which was later settled for a undisclosed amount. Following Ray's death, Pepper represented the King family in a wrongful death lawsuit, \\"King family vs. Loyd Jowers and other unknown co-conspirators\\". During a trial that lasted four weeks, Pepper produced over seventy witnesses. Jowers, testifying by deposition, stated that James Earl Ray was a scapegoat and not involved in the assassination. Jowers testified that Memphis police officer Earl Clark fired the fatal shots. On December 8, 1999, the Memphis jury found Jowers responsible, and also found that the assassination plot included \\"governmental agencies.\\" The jury took less than an hour to find in favor of the King family for the requested sum of $100. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference said Pepper has an \\"unceasing commitment in the pursuit of justice.\\" =Robert F. Kennedy assassination= On February 22, 2012, Pepper and co-counsel Laurie Dusek filed a court brief in District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Robert F. Kennedy, and petitioning for the release of their client Sirhan Sirhan. Pepper believes that Sirhan, who claims to have no memory of the shooting was programmed under hypnosis to shoot and provide a distraction from the actual gunman who got away. Hypnosis expert Harvard Medical School professor Daniel P. Brown concluded that Sirhan did not act under his own volition and knowledge at the time of the shooting. He was a real \\"Manchurian Candidate\\". ABC news said the story had all the makings of a great conspiracy theory. Sirhan Sirhan was again denied parole on February 10, 2016. On March 30, 2016, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied a further appeal launched by Pepper, noting the appellant has not shown that \\"jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\\" Bibliography Articles * \\"The Children of Vietnam.\\" Ramparts, January 1967, pp. 45‚Äì68.

He is famous for his help in starting the Pony Express and for establishing other stage coach and mail routes in the United States during the nineteenth century. Ficklin was also one of the people responsible for the creation of the Pacific Telegraph Company in 1861. Born in Albemarle County, Virginia in 1827, Ficklin had a reputation for misbehaving. So in 1845, his father sent young Ficklin to attend the Virginia Military Institute. As a cadet, Ficklin was known for his pranks, and he often got in trouble for them. One night, he filled a howitzer with gunpowder, turned it toward the cadet barracks, and discharged it (Virginia Military Institute Archives, 2005). This action resulted in his suspension in 1846. With his suspension, Ficklin entered the Army. He ultimately served as a corporal in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, where he was injured but recovered. Ficklin requested to be readmitted into the corps of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, and his request was approved. Upon graduation, Ficklin attempted to work as a teacher. Dissatisfied, he sought employment with an express company in Alabama. Later, he worked as a surveyor for varied freight lines. Ficklin was ubiquitous at a number of important moments during the Utah War, including the raid on Fort Lemhi which signaled Deseret's demise. In 1859, Ficklin returned to the express and stage business which now boomed with the western expansion precipitated in the wave of Gold Rush fever. In 1860, some credit him with the idea of the Pony Express. Yet, William Hepburn Russell, Alexander Majors, and William B. Waddell are more often credited as the founders, owners, and operators of the Pony Express. Ficklin did serve as general manager for the venture, until a disagreement with Russell. Russell allegedly became jealous of Ficklin's popularity and suspicious of Ficklin's loyalties. Learning of this, Ficklin immediately resigned. In 1860, the Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860 called for the facilitation of communication between the east and west coasts of the United States of America. Hiram Sibley of the Western Union Telegraph Company won the contract. In 1861, Ficklin joined Hiram Sibley in helping to form the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska. At the same time, Jeptha Wade was asked by Hiram Sibley to consolidate smaller telegraph companies in California. While the Pacific Telegraph Company built west from Omaha, Nebraska, the Overland Telegraph Company of California was thus formed and built east from Carson City, Nevada. With their connection in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 24, 1861, the final link between the east and west coasts of the United States of America was made. The First Transcontinental Telegraph would ironically lead to the immediate demise of the Pony Express. The Pacific Telegraph Company and Overland Telegraph Company of California were eventually absorbed into the Western Union Telegraph Company. During the Civil War, Ficklin joined the Confederate States of America's war effort in Virginia. He eventually served as a Confederate purchasing agent in Europe and as an intelligence officer. During the war, he achieved some status. In 1864, he even bought Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs Monticello, but it would be stripped from him under Reconstruction. In 1865, Ficklin was sent on a secret peace mission to Washington, D.C.. While there, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and Ficklin was arrested. He was cleared of suspicion and released upon his swearing a loyalty oath to the Union. After the Civil War, Major Ficklin opened an express stagecoach business in Texas. The route served from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to California. He founded a town in Texas to serve his enterprise. After his death, the town was named after him. Today, Ben Ficklin, Texas, is a ghost town. In the course of his final business venture, which included a U.S. Post Office subcontract, Ficklin frequently visited Washington, DC where, in March 1871, he was dining at the Willard hotel in Washington, D.C. when a fishbone lodged in his throat. He died a few days later, after a physician cut an artery while trying to remove the bone. He is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. Benjamin Franklin Ficklin died childless. However, one of his siblings‚Äô descendents, Jared Ficklin, a cowboy, would later appear on the PBS reality show Texas Ranch House. References * Mauer, D.A.

The spacecraft's primary instrumentation was a highly sensitive gravity gradiometer consisting of three pairs of accelerometers which measured gravitational gradients along three orthogonal axes. Launched on 17 March 2009, GOCE mapped the deep structure of the Earth's mantle and probed hazardous volcanic regions. It brought new insight into ocean behaviour; this in particular, was a major driver for the mission. By combining the gravity data with information about sea surface height gathered by other satellite altimeters, scientists were able to track the direction and speed of geostrophic ocean currents. The low orbit and high accuracy of the system greatly improved the known accuracy and spatial resolution of the geoid (the theoretical surface of equal gravitational potential on the Earth). The satellite's unique arrow shape and fins helped keep GOCE stable as it flew through the thermosphere at a comparatively low altitude of . Additionally, an ion propulsion system continuously compensated for the variable deceleration due to air drag without the vibration of a conventional chemically powered rocket engine, thus limiting the errors in gravity gradient measurements caused by non-gravitational forces and restoring the path of the craft as closely as possible to a purely inertial trajectory. After running out of propellant, the satellite began dropping out of orbit and made an uncontrolled reentry on 11 November 2013.  Discoveries and applications  Mission objectives = * To determine gravity-field anomalies with an accuracy of (1 mGal). To increase resolution, the satellite flew in an unusually low orbit. * To determine the geoid with an accuracy of 1‚Äì2 cm. * To achieve the above at a spatial resolution better than 100 km. = Gravity map and model = The final gravity map and model of the geoid will provide users worldwide with well-defined data product that will lead to: * A better understanding of the physics of the Earth's interior to gain new insights into the geodynamics associated with the lithosphere, mantle composition and rheology, uplift and subduction processes. * A better understanding of the ocean currents and heat transport. * A global height- reference system, which can serve as a reference surface for the study of topographic processes and sea-level change. * Better estimates of the thickness of polar ice-sheets and their movement. = Findings = The first Earth global gravity model based on GOCE data was presented at ESA's Living Planet Symposium, in June 2010. Initial results of the GOCE satellite mission were presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2010 Fall (Autumn) Meeting by Dr. Rory Bingham from Newcastle University, UK. The maps produced from the GOCE data show ocean currents in much finer detail than had been available previously. Even very small details like the Mann Eddy in the North Atlantic were visible in the data, as was the effect of Hurricane Igor in 2010. Detailed analysis of GOCE's thruster and accelerometer data serendipitously revealed that it had detected the infrasound waves generated by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake (whereupon it inadvertently became the first seismograph in orbit). Later results from the GOCE data exposed details in the Earth's mantle including mantle plumes, ancient subduction zones, and remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Subsequent analysis of GOCE data has also provided new information about the geological makeup of the Antarctic continent, including the detection of ancient continent remnants and at least three cratons beneath the Antarctic ice.  Operations  Launch = The first launch attempt on 16 March 2009 was aborted due to a malfunction with the launch tower. GOCE was launched on 17 March 2009 at 14:21 UTC from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia aboard a Rokot/Briz-KM vehicle. The Rokot is a modified UR-100N intercontinental ballistic missile that was decommissioned after the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The launcher used the two lower liquid fuel stages of the original missile and was equipped with a Briz-KM third stage developed for precise orbit injection. GOCE was launched into a Sun- synchronous dusk-dawn orbit with an inclination of 96.7¬∞ and an ascending node at 18:00. Separation from the launcher was at 295 km. The satellite's orbit then decayed over a period of 45 days to an operational altitude, planned at 270 km. During this time, the spacecraft was commissioned and the electrical propulsion system checked for reliability in attitude control. = Operation = Model of GOCE In February 2010 a fault was discovered in the satellite's computer, which meant controllers were forced to switch control to the backup computer. In July 2010, GOCE suffered a serious communications malfunction, when the satellite suddenly failed to downlink scientific data to its receiving stations. Extensive investigations by experts from ESA and industry revealed that the issue was almost certainly related to a communication link between the processor module and the telemetry modules of the main computer. The recovery was completed in September 2010: as part of the action plan, the temperature of the floor hosting the computers was raised by some , resulting in restoration of normal communications. In November 2010, the due completion date for the original 20-month mission before it was delayed by the glitches, it was decided to extend the mission lifetime until the end of 2012 in order to complete the original work and carry out a further 18-month mission to improve the collected data. In November 2012 the orbit was lowered from to get higher resolution data, at which time fuel remained for another 50 weeks. = End of mission and re-entry = In May 2013 a further lowering to took place. The satellite ran out of its xenon propellant in October 2013, at which time it would take to re-enter. On 18 October 2013, ESA reported that the pressure in the fuel system of GOCE's ion engine had dropped below 2.5 bar, which is the nominal operating pressure required to fire the engine. Subsequently, end of mission was formally declared on 21 October when the spacecraft ran out of fuel; deprived of xenon, the ion drive stopped working at 03:16 UTC. On 9 November 2013, a published report indicated that the satellite was expected to re-enter within a day or two. By this date, the perigee altitude had decayed to . On 10 November, ESA expected re-entry to occur between 18:30 and 24:00 UTC that day, with the most probable impact ground swath largely running over ocean and polar regions. Its descending orbit on 11 November 2013 passed over Siberia, the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean and Antarctica. The satellite finally disintegrated around 00:16 UTC on 11 November near the Falkland Islands.  Design  Payload = The satellite's main payload was the Electrostatic Gravity Gradiometer (EGG) to measure the gravity field of Earth. This instrument consisted of three pairs of capacitive accelerometers arranged in three dimensions that responded to tiny variations in the 'gravitational tug' of the Earth as it traveled along its orbital path. Because of their different position in the gravitational field they all experienced the gravitational acceleration of the Earth slightly differently. The three axes of the gradiometer allowed the simultaneous measurement of the five independent components of the gravity gradient tensor. Other payload was an onboard GPS receiver used as a Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument (SSTI); a compensation system for all non-gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft. The satellite was also equipped with a laser retroreflector to enable tracking by ground-based Satellite laser ranging stations . = Power and propulsion = GOCE flares to magnitude +2 as the 67.5 degree solar panel briefly mirrors sunlight (3 January 2010, 17:24:23.15 UTC). GOCE's frame had fixed solar panels covering its sun-facing side, which produced 1,300 watts of power. The panels were shaped to act as fins, stabilising the spacecraft while it orbited through the residual air in the thermosphere. The ion propulsion electric engine, designed and built at QinetiQ's space centre in Farnborough, England, ejected xenon ions at velocities exceeding , which compensated for the orbital decay losses. GOCE's mission ended when the xenon fuel tank emptied. The dual Kaufman-type ion thrusters could produce up to of thrust. Although its predicted lifetime was 20 months, an ESA report in June 2010 suggested that unusually low solar activity (meaning a calmer upper atmosphere, and hence less drag on the craft) meant the fuel would last longer than its predicted 20 months‚Äîpossibly into 2014. In reality, the end of mission was formally declared on 21 October 2013 after 55 months, with the final 11 months in a lower orbit (with greater air density and therefore greater fuel use).

The town is best known as the location of the shrine to the Sindhi Sufi poet, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, who gave his name to the town (Bhttai ). Passing along the road that leaves Haala for Hyderabad, beyond the shrubs there are a solitary group of large white mounds, which form hills known as Bhit in Sindhi. Among these sandy mounds the great poet of Sindh made a small cave, where he pondered deep into himself to seek inside of his soul. Even when he was a boy, he would turn away from the haunts of men and disappear into a thick group of shrubs, surrounding these sand-hills. Shrine of Abdul Latif Bhittai The Shrine of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, located in the centre of town, was built by Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro, who ruled over Sindh during the late 1700s. Kalhoro ordered the shrine to be built in 1772. It is a structure covered with traditional Iranian qashani tiles, glazed in the colours such as blue and turquoise. The final resting place of Shah Latif is under the main-dome of the building. His grave is enclosed by a carved wooden screen and lies under a beautifully painted fresco. Musicians are often seen serenading the constant trickle of devotees who visit the saint. On Thursdays' evenings, locals gather around to remember the Sufi saint, by reciting his poems and playing music. The Urs of Shah Latif is celebrated in the Islamic month of Safar. Museum Located close to the shrine is the small Bhit Shah Museum which houses exhibits of folktales mentioned in Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's best known work, Shah Jo Risalo. These include Sohni Mehar and Umar Marui. Bhit is also a tourist attraction.

Elections to positions within a city or town are often known as \\"municipal elections\\". Their form and conduct vary widely across jurisdictions. Local elections by area Europe = Adopted by the Congress of the Council of Europe, The European Charter of Local Self-Government aims to establish basic European rules in order to measure and safeguard the rights of local authorities. The Charter commits the parties to applying basic rules guaranteeing the political, administrative and financial independence of local authorities. The Congress conducts two main activities so as to evaluate the Charter's implementation: local and regional election monitoring and observation. The Congress regularly observes local and/or regional elections in member and applicant countries, which allows the Council to monitor the state of local and regional democracy in the countries concerned. With regards to its monitoring mission, the Congress prepares monitoring reports. =Middle East= In Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, local elections have proven to be easier to achieve than larger scale ones that affect the national or federal government. By giving voice to people on the smaller scales of government, over such issues as water supply, power, and sewer systems, confidence is thought to be built to eventually reform higher levels of government. In more mature developed nations there is always an effort to get more information about candidates and options to people, and to keep the influence of larger national bodies like a political party to a minimum, as its ideological agenda is not typically that of any locality: =New Zealand= Local elections are held every three years to elect local government politicians for the two tiers of local government in New Zealand. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom the term local elections refers to county, unitary authority, borough, district, city, town and parish elections. These take place on the first Thursday of May every year. Councillors generally sit for four years. The number of independent (non-party) Councillors has declined over the past forty years - nowadays the overwhelming majority of local Councillors belong to one of the major parties. =United States= In the United States there is more focus on electoral reform, including a call for instant-runoff voting to be used to select all major executives. This is thought to make it possible for small parties to compete, as in the case of Matt Gonzalez in San Francisco, California. Such a ballot reform is often a complement to moving towards a ‚Äústrong mayor‚Äù system, such as in Baltimore, Maryland or as recently advocated in Oakland, California.

In 1860, the Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860 called for the facilitation of communication between the east and west coasts of the United States of America. Hiram Sibley of the Western Union Telegraph Company won the contract. In 1861, Benjamin Franklin Ficklin joined Hiram Sibley in helping to form the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska. At the same time, Jeptha Wade was asked by Hiram Sibley to consolidate smaller telegraph companies in California. While the Pacific Telegraph Company built west from Omaha, Nebraska, the Overland Telegraph Company of California was thus formed and built east from Carson City, Nevada. With their connection in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 24, 1861, the final link between the east and west coasts of the United States of America was made by telegraph. The First Transcontinental Telegraph led to the immediate demise of the Pony Express. The Pacific Telegraph Company and Overland Telegraph Company of California were eventually absorbed into the Western Union Telegraph Company. Edward Creighton managed construction for Pacific Telegraph, which started in Omaha on 4 July 1861, and simultaneously from Salt Lake a week later. Creighton reached Salt Lake first allowing Brigham Young to send an east bound telegram on 18 Oct.

Fischertechnik is a brand of construction toy. It was invented by Artur Fischer and is produced by fischertechnik GmbH in Waldachtal, Germany. Fans often refer to Fischertechnik as \\"FT\\" or \\"ft\\". It is used in education for teaching about simple machines, as well as motorization and mechanisms. The company also offers computer interface technology, which can be used to teach the theory of automation and robotics. Origin The company is a German manufacturer of fasteners, and the original Fischertechnik set was intended as a Christmas (1964) novelty gift for engineers and buyers at industrial clients. The gifts proved popular, so for Christmas 1965, the company introduced its first building set for retail sale in Germany. In part, it has been claimed to foster education and interest in technology and science among the young. By about 1970, the construction sets were being sold in the United States at upscale toy retailers such as FAO Schwarz. Building blocks The basic building blocks were of channel-and-groove design, manufactured of hard nylon. Basic blocks came in 15√ó15√ó15 and 15√ó15√ó30 millimeter sizes. A peg on one side of each block could be attached into a channel on any of the other five sides of a similar block, producing a tightly-fitting assembly that could assume almost any shape. Red cladding plates could be used to complete the exterior surfaces of the models. Accessories The original blocks were characteristically gray with red accessories such as wheels and angled blocks. Electric motors, power sources, and gears were soon added to mobilize models. Additional building pieces such as struts were added in ‚Äústatics‚Äù sets, allowing the construction of realistic-looking bridges and tower cranes. A few Fischertechnik girders actually are made of aluminum.Hobby Engineering: Aluminum Girder 210 mm from fischertechnik Other companies make Fischertechnik-compatible aluminum bars of any desired length.Staudinger: Fischertechnik-compatible aluminum profiles To teach the physics of such models, some sets included measuring devices, so that trigonometric vectors could be calculated and tested. Electrical and electronic components The early sets were sophisticated and were often used by engineers to teach and simulate industrial robotics. This use was advanced by the addition of electrical and electronic components such as microswitches, magnetic-sensing reed switches, and photocells, which sensed position and provided input to motors. With the basic electronic block (Grundbaustein), which contained an operational amplifier, Schmitt trigger and delay line circuits could be built. In the late 1970s, electronic binary-logic modules (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, flip- flops) were introduced, so that models could make some branching decisions. Pneumatic devices were made available to provide gripping ability. By the late 1980s, process control CPU modules were added, so that sequences movements could be preprogrammed and executed, first using ‚ÄúLucky Logic‚Äù (LLWIN) software. Kits for younger ages As Lego became more sophisticated with its Mindstorms line, Fischertechnik attempted to move down into less technical, more ‚Äúfun‚Äù, building kits for younger ages. The parts were molded from more colorful plastics, and small building sets were developed for simple models such as vehicles. However, the Fischer products were more expensive and had far fewer parts that replicated everyday objects than Lego. Especially in the United States, Fischertechnik never achieved parity with Lego in the general construction toy market, and FT is still more positioned as a product for schools, engineers, and hobbyists. The sets are not as available at retail as Lego products in the United States, or even in Europe. Robotic process control Fischertechnik computing with a interface By 2006, Fischertechnik sets were available for robotic process control using ‚ÄúRobo-pro‚Äù software (the successor to Lucky-logic), on-board process controllers with flash memory, infrared and radio-frequency remote control, and pneumatic-activation. Robotic models could follow preprogrammed routes or lines on the floor, sense obstructions and change course, detect and move objects, and simulate everyday devices such as vending machines, passenger elevator systems, and traffic- control lights. In early 2010, Fischertechnik introduced the ROBO TX Explorer kit, which includes a color sensor. Sets Fischertechnik has produced myriad different sets over the years, and the company has several times renamed existing sets. Moreover, there have been as many as five different lines of these sets (often referred to as \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", and \\"E\\" in fan circles) with similar but differing components (all compatible, of course). Roughly these fit into the production years 1967‚Äì1971, 1972‚Äì1975, 1976‚Äì1981, 1981‚Äì1984 and 1984‚Äì1991. The A line featured predominantly black-and-white images, whereas the \\"B\\" line features the \\"Oscar DuJouet 1970\\" award on the box design. \\"C\\" saw the introduction of black plastic cogs (earlier they were all red), and \\"D\\" saw the introduction of yellow plastic \\"statics\\" (whereas before they were grey). The following equivalencies can help make sense of some of the core sets: * Start 300 = Start 200 + 50/3 = Start 100 + 50/2 + 50/3 = Start 50 + 50/1 + 50/2 + 50/3 * Hobby 1 = UT1 = selected parts from Start 300 (but significantly abbreviated) * Hobby 2 = UT2 = Mot1 + Mot2 + Mot3 (The Hobby 2 / UT2 lacks the battery box that comes with Mot1.) * Hobby 3 = UT3 = EM1 + EM2 + EM3 (The \\"EM\\" stands for \\"Electro-Mechanical\\".) * Hobby 4 = UT4 = EC1 + EC2 + EC3 (The \\"EC\\" stands for \\"Electronic\\".) * Hobby S = Start 50S + 50S/1 + 50S/2 + 50S/3 (Note that those are \\"S\\" = \\"structural\\", not a \\"5\\".) Note that prior to the Fischertechnik \\"C\\" line (1976?), the starter sets didn't have as many parts, and neither did their add-on kits (50/1, 50/2, 50/3). Because the older manuals lack copyright dates or official line designations, it is difficult to distinguish sets without in-depth knowledge of what was actually in the box for each line and set. More recently, Fischertechnik has started producing a whole line of kits specialized for the construction of particular models, like boats, airplanes, bridges, cranes, etc. This is something of a departure from their traditional niche producing generic sets from which (literally) hundreds of different models can be built. Fischertechnik has also started producing advanced robotic sets, including battery packs, remote controls, and programmable control boards.

His reign has been considered by many historians as the start of the expansion of British control of the Indian subcontinent in Indian history and a key step in the eventual British domination of vast areas of modern-day India. Mir Jafar served as the commander of the Bengali army under Siraj ud- Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, but betrayed him during the Battle of Plassey and succeeded Daulah after the British victory in 1757. Mir Jafar received military support from the East India Company until 1760, when he failed to satisfy various British demands. In 1758, Robert Clive discovered that Jafar had made a treaty with the Dutch East India Company at Chinsurah through his agent Khoja Wajid. Dutch ships of the line were also seen in the River Hooghly. Jafar's dispute with the British eventually led to the Battle of Chinsurah. British company official Henry Vansittart proposed that since Jafar was unable to cope with the difficulties, Mir Qasim, Jafar's son-in-law, should act as Deputy Subahdar. In October 1760, the company forced him to abdicate in favor of Qasim. However, the East India Company eventually overthrew Qasim as well due to disputes over trade policies. Jafar was restored as the Nawab in 1763 with the support of the company. Mir Qasim, however, refused to accept this and went to war against the company. Jafar ruled until his death on 5 February 1765 and lies buried at the Jafarganj Cemetery in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Mir Jafar remains a controversial figure in Indian history and has become a symbol of intimate betrayal and treachery among Bengalis. Subedar of the Nawab of Bengal In 1747 the Maratha Empire led by Raghoji I Bhonsle, began to raid, pillage and annex the territories of the Alivardi Khan, the Nawab of Bengal. During the Maratha invasion of Odisha, its subedar Mir Jafar and Ataullah the faujdar of Rajmahal completely withdrew all forces until the arrival of Alivardi Khan and the Mughal Army at the Battle of Burdwan where Raghoji I Bhonsle and his Maratha forces were completely routed. The enraged Alivardi Khan then dismissed the shamed Mir Jafar. Nawab of Bengal Jafar and his son Miran delivering the Treaty of 1757 to William Watts Jafar initially showed loyalty to Alivardi Khan's successor Siraj Ud Daulah, but betrayed him to the British in the battle of Plassey. After Siraj Ud Daulah's defeat and subsequent execution, Jafar achieved his long-pursued dream of gaining the throne, and was propped up by the East India company as a puppet Nawab. Jafar paid Rs. 17,700,000 as compensation for the attack on Calcutta to the company and traders of the city. In addition, he gave bribes to the officials of the company. Clive, for example received over two million rupees, Watts over one million.Modern India by Dr. Bipin Chendra, a publication of National council of Educational Research and Training Soon, however, he realized that company's expectations were boundless and tried to wriggle out from under them; this time with the help of the Dutch. However, the British defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Chinsurah in November 1759 and retaliated by forcing him to abdicate in favor of his son-in-law Mir Qasim. Qasim proved to be both able and independent- minded, although he soon came into dispute with the company over their refusal to pay taxes to Qasim. Mir Qasim formed an alliance to force the East India Company out of East India. The company soon went to war with him and his allies. The Battle of Buxar was fought on 22 October 1764 between the forces under the command of the East India Company led by Hector Munro, and the combined armies of Mir Qasim the Nawab of Bengal, Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh, and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. With the defeat in Buxar, Mir Qasim was eventually overthrown. Mir Jafar managed to regain the good graces of the British; he was again installed Nawab in 1764 and held the position until his death in 1765. =Bengal War= The Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, reviewing the British East India Company's troops, painted in 1781. In 1760, after gaining control over Bihar, Odisha and some parts of the Bengal, the Mughal Crown Prince Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Jafar, Imad-ul-Mulk after they tried to capture or kill him by advancing towards Awadh and Patna in 1759. But the conflict soon involved the increasingly assertive East India Company. The Mughals were led by Prince Ali Gauhar, who was accompanied by Muhammad Quli Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal and Ghulam Husain Tabatabai. Their forces were reinforced by the forces of Shuja- ud-Daula and Najib-ud-Daula. The Mughals were also joined by Jean Law and two hundred Frenchmen and waged a campaign against the British during the Seven Years' War. Although the French were eventually defeated, the conflict between the British East India Company and the Mughal Empire would continue to linger and ended in a draw, which eventually culminated during the Battle of Buxar. Legacy Plassey, by Francis Hayman. The breakup of the centralized Mughal empire by 1750, led to creation of a large number of independent kingdoms in Northern, Central and Western India, as also North-Western India (now Pakistan) and parts of Afghanistan (all provinces of the former Mughal empire). Each of them were in conflict with their neighbor. These kingdoms bought weapons from the British and French East India companies to aid their wars. Bengal was one such kingdom. The British and French supported whichever princes ensured their trading interest. Jafar came to power with support of British East India Company. After the defeat of Sirajuddoula and later Mir Qasim the British strengthened their position in Bengal and in 1793 abolished the nizamat (referring to the Mughal suzerainty) and took complete control of the former Mughal province. The word \\"mirjafar\\" in Bengali and the phrase \\"meer jafar\\" in Urdu, are used much as quisling is used in English, and Jaichand of Kannauj in North Indian history.

When he met with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to urge the creation of a Jewish army, the emperor turned him over to the Inquisition and he was burned at the stake. Early life Nothing is known of Molcho's family or even the exact date of his birth. He was born in Portugal sometime between September 1500 and August 1502, probably to Marrano parents.Kitvei Shlomo Molcho, The Collected Writings of Shlomo Molcho, molchobooks, Jerusalem, 2019, , p. 125 (Hebrew) His original name was Diogo Pires. He held the post of secretary to the High Court of Appeals of his native country. When the Jewish adventurer David Reubeni arrived in 1525 to negotiate with the king, ostensibly on a political mission from some of the ten lost tribes of Israel, Molcho wished to join him, but was rejected. He then circumcised himself, though without thereby gaining Reubeni's favor, and was forced to emigrate.Lechu Neranena Le'et Hageula, Jerusalem 2019 , p. 7 (Hebrew) Mystic studies Molcho became a master Talmudist and biblical exegesist, and then studied the Kabbalah with Joseph Taitazak. He himself inspired Joseph Caro and Shlomo Alkabetz.Lechu Neranena Le'et Hageula, pp. 5, 37. He then wandered as a preacher through Italy and Turkey and achieved a great reputationGedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph, Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah Jerusalem 1962, p. 112 in PDF (Hebrew) and suggested that the Messianic kingdom would come in 1535 or 1540. In 1529 Molcho published a portion of his sermons under the title Derashot, a book that was later renamed Sefer ha-Mefo'ar. Returning to Italy, he was opposed by prominent Jews including Jacob Mantino ben Samuel, who feared that he might cause unrest among the Jews. He was given an audience before Pope Clement VII and gained his favor, as well as that of some Judeophile cardinals at Rome. He warned the Pope to leave Rome as the city would soon be flooded and he sent a message to the king of Portugal warning of an imminent earthquake. The occurrence of a deadly flood on October 8, 1530, and an earthquake in Lisbon on January 26, 1531,Kitvei Shlomo Molcho, The Collected Writings of Shlomo Molcho, p. 109. raised Molcho's reputation among the religious and political authorities. Travels and execution In company with David Reubeni, his mentor, he went in 1532 to Ratisbon, where the emperor Charles V was holding a diet. On this occasion, Molcho carried a flag with the Hebrew word Maccabi, the four letters ◊û◊õ◊ë◊ô which also signify an abbreviation for Exodus 15:11 \\"Who among the mighty is like unto God?\\".Singer, Isidore; Bloch, Phillipp. \\"Molko, Solomon\\" in Jewish Encyclopedia. Funk and Wagnalls, New York. 1901-1906. The three met for two hours, and while the exact content of the meeting was not recorded, letters written from the court at the time indicate Molcho proposed the establishment of a joint Jewish-Christian armyJ Kracuaer, Rabbi Joselmann de Rosheim, REJ, XVI, 91. to fend off the emperor's foreign enemies and, possibly, to reconquer the Holy Land. The emperor had both Molcho and Reubeni arrested and took them back to Italy. In Mantua an ecclesiastical court sentenced Molcho to death by fire. Molcho was taken to the stake in November or December 1532 (a Jewish tradition lists the date as 5th of Tevet 5293 but there are no records to confirm the date). It is claimed the emperor offered to pardon him on condition that he return to the Catholic Church, but Molcho refused, asking for a martyr's death.Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph, Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah Jerusalem 1962, p. 112 in PDF (Hebrew) His mentor, David Reubeni, was exiled to Spain, where later he died. Writings Molcho published a book of homilies Derashot on the Bible, based mostly on the Talmud and Midrash, in Salonika in late 1529. Two of his biographical letters, which also recount his dreams, were first published, in bowdlerized and censored form, in Amsterdam in 1660, in a book entitled Hayat Kaneh. Modern scholars have discovered several more works by Molcho, including a second book, which he had prepared for publication at the time of his death and which focused on Messianic redemption and emphasized the Kabbala, and a song, and the transcript of a synagogue lecture Molcho delivered in the spring of 1531. His second book, along with his homilies and other writings, including uncensored versions of his letters, were published as Kitvei Shlomo Molcho (The Collected Writings of Shlomo Molcho) in Jerusalem in 2019. Molcho's writings and speeches highlighted the roles of the Messiah ben Joseph and the Messiah ben David in the process of redemption and stressed that redemption could come if Jews were faithful to God and his commandments or if the non-Jewish religious and political powers were exceedingly evil and oppressive. A dream Molcho had in 1526 apparently led him to believe he was destined to be either the Messiah ben Joseph or his precursor, but in none of his writings or speeches did he ever explicitly state this or proclaim himself the Messiah.Lechu Neranena Le'et Hageula, p. 11.

Early life and education  Sive was born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 22, 1922, the son of Abraham Sive and Rebecca (n√©e Schwartz) Sive. As a teenager, his growing love for the outdoors and fascination with the American wilderness, as well as his interest in the writings of Thoreau, Emerson, and Wordsworth, led him to a lifelong passion for the natural environment, to wilderness preservation and environmental protection. Hiking and camping expeditions during his college years, to the Catskill and Adirondack mountains of New York State, foreshadowed his advocacy in later years for the ‚Äúforever wild‚Äù clause in the New York State constitution and his activism for environmental preservation in his home state and throughout the U.S. Sive graduated from Brooklyn College with a degree in political science in 1943. He had enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 and was called up in the spring of 1943 shortly before his college graduation. He served in the front lines in Europe, including in the Battle of the Bulge, was wounded twice and awarded the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. Convalescence at a U.S. Army hospital in Devon, England gave him further opportunity to study the verse of William Wordsworth. Sive enrolled at Columbia Law School following his discharge from the Army in the fall of 1945. A Harlan Fiske Stone scholar, he received the Bachelor of Laws degree in 1948.  Legal career  David Sive in his office (1964). One of Sive's first lawsuits that gained public attention was David Sive v. Louis Newman (1951). In this case, Sive argued that the owner of a car that is double-parked is liable for damage incurred to a car traveling from the curb to the normal traffic stream. The argument was upheld. As a partner in the firm Winer, Neuberger & Sive, founded in New York City in 1962, and chairman of the Atlantic Chapter of the Sierra Club in the 1960s, Sive developed his reputation as an expert litigator and fierce defender of the environment. The successor firm, Sive, Paget & Riesel, remains a leader in environmental law. Sive lost one of the earliest cases under the National Environmental Policy Act, Concerned About Trident v. Schlesinger, 400 F.Supp. 454 (D.D.C. 1975). Among the many landmark cases Sive argued were Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission (1971).Houck, Oliver A. (2002). \\"Unfinished Stories,\\" 73 U. Colo. L. Rev. 867. The Storm King case accorded standing to a citizens group without financial interest in the proposed power project and ordered the defendant to explore alternatives. Con Ed eventually abandoned the project. Other notable cases included Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Schlesinger (1971), argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, which attracted wide media attention to the issue of governmental underground nuclear bomb testing and its potential environmental effects at Amchitka Island, Alaska; Concerned About Trident, Inc. v. Rumsfeld (1976), which established that strategic military decisions are not exempt from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; Mohonk Trust v. Board of Assessors of Town of Gardiner (1979), a real property case that on appeal established that land owned by a trust for environmental preservation and use could be exempt from real property taxes; Citizens Committee for the Hudson River v. Volpe et al. (1970), which stopped the construction of a proposed expressway on fill to be placed in the Hudson River. David Sive at a board meeting for the Concerned about Trident case. (June, 1974)  Academic experience  Sive taught litigation and environmental law for many years at Columbia Law School, and also taught environmental law as a visiting faculty member at the Universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, and Washington. He joined the faculty of Pace University Law School in 1995; the Pace Law Library houses the David Sive Manuscript Collection, for students and scholars of environmental law.  Environmental organizations  Sive was a leader and activist with a number of environmental organizations. He was a founding member of Natural Resources Defense Council, the nation‚Äôs leading public interest law firm in this specialty, and of the Environmental Law Institute. Sive was also among the lawyers representing the Sierra Club when the Internal Revenue Service abruptly ended the Club's tax-exempt status in 1966. That move had the quite unintended effect of turning Sierra Club into the nationally known organization it remains and vastly increasing its membership. Sive subsequently served on the Club's Board of Directors. Sive was a founder of Environmental Advocates of New York, a contributing founder of Friends of the Earth, a member of the board of directors of the Hudson Valley Institute and Scenic Hudson, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, while serving on the board of directors of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York; and a multi-year chair of the annual ALI-ABA Conference on Environmental Law.Houck, Oliver A. (2004). \\"More Unfinished Stories: Lucas, Atlanta Coalition, and Palila/Sweet Home,\\" 75 U. Colo. L. Rev. 331, fn.1.  Honors and awards  He was the recipient of many awards, from the Environmental Law Institute, the New York State Environmental Planning Lobby, the Sierra Club, the New York State Bar Association, The Nature Conservancy, the New York State Parks and Conservation Association, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and others. He was a prolific author and lecturer on the topics of environmental law and litigation. References Notes Further reading= * Fox, Margalit (March 19, 2014).

It was the theme song of the movie Thunder Road. The song made the Billboard Hot 100 twice, in 1958 and 1962, and while it never peaked higher than #62, it racked up 21 total weeks in the chart. The song moves ominously between minor and major keys. Background It tells the tale of \\"Lucas Doolin\\" (Robert Mitchum), a bootlegger during the 1950s who would deliver moonshine along local roads at excessive speeds to avoid \\"revenuers\\".http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiTHUNDRD.html lyricsThe song, however, does not specifically name Doolin, only referring to a \\"mountain boy\\". After receiving word (on April 1, 1954) that the revenuers had \\"200 agents, covering the state\\", Lucas' father advises him to \\"make this run your last\\", and that he should not attempt to outrun the revenuers, but if he could not get through safely, to turn himself in. However, Lucas ignores his father's request, and attempts to outrun the law, but fails to evade them and dies as a result (the last lines read: \\"Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike./He left the road at 90, that's all there is to say/The Devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day\\"). Mitchum got the tune for the song from a Norwegian folk-dance (Gammel Reinlender) song his mother used to sing to him. He also played the bootlegger in the movie. Bluegrass performers Jim & Jesse (McReynolds) brought the song to the national country charts in the fall of 1967. The song in the movie soundtrack itself is a softer, more ballad-like version than the hit single recorded by Mitchum, and was sung by Randy Sparks. DJ Allyn The Soundtrack of My Life References .

San Roman was a rich merchant not noted for his learning. During his travels abroad, including time in Germany and the Netherlands, he was influenced by \\"Lutheranism\\", as the young Protestant movement was called. San Roman became a disciple of Jacobo Spreng, a former prior of Augustinian monks at Antwerp. It is believed that San Roman wrote some books, including a catechism and some letters addressed to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which are now lost. Passing through Flanders, he was arrested by authorities of the Roman Church when books by Luther, Melanchthon and Ecolampadius were found in his luggage. San Roman was interrogated by the Dominicans and confessed the Reformed doctrines, including salvation by faith alone and the claim that the Pope is the Antichrist. After six months in prison, he was set free. However, he later preached the Protestant doctrines before the Emperor and was arrested. The Emperor's armies took Francisco de San Roman with them on an expedition to Algiers before handing him over to the Inquisition in Spain. He testified for his belief in salvation through Christ as the only mediator, and condemned the doctrines of the mass, auricular confession, purgatory and prayers to the saints. No efforts of the friars succeeded in convincing him to retract himself. When San Roman was burned at the stake, he made an involuntary movement of the head, which was mistaken by the friars for a recantation. However, when they removed him from the flames he recovered and calmly asked them, \\"Do you envy my happiness?\\". He was returned to the fire, leaving a lasting impression on many spectators.

It is a colorless solid. It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes. A member of the triazine class herbicides, it is manufactured by DuPont and sold under the trade name Velpar.Arnold P. Appleby, Franz M√ºller, Serge Carpy \\"Weed Control\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide. It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and < 2% on sugarcane.Hexazinone, Herbicide Profile, Pesticide Management Education Program, Cornell University Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, due to its high water solubility  History  Hexazinone is widely used as a herbicide. It is a non-selective herbicide from the triazine family. It is used among a broad range of places. It is used to control weeds within all sort of applications. From sugarcane plantations, forestry field nurseries, pineapple plantations to high- and railway grasses and industrial plant sites. Hexazinone was first registered in 1975 for the overall control of weeds and later for uses in crops.  Structure and reactivity  Triazines like hexazinone can bind to the D-1 quinone protein of the electron transport chain in photosystem II to inhibit the photosynthesis. These diverted electrons can thereby damage membranes and destroy cells.  Synthesis  Hexazinone can be synthesized in two different reaction processes. One process starts with a reaction of methyl chloroformate with cyanamide, forming hexazinone after a five-step pathway: 520x520px A second synthesis starts with methylthiourea.: 618x818px  Degradation  The degradation of hexazinone has long been studied. It degrades approximately 10% in five weeks, when exposed to artificial sunlight in distilled water. However, degradation in natural waters can be three to seven times greater. Surprisingly, the pH and the temperature of the water do not affect the photodegradation significantly. It is mainly degraded by aerobic microorganisms in soils.  Mechanism of action  Hexazinone is a broad- spectrum residual and contact herbicide, rapidly absorbed by the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore it is a very effective herbicide for the control for annual and perennial broadleaf weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the herbicide to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots. It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the photosynthesis of the plant within the chloroplasts. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the photosystem II complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state chlorophyll reacts with oxygen to form singlet oxygen. Both chlorophyll and singlet oxygen then remove hydrogen ions from the unsaturated lipids present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxidize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of chlorophyll, leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant. Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die. Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.

Biography He was born in Tulchyn, Ukraine to Rabbi Nachman Chazan, the closest disciple of Nathan of Breslov (\\"Reb Noson\\"), who in turn was the closest disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. Rabbi Nachman Chazan (also known as Reb Nachman Tulchyner) assumed the leadership of the Breslover community in Uman, Ukraine after Reb Noson's death and published the rest of his teacher's existing manuscripts, including the eight-volume Likutey Halakhot. Abraham Chazan was a deeply devout young man who often left home right after the Jewish Sabbath to meditate and study in the forest for the entire week, subsisting only on a sack of bread. Publications Few of his scholarly works survive; the most well-known is Biyur HaLikutim, an incisive and profound commentary on Rebbe Nachman's two- part collection of teachings, Likutey Moharan. Only part of this work was published in Chazan's lifetime; the first complete edition was published in 1935 by Rabbi Shmuel Horowitz and an amended and annotated edition was issued in 1989 by Rabbi Mordechai Frank. Notwithstanding his profound grasp of Rebbe Nachman's teachings, Chazan said about the Rebbe's simple conversations: \\"I hope that 10,000 years after the Resurrection, I will be worthy of understanding even one of Rebbe Nachman's statements the way the Rebbe himself understood it in this world!\\" After his father died in 1884, Chazan began to write down all the stories and Breslover traditions that he had heard from him. These historical anecdotes, along with stories about many of Rebbe Nachman's followers, formed the basis for his books, Kochavei Or (Stars of Light, 5 sections) and Sichot V'Sippurim (Lessons and Stories). Yemey HaTla'os (Days of Affliction), originally published as the fifth section of Kochavei Or in 1933. It was subsequently distributed as a separate pamphlet, detailed the persecution of Reb Noson and Breslover Hasidim by followers of other Rebbes from 1835-1839. Aliyah to Israel Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender. Chazan emigrated to Jerusalem around 1894. However, he returned to Uman each year for the annual Breslover Rosh Hashana kibbutz (prayer gathering). In 1914, the outbreak of World War I forced him to remain in Russia, where he lived and taught until his death in 1917. His students in Uman, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender and Rabbi Eliyahu Chaim Rosen, became leaders of the next generation of Breslover Hasidim after they emigrated from Uman to Jerusalem.

The service frequency was enhanced to about half-hourly in the morning and evening peaks. A limited number of trains worked through beyond Manchester, with trains to/from , Clitheroe, , , and . From 21 May 2018, two trains per hour started running between Manchester and Buxton all day, one of which omits certain stations en route. The evening and Sunday service remains hourly and there are no longer any through trains to/from destinations north of Manchester. Platform 2 is the main platform for arrivals and departures. Platform 1 is a departure platform by shunt move, which is usually used in early mornings by the first trains of the day which have been stabled overnight or when attachment/detachment of a unit to/from a formation is required.  Future  Network Rail has proposed, in their North West RUS, installing a facing cross-over which will allow platform 1 to become fully operational as an arrival and departure platform. Doing this will reduce the number of shunt moves.  History  Two railways arrived in Buxton almost simultaneously in 1863. The Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway, heavily promoted by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), built its line from Manchester to Whaley Bridge and extended it to Buxton. Meanwhile, the Midland Railway extended the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway from Rowsley. When the Midland extended its main line to New Mills in 1867, to bypass the LNWR, Buxton became a branch line from Millers Dale. The two railways planned separate stations, but the town's leaders were concerned that the railway would damage the character of the place and requested that they be built side-by-side, and be in keeping with the existing architecture of the town. Consequently, the LNWR and Midland station were given identical frontages designed by Joseph Paxton, each being built from local stone and having a wrought iron glazed train shed roof, fronted with identical half-circle fan widows. The Midland station closed in 1967, along with the line to Rowsley, and the site is now a roadway. However, the line through Dove Holes Tunnel from Chinley is still used for freight, such as limestone from Tunstead, along with the old Midland branch into Buxton and part of the old Ashbourne Line (closed to passengers in October 1954), which remains in use to serve a lime works at Dowlow and the quarry at Hindlow. These both join the main line just outside the station, where there also a number of sidings to allow trains to reverse. The bay platform formerly used by Ashbourne line trains and the connecting curve from it towards Dowlow have been removed, though it is still possible to trace its route. The LNWR station now handles local trains into Manchester, using its line through Dove Holes and Chapel-en-le-Frith. The trainshed roof of the remaining station was removed, leaving only the fan window and it's stonework at the end of the station as a remnant. In 2009 the fan window was restored to its former glory. = Accidents = * A runaway limestone train demolished the boiler room and gents toilet and damaged the porters' room in 1897, killing a passenger and injuring a porter. * A LNWR Class B boiler blew up in the station yard in 1921, killing the driver and fireman.

POSK claims to be against partisan politics inside the Church, but is thought to belong to the right-wing of Church politics. POSK is seemingly divided on many controversial issues, such as female priesthood and gay marriage. Concerning female priesthood the official line is in favour of it, but promotes respect for the dissenting minority within the Church. POSK does not have any position on gay marriage, and refers the issue back to a theological consultation. POSK wants to reform the electoral system of the Church, and remove it from party politics. In the 2001 elections POSK won 36 out of 251 seats in the Church Assembly. In 2005 POSK passed through a split, as a group opposed to same-sex blessings left it to form Frimodig kyrka. In the 2005 elections POSK got 13.7% and 34 seats.

Early life Sibley was born in North Adams, Massachusetts on February 6, 1807, and later resided in Rochester, New York. He was the second son of Benjamin Sibley (1768‚Äì1829) and Zilpha (n√©e Davis) Sibley (1771‚Äì1824). Career Too poor to receive more than a country education, Sibley started training as a shoemaker‚Äôs apprentice, but, unhappy with the career, went to Lima, New York at age 17 to work in a cotton factory. The following year he became a wool carder in a shop where future president Millard Fillmore then worked. At age 21 he started a machine shop in Sibleyville, New York that was eventually successful enough for him to sell and afford to move to Rochester, where he was elected Sheriff of Monroe County from 1844 to 1846. He became interested in the work of Samuel Morse involving the telegraph. In 1851, Sibley and others organized the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company in Rochester. Sibley later served as first president of Western Union Telegraph Company. In 1861, Jeptha Wade, founder of Western Union, joined forces with Benjamin Franklin Ficklin and Hiram Sibley to form the Pacific Telegraph Company. With it, the final link between the eastern and western coasts of the United States was made by telegraph. In conjunction with Perry Collins, Sibley later hoped to build a telegraph line from Alaska to Russia through the Bering Strait, the so-called Russian American Telegraph. However, this dream collapsed with the establishment of a cross-Atlantic line to Europe. Personal life Sibley was married to Elizabeth Maria Tinker (1815‚Äì1903), the daughter of Giles Tinker of Connecticut. Together, they were the parents of: * Zilpha Louise Sibley (1833‚Äì1868) * Giles Benjamin Sibley (1841‚Äì1843), who died in infancy. * Hiram Watson Sibley (1845‚Äì1932), president of Security Trust Company of Rochester. * Emily Sibley (1855‚Äì1945), a founder of the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester. After a five-day illness, Sibley died on July 12, 1888 and was interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester. At his death, his wealth was estimated between $8,000,000 and $10,000,000. Legacy Cornell's Sibley College ca 1880s Plaque at Sibley Hall, Cornell University In 1874 Sibley funded a library for the University of Rochester. Completed in 1877, it was the second building of the Prince Street campus, and later became part of the Eastman School of Music. The original Sibley Library building was sold in 1956 and torn down in 1968. In 1876 Sibley founded and endowed the Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts, as well as the building which housed it, Sibley Hall, at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The program is now known as the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and is located in parts of Upson, Grumman and Rhodes Halls. Sibley Hall is now a part of the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. Sibley's home near Rochester, the Hiram Sibley Homestead, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. His Rochester home is included in the East Avenue Historic District. The Hiram Sibley Building was built in 1925 at the corner of East Avenue and Alexander Street in Rochester, New York. It was named in his honor by his son Hiram Watson Sibley, and designed by Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott of Boston.

The boats in the first category have shallow structural keels, and are nearly flat-bottomed and often used leeboards if forced in open water, while modern recreational keelboats have prominent fixed fin keels, and considerable draft. The two terms may draw from cognate words with different final meaning. keelboat from the Lewis and Clark Expedition on the back of the 2004 nickel A keep boat, keelboat, or keel- boat is a type of usually long, narrow cigar-shaped riverboat, or unsheltered water barge which is sometimes also called a poleboat‚Äîthat is built about a slight keel and is designed as a boat built for the navigation of rivers, shallow lakes, and sometimes canals that were commonly used in America including use in great numbers by settlers making their way west in the century-plus of wide-open western American frontiers. They were also used extensively for transporting cargo to market, and for exploration and trading expeditions, for water transport was then most effective means to move bulky or heavy cargo. Keelboats were similar to riverboats, but like other barges were unpowered and were typically propelled and steered with oars or setting poles‚Äîusually the latter. Keelboats have been used for exploration, such as during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, but were primarily used to transport cargo or settlers in the early 19th century. The process of moving a keelboat upriver was extremely difficult, though current dependent. Most of these keelboats were long and wide. They usually had a cabin in the middle or at the rear, but were sometimes constructed with an open deck. Mike Fink is probably the most noted keelboater in history.

In New Zealand the term keeler is frequently used as a generic alternative - meaning any sailboat with a keel, regardless of size. World Sailing (Former ISAF, Former IYRU) usage differentiates keelboats (including the 12-meter class) from generally larger yachts, despite overlap in the sizes of boats in the two classes. The Olympic Games used keelboat to describe keeled boats with up to a three-man crew, as opposed to larger-crewed boats such as the 12-metre class. In some countries yachts can also be differentiated from keelboats with the addition of a toilet or \\"head\\" as the term \\"keelboat\\" is in some places understood to mean a sailboat with a keel that is designed purely for recreational/racing purposes, while the term \\"yacht\\" describes a sailboat designed for overnight transport.

The series began in 1995 with the time travel role-playing video game Chrono Trigger, which spawned two continuations, Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H≈çseki, and Chrono Cross. A promotional anime called Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar and two ports of Chrono Trigger were also produced. As of March 31, 2003, Chrono Trigger was Square Enix's 12th best-selling game, with 2.65 million units shipped. Chrono Cross was the 24th, with 1.5 million units. By March 2012, the two games sold over 5.4 million units combined. The games in the series have been called some of the greatest of all time, with most of the praise going towards Chrono Trigger. The series' original soundtracks, composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, have also been praised, with multiple soundtracks being released for them.  Concept and creation  Chrono Trigger was produced in 1995 by Kazuhiko Aoki and directed by Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. The development of the game was dubbed the \\"Dream Project\\", because it was headed by a \\"Dream Team\\" composed of supervisor Hironobu Sakaguchi, of Final Fantasy fame, as well as freelance supervisor Yuji Horii and character designer Akira Toriyama, both of Dragon Quest fame. Yuuji Horii worked on the general outline of the story; as a fan of time travel fictions, such as the TV series The Time Tunnel, he focused on a theme of time travel for Chrono Trigger. The outline was then finalized by story planner and script writer Masato Kato. In 1996, Masato Kato and several other members of the Chrono Trigger staff worked on a minor project for the Super Famicom Satellaview extension, titled Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H≈çseki. Initially, the game was intended to be a short, original text-based adventure developed in three months with almost no planning. Nevertheless, by the end of the development, Masato Kato had connected the game's plot and characters to Chrono Trigger, turning it into a side story. Since the platform of the game was not mainstream, the connections were however left blurred on purpose and were not advertised on the game's release. In 1999, a continuation of Chrono Trigger, titled Chrono Cross, was announced. Although the \\"Dream Team\\" members did not participate in Chrono Cross, the game was developed mostly by the same staff as the first installment. In terms of basic system and gameplay, producer Hiromichi Tanaka made it clear that the new installment was not a sequel to Chrono Trigger; rather, the game designers' approach was to make the \\"gameplay evolve with the hardware\\", creating a completely new game while restructuring the former style so as to maximize the performance of the console. The gameplay focuses on the theme of parallel worlds rather than time travel, although the latter is still deeply involved in the game's plot. In terms of storyline, Chrono Cross was described by director and scenario writer Masato Kato as \\"not a Chrono Trigger 2\\", but \\"a result of a pulled trigger\\", \\"another Chrono\\".  Games  Chrono Trigger = Chrono Trigger is a role-playing video game which was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 11, 1995 in Japan and on August 22, 1995 in North America. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers led by Crono, who are accidentally transported through time and learn that the world will be destroyed in the distant future. Vowing to prevent this disaster, they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet. It is regarded by critics as one of the greatest games of all time. Chrono Trigger was ported to the PlayStation in 1999 as a standalone title in Japan and in 2001 as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation in North America. An enhanced port was released for the Nintendo DS handheld platform on November 20, 2008. which itself was later released on iOS in 2011, Android in 2012, and on PC via Steam on February 27, 2018. Additionally, three Chrono Trigger related applications were released for the Super Famicom's Broadcast Satellaview extension the same year: Character Library, a database featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game, Jet Bike Special, a racing game based on a minigame from the original, and Music Library, a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of Character Library and Music Library were later included as extras in the PlayStation re-release of Chrono Trigger. = Radical Dreamers = Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H≈çseki (literally \\"The Jewel That Cannot Be Stolen\\") is a Japanese-exclusive text- based game released in 1996 through the Super Famicom Satellaview extension.

It is a side story to Chrono Trigger, wrapping up a loose end from its predecessor's plot. = Chrono Cross = Chrono Cross was released on the PlayStation on November 18, 1999 in Japan and on August 15, 2000 in North America. The story is partly a remake of Radical Dreamers, and as such replaces it as Chrono Trigger's successor.

Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar  is a 16-minute humoristic and promotional Chrono Trigger anime which was broadcast at the Japanese V-Jump Festival of July 31, 1996. It was created by Production I.G, and written by Hiroshi Izawa and Akihiro Kikuchi, while Itsuro Kawasaki served as director, Tensai Okamura as animation director, and Riho Nishino as character designer. The anime takes place in the same setting as Chrono Trigger during the night before the beginning of the game's events. It follows two monsters from the game, a Nu and a Mamo (called Kilwala in the English version of the game), voiced by Chafurin and Mayumi Tanaka respectively, through various adventures. These all take place in the \\"Millennial Fair\\", the festival at the beginning of Chrono Trigger, which in the anime has been infested by a festive gathering of monsters coming through portals. They meet several characters from the game, including Johnny and Gonzalez (called Gato in the English version of the game). The anime ends with a scene from the following morning after the monsters have all left, in which Crono and Lucca can be seen. The credits show Nu and Mamo parodying scenes from the game.Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar. Production I.G. July 31, 1996. The anime was followed by a manga series of the same name published in V Jump starting in 1996. The series follows Mamo and Nu, who are joined by Johnny and Spekkio (in the form of a frog), as they continue their adventure through time. They meet various characters from Chrono Trigger along the way, including Masamune, Lavos, Gaspar, Ozzie, Slash and Flea. In 1998, the chapters of the series were released as a tank≈çbon.  Music  The music of the Chrono series was mainly composed by Yasunori Mitsuda. Chrono Trigger was the first game for which he had served as composer. However, after Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu was brought onto the project to compose ten songs. At the time of the game's release, the quantity of its tracks and sound effects were unprecedented. Additionally, a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called The Brink of Time was also released. Mitsuda went on to compose the soundtrack for Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H≈çseki, which was never commercially released as an album. In 1999, Yasunori Mitsuda, now a freelance composer, returned to score the soundtrack for Chrono Cross after being contacted by Masato Kato. Mitsuda decided to center his work around old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music. Xenogears contributor Tomohiko Kira played guitar on the beginning and ending themes. Noriko Mitose, as selected by Masato Kato, sang the ending song, \\"Radical Dreamers ~ Le Tr√©sor Interdit\\". Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned. Certain songs were ported from the score of Radical Dreamers, while other entries in the soundtrack contain leitmotifs from both Chrono Trigger and Radical Dreamers. In 2006, Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the Chrono series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross main themes, as well as \\"Frog's Theme\\", and \\"To Far Away Times\\".  Reception  The Chrono series has been very successful in game rankings and sales. Chrono Trigger sold more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 abroad, reaching two million in sales in only two months. It ended 1995 as the third best-selling game of the year behind Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation and Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest in Japan. The game was met with substantial success upon release in North America, and its rerelease on the PlayStation as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles package topped the NPD TRSTS PlayStation sales charts for over six weeks. The Chrono Trigger DS remake has shipped 490,000 copies in Japan and 220,000 in North America as of December 2008. Chrono Cross also sold well, shipping 850,000 and 650,000 units in Japan and abroad respectively. It was re-released once in the United States as a Greatest Hits title and again as part of the Japanese Ultimate Hits series. Chrono Trigger has placed highly on all six of multimedia website IGN's \\"top 100 games of all time\\" lists‚Äî4th in 2002, 6th in early 2005, 13th in late 2005, 2nd in 2006, 18th in 2007, and 2nd in 2008. GameSpot included Chrono Trigger in \\"The Greatest Games of All Time\\" list released in April 2006, and it also appeared as 28th on an \\"All Time Top 100\\" list in a poll conducted by Japanese magazine Famitsu. Nintendo Power's 100th issue placed it eighteenth on their \\"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\\", and in their twentieth anniversary issue named it the fifth best Super NES game. Chrono Cross was also well-received by reviewers; GameSpot awarded the game a perfect 10, one of only seven games in over 40,000 games listed on Gamespot to have been given the score, and its Console Game of the Year Award for 2000. IGN gave the game a score of 9.7, and Cross appeared 89th in its 2008 Top 100 games list. The music of the series has been very highly regarded and enjoyed wide popularity. IGN termed the Chrono Trigger soundtrack \\"one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced\\" and said that the music was a large part of the game's ability to \\"capture the emotions of the player\\". It furthermore called the soundtrack \\"some of the most memorable tunes in RPG history\\". The game itself won the \\"Best Music in a Cartridge- Based Game\\" award in Electronic Gaming Monthly's 1995 video game awards. The soundtrack for Chrono Cross won the Gold Prize for Sonys PlayStation Awards of 2000. IGN, in their review of the game, termed the soundtrack \\"a brilliant score\\" that \\"does wonders in stirring the emotional strings of the players as they're playing through the game\\". In a separate piece about Japanese RPG composers, IGN named Yasunori Mitsuda the second best out of ten behind Nobuo Uematsu.

Mason came from a distinguished New York family. He was the son of Theodorus Bailey Myers, who was a lawyer and served as a colonel in the United States Army during the Civil War; his uncle, Rear Adm. Theodorus Bailey, served under Admiral David Farragut in New Orleans. He adopted the last name Mason in deference to his maternal grandfather Sidney Mason, who had no male heirs to carry on the family name. A graduate of the United States Naval Academy in 1868, Mason was a distinguished linguist with an inquisitive mind, qualities that gave him respect and recognition in the Navy. After a stint in the Hydrographic Office, he travelled extensively in Europe and South America as a naval observer collecting ideas on naval intelligence systems; he knew what information was available and how to obtain it. He recognized that in order for the Navy to compete with its European counterparts, research in naval science and technology should be encouraged; as part of this objective, a unified intelligence agency was needed to gather information on foreign developments for proper dissemination and coordination with the different Bureaus. He made these recommendations upon the request of Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt. Hunt read and agreed with most of Lt. Mason's recommendations, and consequently issued General Order No. 292 on March 23, 1882, establishing the Office of Naval Intelligence as part of the Bureau of Navigation, with Mason himself as its first \\"Chief Intelligence Officer\\". He assumed this post in June 1882. The Office was initially assigned to a small office in the State, War and Navy Building (now the Old Executive Office Building). Despite initial difficulties, the different Bureaus recognized its value and used it to share information amongst themselves and used this information in justifying funds needed for Navy expansion and modernization. Mason clearly guided the ONI well during its first years, and was succeeded by Lt. Raymond P. Rodgers in April 1885. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in January 1894, and retired from the Navy in December due to ill health. He died in Saugerties on 15 October 1899 and was interred in the Mason family mausoleum at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, NY.Find a Grave In The War of the Pacific Coast of South America Between Chile and the Allied Republics of Peru and Bolivia, Mason wrote one such account in which he described the belligerents of the Atacama border dispute. As stated above, he was resourceful and reports that the material used for the paper was derived from personal observation, from apparently authentic publications, and from other Naval officers within the region at the time of the conflict. Mason's work is a chronology of events leading up to, during, and the outcome of the War of the Pacific. Personal life In 1875, Mason married Edmonia Taylor Phelps (February 1, 1858 ‚Äì July 10, 1909), daughter of Rear Admiral Thomas S. Phelps.

Until 1983, the station had an active signal box and served as a terminus for some trains to/from Manchester. The station is unusual for the line in that its platform one, where the main station building and ticket office is sited, is on the side for trains bound for Buxton, whereas platform two serves trains to Manchester. The platform is on a tight curve and was some 30 cm too low for the height of the carriages used, making it difficult to access for people with mobility problems. The problem was addressed by Network Rail in 2012, who rebuilt the Buxton platform and installed an Easy Access ramp on the Manchester-bound side.\\"Whaley Bridge Station and Schedule of Works\\" Whaleybridge.com; Retrieved 19 May 2017 The station enjoys the support of the local community in the form of Friends of Whaley Bridge Station, a voluntary group dedicated to improving and maintaining the station buildings and grounds.

Manna was carried out by British RAF units, as well as squadrons from the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and Polish air forces, between 29 April and 7 May 1945. Chowhound (1‚Äì8 May) was an operation by the U.S. Army Air Forces, which dropped, together with Operation Manna, a total of over 11,000 tons, of food into the still-unliberated western part of the Netherlands, with the acquiescence of the occupying German forces, to help feed Dutch civilians in danger of starvation. After it was realised that Manna and Chowhound would be insufficient, a ground-based relief operation named Operation Faust was launched. On 2 May, 200 Allied trucks began delivering food to the city of Rhenen, behind German lines. Negotiations By early 1945, the situation was growing desperate for the three million or more Dutch still under German control. Prince Bernhard appealed directly to Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, but Eisenhower did not have the authority to negotiate a truce with the Germans. While the prince got permission from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eisenhower had Air Commodore Andrew Geddes begin planning immediately. On 23 April, authorisation was given by the Chief of Staff, George Marshall. Allied agents negotiated with Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart and a team of German officers. Among the participants were the Canadian future writer Farley Mowat and the German commander-in-chief, General Johannes Blaskowitz. It was agreed that the participating aircraft would not be fired upon within specified air corridors. Operation Manna RAF ground crew loading food supplies into slings for hoisting into the bomb bay of an Avro Lancaster heavy bomber of 514 Squadron (1945). The British operation started first. It was named after the food which was miraculously provided to the Israelites in the Book of Exodus. The planning of the operation was initially done by the Royal Air Force.Hawkins 1995, p. 277. The first of the two RAF Avro Lancasters chosen for the test flight, the morning of 29 April 1945, was nicknamed Bad Penny, as in the expression: \\"a bad penny always turns up\\". This bomber, with a crew of seven young men (five from Ontario, Canada, including pilot Robert Upcott of Windsor, Ontario), took off in bad weather despite the fact that the Germans had not yet agreed to a ceasefire. (Seyss-Inquart would do so the next day.) Bad Penny had to fly low, down to , over German guns, but succeeded in dropping her cargo and returning to her airfield. Many Thanks spelt-out on the ground in tulips after Operation Manna Operation Manna then began in earnest. British aircraft from Groups 1, 3, and 8 took part, flying 145 sorties by Mosquitoes and 3,156 sorties by Lancaster bombers, flying between them a total of 3,301 sorties. These bombers were used to dropping bombs from , but this time they had to do their job from a height of , some even flying as low as , as the cargo did not have parachutes. The drop zones, marked by Mosquitoes from 105 and 109 Squadrons using Oboe, were: Katwijk (Valkenburg airfield), The Hague (Duindigt horse race course and Ypenburg airfield), Rotterdam (Waalhaven airfield and Kralingse Plas) and Gouda. Bomber Command delivered a total of 6,680 tons of food. John Funnell, a navigator on the operation, says the food dropped was tinned food, dried food and chocolate. The idea was for people to gather and redistribute the food, but some could not resist eating straight away, which caused some people to get sick and vomit, (and some died) a result that fatty food can have in starved bodies known as Refeeding syndrome. On the other hand, distribution sometimes took as long as ten days, resulting in some getting the food only after the liberation. Nevertheless, many lives were saved, and it gave hope and the feeling that the war would soon be over. Earlier, there had been a distribution of white bread made from Swedish flour that was shipped in and baked locally. A popular myth holds that this bread was dropped from aircraft, but that is a mix-up between the two events. Also, the food was not dropped with parachutes, as is often said. Operation Chowhound On the American side, ten bomb groups of the US Third Air Division flew 2,268 sorties beginning 1 May, delivering a total of 4000 tons.Manna From Heaven- Legion Magazine, May 1, 2005, by Ted Barris 400 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the United States Army Air Forces dropped 800 tons of K-rations during 1‚Äì3 May on Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Recently published in 2015, a book Operation Chowhound is well-documented as to the statistics behind these operations (with a focus on the US side of it, befitting its title). At least one B-17 crew, that of the Stork Club from the 550th squadron received battle recognition despite having no guns for their humanitarian mission, as a result of German flak.(Tulsa, OK, USA, Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium docent personal account) Losses Three aircraft were lost: two in a collision and one due to engine fire.Vos MacDonald 2002, p. 54. Bullet holes were discovered in several aircraft upon their return, presumably the result of being fired upon by individual German soldiers. Recognition A commemorative plaque to thank the Royal Air Force for their help in mounting Operation Manna was presented in May 1980 by Dr W Scholten, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands and is displayed in the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon, England. Operation Manna Commemoration Plaque On 28 April 2007, British Air Commodore Andrew James Wray Geddes was honoured when a hiking trail in the Rotterdam district of Terbregge, the Air Commodore Geddespath, was named after him. This path goes past the Manna/Chowhound monument in the soundwall of the northern ringroad around Rotterdam. The official unveiling of the plaque was performed by Lieutenant-Commander Angus Geddes RN (son of Andrew Geddes) from England and Warrant Officer David Chiverton from Australia (grandson of Geddes).

The station is south east of Manchester Piccadilly on the Manchester to Buxton line. It also serves as an interchange with the Hope Valley Line station New Mills Central, 15 minutes' walk away across the valley. It was built in 1857 on the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway line, which in 1863 was extended by the London and North Western Railway to connect with the Cromford and High Peak Railway and run to Buxton. History In the past, New Mills Newtown had quite a substantial goods yard, including an elevated signal box of LNWR type 5/6 design, a large three-storey warehouse including basement, and a crane and wharf. These were all built by the LNWR. Recently, the last remaining evidence of this goods yard was demolished. These were the stables for what were meant to be the railway's horses, but ended up being used for many other horses in New Mills. There is also a three-span wrought- iron footbridge that connects Redmoor to its other half, the end of which has steps leading down to the children's park on Chapel Street. This is built on five brick columns: there are five columns for a three-span bridge because one end is held by the steps, the other supported by the Chalkers Snooker Club embankment. The others are in close alignment holding an otherwise flimsy thin iron bridge.

He is the third known physically disabled athlete to have competed in the Olympic Games after George Eyser in 1904 and Oliv√©r Halassy in 1928, followed by Liz Hartel in 1952, Neroli Fairhall in 1984 and Oscar Pistorius in 2012. Tak√°cs was born in Budapest and joined the Hungarian Army. By 1936, he was a world-class pistol shooter, but he was denied a place in the Hungarian shooting team for the 1936 Summer Olympics on the grounds that he was a sergeant, and only commissioned officers were allowed to compete. This prohibition was lifted in Hungary after the Berlin Games, and Tak√°cs had expectations of success at the 1940 Summer Olympics, scheduled to be held in Tokyo. During army training in 1938, his right hand was badly injured when a faulty grenade exploded. Tak√°cs was determined to continue his shooting career, and switched to shooting with his left hand. He practiced in secret, surprising his countrymen when he won the Hungarian national pistol shooting championship in the spring of 1939. He also was a member of the Hungarian team that won the 1939 UIT World Shooting Championships in the event. The Olympic Games scheduled for 1940 and 1944 were canceled due to the Second World War. Howver, Tak√°cs surprised the world by winning the gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, aged 38, beating the favourite, Argentine Carlos Enrique D√≠az S√°enz Valiente, the reigning world champion. Valiente had approached Tak√°cs before the event and had asked him what was he doing there (having heard about his accident). His reply was that he was there to learn, setting a world record. Valiente later congratulated him, saying you have learned enough. Tak√°cs won a second gold medal in the same event at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. After the match, Valiente congratulated him again and said \\"you have learned more than enough now it's time to teach me\\". Tak√°cs also attended the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, but finished eighth and failed to win a third medal.Profile from Magyar Olimpiai Bizotts√°g (in Hungarian) His story has given him a place among the \\"Olympic heroes\\" of the International Olympic Committee. Two Olympic gold medals were won by J√≥zef Zapƒôdzki (Mexico 1968 and Munich 1972) as well but not until Ralf Schumann's third victory in the 2004 Olympics did a shooter succeed in winning three gold medals in this event. Although most associated with the rapid fire pistol, Tak√°cs also won a bronze medal at the 1958 ISSF World Shooting Championships in 25 metre center-fire pistol. He also won 35 Hungarian national shooting championships. After his shooting career, Tak√°cs became a coach. He trained Hungarian Szil√°rd Kun, who won the silver medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics. He ended his army career as a lieutenant colonel.

History In 1868, Maj. Benjamin F. Ficklin bought from John O. Meusebach on the South Concho near the spring from which Fort Concho hauled its drinking water. There, Ficklin built headquarters for his San Antonio-El Paso mail line. Francis Corbett Taylor, a close friend of Ficklin's, came from Alabama to take charge of the Concho mail station. After Ficklin's sudden death in Washington, DC, on March 10, 1871, Taylor carried on the prospering stage line. In 1873, with William Stephen Kelly and Charles B. Metcalfe, he laid out a town a mile up the river and named it Ben Ficklin in honor of his friend. Kelly, also from Alabama, built the first house. The post office was established on August 27, 1873, with Henry M. Taylor as postmaster. Taylor and Kelly were among the commissioners appointed to organize Tom Green County in 1874. In January 1875, they led a successful campaign to make Ben Ficklin the county seat, against the stiff challenge of San Angela (now San Angelo). Taylor had the support of stage line employees, Fort Concho officers, area ranchmen, and the growing numbers of business and professional men, who with their families, had been attracted to the new town. San Angela's saloons, gambling houses, and prostitutes were popular with soldiers, cowboys, and buffalo hunters. Ben Ficklin's first courthouse was donated by Taylor and Sheriff James Spears. An adobe building housed a subscription school, and lots were donated for future church buildings. Three stores and a hotel were soon erected. Around 600 people were living in Ben Ficklin when Taylor died in 1879. A two-story stone courthouse was completed in February 1882. =Ben Ficklin flood= Heavy rains the night of August 23, 1882, swelled Dove Creek, Spring Creek, the Middle Concho River, and the South Concho River, already high because of a wet summer, out of their banks. Their combined waters roared down on Ben Ficklin at midmorning on August 24, and the town was destroyed. On the flat, only the courthouse, the jail, and two houses remained standing. Up the hill, 15 houses and the schoolhouse remained; 65 people were drowned. County offices and the post office were moved to San Angela, which became the county seat in 1883 with the new name San Angelo. Some survivors moved to Sherwood; others found jobs and free homesites in San Angelo. Two families continued to live at Ben Ficklin, a favorite swimming and picnicking spot, into the new century. The Ben Ficklin cemetery, on a hill overlooking new residences, holds the graves of flood victims and of F. C. Taylor and his wife, reinterred there after the flood dislodged their coffins.

In July 1998, JJB bought its largest domestic competitor Sports Division. The acquisition made JJB one of the largest sports retailers in the United Kingdom, focusing on sports clothing rather than sports equipment. It had got to a sales total of ¬£372.97 million (US$636.60 million) in 1999. In July 2002, it had also opened a new branch in Amsterdam. In October 2002, Duncan Sharpe, chief executive of JJB Sports, committed suicide. Mr Sharpe had been with the company for nineteen years, and was the son in law of the chairman, Dave Whelan. By 2005, JJB had expanded to stores over 430 throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. On 8 June 2007, Mr Whelan sold his residual 29% stake in the firm for ¬£190 million to Icelandic financial group Exista and Chris Ronnie, a sports retailer who previously worked at Umbro and Sports Direct.JJB founder David Whelan sells up, BBC News, 8 June 2007 On 19 October 2007, JJB bought a stake of 10.1% in Umbro, in an move to protect its stake in the market for shirts of England Football. This stake was sold in its entirety to Nike in March 2008. In December 2007, JJB announced that they had purchased the Original Shoe Company for ¬£5 million. JJB considered converting some of the smaller JJB High Street stores into OSC stores, keeping OSC as a separate division of the JJB group which would share JJB's buying, financing and marketing functions. In September 2008, JJB released a less than impressive set of interim results, which included a warning from the auditors raising doubts over JJB's future as a going concern. In October 2008, the value of JJB shares fell to less than 10% of the value, at the time of Dave Whelan's share sale to Chris Ronnie and Exista. This was partly in response to the interim financial report, and also as a result of Coface removing credit insurance. This was from debts owed by JJB to their suppliers.JJB Sports under pressure as insurers pull plug, The Daily Telegraph Three weeks later, a 34% share was purchased by Sports Direct. On 10 February 2009, JJB put their Qube and Original Shoe Company subsidiaries into administration, after failing to find a buyer.

It was reported that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was to lose millions of dollars from this outcome, following its investment in JJB Sports in 2009.Gates Foundation to lose millions in JJB Sports investment Business Journal, 24 September 2012 On 1 October 2012, it was announced that rival retailer Sports Direct had purchased the 'JJB' brand name, website and 20 stores, saving around 550 jobs. However, the remaining 160 stores were to close, resulting in 2,200 redundancies. JJB Sports was officially dissolved, with debts of ¬£150 million on 9 November 2012. There were a total of 5,000 employees at its closure. =Legal issues= On 13 October 2009, JJB admitted that former executives were being investigated by both HM Revenue & Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The former boss of both Next and JJB Sports, Sir David Jones, was charged in February 2013, over allegations of forgery and making misleading statements to the market while he was executive chairman of JJB Sports, concerning an earlier ¬£150 million loan. He was the man who helped to turn the clothes retailer Next into one of Britain's largest retailers. Brands In an effort to distance themselves from the majority \\"own branded\\" offering of main competitor Sports Direct, JJB's stock package mainly comprised products from the main sportswear suppliers, such as Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Reebok. However, JJB did operate its own brands, including 'Patrick' (menswear and football accessories), and 'Olympus' (womenswear and fitness accessories). Marketing JJB Sports launched their shopping site, JJB Sports Store, with a view to expanding their market. The majority shareholder of JJB Sports Plc was Dave Whelan, but his 99% stake was sold off. JJB no longer operated the famous \\"Soccerdomes\\", nor any gyms or Fitness Clubs outside Ireland. Also, because of Dave Whelan's purchase of the Fitness Club, and founding of DW Sports Fitness in September 2009, JJB has lost its association with Wigan Athletic FC and Wigan Warriors RLFC. The stadium previously sponsored by the company has since been renamed the DW Sports Stadium. On 7 September 2011, JJB Sports launched a new major marketing campaign entitled \\"Ready?\\". The campaign involves prime time television advertising, national press coverage, in store promotions, and online competitions. The Ready campaign was JJB Sport's first appearance on television for over four years, and represented the company's desire to become profitable again.

He was a partner, along with Alexander Majors and William B. Waddell, in the freighting firm Russell, Majors, and Waddell and the stagecoach company the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company which was the parent company of the Pony Express. His public life is one of numerous business ventures, some successful and some failed. While Russell, described as a good- looking man, lived the majority of his life on the edge on the western frontier, he was always more at home in the upper-class settings of the East coast. Early life Russell was born in Burlington, Vermont on January 31, 1812. In the early 1820s, he moved as a child with his family to western Missouri. In 1826, at the age of 16 and with little formal education, he began work at the Ely & Curtis general store in Liberty, Missouri. Two years later, in 1830, he began working for the mercantile firm of James Aull and Samuel Ringo, where he learned the wholesale business. Marriage and family In 1835 he married Harriet Elliot Warder, whose social standing helped his. Early business ventures In 1837 at the age of 25, Russell left the Aull and Ringo firm to strike out on his own. He helped to organize the Lexington First Addition Company in 1840 with his future partner, William B. Waddell. In 1844, using borrowed money, Russell and James H. Bullard created the partnership of Bullard & Russell to open a general store. This partnership soon welcomed an additional partner in E.C. McCarty and expanded to shipping goods to Santa Fe, New Mexico. He then went on to become a partner in the established firm of Waddell, Ramsey & Co. While some of these early business ventures ended in failure, by 1848, Russell was successful enough to build a 20-room mansion in Lexington, Missouri. In 1850, in partnership with James Brown, and John S. Jones, Russell entered the military freighting business. This partnership dissolved soon after the death of Brown in 1850. In 1852, he re-partnered with William B. Waddell to form a mercantile firm; by 1854 they were freighting military supplies to Santa Fe. The Pony Express On December 28, 1854 Alexander Majors joined Russell and Waddell to form the corporation of Russell, Majors, and Waddell. This firm obtained a consolidated contract with the War Department to supply the majority of military forts west of the Missouri River. Acting as the firm's representative in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City, Russell lobbied for contracts with the War Department as well as for financing from banks and other sources. With a virtual monopoly on all western freighting contracting Russell, Majors, and Waddell became the largest freighting company in western Missouri. In July 1858, the Pike's Peak Gold Rush started when Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small amount of gold in Colorado. William Russell was in Leavenworth, Kansas when he heard the news. Believing that this gold rush was the start of heavy emigration to the region, Russell, together with his former partner John S. Jones, gathered new investors, borrowed money, and organized a stage and express line to run to Denver. The new service was called the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company and transported \\"passengers, mail, freight, and gold\\" to and from the Pike's Peak area on a trail between the Republican and Smoky Hill forks of the Kansas River. To help finance their venture, Russell and Jones wanted to secure a contract to deliver mail for the United States government and on May 11, 1859 they purchased Hockaday & Company the firm that owned the postal contract between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Salt Lake City. The postal contract ran until November 1860 and had been profitable until the post office reduced the frequency of trips and payments for delivery. After consolidating the two companies, Russell and Jones redirected their Denver coaches to Hockaday's more northern route, having run on their original route for less than six weeks. The firm constructed new stations along the route, sixteen to forty miles apart. The construction of the new stations and the abandonment of the stations on the original route were a financial burden on the company. By the fall of 1859 the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company's creditors were owed more than $525,000 and the debts were threatening to collapse the firm. Russell had not partner with Alexander Majors or William Waddell in the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company; they thought it was too early to know whether the emigration would be sustained or merely a passing fad. That, however, did not stop Russell from using the reputation of Russell, Majors, and Waddell to secure credit for the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company. This put a strain on the relationship of the three men. Nevertheless, Majors and Waddell knew that if the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company failed, it could bring down Russell, Majors, and Waddell as well. On October 28, 1859 the three men entered into a new partnership which assumed the assets and debts of the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company. Less than a month later, and likely without consulting his partners, Russell named the new firm the Central Overland California & Pike's Peak Express Company or C.O.C. & P.P Express Co. The new name reflected his hope of securing a daily mail route to California along a central route through the Rocky Mountains. (The Southern Route traveled from St. Louis, Missouri through El Paso, Texas to San Francisco, California.) Russell headed back to New York in December to raise funds and hold off creditors. On January 27, 1860, he wrote his son: \\"Have determined to establish a Pony Express to Sacramento, California, commencing 3rd of April. Time ten days.\\" Under charter from the Kansas legislature, the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company started the Pony Express which began operations on April 3, 1860. By utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they established a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many at the time said was impossible. Russell, Majors, and Waddell had hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract to continue running the Pony Express, but that did not come about and the business venture proved to be a failure, losing upwards of $1,000 a day. By October 1861, the Pony Express was out of business due to the completion of the telegraph lines and the unwillingness of the national government to provide further funding. In attempting to secure funding to continue running the Pony Express, Russell became mixed up in a scandal involving Secretary of War John Buchanan Floyd and Godard Bailey, a clerk for the Department of Interior. In 1857 Secretary Floyd had personally guaranteed payment for a government contract that Congress had not paid. Russell, Majors, and Waddell used this guarantee to secure a line of credit but the failure of the Pony Express now threatened to bankrupt the firm. Bailey, perhaps fearing that Floyd, as a guarantor of some of Russell, Majors, and Waddell's debt, would be forced to resign if the firm went bankrupt, agreed to help Russell raise money. Through a series of illegal transactions, money was obtained from the Indian Trust Fund. However, on December 1, 1860, Bailey confessed to Floyd and was arrested and brought to trial along with Russell. The outbreak of the American Civil War saved the men from prosecution and they were freed on a technicality. But the bond scandal had ruined the reputation of Russell, Majors, and Waddell and their freighting firm soon collapsed into bankruptcy. Later years Deep in debt and without his previous social connections, Russell attempted to regain his fortunes in a Colorado gold mining venture that resulted in failure. His assets were sold in April 1865 to pay off creditors. He went to a brokerage partnership with Thomas P. Akers in New York, a venture that also failed. Due to failing health he returned to Missouri to live first with his daughter in St. Louis and then with his son in Palmyra where he died September 10, 1872, at age 60.

It centered on Lawrence, Kansas, and the Wakarusa River Valley.  Background  After being arrested by Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, Jacob Branson was rescued by Free-Staters, led by Samuel Newitt Wood (pictured). While pro- and anti-slavery settlers had held negative opinions of one another for some time, the genesis of the Wakarusa War in particular dates to November 21, 1855, when the pro-slavery settler Franklin Coleman shot the Free-Stater Charles Dow nine times in the back, killing him. The murder was the culmination of a long-simmering feud between the two, as for some time they had argued about a land claim near Hickory Point, located about south of Lawrence. According to the Border War Encyclopedia, \\"Politics had not motivated Coleman to kill Dow, but the murder marked the genesis of the violent political divisions that characterized Kansas for the next 10 years.\\" Coleman argued that he had been acting in self-defense when he killed Dow, and so when Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones investigated, he chose to arrest Dow's Free-State affiliate, Jacob Branson, for disturbing the peace. Branson, however, was eventually rescued by Free-Staters, led by Samuel Newitt Wood, which caused the pro-slavery faction to seethe with anger. Within a matter of days, the governor of the Kansas Territory, Wilson Shannon, called for the Kansas militia to settle the issue; Shannon had intended for the militia to be composed of Kansans, but Jones rallied a small army of 1,500 men, almost all of whom were from Missouri. This group, led by Jones, crossed the Kansas border and made their way to Lawrence, preparing to eradicate the Free-Staters.  Siege  The grave marker of abolitionist Thomas Barber in Pioneer Cemetery, Lawrence, KS (2018). Barber's death inspired the poet John Greenleaf Whittier to write a poem titled Burial of Barber. During the siege, the main body of the invaders were encamped near the small pro-slavery settlement Franklin, located to the southeast of Lawrence, although others camped near the territorial capital of Lecompton. The invading army was indifferently armed as a whole, but some men had broken into the United States Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri and stolen guns, cutlasses, the \\"Old Sacramento Cannon\\" (which would later be used during the Sacking of Lawrence in 1856), and other munitions of war. Hearing of the impending raid, the men of Lawrence raised up a militia of 800 men. Dr. Charles L. Robinson (an agent of the New England Emigrant Aid Company) was put in charge of the city's troops, and the future state senator James Lane was appointed as his second-in-command. Lawrence was also aided by the abolitionist John Brown and his sons. After about a week, the Free-Staters eventually sent an emissary to Shannon, who was briefed in regards to the situation. The news distressed him, so he journeyed to Lawrence to see the situation for himself and was quite startled by what he saw. He immediately called representatives from the Missouri army and Lawrence militia before him and urged them to sign a peace treaty. Such an agreement was finally made in December 1855 between Robinson and Lane (who represented the Free-Staters) and David Rice Atchison (who represented the pro-slavers). After much persuasion (which, according to Frank W. Blackmar, \\"was not easily accomplished\\"), the Missouri army reluctantly left the area. Aside from Dow, the Wakarusa War claimed only one other life: that of Free State settler and abolitionist Thomas Barber, who, on his way to the defense of Lawrence, had been shot by the Pottawatomi Indian Agent George W. Clarke during an ambush. Barber's death was memorialized in a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier titled Burial of Barber.

Waddell founded the Pony Express, based in St. Joseph, Missouri. In about 1860, their freight firm, now known as \\"Russell, Majors and Waddell,\\" formed the \\"Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company\\" to get the federal contract to deliver mail between Missouri and California. It had previously been held by Butterfield Overland Mail, which delivered the mail in 25 days or more over a route that went through the South. With sectional tensions on the rise, Majors and his colleagues proposed to deliver the mail over a central route through Salt Lake City, Utah and proposed doing it in 10 days via a horse relay called the Pony Express. Even though they succeeded in making the deliveries, they did not get the contract. They went bankrupt after the Transcontinental Telegraph opened in October 1861, as its competition eliminated the need for some mail service. He provided rail ties for the crews of the Union Pacific Railroad working on the First Transcontinental Railroad. After the railroad was completed, he continued to haul freight to towns not yet served by the railroad. Early life and education Alexander Majors was born October 4, 1814, in Franklin, Kentucky. Overland freight Alexander Majors (left) is honored with Kansas City \\"father\\" John Calvin McCoy and Mountainman James Bridger at Pioneer Square in Westport in Kansas City. In 1848 Alexander Majors started hauling overland freight on the Santa Fe Trail. On his first trip, he set a new time record of 92 days for the 1564-mile (2500 km) round trip. Eventually he employed 4,000 men, including a 15-year-old lad named Billy Cody, later known as Buffalo Bill. Cody became one of his most famous Pony Express riders. in 1853 Majors was awarded contracts to haul supplies to United States Army posts along the Santa Fe Trail. Majors helped establish the Kansas City stockyards, which became a center of shipping beef to the East Coast and Midwest. In 1854 he teamed up with William B. Waddell and William Hepburn Russell. Majors was responsible for the freighting part of the business, Waddell was to manage the office, and Russell was to use his Washington DC contacts to acquire new contracts. Waddell chose be a silent partner, so the firm was initially called \\"Majors and Russell\\". In the 1850s their firm Russell, Majors and Waddell and the short-lived Pony Express were major businesses, contributing to the growth of Kansas City. Majors' Overland Stage Company was part of a wide network that reached into the frontier West. Fifteen years later, it was all over. On the Missouri side of State Line at 81st Street, Majors built his two-story frame farmhouse in 1855. (His house is now operated as a museum.) There, wagon trains loaded with goods from his warehouse down on the river headed west. In Westport, Majors operated a meat- packing plant. It supplied the trains with cured pork, soap and candles. For 15 years Majors and his far-flung interests were highly successful. In 1860 his Pony Express began. But by then, technology was already threatening. Telegraphs and railroads were a reality. The telegraph spelled doom for Pony Express, and the \\"great iron horse\\" killed Majors' freighting and stage coach operations in time. By 1865 Majors sold out what little remained and moved to Colorado. There, 30 years later, his former young wagonmaster and Pony Express rider, William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, found him. He was old, ill and penniless. Cody helped him, taking Majors on as part of the Cody Wild West show. Majors lived at Cody's Scouts' Rest Ranch in North Platte, Nebraska for a time. Majors died in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, on January 13, 1900, aged 85, and is buried in Union Cemetery in Kansas City, MO.

This leads to a reduction in fitness for both individuals, but the most fit individual survives and is able to reproduce. By contrast, interspecific competition occurs when members of different species compete for a shared resource. Members of the same species have rather similar requirements for resources, whereas different species have a smaller contested resource overlap, resulting in intraspecific competition generally being a stronger force than interspecific competition. Individuals can compete for food, water, space, light, mates or any other resource which is required for survival or reproduction. The resource must be limited for competition to occur; if every member of the species can obtain a sufficient amount of every resource then individuals do not compete and the population grows exponentially. Prolonged exponential growth is rare in nature because resources are finite and so not every individual in a population can survive, leading to intraspecific competition for the scarce resources. When resources are limited, an increase in population size reduces the quantity of resources available for each individual, reducing the per capita fitness in the population. As a result, the growth rate of a population slows as intraspecific competition becomes more intense, making it a negatively density dependent process. The falling population growth rate as population increases can be modelled effectively with the logistic growth model. The rate of change of population density eventually falls to zero, the point ecologists have termed the carrying capacity (K). However, a population can only grow to a very limited number within an environment. The carrying capacity, defined by the variable k, of an environment is the maximum number of individuals or species an environment can sustain and support over a longer period of time. The resources within an environment are limited, and are not endless. An environment can only support a certain number of individuals before its resources completely diminish. Numbers larger than this will suffer a negative population growth until eventually reaching the carrying capacity, whereas populations smaller than the carrying capacity will grow until they reach it. Intraspecific competition does not just involve direct interactions between members of the same species (such as male deer locking horns when competing for mates) but can also include indirect interactions where an individual depletes a shared resource (such as a grizzly bear catching a salmon that can then no longer be eaten by bears at different points along a river). The way in which resources are partitioned by organisms also varies and can be split into scramble and contest competition. Scramble competition involves a relatively even distribution of resources among a population as all individuals exploit a common resource pool. In contrast, contest competition is the uneven distribution of resources and occurs when hierarchies in a population influence the amount of resource each individual receives. Organisms in the most prized territories or at the top of the hierarchies obtain a sufficient quantity of the resources, whereas individuals without a territory don‚Äôt obtain any of the resource. MechanismsDirect= Interference competition is the process by which individuals directly compete with one another in pursuit of a resource. It can involve fighting, stealing or ritualised combat. Direct intraspecific competition also includes animals claiming a territory which then excludes other animals from entering the area. There may not be an actual conflict between the two competitors, but the animal excluded from the territory suffers a fitness loss due to a reduced foraging area and is unable to enter the area as it risks confrontation from a more dominant member of the population. As organisms are encountering each other during interference competition, they are able to evolve behavioural strategies and morphologies to out-compete rivals in their population. Flamingos competing via interference competition, potentially for territories, mates or food. For example, different populations of the northern slimy salamander (Plethodon glutinosus) have evolved varying levels of aggression depending on the intensity of intraspecific competition. In populations where the resources are scarcer, more aggressive behaviours are likely to evolve. It is a more effective strategy to fight rivals within the species harder instead of searching for other options due to the lack of available food. More aggressive salamanders are more likely obtain the resources they require to reproduce whereas timid salamanders may starve before reproducing, so aggression can spread through the population. In addition, a study on Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) found that birds in a bond were much more aggressive than single birds. The paired birds were significantly more likely to start an agonistic encounter in defense of their mate or young whereas single birds were typically non-breeding and less likely to fight. Not all flamingos can mate in the population because of an unsuitable sex ratio or some dominant flamingos mating with multiple partners. Mates are a fiercely contested resource in many species as the production of offspring is essential for an individual to propagate its genes. =Indirect= Organisms can compete indirectly, either via exploitative or apparent competition. Exploitative competition involves individuals depleting a shared resource and both suffering a loss in fitness as a result. The organisms may not actually come into contact and only interact via the shared resource indirectly. For instance, exploitative competition has been shown experimentally between juvenile wolf spiders (Schizocosa ocreata). Both increasing the density of young spiders and reducing the available food supply lowered the growth of individual spiders. Food is clearly a limiting resource for the wolf spiders but there was no direct competition between juveniles for food, just a reduction in fitness due to the increased population density. The negative density dependence in young wolf spiders is evident: as the population density increases further, growth rates continues to fall and could potentially reach zero (as predicted by the logistic growth model). This is also seen in Viviparous lizard, or Lacerta vivipara, where the existence of color morphs within a population depends on the density and intraspecific competition. In stationary organisms, such as plants, exploitative competition plays a much larger role than interference competition because individuals are rooted to a specific area and utilise resources in their immediate surroundings. Saplings will compete for light, most of which will be blocked and utilised by taller trees. The saplings can be easily out-competed by larger members of their own species, which is one of the reasons why seed dispersal distances can be so large. Seeds that germinate in close proximity to the parents are very likely to be out-competed and die. Apparent competition occurs in populations that are predated upon. An increase in population of the prey species will bring more predators to the area, which increases the risk of an individual being eaten and hence lowers its survivorship. Like exploitative competition, the individuals aren‚Äôt interacting directly but rather suffer a reduction in fitness as a consequence of the increasing population size. Apparent competition is generally associated with inter rather than intraspecific competition, whereby two different species share a common predator. An adaptation that makes one species less likely to be eaten results in a reduction in fitness for the other prey species because the predator species hunts more intensely as food has become more difficult to obtain. For example, native skinks (Oligosoma) in New Zealand suffered a large decline in population after the introduction of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Both species are eaten by ferrets (Mustela furo) so the introduction of rabbits resulted in immigration of ferrets to the area, which then depleted skink numbers. Resource partitioningContest= Contest competition takes place when a resource is associated with a territory or hierarchical structure within the population. For instance: white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) have different energy intakes based on their ranking within the group. Both males and females compete for territories with the best access to food and the most successful monkeys are able to obtain a disproportionately large quantity of food and therefore have a higher fitness in comparison to the subordinate members of the group. In the case of Ctenophorus pictus lizards, males compete for territory. Among the polymorphic variants, red lizards have are more aggressive in defending their territory compared to their yellow counterparts. Aggressive encounters are potentially costly for individuals as they can get injured and be less able to reproduce. As a result, many species have evolved forms of ritualised combat to determine who wins access to a resource without having to undertake a dangerous fight. Male adders (Vipera berus) undertake complex ritualised confrontations when courting females. Generally, the larger male will win and fights rarely escalate to injury to either combatant. However, sometimes the resource may be so prized that potentially fatal confrontations can occur to acquire them. Male elephant seals, Mirounga augustirostris, engage in fierce competitive displays in an attempt to control a large harem of females with which to mate. The distribution of females and subsequent reproductive success is very uneven between males. The reproductive success of most males is zero; they die before breeding age or are prevented from mating by higher ranked males. In addition, just a few dominant males account for the majority of copulations. The potential reproductive success for males is so great that many are killed before breeding age as they attempt to move up the hierarchy in their population. Contest competition produces relatively stable population dynamics. The uneven distribution of resources results in some individuals dying off but helps to ensure that the members of the population that hold a territory can reproduce. As the number of territories in an area stays the same over time, the breeding population remains constant which produces a similar number of new individuals every breeding season. =Scramble= Scramble competition involves a more equal distribution of resources than contest competition and occurs when there is a common resource pool that an individual cannot be excluded from. For instance, grazing animals compete more strongly for grass as their population grows and food becomes a limiting resource. Each herbivore receives less food as more individuals compete for the same quantity of food. Scramble completion can lead to unstable population dynamics, the equal division of resources can result in very few of the organisms obtaining enough to survive and reproduce and this can cause population crashes. This phenomenon is called overcompensation. For instance, the caterpillars of cinnabar moths feed via scramble competition, and when there are too many caterpillars competing very few are able to pupate and there is a large population crash. Subsequently, very few cinnabar moths are competing intraspecifically in the next generation so the population grows rapidly before crashing again. Consequences of intraspecific competitionSlowed growth rates= Exponential human population growth in the last 1,000 years. The major impact of intraspecific competition is reduced population growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, intraspecific competition does not occur and populations can grow exponentially. Exponential population growth is exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew exponentially in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place. {dN(t)\\\\over dt}=r N(t) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{N(t)}{K}\\\\right). dN(t)/dt = rate of change of population density N(t) = population size at time t r = per capita growth rate K = carrying capacity Population growth against time in a population growing logistically. The steepest parts of the graph are where the population growth is most rapid. The logistic growth equation is an effective tool for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, and has been used to model many real biological systems. At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the main determinant for population growth is just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the logistic equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density. The logistic growth curve is initially very similar to the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because the population is as large as possible based on the resources available. Experiments on Daphnia growth rates showed a striking adherence to the logistic growth curve. The inflexion point in the Daphnia population density graph occurred at half the carrying capacity, as predicted by the logistic growth model. Gause‚Äôs 1930s lab experiments showed logistic growth in microorganisms. Populations of yeast grown in test tubes initially grew exponentially. But as resources became scarcer, their growth rates slowed until reaching the carrying capacity. If the populations were moved to a larger container with more resources they would continue to grow until reaching their new carrying capacity. The shape of their growth can be modeled very effectively with the logistic growth model.

As a partner at Kapor Capital and the Kapor Center for Social Impact, she is known for efforts to diversify the technology workforce through activism and investments. Her 2007 book Giving Notice: Why the Best and the Brightest Leave the Workplace and How You Can Help Them Stay examines the reasons people have for leaving corporate America as well as the human and financial cost. Klein first became a victims advocate in the 1970s. During this time, she noticed a widespread denial of the prevalence of sexual harassment and compared it to the silence surrounding rape that she had seen six years earlier. Kapor Klein's association with technology companies began when she started working for Lotus Software in 1984. In 2015, Benjamin Jealous called her \\"the moral center of Silicon Valley and an O.G. in technology\\". Early life and education Klein was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1952 and grew up in the San Fernando Valley with two older siblings. Her father was a chemical engineer attending medical school. Her mother was one of the few survivors of a Jewish family who fled Russia to escape pogroms. When applying to universities, Klein looked for places where there were high levels of student activism. Studying at the University of California, Berkeley, she volunteered at a rape crisis center and later interviewed rapists who were in prison. She graduated from Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in criminology in 1974 and founded the Alliance Against Sexual Coercion in 1976. This is considered to be the first organization in the United States to focus on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace. In 1984, Klein received a Ph.D. in social policy and research from the Heller School for Social Policy and Management of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts with a Social Science Research Council fellowship for the study of sexual harassment in federal government employment. Career After receiving her first degree, Klein was a writer for the newsletter for the women's organization Feminist Alliance Against Rape. Kapor Klein joined Lotus Development Corporation in 1984, when Lotus 1-2-3 was widely recognized as the killer app which made computers ubiquitous in business. Her position was Head of Employee Relations, Organizational Development and Management Training. A stated vision for the company was to be \\"the most progressive employer in the United States\\". In 1987, Kapor Klein founded the consulting firm Klein Associates to provide training on issues of fairness and bias reduction in work environments. Kapor Klein became a partner at Kapor Capital, which was founded in 1999. The fund, which has made a pledge to only invest in companies that prioritize diversity, focuses on products that \\"close gaps of access and opportunity\\". An example she gave was the mobile app Pigeonly which aims to bypass the high cost of phone calls in and out of the prison system. Her investment sectors include education, health, and consumer finance. Kapor Capital has been absorbed into the broader organization known as the Kapor Center for Social Impact. Another project under this umbrella is the Level Playing Field Institute, founded by Kapor Klein in 2001. Aiming to foster interest in STEM fields among underrepresented groups, the LPFI promotes computer science participation through hackathons and workshops. Some studies produced by the institute include The Tilted Playing Field and The Corporate Leaders Survey. The institute is also known for its Summer Math and Science Honors Academy (SMASH) three-summer high school program. SMASH has been described as \\"100 percent students of color\\" and has led most of them to pursue a degree in a quantitative science. Kapor Klein's for-profit and non- profit organizations, which are run from the same office, regularly contribute studies on racial and gender disparity. They have explored factors ranging from direct discrimination to attrition in the STEM pipeline. Two notable studies are an assessment of inclusion efforts at Fortune 500 manufacturing firms and a survey of bias experienced by Massachusetts physicians and medical students. Described as \\"in regular touch with the White House\\", Kapor Klein has advised the World Bank and the United Nations. She also gave input on the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In 2016, Kapor Klein, along with Erica Baker, Tracy Chou, Ellen Pao and others, founded the non-profit organization Project Include to develop customized human resources advice in consultation with startup executives. Several companies employing 25-1,000 people signed on for the program following its launch in May. Although they were initially kept anonymous, the names of the clients were announced a month later. Freada Kapor Klein is an advisor to Crossculture VC and sits on the board of the Berkeley Foundation. While serving on Berkeley's College of Letters and Science board in 2000, Kapor Klein founded the IDEAL Scholars Fund with three other board members and alumni. Designed as a response to California Proposition 209, the scholarship invests in high-caliber, underrepresented students and provides access to staff in mentor roles. In the midst of Uber's 2017 sexual harassment scandal, Kapor-Klein wrote in an open letter that as an investor in the company, she was disappointed with its under-commitment to inclusion. She criticized technology companies for making reporting difficult and said it was unfortunate that \\"Medium and Twitter have become tech's complaints channels.\\" Personal life Freada Klein met Mitch Kapor during her time at Lotus. In the 1990s, they began a relationship and eventually married. Although never calling for an outright ban, Kapor Klein is largely opposed to office romances and believes that harassment can often result when they are executed poorly. On their decision to wait, she stated \\"he was smart enough as the CEO to not hit on the person who co-founded the first group on sexual harassment in the U.S. He's very bright.\\" Kapor and Kapor Klein moved to the Bay Area in 1999 and lived in Oakland, California, with her stepson Adam and stepdaughter Molly. The couple attempted to build a large home in Berkeley, California, described as \\"akin to an office building\\" by environmental groups. They managed to obtain approval but nevertheless put the lot up for sale in 2016. Kapor Klein was on the Board of Trustees of the Summer Science Program from 2004 to 2006. Her husband, also a board member, had been a student of the program in 1966. She has challenged millennials working on diversity to inform themselves about the movement's history and learn \\"how recent and how complicated the whole issue of stereotyping and limiting opportunity\\" is.

It features a guest appearance by a young Kirsten Dunst as a young alien. It was also Lwaxana Troi's last appearance in an episode of Star Trek: Next Generation. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, while visiting the Enterprise Lwaxana Troi is preoccupied by a dark secret she has carried for years. Plot Lwaxana Troi returns to the Enterprise, this time as the teacher of an alien race, the Cairn, who are learning to speak. The Cairn's native form of communication is telepathy, but they want to learn spoken language in order to interact with other races. Lwaxana comes aboard with Ambassador Maques and his young daughter, Hedril, who is Lwaxana's star pupil. Suspecting that Lwaxana is not her usual flamboyant self, her daughter, Deanna Troi, tries to investigate. When Lwaxana starts showing signs of fatigue, she is taken to sickbay to be examined. Beverly tells Lwaxana that her interaction with the aliens is more taxing on her telepathic ability than she is used to, and is asked to refrain from contact with the Cairn until she can recover. Deanna helps her mother by verbally communicating with Maques and Hedril, but Lwaxana still uses her telepathy when they don't grasp the verbal concepts. After an incident where Hedril falls into a pool of water in the arboretum, Lwaxana falls into a coma. With no signs of physical trauma, Crusher deduces that her telepathic abilities have caused her mind to collapse in on itself from overuse. Maques uses his ability to form a bridge between Deanna and Lwaxana, and the former finds herself walking through corridors like on the Enterprise. Lwaxana's mental defenses pick up, first conjuring an image of Picard himself ordering her to sever her connection. She then creates an image of a wolf that chases Deanna through the corridor. After escaping through a door, she sees her father in a place where they once lived. She sees through all the ruses and exits back into the corridor. Lwaxana then charges after her screaming for Deanna to get away from her, causing Deanna to break her connection. Deanna and Picard search through Lwaxana's things and find several pieces of the puzzle missing; seven years of entries for a journal Lwaxana kept since being married had been erased, from shortly after her marriage until a few months after Deanna's birth. The image of Hedril in her mother's mind does not add up. She tries again to reach her mother. With the telepathic connection to her mother reestablished, Deanna sees Hedril petting the wolf, and cautions her. When she says Hedril's name, the girl asks who Hedril is. Deanna follows the girl and the wolf through the deck until she encounters a turbolift that opens into space. Hearing her mother call for help, Deanna jumps in and lands in the arboretum where Lwaxana had collapsed. Lwaxana is there, still begging Deanna to leave, but Deanna refuses, stating that a repressed memory is killing her and she must relive the memory in order to survive. Suddenly, an image of a human girl who looks like Hedril is playing by the water with a puppy, and Lwaxana calls her Kestra--her first born child, and Deanna's older sister, whom Deanna never knew she had. Deanna urges Lwaxana to relive what happened, and she tearfully remembers a tragedy when Kestra ran after the puppy when it got away, though it was unclear what had caused her death. However, the clues seem to indicate that she fell into the water and drowned. Lwaxana's repressed memory of Kestra and her resemblance to Hedril led to her coma. As Lwaxana recalls happier memories of Kestra, Deanna tells her to share them so she can learn about the sister she never knew. The women awaken in sickbay holding hands. Later, it is revealed that Mr. Homn saved mementos of Kestra, and Deanna asks her mother to tell her everything about her. Production In addition to being the last episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation to feature Lwaxana Troi, it was the first sighting of Deanna Troi's father, Ian Andrew Troi (played by Amick Byram).  Reception  The episode received a warp factor rating of 6/10 from Tor.com. A reviewer for The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, writing, \\"Dark Page is a not-too-terrible episode which nonetheless points to ... something of a theme for the seventh season: a show that‚Äôs working so hard to make an impact that the care and attention it used to put into characterization is in danger of being lost.\\" A SyFy review praised the episode's portrayal of Lwaxana and Deanna Troi's relationship, saying, \\"I will defend Dark Page forever because there aren't a lot of times Star Trek boldly tries to deal with a mother losing a child ... Lwaxana loses a daughter. She loses a husband. And then she becomes sort of transient and finds that she's the only one who even knows this other young girl ever existed. No wonder she tried to bury it. No wonder she can't.\\" TV Guide and Variety noted the young Kirsten Dunst's appearance in the episode. She gained widespread acclaim one year later in her breakout role in Interview with the Vampire and later starred in the blockbuster Spider-Man film series in the 2000s.

July 20, 1975 Pingos are intrapermafrost ice-cored hills, ranging in height from and in diameter. They are typically conical in shape and grow and persist only in permafrost environments, such as the Arctic and subarctic. A pingo is a periglacial landform, which is defined as a non-glacial landform or process linked to colder climates. It is estimated that there are more than 11,000 pingos on Earth. The Tuktoyaktuk peninsula area has the greatest concentration of pingos in the world with a total of 1,350 pingos. There are currently remarkably limited data on pingos.  History  Collapsed pingo in the Mackenzie Delta. The formerly drained lake can be outlined. August 8, 1987 In 1825, John Franklin made the earliest description of a pingo when he climbed a small pingo on Ellice Island in the Mackenzie Delta. However, it was in 1938 that the term pingo was first borrowed from the Inuvialuit by the Arctic botanist Alf Erling Porsild in his paper on Earth mounds of the western Arctic coast of Canada and Alaska. Porsild Pingo in Tuktoyaktuk is named in his honour. The term pingos, which in Inuvialuktun means conical hill, has now been accepted as a scientific term in English-language literature.  Formation  Pingos can only form in a permafrost environment. Evidence of collapsed pingos in an area suggests that there was once permafrost. = Hydrostatic pingos = Diagram showing how closed system (hydrostatic) pingos are formed Closed systems, also known as hydrostatic pingos are formed as a result of hydrostatic pressure built up within the core of pingos due to water. They occur in regions of continuous permafrost where there is an impermeable ground layer. These pingos are found in flat, poorly drained areas with limited groundwater available such as shallow lakes and river deltas. The formation of these landforms occurs when layers of permafrost generates an upwards movement of pressure, resulting in masses of confined soil freezing which push material upwards that begins to expand. The figure below illustrates this process and the changes that occur throughout the year. This type of closed system pingos is formed in an area where a lake has been infilled with sediment. This has meant that the ground is insulated, allowing liquid water to collect underneath the sediment. In winter months this sediment begins to freeze which leads to expansion of sediment, confining the water and increasing the pressure. This results in the formation of a mound due to the upwards pressure. However, during summer months the ice core of the pingo beings to melt which causes the mound to cave in. = Hydraulic pingos = Diagram showing how open system (hydraulic) pingos are formed. Hydraulic (open-system) pingos result from groundwater flowing from an outside source, i.e. sub-permafrost or intra-permafrost aquifers. Hydrostatic pressure initializes the formation of the ice core as water is pushed up and subsequently freezes. Open-system pingos have no limitations to the amount of water available unless the aquifers freeze. They often occur at the base of slopes and are commonly known as Greenland type. The groundwater is put under artesian pressure and forces the ground up as it makes an expanding ice core. It is not the artesian pressure itself that forces the ground up, but rather the ice core that is being fed the water from the aquifer. These are often formed in a thin, discontinuous permafrost. These conditions allow an ice core to form, but also provide it with a supply of artesian ground water. If water pressure entering an artesian pingo is strong enough, it can lift the pingo up allowing a sub-pingo water lens to form underneath. However, if the water lens starts to leak water it can cause subsidence which can compromise the structure. These pingos are often oval or oblong shaped. It is still not entirely understood why open system or hydraulic pingos normally occur in unglaciated terrain. Pingos usually grow only a couple of centimetres per year, with Ibyuk Pingo growing at a rate of a year,Pingo Canadian Landmark and the largest take decades or even centuries to form. The process that creates pingos is believed to be closely related to frost heaving. The base of the pingo tends to reach its maximum diameter in its early youth. This means pingos tend to grow higher rather than growing in diameter and height at the same time. The height of pingos can range anywhere from and their diameters range from . The shape of pingos in usually circular. Smaller pingos tend to have curved tops whereas larger pingos usually have collapsed mounds or craters due to the melting of exposed ice.  Locations  Greenland = The landscape of Greenland contains many pingos and other glacial landforms. In western Greenland it is estimated that there are 29 pingos, whilst in eastern Greenland it is estimated there are 71 pingos. The majority of pingos in Greenland are located within Disko Bay and Nuussuaq Peninsula within western Greenland as well as some in eastern Greenland in Mesters Vig. The thickness of the permafrost at Disko Bay is around deep, making it ideal for closed system pingos to develop. There are 20 pingos located on Disko Island, with the largest located on Kuganguaq alluvial plain at wide and high. In eastern Greenland, pingos are found in Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden. They are well known because they are the northernmost pingos of eastern Greenland. The largest of these pingos is wide and high, taking the shape of a semicircle. This pingo is still active, meaning it is increasing in elevation over time. = Canada = Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula pingos  Mackenzie delta with drained lake (foreground), ice-wedge polygons and a growing pingo The Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula is an area with a marine tundra environment on the shores of the Arctic Ocean in the Northwest Territories, Canada. This peninsula is covered in thick permafrost, which is known to be more than 50,000 years old. There are many pingos within the Pingo National Landmark area, all ranging in size and diameter. The most well known pingo in this area is Ibyuk Pingo, which is the tallest pingo in Canada. The height of this pingo is above sea level, but the pingo is still increasing in height by a few centimetres every year. This pingo is one of the younger pingos in the area, estimated at around 1,000 years old. Since about 1990, several larger pingos have started to melt out as the injection ice of the core is exposed. = Alaska = Collapsed pingo in the Mackenzie Delta with thick injection ice. The formerly drained lake can be outlined. August 8, 1987 Detail of pingo in the Mackenzie Delta with massive injection ice. August 8, 1987 Melting pingos near Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada Approximately 80% of Alaska is covered in permafrost, with 29% of this continuous permafrost, 35% discontinuous permafrost and the rest sporadic or isolated permafrost. Throughout Alaska, there are more than 1,500 known pingos with the majority being open system pingos. The height of pingos in Alaska ranges from in height and in width. The world‚Äôs tallest pingo is located in Alaska, known as the Kadleroshilik Pingo. The Kadleroshilik Pingo is in height, but is continuing to rise in elevation by a few centimetres a year. = Siberia = In Siberia, an area containing a high density of close system pingos can be found near Yakutsk located on the Lena River. In this area there are more than 500 pingos next to the Lena River. The area consists of alluvial plains areas of thick permafrost, allowing pingos to form and develop. = Central Asia = Areas of Central Asia are known to have pingos at the highest elevations in the world. For example, the Tibetan Plateau has pingos at above in elevation due to its permanently frozen terrain. This environment is perfect for pingo production, and the cold, dry permafrost along with cold temperatures deters pingo collapse. = Outer space - Mars = Although no pingos have been confirmed to be located on Mars, scholars agree that there are indisputable signs of pingo- like features (PLFs). PLFs are periglacial features which have been discovered but are usually not classed as pingos. This is usually because they are not large enough to be classified as pingos, or there is not enough evidence to class them as pingos.  Effects of climate change  Global warming is causing Arctic temperatures to rapidly rise, causing permafrost to thaw. For this reason, permafrost environments are extremely vulnerable to climate change in the Arctic. Permafrost degradation caused by climate warming is indicated by increased mean annual ground temperature, increased active layer thickness, talik and thermokarst development and disappearance of permafrost islands. The interchange between permafrost degradation and aggradation shapes sub-Arctic and Arctic lowland landscapes, and therefore contain records of past climate and landscape development. Pingos are vulnerable to surface disturbance given the considerable amount of ground ice stored within them. Abrupt permafrost thaw processes can cause ice wedges within pingos to melt, which can result in increased pingo collapse and the formation of remnant lakes. However, there are currently few studies investigating how climate change could affect formation and growth of pingos.

Between the posterior edge of this process and the anterior surface of the ethmoid bulla, there is a two-dimensional space, resembling a crescent shape. This space continues laterally as a three-dimensional slit-like space - the ethmoidal infundibulum. This is bounded by the uncinate process, medially, the orbital lamina of ethmoid bone (lamina papyracea), laterally, and the ethmoidal bulla, posterosuperiorly. This concept is easier to understand if one imagine the infundibulum as a prism so that its medial face is the hiatus semilunaris. The \\"lateral face\\" of this infundibulum contains the ostium of the maxillary sinus, which, therefore, opens into the infundibulum. Variations The uncinate process can be attached to either the lateral nasal wall, on the lamina papyracea (50%), the anterior cranial fossa, on the ethmoidal roof (25%), or the middle concha (25%). The superior attachment of the uncinate process determines the drainage pattern of the frontal sinus. In the first case, the infundibulum and the frontal recess are separated from each other, forcing the frontal sinus to drain directly into the middle meatus and not into the ethmoidal infundibulum. With the other configurations, the sinus will drain, firstly, into the infundibulum.

It is produced by Revolution Studios and Happy Madison Productions and is distributed by Columbia Pictures. It has developed a cult following over the years since its release, especially amongst baseball fans. Plot Gus Matthews (Rob Schneider), Richie Goodman (David Spade), and Clark Reedy (Jon Heder) are three adult \\"nerds\\" who spent much of their childhoods longing to play sports, especially baseball, but never got the chance. Clark and Richie were unpopular children who were constantly bullied by the jocks and were never able to play baseball or other sports because of their lack of athletic ability. Gus Matthews, who does not talk much about his past, is surprisingly good at baseball even though he also lacks an athletic record. When a nerdy, unathletic boy named Nelson Carmichael (Max Pardo) and his friends are ruthlessly bullied and kicked off a nearby baseball diamond by a team of bullies who belong to a local little league team, Gus and Clark chase the bullies away. When Gus and Clark come with Richie to the field to play and get back their feel for the game, the bullies return and demand that they leave. Gus challenges the bullies to play them for the field, and the three friends, despite Clark and Richie's poor abilities, win the game due to Gus's superior skill. Days later, a man named Brad, who was one of Clark and Richie's bullies, challenges them to another baseball game with his team, but the three friends win again. Later, Nelson's billionaire father, Mel (Jon Lovitz), tells the trio that he is impressed with their wins, and explains his plan to hold a round-robin with all the mean-spirited little league teams in the state, plus their team. The winners will be given access to a new multimillion-dollar baseball park that he is building. Wanting to capture the spirit and fun in baseball which they never had when they were kids, as well as seeing this as an opportunity to teach children everywhere that bullying is wrong and that all children, regardless of ability, should be given equal opportunities in sports, the three name themselves the Benchwarmers and join the tournament. They play against every cruel little league team in the tournament, despite the fact that they are three adults squaring off against a team of nine kids. The Benchwarmers win every single game, with Clark and Richie's abilities gradually improving, and the team becomes popular among many nerds, children with poor athletic abilities, and the general public. Their success causes increasing frustration and bitterness amongst the mean-spirited teams of jocks, who start meeting to think of plans to defeat the Benchwarmers. At the semi-final game, around halfway through, the competing team's coach Wayne bribes the umpire by entering a 30-year-old Dominican man named Carlos into the league claiming him to be 12 years old. Carlos proves to be a professional, purposely stepping on Gus' hand at one point to injure it too much for him to pitch. But the Benchwarmers eventually manage to defeat Carlos by making him too drunk to actually pitch properly and they manage to win when Richie's agoraphobic and heliophobic brother Howie is hit by the pitch but forces the winning run. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to derail the trio and halt their winning streak, the Benchwarmers' adversaries finally find a weakness that they can exploit. They find evidence that Gus was a bully himself as a child, known for using name calling over physical force and had bullied one boy named Marcus so intensely that he had to be sent to a mental institution. Seizing this opportunity, the bully teams expose Gus' secret to the public, shaming Gus into resigning from the team. However, on his wife Liz's advice, Gus sincerely apologizes to Marcus just before the final game. In return, Marcus forgives Gus in an incredibly moving speech in front of everyone right on the field at the beginning of the final game. Gus re-joins the team, announcing that Marcus is the Benchwarmers' new third-base coach. In the final game, Gus, Clark and Richie do not play; rather, they let a team consisting of Nelson and other non-athletic children play, to give them a chance to compete. The final is played against a team with their heartless coach, Jerry, who is the leader of all the mean bully jocks on the local little league teams, and was Richie and Clark's main bully when they were children. In the final inning, the Benchwarmers are losing, but Jerry's team sees that the Benchwarmers are having fun playing the game anyway despite losing. Seeing how heartless and uncaring Jerry is and realizing the true spirit of the game, they decide to let Nelson hit the ball, and let him score a run, saying that Jerry is \\"the loser\\". The Benchwarmers storm the field, celebrating the fact that they were not shut out, and they give an enraged Jerry a taste of his own medicine, giving him a wedgie. Later, the entire Benchwarmers team, along with the kids from Jerry's team, Number 7, Marcus, and even Carlos and Wayne, celebrate at Pizza Hut where Richie and Clark manage to get girlfriends, and Gus ecstatically announces that he is going to become a father.

These neighbourhoods were separate villages before the creation of the town at the beginning of the 20th century. History The area of the actual town has been inhabited for millennia, but a significant growth of its population did not begin until the 19th century. It was the construction of the railway that stimulated a strong population growth. Factories were built near the railway, and the Oil Campaign of World War II targeted the oil refinery on December 28, 1944. During the totalitarian communist rule (1948‚Äì89) the town lacked democratic municipal government. The town centre was damaged by flood in 2002.

The Cherokee clans (Cherokee syllabary:·è£·é≥·é© ·èì·èÇ·é≥·èç·èì·è¢·é¢) are traditional social organizations of Cherokee society. Customs and functions of the Cherokee clans The Cherokee society was historically a matrilineal society; meaning children belong to the mother's clan, and hereditary leadership and property were passed through the maternal line. Traditionally, women were considered the head of household among the Cherokee, with the home and children belonging to her should she separate from a husband, and maternal uncles were considered more important than fathers. Property was inherited and bequeathed through the clan and held in common by it. In addition, Cherokee society tended to be matrilocal, meaning that once married a couple moved in with or near the bride's family.Mooney, James; History, Myths, and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee; pp. 212‚Äì213; Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900. Cherokee clans held the only coercive power within Cherokee society. It was forbidden to marry within one's clan or to someone in the clan of one's father. Such marriage was considered incest and punishable by death at the hands of the offender's own clan and by no other. The clan was also responsible for balancing the death of one of its members at the hands of the member of another clan, whether deliberate, impulsive, or accidental. The one to pay the penalty did not have to be the person responsible; it could be any member of his or her clan. Indeed, if the intentional or unintentional killer escaped or found sanctuary in one of the towns so designated, such as Chota, Kituwa, or Tugaloo, the fugitive's clan was expected to deliver up another of its members. The purpose of this was not retaliation but equalization.McLoughlin, William G.; Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic;sic pp. 12‚Äì13; Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. Cherokee born outside of a clan or outsiders who were taken into the tribe in ancient times had to be adopted into a clan by a clan mother. If the person was a woman who had born a Cherokee child and was married to a Cherokee man, she could be taken into a new clan. Her husband was required to leave his clan and live with her in her new clan. Men who were not Cherokee and married into a Cherokee household had to be adopted into a clan by a clan mother; he could not take his wife's clan. In \\"The Cherokee Editor\\" on February 18, 1829, Elias Boudinot wrote the following regarding Cherokee Clan marriage customs: > This simple division of the Cherokees formed the grand work by which > marriages were regulated, and murder punished. A Cherokee could marry into > any of the clans except two, that to which his father belongs, for all of > that clan are his fathers and aunts and that to which his mother belongs, > for all of that clan are his brothers and sisters, a child invariably > inheriting the clan of his mother. In a practice known as Gadugi, Cherokee clans took care of orphans, those left destitute by various circumstances and fostered hospitality for visiting clan members from other villages. This communal work provided an important function to the overall village and community as a whole. The seven clans The Cherokee have seven clans and have had that number as long as there has been contact with Europeans. Some have multiple names, and according to ethnographer James Mooney the seven are the result of consolidation of as many as what was previously fourteen separate clans in more ancient times.Mooney, pp. 212‚Äì213. Wild Potato Clan pillar from the monument at Chota. =Anigatogewi= \\"Anigatogewi\\" or \\"Anigadogewi\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·é¶·èô·é®·è´) cannot confidently be translated; however, this clan is known as the \\"Wild Potato Clan\\", or occasionally as the \\"Blind Savannah Clan. The Anigatogewi's only subdivision was Blind Savannah, possibly a separate clan in origin. Historically, members of this clan were known to be 'keepers of the land,' and gatherers. The wild potato was a main staple of the traditional Cherokee life in the Southeast (Tsalagi Uweti). Long Hair Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Anigilohi= \\"Anigilohi\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·é©·é∂·éØ) is translated as \\"Long Hairs\\" or \\"Twisters.\\" The name can be translated as \\"They have just become offended.\\" or could be short for Gitlugunahita, which means literally \\"Long Hair\\".Mooney, pp. 507‚Äì548. The Anigilahi or the Long Hair Clan, whose subdivisions were Twister, Wind, and Strangers (possibly separate clans in origin combined into one), were regarded as peacemakers. Peace Chiefs would often be from this clan.Anigilohi ; Cherokee Nation Cultural Resource Center; The Cherokee Nation; retrieved January 18, 2009 In the times of the Peace Chief and War Chief government, the Peace Chief would come from this clan. Prisoners of war, orphans of other tribes, and others with no Cherokee tribe were often adopted into this clan, thus a common interpretation of the name 'Strangers.' Deer Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Aniawi= \\"Aniawi\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·é†·è´) is the \\"Deer Clan.\\" The Aniawi, or Deer Clan, were historically known as fast runners and hunters. Even though they hunted game for subsistence, they respected and cared for the animals while they were living among them. They were also known as messengers on an earthly level, delivering messages from village to village, or person to person. Blue Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Anisahoni= \\"Anisahoni\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·èå·é∞·èÇ) is the \\"Blue Clan\\". The Anisahoni, or Blue Holly Clan, subdivisions were Panther, or Wildcat, and Bear, probably in origin two separate clans that were later consolidated with a third. Historically, this clan produced many people who were able to make special medicines for the children. The medicine was made from a blue plant which is where the clan gained its name. Bird Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Anitsiskwa= \\"Anitsiskwa\\" or \\"Anitsisqua\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·è•·èç·èÜ) is the \\"Bird Clan\\". Members of the Anitsiskwa, or Bird Clan, were historically known as messengers. The belief that birds are messengers between earth and heaven, or the People and Creator, gave the members of this clan the responsibility of caring for the birds. The subdivisions were Raven, Turtledove, and Eagle, probably in origin three separate clans later consolidated into one. Earned Eagle feathers were originally presented by the members of this clan, as they were the only ones able to collect them. Wolf Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Aniwaya= \\"Aniwaya\\" or \\"Aniwahya\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·è©·èØ) is the \\"Wolf Clan\\". The Aniwaya, or Wolf Clan, has been known throughout time to be the largest clan. During the time of the Peace Chief and War Chief government setting, the War Chief would come from this clan. Wolves are known as protectors. Historically, the Wolf Clan was the largest and most important among the Cherokee. A few members of this clan are said to be extremely powerful; they are called alphas. Ex. Alpha GƒÉlƒÉ-gi‚Ä≤na etc. thMooney, James. History, Myths, and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee, p. 212. Paint Clan pillar from the monument at Chota =Aniwodi= \\"Aniwodi\\" (Cherokee syllabary:·é†·èÇ·è¨·èó) is the \\"Paint Clan\\", also commonly called the \\"Red Paint Clan\\". The Aniwodi or the Paint Clan were historically known as a prominent medicine people. Medicine is often 'painted' on a patient after harvesting, mixing and performing other aspects of the ceremony. Historical evolution of the clan system in the 19th century Although traditionalists still observe clan customs regarding marriage and certain social event, the customs and mores of the Cherokee regarding clans and the clan system have evolved considerably since ancient times, especially beginning with the 19th century. A large reason for this was the turmoil of the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars and the resulting displacement of vast numbers of Cherokee removed westward, both voluntarily and involuntarily, from their more easterly ancient homes. Also, European traders in the Southeast‚Äîmostly Scottish, but also English, Irish, German, even French‚Äîhad married Cherokee women (as well as those of other tribes) for several decades. Their children belonged to the mother and her clan and were considered Cherokee. The first change legislated by the National Council of the Cherokee Nation actually took place a few years before the beginning of the 19th century, when in 1797 it ruled that clans no longer had to redress deaths that were judged to be accidental, and also abolished the practice of substituting one clan member for another to answer for the death of a person from another clan if the person so culpable could not be obtained.McLoughlin, Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic, sic pp. 161‚Äì162. The Ridge, who had joined the Council as the representative from Pine Log town, the previous year, initiated these changes.McLoughlin, William L. Cherokee Tragedy: The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People; pp. 25‚Äì28; New York: Macmillan Company; 1970 The Ridge also helped bring about the second major revision to the Cherokee \\"Blood Law\\", which was provoked largely by the assassination of Doublehead at the Hiwassee Garrison near the Cherokee Agency (now Calhoun, Tennessee) in August 1807. The stated reason was Doublehead's involvement in making private deals to sell off Cherokee land. The killers were he and Alexander Sanders, the two of them having to stand in for James Vann, who was too drunk to accomplish the task.McLoughlin, Cherokee Tragedy; p. 38. Much more wide-sweeping changes came with the first printed law in the Cherokee Nation, passed by the National Council on September 11, 1808. A major reform designed and pushed forward by the young chiefs' \\"Cherokee Triumvirate\\" (James Vann, Charles R. Hicks, and The Ridge), its primary prescriptive feature was setting up a Light Horse Guard of several teams over the whole Nation to act as \\"regulating parties\\", and also provided for a system of patrilineal inheritance alongside the matrilineal inheritance system of the clans. Major Ridge served as the first commander of the Light Horse Guard. Proscriptively, it further restricted clan retaliation.The First Printed Law in the Cherokee Nation; \\"The Cherokee Observer,\\" Vol. 15, Nos. 11 & 12; Blackwell, Oklahoma; November‚ÄìDecember 2007. In the Act of Oblivion on April 18, 1810, the National Council completely eradicated clan retaliation from Cherokee law, repudiated matrilineal inheritance, and referred to husbands/fathers in the Nation as the heads of household.Mooney, pp. 86‚Äì87. In 1825 the Cherokee Council passed a law admitting children of mixed marriages, in which the father was Cherokee and the mother was white, to the tribe as if their mother were Cherokee.Yarbough, Fay.

Aged twelve, he embarked as ship's boy on a boat from Lorient heading for the island of Hispaniola (present day Dominican Republic). From there, he embarked for Pondich√©ry, French trading post in India. Madec lived there for about twenty five years, sometimes French corsair, sometimes British corsair. He became soldier under Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix and sergeant under Lally-Tollendal. Being taken prisoner by the British, he enlisted in the Bengal army. Deserting with some of his companions shortly before the battle of Buxar (1764), he became military instructor to various native princes, organizing successively the forces of Shuja-ud-Dowlah, Nawab of Oudh, and of the Jats and Rohillas. In 1772 he took service under the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, who gave him the title of Nawab, reserved to the highest dignitaries of the sultan's court. When that prince was defeated at Delhi by the Mahrattas, Madec rejoined his own countrymen in Puducherry, where he took an active part in the defence of the town (1778). He became King of the Deccan, defender of the Indies for the King of France and he accumulated great wealth. After the capitulation of Puducherry, in 1779, he returned to France with a considerable fortune. The King appointed him Colonel and named him Chevalier de Saint Louis. He then settled in Quimper, at the number 5 of the street which nowadays bears his name, not far from his birth-house. He lived a fabulous life until a bad fall off a horse in 1784. He died soon thereafter. He is buried in the graveyard at Penhars. At one time he formed a scheme of a French alliance with the Mughal emperor against the British, but the project came to nothing.

Levin was the vice president and Hertog Fellow of Ethics and Public Policy Center (2007‚Äì19), executive director of the President's Council on Bioethics (2001‚Äì04), Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy (2004‚Äì07), and contributing editor to The Weekly Standard (95‚Äì2018). Prior to that he served as a congressional staffer at the member, committee, and leadership levels. Levin's essays and articles have appeared in numerous publications, among them, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, among others. He is the author of five books on public policy and political theory, including ‚ÄúThe Fractured Republic: Renewing America‚Äôs Social Contract in the Age of Individualism‚Äù (Basic Books, 2016). In 2020, he published his latest book, ‚ÄúA Time to Build: From Family and Community to Congress and the Campus, How Recommitting to Our Institutions Can Revive the American Dream‚Äù (Basic Books). Early life and education Levin was born in Haifa, Israel, and moved to the United States with his family at the age of eight. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science at American University, and earned a PhD from the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Career Levin is the author of five books, and of numerous essays and articles dealing largely with political theory, science, technology, and public policy. On the relationship between political theory and public policy, Levin has observed: > For me, these things are very deeply connected. I think politics really is > rooted in political philosophy, is much better understood when it's > understood in light of political philosophy. And that a lot of the policy > debates we have make much more sense if you see that people are arguing > about two ways of understanding what the human person is, what human society > is, and especially what the liberal society is. The left and right in our > country are both liberal, they both believe in the free society, but they > mean something very different by that. Conservatism, Levin has said, \\"understands society not as just individuals and government, but thinks of it in terms of everything that happens in between. That huge space between the individual and the state is where society actually is. And that's where families are, it's where communities are, it's where the market economy is.\\" In 2014, Levin co-edited, with Ramesh Ponnuru, Room to Grow: Conservative Reforms for a Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class, a reform conservative manifesto and policy agenda.) The book was widely praised, with New York Times columnist David Brooks describing it as a \\"policy-laden manifesto... which is the most coherent and compelling policy agenda the American right has produced this century.\\" Ross Douthat called Levin a leader of the \\"reform conservative\\" movement, and Levin was prominently featured in a 2014 New York Times Magazine cover story about the conservative intellectuals who comprise it. The Times' Sam Tanenhaus wrote that Levin was one of a group of young conservative Republicans who had \\"become the leaders of a small band of reform conservatives, sometimes called reformicons, who believe the health of the G.O.P. hinges on jettisoning its age-old doctrine ‚Äî orgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street ‚Äî and using an altogether different vocabulary, backed by specific proposals, that will reconnect the party to middle-class and low-income voters.\\" Levin has been called \\"probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era\\" by Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine, while The New Republic has anointed Levin \\"the right's new Irving Kristol,\\" fondly nicknaming him \\"Baby Kristol\\".

Life  Born to a big family of farmers in Vorarlberg (present-day Austria), Gmeiner was a talented child and won a scholarship to attend grammar school. His mother died while he was still a young boy, and his eldest sister Elsa took on the task of caring for the smallest of the children. Having experienced the horrors of war himself as a soldier in Russia, he was then confronted with the isolation and suffering of the many war orphans and homeless children as a child welfare worker after the end of the Second World War. In his conviction that help can never be effective as long as the children have to grow up without a home of their own, he set about implementing his idea for SOS Children's Villages. With just 600 Austrian schillings (approx. 40 US dollars) in his pocket Hermann Gmeiner established the SOS Children's Village Association in 1949, and in the same year the foundation stone was laid for the first SOS Children's Village in Imst, in the Austrian state of Tyrol. His work with the children and development of the SOS Children's Village organization kept Hermann Gmeiner so busy that he finally decided to discontinue his medical degree course. In the following decades his life was inseparably linked with his commitment to a family-centred child-care concept based on the four pillars of a mother, a house, brothers and sisters, and a village. Given his exclusive focus on the need to help abandoned children, the rest of his biography reads like the history of SOS Children's Villages themselves. He served as Village Director in Imst, organized the construction of further SOS Children's Villages in Austria, and helped to set up SOS Children's Villages in many other countries of Europe. In 1960 SOS-Kinderdorf International was established in Strasbourg as the umbrella organization for SOS Children's Villages with Hermann Gmeiner as the first president. In the following years the activities of SOS Children's Villages spread beyond Europe. The sensational \\"grain of rice\\" campaign raised enough funds to permit the first non-European SOS Children's Village to be built in Daegu, Korea in 1963, and SOS Children's Villages on the American and African continents followed. By 1985 the result of Hermann Gmeiner's work was a total of 233 SOS Children's Villages in 85 countries. In recognition of his services to orphaned and abandoned children he received numerous awards and was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. However, he was always at pains to stress that it was only thanks to the support of millions of people that it had been possible to achieve the goal of providing abandoned children with a permanent home, and that still applies today. Hermann Gmeiner died in Innsbruck in 1986. He is buried at SOS Children's Village Imst. SOS Children's Villages is currently active in 132 countries and territories. 438 SOS Children's Villages and 346 SOS Youth Facilities provide more than 60,000 children and youths in need with a new home. More than 131,000 children/youths attend SOS Kindergartens, SOS Hermann Gmeiner Schools and SOS Vocational Training Centres. Around 397,000 people benefit from the services provided by SOS Medical Centres, 115,000 people from services provided by SOS Social Centres. SOS Children's Villages also helps in situations of crisis and disaster through emergency relief programmes. The emergency clinic in Mogadishu (provides app. 260,000 check-ups and treatments a year) is one example of a huge long-term relief project.

The orbital plane is nearly aligned with the line of sight to the Earth, so the pair forms an eclipsing binary. The primary eclipse has a minimum of 4.23 in magnitude, while the secondary minimum is magnitude 4.21. This eclipsing behavior was discovered by German astronomer P.

The Chincha culture consisted of a Native Peruvian people living near the Pacific Ocean in south west Peru. The Chincha Kingdom and their culture flourished in the Late Intermediate Period (900 CE - 1450 CE), also known as the regional states period of pre-Columbian Peru. They became part of the Inca Empire around 1480. They were prominent as sea-going traders and lived in a large and fertile oasis valley. La Centinela is an archaeological ruin associated with the Chincha. It is located near the present-day city of Chincha Alta. The Chincha disappeared as a people a few decades after the Spanish conquest of Peru, which began in 1532. They died in large numbers from European diseases and the political chaos which accompanied and followed the Spanish invasion. The Chincha gave their name to the Chinchaysuyo Region, the Chincha Islands, to the animal known as the chinchilla (literally \\"Little Chincha\\"), and the city of Chincha Alta. The word \\"Chinchay\\" or \\"Chincha\\", means \\"Ocelot\\" in Quechua. Setting Chincha is one of the largest valleys on Pacific Ocean coast of Peru. The valley is about south of Lima, Peru.

The earliest settlers were probably fishermen, enjoying the rich maritime resources of the Humboldt Current. Irrigation agriculture in river valleys developed later. The first settled communities known in the Chincha valley date from about 800 BCE and belong to the Paracas culture.Stanish, Charles, Tantalean, Henry, Nigra, Benjamin T., and Griffin, Laura (2014), \\"A 2,300-year-old architectural and astronomical complex in the Chincha Valley, Peru\\", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 111, No. 20, p. 7218 Later, from 100 BCE to 800 CE the Chincha valley was influenced by the Ica-Nazca culture.Prouix, Donald A.

Some scholars claim that the change was the product of a migratory wave of unknown origin, identifying this culture as the \\"Pre-Chincha\\" culture. The rudimentary Pre-Chincha culture relied extensively on fishing and shell gathering. = Chincha era = In the 11th century, the sophisticated and warlike culture known as the Chincha began, possibly the product of a migratory wave from the highlands. The Chincha had developed systems of architecture, agriculture and irrigation. The Chincha culture came to dominate the whole valley. The Chincha worshiped a jaguar god, and believed themselves to be descended from jaguars, who gave them their warlike and dominating tendencies. The Chincha fertilized their fields with dead birds and guano, and this knowledge was passed on to later peoples. The Chincha merchants maintained trade routes by land with herds of camelids used as beasts of burden reaching the Collao (Altiplano) and Cusco. Moreover, the Chincha learned seafaring skills; and new technologies such as raft construction with balsa logs, being the largest capable of carrying twenty people in addition to a large cargo, and the use of the sail, only known by some cultures of Ecuador and Peru in the Pre-Columbian era of the Americas; allowing the Chincha to have extensive maritime trade routes and perhaps traveled as far as Central America by boat (raft). The Chincha sea- going \\"traders\\" worshiped a star known to them as Chundri, that may have served for navigation. The Chincha ruin of La Centinela was one of the first archaeological sites in Peru to be investigated by archaeologists. The site covers more than and consists of two large pyramids, La Centinela and Tambo de Mora, constructed of adobe and serving as the habitations of the leaders of the Chincha people. The surrounding residential area housed artisans of silver, textiles, wood, and ceramics,Tavero Vega, Lizardo, \\"La Centinela\\", http://www.arqueologiadelperu.com.ar/lacentinela.htm, accessed 12 August 2016 although, like most pre-Columbian monumental archaeological sites, the main purpose of La Centinela was probably ceremonial rather than residential or commercial. A network of roads radiated out from La Centinela, running in straight lines, as was the Andean custom. The roads are still visible. The roads extended east and south of la Centinela and led to outlying ceremonial centers and also facilitated the transportation of goods to the Paracas valley to the south and toward the highlands of the Andes which rise about inland from La Centinela.Wallace, pp. 253-255 According to an early Spanish chronicle, the population of Chincha consisted of 30,000 heads of households, among which were 12,000 agriculturalists, 10,000 fishermen, and 6,000 traders. The numbers suggest a total population of more than 100,000 people under Chincha control, likely in a larger area than the Chincha valley itself. The larger than normal number of fishermen and traders in the population illustrates the commercial nature of the Chincha state and the importance of the sea to their economy.Rostworowski de Diez Canseco, Maria (1999), History of the Inca Realm, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 205‚Äì206 The Chincha like the Chimor and some other Andean cultures used money for commerce. Chincha and the Incas Several 16th century Spaniards recorded Chincha history from indigenous Peruvian informants. Although those chronicles are often contradictory, the broad outlines of Chincha history can be discerned. Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n described Chincha as a \\"great province, esteemed in ancient times...splendid and grand...so famous throughout Peru as to be feared by many natives.\\" The Chinchas were expanding up and down the coast of Peru and into the Andes highlands at about the same time the Incas were creating their empire in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Chincha controlled a rich and prominent oracle named Chinchaycamac, probably near La Centinela, which garnered contributions from the Chincha people and others, indicating surpluses of wealth.Nigra, Ben, Jones, Terrah, Bongers, Jacob, Stanish, Charles, Tantalean, Henry and Perez, Kelita (2014), \\"The Chincha Kingdom: The Archaeology and Ethnohistory of the Late Intermediate Period South Coast, Peru,\\" Backdirt 2014, p. 39, http://ioa.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/backdirt2014_full_lr_update.pdf, accessed 18 August 2016 The Chinchas were most famous for maritime commerce. Pedro Pizarro said that Atahualpa claimed that the ruler of Chincha controlled 100,000 sea-going rafts, undoubtedly an exaggeration, but illustrating the importance of Chincha and trade.Nigra et al, p. 40 Voyages via balsa raft up and down the Pacific coast from southern Colombia to northern Chile, possibly as far as Mexico, were a long-standing practice, the trade largely being in luxury items such as worked gold and silver and ritually-important Spondylus and Strombus seashells.Dewan, Leslie and Hosler, Dorothy (2008), \\"Ancient Maritime Trade on Balsa Rafts: An Engineering Analysis,\\" Journal of Archaeological Research, Vol. 64, pp. 19‚Äì20 Some authorities have asserted that the Chincha gained influence and control over much of this maritime trade only late in the fifteenth century. The Incas captured and dismantled the economy of the Chimu in northern Peru about 1470 and gave control of the trade to the Chincha, whose location near the Inca homeland in the highlands made Chincha a convenient entrepot.Sandweiss, Daniel H. and Reid, David A.

According to some sources it was an attempt to establish a friendly relationship rather than a conquest, upon the arriving at Chincha, Ccapac Yupanqui said not wanting anything more than the acceptance of Cuzco superiority and gave gifts to the Chincha curacas to show the Inca magnificence. The Chincha had no trouble recognizing the Inca and continue living peacefully in their dominion. The next emperor, Topa Inca Yupanqui (ruled 1471-93) brought the Chincha Kingdom into a true territorial annexation to the empire, but the rulers of Chincha retained much of their political and economic autonomy and their traditional leadership. The Chincha king was required to spend several months each year attending the court of the Inca emperor, although he was given the honors of the highest Inca nobles.Nigra et al, pp. 39-40; Sandweiss, Daniel H. (1992), The Archaeology of Chincha Fishermen: Specialization and Status in Inka Peru, Bulletin of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, pp. 5 The lord of Chincha was the only person in the Atahualpa's entourage carried on a litter at the meeting with the Spanish. In the Inca culture, the use of a litter in presence of the Sapa Inca was an outstanding honor. The Chincha possibly supported the Atahualpa's faction at the Inca civil war, Atahualpa said that the lord of Chincha was his friend and the greatest lord of the lowlands. The Chincha lord was initially mistaken for Atahualpa because of his displayed wealth at the meeting with Francisco Pizarro, and then killed in the battle of Cajamarca in 1532 in which the emperor Atahualpa was captured by the Spaniards. Spanish rule The Spanish first appeared in the Chincha valley in 1534 and a Dominican Roman Catholic mission was founded by 1542. With the arrival of the Spaniards, the population of Chincha declined precipitously, mostly due to European diseases and political turmoil. Demographers have estimated a 99 percent decline in population in the first 85 years of Spanish rule. Chincha never regained its earlier prominence.Sandweiss, (1992), pp. 23-24 See also *Tambo Colorado *Nazca culture *Paracas culture Other reading *Caceres Macedo, Justo. Prehispanic Cultures of Peru.

These claims were not widely accepted prior to about 1955, but after the introduction of the bead argument, any remaining doubts soon disappeared from the research literature. The argument is often credited to Hermann Bondi, who popularized it, but it was originally proposed anonymously by Richard Feynman.Preskill, John and Kip S. Thorne. Foreword to Feynman Lectures On Gravitation. Feynman et al. (Westview Press; 1st ed. (June 20, 2002) p. xxv‚Äìxxvi.Link PDF (page 17-18)DeWitt, Cecile M. (1957). Conference on the Role of Gravitation in Physics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, March 1957; WADC Technical Report 57-216 (Wright Air Development Center, Air Research and Development Command, United States Air Force, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio) Link on www.edition- open-access.de.  Description  The thought experiment was first described by Feynman (under the pseudonym \\"Mr. Smith\\") in 1957 at a conference at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and later addressed in his private letter: As the gravitational waves are mainly transverse, the rod has to be oriented perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave. History of arguments on the properties of gravitational wavesEinstein's double reversal= The creator of the theory of general relativity, Albert Einstein, argued in 1916 that gravitational radiation should be produced, according to his theory, by any mass-energy configuration that has a time-varying quadrupole moment (or higher multipole moment). Using a linearized field equation (appropriate for the study of weak gravitational fields), he derived the famous quadrupole formula quantifying the rate at which such radiation should carry away energy. Examples of systems with time varying quadrupole moments include vibrating strings, bars rotating about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the bar, and binary star systems, but not rotating disks. In 1922, Arthur Stanley Eddington wrote a paper expressing (apparently for the first time) the view that gravitational waves are in essence ripples in coordinates, and have no physical meaning. He did not appreciate Einstein's arguments that the waves are real. In 1936, together with Nathan Rosen, Einstein rediscovered the Beck vacuums, a family of exact gravitational wave solutions with cylindrical symmetry (sometimes also called Einstein‚ÄìRosen waves). While investigating the motion of test particles in these solutions, Einstein and Rosen became convinced that gravitational waves were unstable to collapse. Einstein reversed himself and declared that gravitational radiation was not after all a prediction of his theory. Einstein wrote to his friend Max Born > Together with a young collaborator, I arrived at the interesting result that > gravitational waves do not exist, though they had been assumed a certainty > to the first approximation. This shows that the nonlinear field equations > can show us more, or rather limit us more, than we have believed up till > now. In other words, Einstein believed that he and Rosen had established that their new argument showed that the prediction of gravitational radiation was a mathematical artifact of the linear approximation he had employed in 1916. Einstein believed these plane waves would gravitationally collapse into points; he had long hoped something like this would explain quantum mechanical wave-particle duality. Einstein and Rosen accordingly submitted a paper entitled Do gravitational waves exist? to a leading physics journal, Physical Review, in which they described their wave solutions and concluded that the \\"radiation\\" that seemed to appear in general relativity was not genuine radiation capable of transporting energy or having (in principle) measurable physical effects. The anonymous referee, who‚Äîas the current editor of Physical Review recently confirmed, all parties now being deceased‚Äîwas the combative cosmologist, Howard Percy Robertson, pointed out the error described below, and the manuscript was returned to the authors with a note from the editor asking them to revise the paper to address these concerns. Quite uncharacteristically, Einstein took this criticism very badly, angrily replying \\"I see no reason to address the, in any case erroneous, opinion expressed by your referee.\\" He vowed never again to submit a paper to Physical Review. Instead, Einstein and Rosen resubmitted the paper without change to another and much less well known journal, The Journal of the Franklin Institute. He kept his vow regarding Physical Review. Leopold Infeld, who arrived at Princeton University at this time, later remembered his utter astonishment on hearing of this development, since radiation is such an essential element for any classical field theory worthy of the name. Infeld expressed his doubts to a leading expert on general relativity: H. P. Robertson, who had just returned from a visit to Caltech. Going over the argument as Infeld remembered it, Robertson was able to show Infeld the mistake: locally, the Einstein‚ÄìRosen waves are gravitational plane waves. Einstein and Rosen had correctly shown that a cloud of test particles would, in sinusoidal plane waves, form caustics, but changing to another chart (essentially the Brinkmann coordinates) shows that the formation of the caustic is not a contradiction at all, but in fact just what one would expect in this situation. Infeld then approached Einstein, who concurred with Robertson's analysis (still not knowing it was he who reviewed the Physical Review submission). Since Rosen had recently departed for the Soviet Union, Einstein acted alone in promptly and thoroughly revising their joint paper. This third version was retitled On gravitational waves, and, following Robertson's suggestion of a transformation to cylindrical coordinates, presented what are now called Einstein‚ÄìRosen cylindrical waves (these are locally isometric to plane waves). This is the version that eventually appeared. However, Rosen was unhappy with this revision and eventually published his own version, which retained the erroneous \\"disproof\\" of the prediction of gravitational radiation. In a letter to the editor of Physical Review, Robertson wryly reported that in the end, Einstein had fully accepted the objections that had initially so upset him. =Bern and Chapel Hill conferences= In 1955, an important conference honoring the semi-centennial of special relativity was held in Bern, the Swiss capital city where Einstein was working in the famous patent office during the Annus mirabilis. Rosen attended and gave a talk in which he computed the Einstein pseudotensor and Landau‚ÄìLifshitz pseudotensor (two alternative, non-covariant, descriptions of the energy carried by a gravitational field, a notion that is notoriously difficult to pin down in general relativity). These turn out to be zero for the Einstein‚ÄìRosen waves, and Rosen argued that this reaffirmed the negative conclusion he had reached with Einstein in 1936. However, by this time a few physicists, such as Felix Pirani and Ivor Robinson, had come to appreciate the role played by curvature in producing tidal accelerations, and were able to convince many peers that gravitational radiation would indeed be produced, at least in cases such as a vibrating spring where different pieces of the system were clearly not in inertial motion. Nonetheless, some physicists continued to doubt whether radiation would be produced by a binary star system, where the world lines of the centers of mass of the two stars should, according to the EIH approximation (dating from 1938 and due to Einstein, Infeld, and Banesh Hoffmann), follow timelike geodesics. Inspired by conversations by Felix Pirani, Hermann Bondi took up the study of gravitational radiation, in particular the question of quantifying the energy and momentum carried off 'to infinity' by a radiating system. During the next few years, Bondi developed the Bondi radiating chart and the notion of Bondi energy to rigorously study this question in maximal generality. In 1957, at a conference at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, appealing to various mathematical tools developed by John Lighton Synge, A. Z. Petrov and Andr√© Lichnerowicz, Pirani explained more clearly than had previously been possible the central role played by the Riemann tensor and in particular the tidal tensor in general relativity. He gave the first correct description of the relative (tidal) acceleration of initially mutually static test particles that encounter a sinusoidal gravitational plane wave. =Feynman's argument= Later in the Chapel Hill conference, Richard Feynman used Pirani's description to point out that a passing gravitational wave should in principle cause a bead on a stick (oriented transversely to the direction of propagation of the wave) to slide back and forth, thus heating the bead and the stick by friction. This heating, said Feynman, showed that the wave did indeed impart energy to the bead and stick system, so it must indeed transport energy, contrary to the view expressed in 1955 by Rosen. In two 1957 papers, Bondi and (separately) Joseph Weber and John Archibald Wheeler used this bead argument to present detailed refutations of Rosen's argument. =Rosen's final views= Nathan Rosen continued to argue as late as the 1970s, on the basis of a supposed paradox involving the radiation reaction, that gravitational radiation is not in fact predicted by general relativity. His arguments were generally regarded as invalid, but in any case the sticky bead argument had by then long since convinced other physicists of the reality of the prediction of gravitational radiation.

Rev Dr George Matheson DD FRSE (27 March 1842 ‚Äì 28 August 1906) was a Scottish minister and hymn writer. He was blind from his youth. Life The grave of Rev George Matheson, Glasgow Necropolis Born at 39 Abbotsford Place in Glasgow, to George Matheson (d.1891), a merchant and Jane Matheson (a second cousin), he was the eldest of eight children. He was educated at Glasgow Academy and the University of Glasgow, where he graduated first in classics, logic and philosophy. In his twentieth year he became totally blind, but he held to his resolve to enter the ministry, and gave himself to theological and historical study. In 1879 the University of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.. In 1890, he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, upon the proposal of Sir William Thomson, Robert Flint, Hugh Macmillan and James Lindsay. He died suddenly of apoplexy (stroke) at Avenell House in North Berwick on 28 August 1906 in Edinburgh and is buried with his parents in the Glasgow Necropolis. The grave lies near the summit. He never married. Service He started as an assistant pastor in 1866. His first ministry began in 1868 at Innellan, on the Argyll coast between Dunoon and Toward. He stayed 18 years. His books on Aids to the Study of German Theology, Can the Old Faith live with the New?, The Growth of the Spirit of Christianity from the First Century to the Dawn of the Lutheran Era, established his reputation as a liberal and spiritually minded theologian; and Queen Victoria invited him to preach at Balmoral. She had his sermon on Job published. In 1886, he moved to Edinburgh, where he became minister of St. Bernard's Parish Church in Stockbridge for 13 years. Here his chief work as a preacher was done. In 1879, he declined an invitation to the pastorate of Crown Court, London, in succession to Dr. John Gumming (1807‚Äì1881). In 1881 he was chosen as Baird lecturer, and took for his subject Natural Elements of Revealed Theology, and in 1882 he was the St Giles lecturer, his subject being Confucianism. In 1890 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Aberdeen gave him its honorary LL.D., and in 1899 he was appointed Gifford lecturer by that university, but declined on grounds of health. In the same year he severed his active connection with St. Bernard's. Published works One of his hymns, \\"O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go,\\" has passed into the popular hymnology of the Christian Church. Matheson himself wrote of the composition: :\\"I am quite sure that the whole work was completed in five minutes, and equally sure that it never received at my hands any retouching or correction. I have no natural gift of rhythm. All the other verses I have ever written are manufactured articles; this came like a dayspring from on high.\\" O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go at the Cyber Hymnal \\"O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go\\" was written on the evening of Matheson‚Äôs sister‚Äôs marriage. Years before, he had been engaged, until his fianc√©e learned that he was going blind‚Äîthat there was nothing the doctors could do‚Äîand she told him that she could not go through life with a blind man. He went blind while studying for the ministry, and his sister had been the one to care for him through the years, but now she was gone. He was now 40, and his sister‚Äôs marriage brought a fresh reminder of his own heartbreak. It was in the midst of this circumstance and intense sadness that the Lord gave Matheson this hymn, which he said was written in five minutes.

Possers come in various forms; there is usually a vertical pole with a handle bar at the top but the base can be conical or domed. It has a double rim with a row of holes around the edge of the outer one. A similar tool with three (or more) legs was called a variety of names including posstick, peggy-legs, dolly-legs, and dolly-peg. Sometimes they took the form of a flat disk.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the tradition of a weekly washing day had been established. Soap was available in the forms of flakes and powder. The posser was not so much used to hammer the dirt out of the clothes, as to agitate the water which would be forced under pressure through the holes.

The journal is not peer- reviewed, and covers topics about the social, ethical, political, and policy dimensions of modern science and technology. The journal is published in Washington, D.C. by the Center for the Study of Technology and Society. It is edited by Ari Schulman, having previously been edited by co-founders Eric Cohen and Adam Keiper. The journal's name is taken from Francis Bacon‚Äôs utopian novella New Atlantis, which the journal‚Äôs editors describe as a \\"fable of a society living with the benefits and challenges of advanced science and technology.\\" An editorial in the inaugural issue states that the aim of the journal is \\"to help us avoid the extremes of euphoria and despair that new technologies too often arouse; and to help us judge when mobilizing our technological prowess is sensible or necessary, and when the preservation of things that count requires limiting the kinds of technological power that would lessen, cheapen, or ultimately destroy us.\\" Writing for National Review, editor Adam Keiper described The New Atlantis as being written from a \\"particularly American and conservative way of thinking about both the blessings and the burdens of modern science and technology.\\" New Atlantis authors and bioethicists publishing in other journals have also similarly referred to The New Atlantis as being written from a social conservative stance which utilizes religion. Subjects The New Atlantis tends to publish views in favor of technological innovation but wary of certain avenues of development. For example, the journal has generally advocated nuclear energy; space exploration and development through public-private partnerships, including manned missions to Mars; biofuels; and genetically modified foods. But it has expressed ambivalent or critical views about developments in synthetic biology and military technologies like drones, chemical weapons, and cyberwarfare. Articles often explore policy questions on these and other issues, sometimes advocating particular policy outcomes, especially on health care, environmental management, and energy. The journal has published widely on bioethics, including issues such as stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, assisted suicide, organ and tissue donation, the purported link between vaccines and autism, and informed consent. Articles on these issues often highlight the potential for dangerous or degrading developments, including concerns over human dignity, with many articles examining human enhancement, and life extension, and historical precedents for abuse in eugenics and population control. The journal also features broader philosophical reflections on science and technology, and tends to be skeptical of what its authors consider to be speculative overreach common in popular discussions. Examples include articles that have defended the existence of free will in light of developments in neuroscience, questioned the wisdom of using brain scans in courtrooms, and described how growing knowledge of epigenetics has undermined common claims about genetic determinism. While the journal has sometimes aired libertarian views about human enhancement and transhumanism, its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence, \\"friendly\\" artificial intelligence, and genetic enhancement are possible or desirable. The journal has also published widely on the interpersonal effects of the Internet and digital technology. It has featured articles on subjects like Facebook, cell phones, multitasking, e-readers, GPS and navigation, and virtual reality. A 2006 article by Matthew B. Crawford advocating the intellectual and economic virtues of the manual trades was noted as a best-of-the-year essay by New York Times columnist David Brooks, and was subsequently expanded into the bestselling book Shop Class as Soulcraft. The journal also frequently publishes essays on philosophical and literary questions relating to science and technology.  Criticism  Sexuality and Gender Special Report = In August 2016, Paul R. McHugh, at the time a retired professor, co-authored a 143-page review of the scientific literature on gender and sexuality in The New Atlantis, a non-peer reviewed journal published under the auspices of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Christian-focused conservative think tank.McHugh Paul R., Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences In September 2016 Johns Hopkins University faculty members Chris Beyrer, Robert W. Blum, and Tonia C. Poteat wrote a Baltimore Sun op-ed, to which six other Johns Hopkins faculty members also contributed, in which they indicated concerns about McHugh's co-authored report, which they said mischaracterized the current state of science on gender and sexuality.\\"Bishops appoint sexual abuse review panel,\\" The Baltimore Sun. More than 600 alumni, faculty members and students at the medical school also signed a petition calling on the university and hospital to disavow the paper. ‚ÄúThese are dated, now-discredited theories,‚Äù said Chris Beyrer, a professor at the public health school and part of the faculty group that denounced McHugh's stance. Brynn Tannehill, a board member of the Transgender United Fund wrote that \\"this isn‚Äôt a study, it‚Äôs a very long Opinion-Editorial piece.\\" Other reception Writing for the National Review in a 2003 column, the conservative author Stanley Kurtz described The New Atlantis as influential on thinking about science and technology. Richard John Neuhaus, late editor of the conservative journal First Things, wrote that The New Atlantis is \\"as good a publication as there is for the intelligent exploration of questions in bioethics and projections‚Äîpromising, ominous, and fantastical‚Äîabout the human future,\\" and a writer in The American Conservative described the journal as a source \\"of fresh ideas on the Right.\\" National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg described The New Atlantis as \\"a new and interesting magazine\\" that \\"seems to be trying to carve out the space for the government to stop the more offensive aspects of biotechnology.\\" By contrast, the liberal bioethicist Jonathan D. Moreno has said that the journal offers \\"a very dark vision\\" about science and technology, but that it \\"makes an important point about the need to worry about the ends as well as means in science\\" and that its \\"writers were young, smart, and had a good understanding of the political process and the making of public policy.\\" Bioethicist Ruth Macklin criticized The New Atlantis as representative of a conservative movement in bioethics that is \\"mean-spirited, mystical, and emotional\\" and that \\"claims insight into ultimate truth yet disavows reason.\\" The journal has particularly gained a reputation among the transhumanist movement for its criticism of human enhancement. James Hughes, a techno-progressivist and at times director of organizations such as the World Transhumanist Association and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, notes that the journal \\"has published influential attacks on artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, reproductive technology, and life extension.\\" The artist/designer, Dr. Natasha Vita-More, wife of British transhunanist Philosopher, author, and cryonicist Max More, has described it as a \\"journal known as a ring of bioconservatives bent on opposing the cyberculture,\\". Meanwhile, the organization founded by her husband, the Extropy Institute, has called it \\"a high-powered rallying point for the neo-Luddites.\\"  Book series  The New Atlantis also publishes a book series, New Atlantis Books, an imprint of Encounter Books. To date, six books have been released: *In the Shadow of Progress: Being Human in the Age of Technology (2008), by Eric Cohen *Imagining the Future: Science and American Democracy (2008), by Yuval Levin *Neither Beast nor God: The Dignity of the Human Person (2009), by Gilbert Meilaender *Merchants of Despair: Radical Environmentalists, Criminal Pseudo- Scientists, and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism (2012), by Robert Zubrin *Why Place Matters: Geography, Identity, and Civic Life in Modern America (2014), edited by Wilfred M.

The characters use a frog suit containing electrical coils on the soles of each of the two flippers which allow the wearer to leap great distances up to high or long. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack, and triggered via hidden buttons in his gloves. Additionally, the costume later had a strength-boosting exoskeleton along with substantial internal padding and a computer-guided system for leaping accuracy. Publication history The first Leap-Frog appeared in Daredevil #25-26 (February-March 1967), and was created by Stan Lee, Gene Colan, and Frank Giacoia. The character subsequently appears in Daredevil Annual #1 (September 1967), The Defenders #64 (October 1978), Iron Man #126-127 (September-October 1979), Marvel Team-Up #121 (September 1982), #131 (July 1983), The Defenders #131 (May 1984), Marvel Fanfare #31-32 (March, May 1987), Damage Control #2 (December 1989), The Spectacular Spider-Man #185 (February 1992), Daredevil #16 (May 2001), Spider-Man's Tangled Web #12 (May 2002), and Wolverine #27 (June 2005). The second Leap-Frog debuted in Daredevil Vol. 2 #16 and was created by Brian Michael Bendis and David W. Mack. Fictional character biographyVincent Patilio= Tired of his lack of success as an inventor of novelty items for toy companies, Vincent Patilio designed himself electrically powered coils that could be used for leaping great distances and incorporated them into a frog-like costume.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #4: Frog- Man/Marvel Knights Calling himself Leap-Frog, Patilio was not known for being lucky in his criminal career. For example, he started by taking blind lawyer Matt Murdock hostage (Murdock being in fact the civilian identity of the superhero Daredevil).Daredevil vol. 1 #25-26 He was recruited by Electro to serve in his Emissaries of Evil in a revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. However, Daredevil defeated them.Daredevil Annual vol. 1 #1 Other attempts at being a criminal failed at the hands of Daredevil, before Leap- Frog was defeated by Iron Man and sent to jail.Iron Man vol. 1 #126-127 Patilio served his time in prison and then returned to his wife Rose and young son Eugene. Rose's salary kept the family financially solvent until she died of cancer.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2006 #4 Barely making enough money to support himself and his son, Patilio fell into despair. At this time, his son Eugene donned a version of his costume to attempt to create a heroic career as \\"Frog-Man.\\" Patilio was at first proud of his son for capturing the villain Speed Demon, but his pride turned to disapproval as Eugene continued to serve as a superhero. Patilio forbade his son to adventure as Frog-Man.Marvel Team-Up vol. 1 #121 Patilio later went undercover in the villainess White Rabbit's gang on behalf of the police, which brought him into conflict with his son, who, as Frog-Man, tried to take down the White Rabbit. Patilio ultimately defeated the White Rabbit with the help of his son and got a reward that considerably eased his financial worries.Marvel Team-Up vol. 1 #131 When the White Rabbit reappeared, she teamed up with the Walrus to create mayhem which would not stop until the Frog-Man surrendered to her. Spider-Man went after the two. Meanwhile, Vincent ordered Eugene to stay at home while he donned a revamped version of his costume, announced himself as Frog-Man and joined Spider-Man. However, Eugene also donned his own costume and joined the struggle, and the trio managed to stop the criminals.Spectacular Spider-Man vol. 1 #185 Currently, Patilio remains retired from adventuring. =Buford Lange= Buford Lange is an abusive father who lived in Hell's Kitchen with his wife Allison and their autistic son Timmy. He stumbled upon an abandoned Leap-Frog costume and began a short-lived criminal career by robbing small businesses. Lange fought Daredevil on a rooftop only to be electrocuted by Timmy, who didn't want to see his hero, Daredevil, hurt. Lange fell off the rooftop and into a garbage truck on the street below and seemingly died.Daredevil vol. 2 #16-19 He was killed and resurrected by the Hand and joined an assault on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier which resulted in its destruction. He was killed again by Wolverine, as were most of the super- villains and heroes the Hand were using in the attack.Wolverine vol. 3 #26-27 Powers and abilities Leap-Frog has no superpowers but wears an exoskeleton frog suit that gives him enhanced strength and agility. The suit is also equipped with electrically powered leaping coils that allow him to reach a height of 6 stories per jump. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack. His suit also has an internal padding to protect him from impacts and a computer-guided system for leaping accuracy.

He was born in Bijnor in Rohilkhand and later became a subedar, the chief native commanding officer, in the army of the East India Company, gaining forty years of experience in the Bengal horse artillery and seeing action in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Before the rebellion Subedar Bakht Khan was well known to a number of British officers, including several who were to serve against him during the siege of Delhi in 1857. One colonel described him as being \\"a most intelligent character\\" who was \\"very fond of English society\\". The rebellion Indian Rebellion of 1857 started when a group of sepoys rebelled against the introduction of rifle cartridges that were allegedly greased with pig or beef fat. This offended both Muslim soldiers, who did not eat pork and Hindu soldiers, who did not eat beef. The uprising spread rapidly in the surrounding areas of Delhi against the British.Time check: British India War of independence Dawn (newspaper), Published 17 December 2011, Retrieved 1 January 2018 With the outbreak of the mutiny in Barailly, Subedar Bahadur Khan had been acclaimed as general by the sepoys involved. When Bakht Khan heard of the rebellion in Meerut, he decided to march to Delhi to support the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar's army. By the time Bakht Khan arrived at Delhi on 1 July 1857, with a large number of Rohilla sepoys, the city had already been taken by rebel forces and the Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah Zafar had been proclaimed Emperor of India. The Bareilly Brigade led by Bakht Khan included four regiments of Bengal Native Infantry, one of cavalry and a battery of artillery. The appearance of this substantial reinforcement, marching in good order, dismayed the British besieging Delhi and impressed Bahadur Shah Zafar. Bakht and his officers were quickly summoned to meet with the emperor. The emperor's eldest son, Mirza Mughal, also called Mirza Zahiruddin, had been given the title of chief general, but this prince had no military experience. The newly restored Mughal dynasty faced problems of looting and ill-discipline amongst the sepoys already in the city. This was the moment when Bakht Khan along with his forces arrived in Delhi. With his arrival, the leadership position did improve. Bakht Khan's administrative abilities quickly became evident, and the emperor gave him actual authority and the title of Saheb-e-Alam Bahadur, or Lord Governor General. Khan was virtual commander of the sepoy forces, although Mirza Zahiruudin was still the commander-in-chief. Bakht Khan faced many problems which needed his immediate attention. The first and foremost problem was financial, to solve it he obtained from the Emperor authority to collect taxes. The second problem was the logistical one of supplies, which became more and more acute with the passage of time and even more so when British forces assaulted the city in September 1857. The British had many spies and agents in the city and were constantly pressurizing Bahadur Shah to surrender. The situation around Delhi proceeded to deteriorate rapidly; Bakht Khan's leadership could not compensate for the rebels' lack of organization, supplies and military strength. Delhi was besieged on 8 June 1857. On 14 September, the British assaulted the Kashmiri Gate and Bahadur Shah fled to Humayun's Tomb before surrendering to the British against Bakht Khan's pleas, on 20 September 1857. The emperor was arrested and the Mughal princes who were implicated in the massacre of British civilians, were executed. Bakht Khan himself left Delhi and joined rebel forces in Lucknow and Shahjahanpur. Later, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried on the charges of treason and exiled to Rangoon, Burma where he died in 1862.Time check: British India: Bahadur Shah Zafar Dawn (newspaper), Published 6 January 2012, Retrieved 1 January 2018 Burial On 13 May 1859, he was mortally wounded and died. He was buried in the graveyard of Nanser, then part of Swat; now in District Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. One expert in the matters of Swat history claims that he came to Swat after the war was lost and spent the rest of his life under the protection of Akhund of Swat.

It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.36. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 18.95 mas as seen from Earth, it is located 172 light years from the Sun. The star is moving closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of about ‚àí8 km/s. Description This is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A1 Van, where the 'n' indicates \\"nebulous\\" absorption lines in the spectrum due to rapid rotation. It is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 180 km/s, which is giving the star an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge that is an estimated 7% larger than the polar radius. The star is about 327 million years old with 2.35 times the mass of the Sun. It is radiating about 48 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,911 K. Œ¥ Ursae Minoris has a 12th magnitude common proper-motion companion at an angular separation of 4.5 arc seconds along a position angle of 67.3¬∞, which is a projected separation of 237.4 au at the distance of Œ¥ Ursae Minoris. The pair were resolved using adaptive optics. The companion is assumed to be gravitationally bound and to have a mass of approximately .

Plot In 1906, Wilse Dilling (Lon Chaney), a crippled gangster living like a brute in the savage streets of Chinatown, receives a coded message to go to the home of his boss, Ann Cardington (Christine Mayo), known as Queen Anne, a powerful crime boss feared in the underworld. When Wilse meets with her, she sends him to the town of Fallbrook, where he is to await her instructions in dealing with a former lover of hers, a banker named Micha Hadley (William Welsh), who had betrayed her. Dilling is to pose as a telegraph operator in his effort to watch the banker. Being practically dependent on crutches and wheelchair-bound has not stopped Dilling from committing a lengthy series of crimes, but to his surprise, he finds that the small town atmosphere makes him feel differently about everything. He finds a good friend in Hadley's daughter Gertrude (Virginia Valli), whom Dilling not only falls in love with her but she helps him believe that he can make a fresh start. Gertrude, however, is engaged to Jack Cooper (Jack Mower). Dilling's new-found contentment is soon shattered by a series of new developments which includes trying to stop Queen Ann's plot against Hadley and Gertrude. Threatened with exposure as a thief, Hadley lashes out at Dilling when he confesses his part in the scheme. When an attempt to blow up the bank goes badly, Gertrude and Cooper are caught in the blast. With Gertrude severely injured, Cooper's father forces him to break off their engagement. With the bank records destroyed, bank examiners are unable to find evidence against Hadley. After surgery, his daughter is expected to make a complete recovery but Queen Anne still seeks his revenge. Dilling tries to recover a document that his boss is holding, but with her henchmen, she captures Gertrude to Dilling's despair. Before anything can happen, everyone in the Manadarin Cafe, the gangsters' headquarters, as well as the entire city, is caught up in the San Francisco earthquake. Dilling survives and later in recuperation, is able to recover the use of his legs, beginning a new life with Gertrude. right Cast * Lon Chaney as Wilse Dilling * Virginia Valli as Gertrude Hadley * Jack Mower as Jack Cooper * William Welsh as Micha Hadley * Henry A.

The Sirius Passet Lagerst√§tte was named after the Sirius sledge patrol that operates in North Greenland. It comprises six places in Nansen Land, on the east shore of J.P. Koch Fjord in the far north of Greenland. It was discovered in 1984 by A. Higgins of the Geological Survey of Greenland. A preliminary account was published by Simon Conway Morris and others in 1987 and expeditions led by J. S. Peel and Conway Morris have returned to the site several times between 1989 and the present. A field collection of perhaps 10,000 fossil specimens has been amassed. It is a part of the Buen Formation.  Age  The fauna is inevitably compared to that of the Burgess Shale, although it is probably ten to fifteen million years older ‚Äì vs. ) ‚Äì and more closely contemporaneous with the fauna of the Maotianshan shales from Chengjiang, which are dated to .  Preservation  The preservation of the Sirius Passet is not typical of a Burgess Shale type, but rather represents silicification associated with a death mask, recalling the 'Ediacara-type' preservation of the Precambrian Ediacara biota. Geochemical analysis indicates that the fossils lived close to the boundary of an oxygen minimum zone, possibly being preserved in oxygen- starved periods.  Fauna  Although the fauna has not yet been fully described, it is known to consist of a moderate number of arthropods and sponges, and rare representatives of other groups.
