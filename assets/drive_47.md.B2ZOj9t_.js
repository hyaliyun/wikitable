It is best known for being a rock concert venue, particularly between the 1970s-1990s. It is a Grade II* listed building. Its gardens are also listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In its surrounding park is the medieval St. Mary's Church and the Lytton family mausoleum. History and description The home of the Lytton family since 1490, when Thomas Bourchier sold the reversion of the manor to Sir Robert Lytton, Knebworth House was originally a red-brick Late Gothic manor house, built round a central court as an open square. In 1813-16 the house was reduced to its west wing, 'Parishes: Knebworth', A History of the County of Hertford: volume 3 (1912), pp. 111-18. Date accessed: 27 August 2007]. which was remodelled in a Tudor Gothic style by John Biagio Rebecca for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton,Colvin, Howard (1995) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, s.v. \\"John Biagio Rebecca\\". and then was transformed in 1843-45 by Henry Edward Kendall Jr. into the present Tudor Gothic structure.Colvin, Howard (1995) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed. New Haven: Yale University Press, s.v. \\"Henry Edward Kendall\\", note. Knebworth's most famous resident was Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), the Victorian author, dramatist and statesman, who embellished the gardens in a formal Italianate fashion. The 1st Baron's great-grandson Neville (1879-1951) married Judith Blunt, a well known horse breeder who inherited Crabbet Arabian Stud in 1917 and devoted her life to it. In 1913-1914 the house was leased for ¬£3,000 per year by Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and his morganatic wife Natalia Brasova.Donald Crawford, The Last Tsar: Emperor Michael II (Kindle Location 630.) Murray McLellan. Kindle Edition Much of the interior of Knebworth House was redesigned by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who married Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (1874-1964) - he simplified the main parterre. Lady Emily was the daughter of The 1st Earl of Lytton, who served as Viceroy of India between 1876 and 1880. A herb garden, with an interlaced quincunx design, was drawn by Gertrude Jekyll in 1907, although not planted until 1982. The house today Lytton Mausoleum As of 2019, its residents are Henry Lytton-Cobbold and his family. He had a career in the film industry, living for some years in Los Angeles, and so the house and gardens are frequently used for filming. They are also open to the public. The grounds include tourist attractions such as an adventure playground and dinosaur park and host various events including classic car rallies. Since 1974, concerts at Knebworth House have featured the likes of Robbie Williams, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, Paul McCartney, Genesis, Mike Oldfield, The Beach Boys, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Dire Straits, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Iron Maiden and Oasis.\\"Knebworth: The Stately Home of Rock\\".

The term is generally used to refer to acts by national governments. Moratory laws are usually passed at times of special political or commercial stress: for instance, on several occasions during the Franco-Prussian War, the French government passed moratory laws. Their international validity was discussed at length, and was upheld in the English law case Rouquette v Overman (1875) LR 10 QB. Debt moratoriums are generally opposed by creditors. Proponents of debt moratoriums argue that it is a sovereign decision by the government of a nation to suspend repayment of debt to its creditors, if to do otherwise would do irreparable harm to the welfare of its citizenry. A debt moratorium may take the form of a complete cessation of debt repayments, or a partial cessation: for example, the government of President Alan Garc√≠a of Peru implemented the so-called \\"Ten Per Cent Solution\\", when it was announced that only 10% of export earnings would go to debt payment. Nations which have, at one time or another, declared a debt moratorium include Peru, Pakistan,Siddiqui, R. & Siddiqui, R. (2001). Determinants of Debt Rescheduling in Pakistan. The Pakistan Development Review, 40(4). Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Argentina. The most recent addition to this group is Ecuador, which entered a technical moratorium on its foreign debt on 14 November 2008. Ecuador stopped all payments on its 2012 bond, but has continued on the 2015 bond. The investment company Dubai World, owned by the Dubai government, also declared a debt moratorium in November 2009.

and data capture (see RFID). In such cases, electronic devices use radio waves to track and identify items, such as pharmaceutical products, by assigning individual serial numbers to the containers holding each product. This technology may prevent the diversion or counterfeiting of drugs by allowing wholesalers and pharmacists to determine the identity and dosage of individual products. A taggant is also a chemical or physical marker added to materials to allow various forms of testing. Physical taggants can take many different forms but are typically microscopic in size, included at low levels, and simple to detect. They can be utilized to differentiate authentic product from counterfeits, provide identifying information for traceability purposes (e.g. lot number, company name), determine mixing homogeneity and cross- contamination, and to detect dilution of proprietary products. Taggants are known to be widely used in the animal feed industry, plastics, inks, sheet and flexible explosives, and pharmaceuticals. A software taggant is a cryptographic signature added to software that enables positive origin identification and integrity of programs. Software taggants use standard PKI techniques (see public key infrastructure) and were introduced by the Industry Connections Security Group of IEEE in an attempt to control proliferation of malware obfuscation via executable compression. History of taggants The word 'taggant' originates from the trademarked name \\"Microtaggant Identification Particles\\". Microtaggants were originally developed by 3M for the post detonation of explosives. In 1985, Microtrace, LLC acquired the technology and began to utilize Microtaggants for anti-counterfeiting and brand protection. Since 1985, the word 'taggant' has become widely utilized and refers to multiple variations. Explosive taggants There are two types of taggant which have been considered for use with explosives. One is to help detect the presence of a bomb in, for example, airport screening of luggage; and the other to assist the police in identifying the explosive after the detonation of such a bomb. =Detection taggants= These are volatile chemicals which will slowly evaporate from the explosive and can be detected in the atmosphere by either detection dogs or specialised machines. They are intended to enhance the detectability of the explosive by instruments or animals thus revealing the presence of a bomb containing the explosive to be detected. Although various technologies exist to detect untagged explosives, detection taggants help to increase their reliability. The inclusion of detection taggants in explosives is mandatory in some countries. Following the bombing of PanAm 103 over Scotland, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was instrumental in effecting a worldwide requirement for placing a detection taggant in plastic bonded explosives. There is a choice between four possible detection taggant chemicals which must be added to plastic explosives under the 1991 International Civil Aviation Organization's Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection. In the United States the marker is always 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane, usually called DMDNB or DMNB. Dogs are very sensitive to it and can detect as little as 0.5 parts per billion in the air, as can specialised ion mobility spectrometers. Other taggants in use are ethylene glycol dinitrate, known as EGDN and used to mark Semtex, ortho-mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), and para- mononitrotoluene (p-MNT). =Identification (or post detonation) taggants= These have been considered for introduction in industrial explosives so that the manufacturer and batch number can be determined if they are used illegally. The taggant must survive the detonation of the product and not be contaminated by the environment afterwards. Several different technologies have been considered, but the most common are microscopic polymer/metallic particles. Taggant evidence was crucial in the 1980 conviction of James L. McFillin in Maryland for the 1979 truck bombing murder of Nathan A. Allen, Sr. A contention claimed for opposing mandated taggants is that most terrorist attacks use homemade explosives (HME) which would allegedly not be tagged. Examples given included, for instance, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Oklahoma City and the Omagh bombings. Contamination of the site is also cited as a problem, since different taggants might be present at a crime scene from, for example, explosives used to obtain the building materials. Switzerland passed a law in 1980 requiring taggants in explosives manufactured there, and that the code must be changed every six months. So far it is the only country which requires identification taggants. Imported explosives must be tagged only if competing products are also manufactured in Switzerland. In the United States, the NRA opposed the mandated use of taggants in firearm propellants after tests revealed a dangerous increase in burn rates. It was claimed that a chemical incompatibility with the propellent powders would cause such an increase in pressures that many firearms would burst after using a taggant-laced powder that had been stored for as little as several months. However, these tests were performed on gunpowder with a taggant concentration of 500,000 parts per million, which is 2,000 times greater than the official recommended taggant concentration of 250 parts per million.Tagging Explosives, ABC Science, Karl S.

Daniel Hiester (June 25, 1747 ‚Äì March 7, 1804) was an American political and military leader from the Revolutionary War period to the early 19th Century. Born in Berks County in the Province of Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Hiester Family political dynasty. He was the brother of John Hiester and Gabriel Hiester, cousin of Joseph Hiester, and the uncle of William Hiester and U.S. Rep. Daniel Hiester (1774‚Äì1834). Biography Hiester's father, also named Daniel Hiester, emigrated from Silesia in 1737 and settled in Goshenhoppen (now Bally), Pennsylvania, afterward purchasing a tract of several thousand acres in Berks County. After completing his education, the young Hiester engaged in the mercantile business in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. During the American Revolution, Hiester served as a colonel and later a brigadier general of the Pennsylvania Militia. He was a member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from 1778 to 1781. In 1784 he was elected to the supreme executive council of Pennsylvania, and later in 1787 he was appointed as a commissioner to negotiate the Connecticut land claims dispute. Hiester was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Pennsylvania, serving from March 4, 1789 until his resignation on July 1, 1796. He then moved to Hagerstown, Maryland, and was again elected to the House representing Maryland, serving from March 4, 1801, until his death in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 1804. He was among the number that voted to move the U.S. capital from Philadelphia to a place on the Potomac later named Washington, D.C. He was buried in Zion Reformed Graveyard in Hagerstown, Maryland and has a cenotaph at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington.

Their main goal is to have Japan, and the entire world, adopt communist policies. Ch≈´kaku-ha reject imperialism and the Stalinism. With the group being founded in 1957 of elements of the anti-Stalinist left.  History  Ch≈´kaku-ha was formed in January 1957. They were fervently anti-Stalinist. They believed the Stalinist form of communism, which was present in Eastern Europe, China, USSR and North Korea, did not elevate the working class as true as Marxist communism intends. Their goals at this time were to overthrow the Japanese government, stop U.S. occupation of the island of Okinawa, and abolish the Japan-US Security Alliance. The group evolved after two schisms into its current form. The first schism branched off separately from Ch≈´kaku- ha over a disagreement between degenerated workers and formed the Communist League (CL) in 1958. In 1959 another disagreement led to the addition of National Committee to the end of the name. In 1960 the Marxist Student League (MSL) would form as an unofficial youth branch of the Ch≈´kaku-ha. This was followed in 1961 by the creation of another unofficial youth branch, the Marxist Workers' Youth League (MWYL). In 1963 another disagreement would lead to the formation of JRCL Revolutionary Marxist Faction. Also this would bring about the name Middle Core Faction, as another way of referring to Ch≈´kaku-ha.

In 2017, the MPD announced the arrest of Masaaki Osaka, a known JRCL NC leader accused of killing a police officer during a riot on November 14, 1971. On that day, a protest against the occupation of Okinawa by the United States turned violent, with students throwing Molotov cocktails at officers.  Activities  Starting in 1967, Ch≈´kaku-ha, would become active in organizing protests, usually recruiting students as their protesters from both youth organizations, MSL and MWYL. Their first protest was against the Japanese Prime Minister Sato's visit to South Vietnam. In 1968, they protested the visit of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, , to Sasebo, Japan. That same year there was another protest of the Sinjuku Rail Station's transportation of US forces fuel tanks. In 1969, the organization promoted several protests at campuses across Japan. During the early 1970s the group was engaged in conflict with a rival organization known as Kakumaru. During the conflict, Kakumaru assassinated several members of Ch≈´kaku-ha. According to Ch≈´kaku-ha, Kakumaru was aided and protected by the police. Starting in the late 1970s, the group began committing armed assaults, bombings, and destruction of infrastructure in Japan.

Aiki-ken (Kanji: ÂêàÊ∞óÂâ£ Hiragana: „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Åç„Åë„Çì) is the name given specifically to the set of Japanese sword techniques practiced according to the principles of aikido, taught first by Morihei Ueshiba (aikido's founder), then further developed by Morihiro Saito, one of Ueshiba's most prominent students. Currently, Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai is the main proponent organization. Development Much of the aiki-ken syllabus was developed by Morihei Ueshiba (Ê§çËäù ÁõõÂπ≥ Ueshiba Morihei, 1883-1969) at his dojo in Iwama, Japan, at the same time he developed aikido's staff training (called aiki-j≈ç). It is well documented that Ueshiba studied several different styles of kenjutsu (Japanese swordsmanship), but the aiki-ken techniques are predominantly based upon the teachings of the Kashima Shint≈ç-ryu. The practice of aiki-ken is not pervasive. Some schools of aikido incorporate weapons training that is unrelated to aiki-ken, and others forego weapons training entirely. Practice Much of aiki-ken bears little similarity to other modern sword arts. Rather than learning to \\"fight\\" with swords, the primary purpose of aiki-ken is to magnify errors in one's aikido technique, and to give the student an opportunity to apply the principles of aikido in different situations. Aiki-ken is practiced using bokken (a wooden katana) and has a wide variety of techniques. Saito codified two sets of techniques, the first being seven suburi (solo cutting exercises), and the second being five partnered forms. Some dojo also practice jiyu-waza armed with bokken (freestyle technique, without a predetermined form of attack and response). =Suburi= , meaning \\"practice-swinging\\", is used to refer to the basic solo movements of aiki-ken, developed as a distillation of the partnered practice. There are seven aiki-ken suburi in Saito's tradition, and are very simply named as follows: #Ichi-no: A simple downward vertical cut. #Ni-no: Step back into j≈çdan-no-kamae, then a downward vertical cut. #San-no: Step back into waki-gamae, then a downward vertical cut. #Yon-no: Step forward with a downward vertical cut; repeat. #Go-no: Step forward while guarding, then a 70 degree downward cut; repeat. #Roku-no: Step forward with a downward vertical cut, then shuffle forward and thrust. #Shichi-no: Step forward while guarding, then a 70 degree downward cut, then step forward and thrust. =Kumitachi= The partnered forms practice of aiki-ken is called , meaning sword practice with a partner. There are five kumitachi in Saito's aiki-ken curriculum. The kumitachi teach students how to alternately control the center line and move off it to avoid attacks and how to blend with an opponent's attacks, among other skills. #Ichi-no-tachi (‰∏Ä„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): first of sword #Ni-no-tachi (‰∫å„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): second of sword #San-no-tachi (‰∏â„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): third of sword #Yon-no-tachi (Âõõ„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): fourth of sword #Go-no-tachi (‰∫î„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): fifth of sword #Kimusubi-no-tachi (Ê∞óÁµê„Å≥„ÅÆÂ§™ÂàÄ): blending one's energy with partner of sword Improvisational variations on the kumitachi (called henka), which generally cause the kumitachi form to end early with one person taking advantage of an opening to strike or throw the other, are also taught.

Most generals and staff officers of the Napoleonic period wore bicornes, and it survived as a widely worn full-dress headdress until at least 1914. Historic use Descended from the tricorne, the black-coloured bicorne originally had a rather broad brim, with the front and the rear halves turned up and pinned together forming a semi-circular fan shape; there was usually a cockade in the national colours at the front. Later, the hat became more triangular in shape, its two ends became more pointed, and it was worn with the cockade at the right side. This kind of bicorne eventually became known in the English language as the cocked hat, although to this day it is still known in the French language as the bicorne. Worn in the side-to-side athwart style during the 1790s, the bicorne was normally seen fore-and-aft in most armies and navies from about 1800 on. This change in style coincided with the flattening out of the pronounced front peak of the original headdress. The French gendarmerie continued to wear their bicornes in the classic side-to-side fashion until about 1904 as do the Italian Carabinieri in their modern full dress. Some forms of bicorne were designed to be folded flat, so that they could be conveniently tucked under the arm when not being worn. A bicorne of this style is also known as a chapeau-bras or chapeau-de-bras. The bicorne was widely worn until World War I as part of the full dress of officers of most of the world's navies. It survived to a more limited extent between the wars for wear by senior officers in the British, French, US, Japanese and other navies until World War II but has now almost disappeared in this context. In addition to its military/naval uses, the bicorne was widely worn during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by civilian officials in European monarchies and Japan, when required to wear uniforms on formal occasions. This practice generally ceased after World War I except in the context of diplomatic uniform. However British colonial governors in temperate climates and governors general in some countries of the Commonwealth (notably Australia, Canada and New Zealand) continued to wear bicornes with ceremonial dress until the second half of the twentieth century.  Cocked hat  British Army cocked hat with General officer's plume, worn by Lord Dannatt, (Constable of the Tower). By the twentieth century, the term cocked hat had come to be used more often than not in official UK usage (uniform regulations etc.) with reference to this shape of hat (particularly when worn as part of a uniform);E.g. Dress worn at Court, 1898ff, Lord Chamberlain's Office. however, in the rare instances where hats were directed to be worn side-to-side ('athwarts') rather than front-to-back‚Äîe.g. by footmen in full state livery‚Äîthe term bicorn tended to be preferred. In its most commonly seen form at this time, the cocked hat was pinned up at two sides to form a hump-back bridge shape and was worn perpendicular to the shoulders, with the front end above the face and the back end over the nape. A cockade in the national colours might be worn at the right side (French tradition) and a plume might be attached to the top (British military c. 1800). Cocked hats were often trimmed with gold or silver bullion lace and tassels. Naval officers wore them without further decorations, but those worn by military and civilian officials might be lavishly decorated with coloured ostrich or swan feathers.  Current use  The full-dress uniform of √âcole Polytechnique of France comprises black trousers with a red stripe (a skirt for women), a coat with golden buttons and a belt, and a cocked hat (officially called a bicorne). usher accompanying a federal councillor in Switzerland. Members of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise wear the habit vert (green habit) at the Acad√©mie's ceremonies. The habit includes a black jacket and a bicorne in the cocked-hat style, each embroidered in green. Students at the √âcole Polytechnique wear a bicorne as part of their Grand Uniforme (GU). Female students used to wear a tricorne hat but now also wear a bicorne. The bicorne also formed part of the historic black and red full dress of cadets at the French Military Medical School (\\"√âcole de Sante des Arm√©es\\") until this uniform was withdrawn in 1971, except for limited use on special occasions. The bicorne is still worn by the members of the Cadre Noir in full dress uniform. The uniform of the horsemen of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna includes a bicorne. Diplomatic uniforms worn on such occasions as the presentation of credentials by ambassadors normally included bicornes worn with feathers and gold or silver braiding. Until World War II such uniforms were worn by even junior embassy staff but now survive only for ambassadors in a few long-established diplomatic services such as those of Britain, France, Sweden, Belgium and Spain. In the United Kingdom cocked hats continue to be worn by certain office-holders on special occasions: *On occasions in Parliament when the Queen is represented by Lords Commissioners (e.g. at Prorogation) the Lords Commissioners wear plain black bicorne hats with their parliamentary robes (except the Lord Chancellor who, if present, wears his tricorne). *At the annual Trooping the Colour in London, the Major- General commanding the Household Division wears full dress uniform (as does his chief of staff) consisting of a scarlet tunic and a cocked hat with swan- feather plume. Similar hats with distinctive upright plumes are worn by the Equerries on this and other State occasions. *Senior officers holding certain royal or special appointments also wear cocked hats (e.g. officers of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, officers of the Yeomen of the Guard, etc.). *In most British regiments prior to 1914, certain Regimental Staff officers in full- dress uniform wore cocked hats in place of the usual regimental headdress. Since then, the use of full dress has been largely restricted to the Household Division, which maintains the tradition: quartermasters wear cocked hats with a feather of regimental colour, whilst Veterinary Officers and Medical Officers wear cocked hats with a red feather plume and black feather plume respectively. *Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police in full dress uniform. *Governors of United Kingdom overseas territories may wear a cocked hat with white swan-feather plume, or in tropical territories, a plumed pith helmet. Usage has declined since a 2001 decision by HM Treasury that the overseas territorial government concerned would be responsible for meeting the cost of their governor's optional ceremonial uniforms. *A cocked hat is still sometimes seen as part of Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom. In the Knights of Columbus, Fourth Degree Knights of the Color Corps may wear regalia which includes a chivalric chapeau. The color of the plume denotes the office held by the wearer. The Italian Carabinieri wear a bicorn with points sideways with their full dress uniform. The large tricolor cockade in front has given it the popular name of la \\"lucerna\\", the \\"lamp\\". In Java, a cocked hat is still in use in the parade uniform of the Dhaeng and Ketanggung brigades; both are from Yogyakarta Sultanate. Since the end of the Java War, they no longer function as combat troops. This cocked hat is known in Javanese as ' hat, because of its shape like a pointed nose, '. Only used on special occasions, such as Grebeg and other cultural or ceremonial events held by the kraton (palace), the headgear came as a part of Western influence in Yogyakarta, during the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IV.

It occurs when the view of a moving object is represented by a series of short samples as distinct from a continuous view, and the moving object is in rotational or other cyclic motion at a rate close to the sampling rate. It also accounts for the \\"wagon-wheel effect\\", so-called because in video, spoked wheels (such as on horse-drawn wagons) sometimes appear to be turning backwards. A strobe fountain, a stream of water droplets falling at regular intervals lit with a strobe light, is an example of the stroboscopic effect being applied to a cyclic motion that is not rotational. When viewed under normal light, this is a normal water fountain. When viewed under a strobe light with its frequency tuned to the rate at which the droplets fall, the droplets appear to be suspended in mid- air. Adjusting the strobe frequency can make the droplets seemingly move slowly up or down. Explanation Consider the stroboscope as used in mechanical analysis. This may be a \\"strobe light\\" that is fired at an adjustable rate. For example, an object is rotating at 60 revolutions per second: if it is viewed with a series of short flashes at 60 times per second, each flash illuminates the object at the same position in its rotational cycle, so it appears that the object is stationary. Furthermore, at a frequency of 60 flashes per second, persistence of vision smooths out the sequence of flashes so that the perceived image is continuous. If the same rotating object is viewed at 61 flashes per second, each flash will illuminate it at a slightly earlier part of its rotational cycle. Sixty-one flashes will occur before the object is seen in the same position again, and the series of images will be perceived as if it is rotating backwards once per second. The same effect occurs if the object is viewed at 59 flashes per second, except that each flash illuminates it a little later in its rotational cycle and so, the object will seem to be rotating forwards. The same could be applied at other frequencies like the 50 Hz characteristic of electric distribution grids of most of countries in the world. In the case of motion pictures, action is captured as a rapid series of still images and the same stroboscopic effect can occur. =Audio conversion from light patterns= The stroboscopic effect also plays a role in audio playback. Compact discs rely on strobing reflections of the laser from the surface of the disc in order to be processed (it is also used for computer data). DVDs and Blu-ray Discs have similar functions. The stroboscopic effect also plays a role for laser microphones. Wagon-wheel effect Propeller of a Bombardier Q400 taken with a digital camera showing the stroboscopic effect Motion-picture cameras conventionally film at 24 frames per second. Although the wheels of a vehicle are not likely to be turning at 24 revolutions per second (as that would be extremely fast), suppose each wheel has 12 spokes and rotates at only two revolutions per second. Filmed at 24 frames per second, the spokes in each frame will appear in exactly the same position. Hence, the wheel will be perceived to be stationary. In fact, each photographically captured spoke in any one position will be a different actual spoke in each successive frame, but since the spokes are close to identical in shape and color, no difference will be perceived. Thus, as long as the number of times the wheel rotates per second is factor of 24 and 12, the wheel will appear to be stationary. If the wheel rotates a little more slowly than two revolutions per second, the position of the spokes is seen to fall a little further behind in each successive frame and therefore, the wheel will seem to be turning backwards.  Unwanted effects in common lighting  Stroboscopic effect is one of the particular temporal light artefacts. In common lighting applications, the stroboscopic effect is an unwanted effect which may become visible if a person is looking at a moving or rotating object which is illuminated by a time-modulated light source. The temporal light modulation may come from fluctuations of the light source itself or may be due to the application of certain dimming or light level regulation technologies. Another cause of light modulations is the incompatibility of a lamp with an external dimmer. = Effects = Various scientific committees have assessed the potential health, performance and safety-related aspects resulting from temporal light modulations (TLMs) including stroboscopic effectIEEE Std 1789:2015, IEEE Recommended Practices for Modulating Current in High-Brightness LEDs for Mitigating Health Risks to viewers.

The visibility aspects of stroboscopic effect are given in a technical note of CIE, see CIE TN 006:2016CIE TN 006:2016, Visual Aspects of Time-Modulated Lighting Systems ‚Äì Definitions and Measurement Models.

Stroboscopic effects may also lead to unsafe situations in workplaces with fast moving or rotating machinery. If the frequency of fast rotating machinery or moving parts coincides with the frequency, or multiples of the frequency, of the light modulation, the machinery can appear to be stationary, or to move with another speed, potentially leading to hazardous situations. Stroboscopic effects that become visible in rotating objects are also referred to as the wagon-wheel effect. In general, undesired effects in the visual perception of a human observer induced by light intensity fluctuations are called Temporal Light Artefacts (TLAs). Further background and explanations on the different TLA phenomena including stroboscopic effect is given in a recorded webinar ‚ÄúIs it all just flicker?‚Äù 1\\\\. D. Sekulovski, Recording of webinar ‚ÄúIs it all just flicker?‚Äù (YouTube). In some special applications, TLMs may also induce desired effects. For instance, a stroboscope is tool that produces short repetitive flashes of light that can be used for measurement of movement frequencies or for analysis or timing of moving objects. Also stroboscopic visual training (SVT) is a recent tool aimed at improving visual and perceptual performance of sporters by executing activities under conditions of modulated lighting or intermittent visionLuke Wilkins, Carl Nelson, Simon Tweddle, Stroboscopic Visual Training: a Pilot Study with Three Elite Youth Football Goalkeepers, J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:3‚Äì11, DOI 10.1007/s41465-017-0038-z. = Root causes = Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional light variations are applied for warning, signalling (e.g. traffic-light signalling, flashing aviation light signals), entertainment (like stage lighting) with the purpose that flicker is perceived by people. Generally, the light output of lighting equipment may also have residual unintentional light level modulations due to the lighting equipment technology in connection with the type of electrical mains connection. For example, lighting equipment connected to a single-phase mains supply will typically have residual TLMs of twice the mains frequency, either at 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country). The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLMs will depend on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technology and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). If the modulation frequency is below the flicker fusion threshold and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level, then such TLMs are perceived as flicker. Light modulations with modulation frequencies beyond the flicker fusion threshold are not directly perceived, but illusions in the form of stroboscopic effect may become visible (example see Figure 1). Figure 1: Stroboscopic effect resulting from a moving screwdriver lit with a square- waveform modulated light source with a modulation frequency of 100 Hz, duty cycle of 50 % and 100 % modulation (SVM = 4,9); small photo inset shows absence of stroboscopic effect if screwdriver is not moved LEDs do not intrinsically produce temporal modulations; they just reproduce the input current waveform very well, and any ripple in the current waveform is reproduced by a light ripple because LEDs have a fast response; therefore, compared to conventional lighting technologies (incandescent, fluorescent), for LED lighting more variety in the TLA properties is seen. Many types and topologies of LED driver circuits are applied; simpler electronics and limited or no buffer capacitors often result in larger residual current ripple and thus larger temporal light modulation. Dimming technologies of either externally applied dimmers (incompatible dimmers) or internal light-level regulators may have additional impact on the level of stroboscopic effect; the level of temporal light modulation generally increases at lower light levels. NOTE ‚Äì The root cause temporal light modulation is often referred to as flicker. Also, stroboscopic effect is often referred to as flicker. Flicker is however a directly visible effect resulting from light modulations at relatively low modulation frequencies, typically below 80 Hz, whereas stroboscopic effect in common (residential) applications may become visible if light modulations are present with modulation frequencies, typically above 80 Hz. = Mitigation = Generally, undesirable stroboscopic effect can be avoided by reducing the level of TLMs. Design of lighting equipment to reduce the TLMs of the light sources is typically a tradeoff for other product properties and generally increases cost and size, shortens lifetime or lowers energy efficiency. For instance, to reduce the modulation in the current to drive LEDs, which also reduces the visibility of TLAs, a large storage capacitor, such as electrolytic capacitor, is required. However, use of such capacitors significantly shortens the lifetime of the LED, as they are found to have the highest failure rate among all components. Another solution to lower the visibility of TLAs is to increase the frequency of the driving current, however this decreases the efficiency of the system and it increases its overall size. = Visibility = Stroboscopic effect becomes visible if the modulation frequency of the TLM is in the range of 80 Hz to 2000 Hz and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level. Other important factors that determine the visibility of TLMs as stroboscopic effect are: * The shape of the temporary modulated light waveform (e.g. sinusoidal, rectangular pulse and its duty cycle); * The illumination level of the light source; * The speed of movement of the moving objects observed; * Physiological factors such as age and fatigue. Figure 2: Stroboscopic effect contrast threshold function (see Visibility) All observer-related influence quantities are stochastic parameters, because not all humans perceive the effect of same light ripple in the same way. That is why perception of stroboscopic effect is always expressed with a certain probability. For light levels encountered in common applications and for moderate speeds of movement of objects (connected to speeds that can be made by humans), an average sensitivity curve has been derived based on perception studiesMALGORZATA PERZ, DRAGAN SEKULOVSKI, INGRID VOGELS, AND INGRID HEYNDERICKX, Stroboscopic effect: contrast threshold function and dependence on illumination level, Vol. 35, No. 2 / February 2018 / Journal of the Optical Society of America A, pp. 309.. The average sensitivity curve for sinusoidal modulated light waveforms, also called the stroboscopic effect contrast threshold function, as a function of frequency f is as follows: T(f) = 2.865*10^{-5}*f^{1.543}+0.225 The contrast threshold function is depicted in Figure 2. Stroboscopic effect becomes visible if the modulation frequency of the TLM is in the region between approximately 10 Hz to 2000 Hz and if the magnitude of the TLM exceeds a certain level. The contrast threshold function shows that at modulation frequencies near 100 Hz, stroboscopic effect will be visible at relatively low magnitudes of modulation. Although stroboscopic effect in theory is also visible in the frequency range below 100 Hz, in practice visibility of flicker will dominate over stroboscopic effect in the frequency range up to 60 Hz. Moreover, large magnitudes of intentional repetitive TLMs with frequencies below 100 Hz are unlikely to occur in practice because residual TLMs generally occur at modulation frequencies that are twice the mains frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz). Detailed explanations on the visibility of stroboscopic effect and other temporal light artefacts are also given in CIE TN 006:2016 and in a recorded webinar ‚ÄúIs it all just flicker?‚Äù. = Objective assessment of stroboscopic effect =  Stroboscopic effect visibility meter  For objective assessment of stroboscopic effect the Stroboscopic effect Visibility Measure (SVM) has been developed. The specification of the stroboscopic effect visibility meter and the test method for objective assessment of lighting equipment is published in IEC technical report IEC TR 63158IEC TR 63158:2018 + COR 1, Equipment for general lighting purposes ‚Äì Objective test method for stroboscopic effects of lighting equipment, 2018-03-19.. SVM is calculated using the following summation formula: SVM=\\\\sqrt[3.7]{\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty \\\\displaystyle\\\\left ( \\\\frac{C_m}{T_m} \\\\right )^{3.7}}where, Cm is the relative amplitude of the m-th Fourier component (trigonometric Fourier series representation) of the relative illuminance (relative to the DC-level); Tm is the stroboscopic effect contrast threshold function for visibility of stroboscopic effect of a sine wave at the frequency of the m-th Fourier component (see Visibility). SVM can be used for objective assessment by a human observer of visible stroboscopic effects of temporal light modulation of lighting equipment in general indoor applications, with typical indoor light levels (> 100 lx) and with moderate movements of an observer or a nearby handled object (< 4 m/s). For assessing unwanted stroboscopic effects in other applications, such as the misperception of rapidly rotating or moving machinery in a workshop for example, other metrics and methods can be required or the assessment can be done by subjective testing (observation). NOTE ‚Äì Several alternative metrics such as Modulation Depth, Flicker Percentage or Flicker Index are being applied for specifying the stroboscopic effect performance of lighting equipment. None of these metrics are suitable to predict actual human perception because human perception is impacted by modulation depth, modulation frequency, wave shape and if applicable the duty cycle of the TLM.  Matlab toolbox  A Matlab stroboscopic effect visibility measure toolbox including a function for calculating SVM and some application examples are available on the Matlab Central via the Mathworks CommunityStroboscopic effect visibility measure toolbox Matlab Central..  Acceptance criterion  If the value of SVM equals one, the input modulation of the light waveform produces a stroboscopic effect that is just visible, i.e. at the visibility threshold. This means that an average observer will be able to detect the artefact with a probability of 50 %. If the value of the visibility measure is above unity, the effect has a probability of detection of more than 50 %. If the value of the visibility measure is smaller than unity, the probability of detection is less than 50 %. These visibility thresholds show the average detection of an average human observer in a population. This does not, however, guarantee acceptability. For some less critical applications, the acceptability level of an artefact might be well above the visibility threshold. For other applications, the acceptable levels might be below the visibility threshold. NEMA 77-2017NEMA 77-2017: Temporal Light Artifacts: Test Methods and Guidance for Acceptance Criteria.(link) amongst others gives guidance for acceptance criteria in different applications. Figure 3: Generic setup to test lighting equipment for its stroboscopic effect performance.  Test and measurement applications  A typical test setup for stroboscopic effect testing is shown in Figure 3. The stroboscopic effect visibility meter can be applied for different purposes (see IEC TR 63158): * Measurement of the intrinsic stroboscopic-effect performance of lighting equipment when supplied with a stable mains voltage; * Testing the effect of light regulation of lighting equipment or the effect of an external dimmer (dimmer compatibility). = Publication of standards development organisations = # CIE TN 006:2016: introduces terms, definitions, methodologies and measures for quantification of TLAs including stroboscopic effect. # IEC TR 63158:2018: includes the stroboscopic effect visibility meter specification and verification method, and test procedures a.o. for dimmer compatibility. # NEMA 77-2017: amongst others, flicker test Methods and guidance for acceptance criteria. Dangers in workplaces Stroboscopic effect may lead to unsafe situations in workplaces with fast moving or rotating machinery. If the frequency of fast rotating machinery or moving parts coincides with the frequency, or multiples of the frequency, of the light modulation, the machinery can appear to be stationary, or to move with another speed, potentially leading to hazardous situations. Because of the illusion that the stroboscopic effect can give to moving machinery, it is advised that single-phase lighting is avoided. For example, a factory that is lit from a single-phase supply with basic lighting will have a flicker of 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country, 50 Hz x 2 in Europe, 60 Hz x 2 in US, double the nominal frequency), thus any machinery rotating at multiples of 50 or 60 Hz (3000‚Äì3600rpm) may appear to not be turning, increasing the risk of injury to an operator. Solutions include deploying the lighting over a full 3-phase supply, or by using high-frequency controllers that drive the lights at safer frequencies or direct current lighting.

The organization was founded in 1994 by Dan and Betty Butler, and offers circus arts training to young people ranging from 3 to 21 years old. Emulating the style of Cirque du Soleil, Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent big top facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the Highland Park neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme. These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting students' occasional missteps during performances. Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area and abroad. As of 2014, Juventas was the largest youth performing arts circus in North America. The school had tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region. History The founders of Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as teenagers at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, went on to perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, \\"Wouldn't it be great if we could do something in ?\\" alt=A beige building with a large windowed rotunda stands before a wide lawn. The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as a nonprofit corporation in October 1994, citing a desire to give back to the community as one of the reasons for its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students. With the school's growing popularity, the Butlers saw the need for a larger space so they developed plans to build a 1,500-seat facility. In an article published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1997, the estimated cost of the project was quoted at $700,000, with a groundbreaking planned for April 1998. The Butlers initiated their capital campaign on February 18, 1998, with the goal of raising $1.1 million for their new building. By August 1999, they had raised $1 million of their expanded $1.6 million goal for the circus expansion, with plans to break ground on the new facility that November. Part of the funding came from Saint Paul's Sales Tax Revitalization (STAR) program, through which surplus funds were distributed by councilmembers to worthy organizations. A total of $627,183 was disbursed for the circus through the program, split between three STAR components: $450,000 as part of Neighborhood STAR which sought to fund local initiatives, $122,183 as part of Cultural STAR which funded arts and culture programs, and $55,000 from 3rd Ward City Councilmember Pat Harris's discretionary Neighborhood Investment Initiative budget. Another $60,000 came from an anonymous recently retired Saint Paul businessperson. alt=A round, green building with a white tent-like roof stands against a clear summer sky. The $1.6 million were raised in full by the end of April 2000, just in time to ensure the circus received its STAR funding which would have been nullified if the Butlers had not made their fundraising goal by May 5 of that year. The Butlers had found the space for the school through coincidence; after driving along Montreal Avenue in Saint Paul one night, they turned into a parking lot, noticed an area beneath some trees, and realized it was an ideal location for their school's expanded facility. On August 25, 2000, ground was broken on the new structure. The big top took about a year to complete, during which time the school also changed its name to Circus Juventas, named for Juventas, an ancient Roman goddess of youth and rejuvenation. Ultimately, the project totaled $2.1 million and by 2006, the school was $700,000 in debt. It was working with various city agencies to resolve the shortfall and faced \\"no looming threat.\\" The school relies heavily on parent volunteers to help with various operational aspects, from rigging to administrative work to set construction and decoration, and concessions sales. Betty Butler estimated that 90 percent of work on the school's shows is done by parent volunteers. The circus operates with the equivalent of 40 full-time employees. In 2010, the circus school enrolled students from ages 6 to 21, with an additional enrollment of about 150 toddlers and other younger participants as young as three years old. By 2013, the enrollment had reached over 800 and the school's annual operating budget exceeded $2 million. Circus Juventas has also held circus arts fitness classes for adults, taught by the school's regular instructors. The school is a member of the Outdoor Amusement Business Association and the F√©d√©ration Mondiale du Cirque. A listing on the latter organization's website notes that as of 2014, Juventas is the largest performing arts circus school for youth in the United States; other sources indicate that it is the largest in all of North America. Facilities Circus Juventas's big top is located in the Highland Park neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota. It stands tall and encompasses of floor space built on concrete slab. The structure is supported by an aluminum frame and covered with flame- resistant vinyl-coated cloth. The building's lobby space was designed by Locus Architecture, Ltd., of Minneapolis. The firm connected texteline fabric (often used for awnings) to the system of catwalks and supports to help \\"the lobby act...as an immersion tank, rather than a threshold, to introduce spectators to the illusion of the world of circus.\\" Although Locus was still installing the fabric within hours of the circus's gala opening, the company won one of the 10 honor awards distributed in 2002 by the Minnesota branch of the American Institute of Architects for their design. The circus school's original bleachers could seat 1,200 audiencemembers. =Bleacher collapse= alt=People mill about next to and atop a set of toppled black bleachers. On August 16, 2009, at the closing performance of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March. =Future= In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional . The additional space would house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a gym. Naming rights for the new structure would provide a component of the $4 million the school hoped to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus's endowment, and eventual repairs to the building's exterior, estimated at $1 million. Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create \\"a true professional program, a separate program\\" for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school. According to Saint Paul's Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy was deemed unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion's proposed size. In response, the Butlers were considering building a new facility of up to in the western suburbs of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million, require a capital campaign to fund, and probably not begin for five to 10 years. In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to its Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014. Performances The school typically puts on two shows each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show to display the talents of more advanced students. While the earliest shows were focused primarily on technique and the individual acts, by 1997 or 1998 the school began to emphasize the artistic side of performances, including integrating those acts into Cirque du Soleil-style narratives. The school also hosts an annual gala in late autumn that includes portions of the year's earlier summer performance. Circus Juventas does not utilize animal acts in its shows. =Big top summer shows= * 2001: Mythos, a production dealing with Greek mythology was performed not only in Circus Juventas's newly opened permanent big top facility but also at the Minnesota State Capitol on New Year's Eve, 2001. * 2002: Cirque Napoleon, a show that delved into the history of circus, taking place in a French circus in 1859 and honoring Jules L√©otard, an early trapeze artist. * 2003: Taroq, a production set in Morocco following four traveling nomads on a quest to determine the meaning of life. * 2004: Swash, a pirate-themed performance that entailed a quest for lost treasure. * 2005: Dyrnwych, a production that included \\"an amalgam of fairy- tale types, with wicked hag witches, trolls, forest spirits, and warrior women.\\" * 2006: Pazzanni, a retelling of the story of Cinderella, inspired by 1500s Venetian carnivales and featuring masks designed by the maskmaker responsible for those used in the 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut. * 2007: Atlanticus, a performance set under the oceans in the domain of Poseidon. * 2008: RavensManor, a haunted house-themed show, based loosely on the Haunted Mansion ride located in Disneyland.

Performers have appeared at local events including the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak's 2002 inauguration at the Minneapolis City Hall, and at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts as part of the Flint Hills International Children's Festival. Students have presented their work at a variety of local public, retail, and theater spaces. Students have also participated non-Juventas shows, including a 2004 Minnesota Fringe Festival production, the 2005 world premiere of Tin Forest with the Minnesota Orchestra at Orchestra Hall, the Children's Theatre Company's 2008 stage adaptation of Madeline and the Gypsies, and the 2012 adaptation of Jack Prelutsky's The Dragons Are Singing Tonight at The Southern Theater. In 2010, a cohort of Juventas students traveled to perform in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at the RiverRocks Festival. Outside the United States, performers have traveled to compete, including at the International Circus Festival in Latina, Italy, and at the Circus Ring of Friendship Festival in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden, in which the troupe's triple trapeze team garnered the gold medal. In April 2015, a Circus Juventas spinning cube team performed at the Circus Waldoni Festival in Darmstadt, Germany, where they tied for first place. Students from the school will perform at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., in June and July 2017. Music alt=A white- haired man in a red T-shirt plays mandolin. Much of the accompaniment for the big top summer shows came from Peter Ostroushko, a local mandolin player. Ostroushko, known for his work on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion, became involved in the youth circus after his daughter saw a show and decided to join. In 2005, the Butlers discovered Ostroushko's affinity for the mandolin and fiddle, and asked if he would play a Celtic song at the premiere of their upcoming summer big top show, Dyrnwych. He happily agreed, having expressed a lifelong dream of joining a circus, and played the track, \\"See It There/Con Cassidy's\\", not only at Dyrnwych opening but also at each of its subsequent 18 performances. The following year, he composed original music for the 2006 Juventas show, Pazzanni, and expanded his band to five members, including himself on mandolin, fiddle, and mandocello, Marc Anderson on percussion, Dan Chouinard on piano, accordion, and keyboard, Dirk Freymuth on electric and acoustic guitars, and Joel Sayles on electric and acoustic bass guitars. Ostroushko again provided a score for Atlanticus and RavensManor, continued in 2010 with Sawdust, then Grimm, and finally Showdown. Tracks from the first four shows for which he played, from Dyrnwych to RavensManor, are anthologized on the album Peter Joins the Circus, published by Borderland Productions in 2008. Reception Jando Dominique, reporting for Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as \\"always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press.\\" Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a St. Paul Pioneer Press review of Oz comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, \\"Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?\\" Writing for Minnesota Monthly, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's Showdown: \\"There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros.\\" In Spectacle, Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have \\"a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter.\\" Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, \\"at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [Grimm] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers.\\" Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that \\"there are moments ‚Äì just a few stand out ‚Äì when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always.\\" Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, \\"Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive.\\" Notes References =Cited=  * External links * * Category:Circus schools Category:Culture of Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Education in Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Tourist attractions in Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Arts organizations established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"Circus Juventas"},{"id":"1135229","text":"Breezy Point can refer to a community in the United States: *Breezy Point, Minnesota, a city in Crow Wing County *Breezy Point, Queens, New York, a neighborhood on the Rockaway Peninsula See also * Point Breeze (disambiguation) * Breezy (disambiguation) * Point (disambiguation) ","title":"Breezy Point"},{"id":"1135237","text":"Wolfurt is a municipality in the western Austrian state of Vorarlberg.

Facing St Peter's Square, it was designed by E. Vincent Harris and constructed between 1930 and 1934. The form of the building, a columned portico attached to a rotunda domed structure, is loosely derived from the Pantheon, Rome. At its opening, one critic wrote, \\"This is the sort of thing which persuades one to believe in the perennial applicability of the Classical canon\\". The library building is grade II* listed. A four-year project to renovate and refurbish the library commenced in 2010. Central Library re-opened on 22 March 2014. History =Background= Manchester was the first local authority to provide a public lending and reference library after the passing of the Public Libraries Act 1850. The Manchester Free Library opened at Campfield in September 1852 at a ceremony attended by Charles Dickens. When the Campfield premises were declared to be unsafe in 1877, the library was moved to the old Town Hall in King Street. The library moved again to what is now Piccadilly Gardens, to the former outpatients wing of Manchester Royal Infirmary and an old YMCA hut in 1912. In 1926 the city council held a competition to design an extension to the town hall and a central library. E. Vincent Harris was selected to design both buildings. His circular design for the library, reminiscent of the Pantheon in Rome, was based on libraries in America. The library's foundation stone was laid on 6 May 1930 by the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The library was officially opened by King George V on 17 July 1934 after he had laid the foundation stone for the Town Hall Extension. Manchester Central Library at Night In 1934 the Blind Collection from Deansgate and the Commercial Library from the Royal Exchange were moved to the library. The Chinese Library Service was set up in 1968. =Opening= Central Library opened in 1934 to much fanfare. Singer-songwriter Ewan MacColl reminisced on the opening: \\"The new Central Library which replaced the chicken house was an imposing circular structure with an enormous reading room, a small theatre and carrels where serious students could carry on their research without interruption. The portico of the magnificent edifice quickly became a popular rendezvous and \\"Meet you at the Ref\\" became a familiar phrase on the lips of students, lovers and unemployed youths. I was there on the opening day and on many days thereafter; the Ref played an important part in my life for I made many friends there.\\" The library was declared open by King George V on 17 July 1934. George V declared to the crowd: \\"In the splendid building which I am about to open, the largest library in this country provided by a local authority, the Corporation have ensured for the inhabitants of the city magnificent opportunities for further education and for the pleasant use of leisure.\\" An employee at the library who was present on opening day said: \\"When it was being built the public were very intrigued about its final appearance ‚Äì they were used to rectangular buildings and the shape of the girders used seemed to make little sense. I remember families coming in first to \\"gawp\\"... Under the portico became a favourite trysting place. In all, the shape of the building was its best advertisement and it was never necessary to put a notice 'Public Library' on the outside.\\" =Renovation= Reports emerged in 2008 that the Central Library needed essential renovation to repair and modernise its facilities. The library faced asbestos problems and needed work to maintain its 'structural integrity'. The Central Library closed from 2010 to 2014 for refurbishment and expansion. During the closure its collections were stored in the Winsford Rock Salt Mine; some of the books in the stack joined collections at Greater Manchester County Record Office. Some of its services were available at a temporary location nearby. During renovation, a temporary community library for the city centre was established on Deansgate. Central Library re-opened on 22 March 2014 after a ¬£40 million re-design. The project delivered by Laing O'Rourke won the Construction News Judges Supreme Award in June 2015. It was described as an almost impossibly complex project completed on schedule and within budget. The indoor plan is now very different. What was the theatre in the basement is now part of the library. A wall was knocked through, making an indoor connection between the library and Manchester Town Hall. The Library Theatre Company will move to their new theatre at HOME (Manchester) in May 2015. Architecture The central Wolfson Reading Room in 2014. The Shakespeare Hall entrance in 2014. The exterior of the library The Ceiling in the entrance Designed by architect Vincent Harris, the striking rotunda form of the library was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Like its 2nd-century model, the library is a round building fronted by a large two-storey portico which forms the main entrance on St Peter's Square, and is surrounded by five bays of Corinthian columns. Around the second and third floors is a Tuscan colonnade, topped by a band of unrelieved Portland stone. The pitched leaded roof appears from street level to be a dome, but this is only a surrounding roof. The dome that can be seen from within the Great Hall lies within this roof, and cannot be seen from the ground. On the first floor is the Great Hall, a large reading room topped by a dome. Much of the original furniture designed by the architect can be seen on this floor. Around the rim of the dome is an inscription from the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament: In former years the dome's acoustics caused an echo problem, which repeated several times any short noise made in the room. Adding sound-absorbing material reduced this effect. The Shakespeare Hall is an ornate chamber displaying local heraldry and with large stained glass windows. The central window was designed by Robert Anning Bell and depicts William Shakespeare and scenes from his plays. Two side windows designed by George Kruger Gray depict the coats of arms of the City of Manchester, the University of Manchester, and the County and Duchy of Lancaster. The windows were a memorial bequest to the library by Rosa E. Grindon (1848‚Äì1923), the widow of Manchester botanist Leo Grindon.She was the author of Shakespeare & his plays from a woman's point of view, published in 1930. The ceiling decorations include the arms and crests of the Duchy of Lancaster, the See of York, the See of Manchester, the City of Manchester, and Lancashire County Council. The walls of Shakespeare Hall are covered with Hopton Wood stone quarried in Derbyshire. On the walls are the arms of The Manchester Grammar School, Manchester University, the Manchester Regiment, Humphrey Chetham, the Overseers of the Township, England, St. George, St. Mary (patron saint of Manchester), and over the memorial window, Shakespeare. On the left landing is a white marble statue, the Reading Girl by the Italian sculptor Giovanni Ciniselli. It was bought by the industrialist and promoter of the Manchester Ship Canal, Daniel Adamson. The statue was presented to the library by his grandchildren, the Parkyn family, in 1938. Collections The new Lending Library in 2014. It is the second largest public lending library in Britain, after the Library of Birmingham. Beneath the Great Hall were four floors of steel book stacks providing 35 miles of shelving which accommodated one million books: video. Those floors were only accessible to employees and were environmentally controlled to protect books, many of which are old and fragile. The upper two stack floors occupied all the area under the dome. The fourth level, the Archive unit, was in the basement of the building. The lower two stack floors were smaller because the basement theatre took some of that area. In 2011 when the library closed for the alterations, there were 3600 stack columns supporting approximately 45,000 shelves; those columns were rooted in the sandstone rock underneath and supported the Great Hall's reinforced concrete floor. Placed end to end, those shelves would have covered over . The total floor area was about . After the 2010‚Äì2014 alterations, many of the former stack books (except rare or valuable or fragile books) are on public shelves. The library collections include over 30 incunabula (books published before 1500) and many first and early editions of major works. The special collections include: * The Gaskell Collection ‚Äì works by Elizabeth Gaskell, one of the most important writers to have lived and worked in the city * The Theatre Collection ‚Äì a record of the history of theatre in Manchester * The Newman Flower Collection of Handel Manuscripts ‚Äì works by George Frederic Handel, as well as items of Italian music from the early 18th century, including the Manchester Violin SonatasAntonio Vivaldi, Manchester Violin Sonatas (1720, reprinted 1976) by Antonio Vivaldi (previously undiscovered violin sonatas autographed by the composer) and the Four Seasons concerto partbooks. Library Theatre The Library Theatre occupied much of the basement of Manchester Central Library and was the home of the Library Theatre Company, a Manchester City Council service. It was built in 1934 as a lecture theatre, and since 1952 had been used by the Library Theatre Company. After the 2011‚Äì2014 alterations its area is now part of the library. A new theatre opened on First Street in partnership with Cornerhouse, Manchester in 2015. Famous users The conductor Sir John Barbirolli, was a regular user of the Music Library. Ewan MacColl, folk singer and playwright, educated himself in the library. Anthony Burgess, the author who wrote the novel A Clockwork Orange, was a regular visitor to the library during his school days. In a volume of his autobiography, Little Wilson and Big God (1987) he recounted his visit to the index system, then in temporary accommodation in Piccadilly, Manchester, where he met an older woman who took him to her flat in Ardwick where she seduced him (p. 121, 1988 Penguin ed.) Morrissey studied in the library for his A Level exams. Statistics In 1968 it was recorded that the adult lending stock was 895,000, the adult reference stock 638,200, the junior stock 114,600, a total of nearly one and two thirds of a million volumes. There were about 2,000 reading places and an estimated 10,000 people visited the library each day. There were subscriptions to 3,000 periodicals.Cotton, G. B.

In addition to covering music, Punk Planet also covered visual arts and a wide variety of progressive issues ‚Äî including media criticism, feminism, and labor issues. The most notable features in Punk Planet were the interviews and album reviews. The interviews generally ran two or three pages, and tended to focus on the motivations of the artist (or organizer, activist, or whoever) being interviewed. Punk Planet tried to review nearly all the records it received, so long as the record label wasn't owned or partially owned by a major label. This led to a review section typically longer than thirty pages, covering a variety of musical styles. Although much of the music thus reviewed was, expectedly, aggressive rock, the reviews also covered country, folk, hip-hop, indie rock, and other genres. The Punk Planet reviews section also encompassed independently released comics, zines, and DVDs. A number of poor distribution deals and the collapse of the Independent Press Association resulted in mounting debts for the editors. As a result, issue 80 was shipped with a cover reading: \\"This is the final issue of Punk Planet, after this the fight is yours.\\" Subsidiary business Punk Planet books remains in business.  History and other projects  The first issue of the zine was published in May 1994, in part as a response to the perception that Maximum Rock and Roll was becoming too elitist. In September 2006, Punk Planet had printed 75 issues of their bi-monthly publication, and in the fall of 2004 launched a book publishing arm, Punk Planet Books, in conjunction with the New York-based small press Akashic Books. Punk Planet Books has published four titles as of May 2006: \\"Hairstyles of the Damned\\" by Joe Meno (August 2004, ), ‚ÄúAll the Power: Revolution Without Illusion‚Äù by Mark Andersen (September 2004, ), ‚ÄúLessons in Taxidermy‚Äù by Bee Lavender (March 2005, ), and \\"100 Posters, 134 Squirrels\\" by Jay Ryan (November 2005, ). In September 2006, Punk Planet partnered with the website, ZineWiki, to publish, online, exclusive articles from past print issues. On June 18, 2007, a post at www.punkplanet.com informed the public that after 13 years and 80 issues, Punk Planet's final issue was being sent out. The reasoning pointed to \\"bad distribution deals, disappearing advertisers, and a decreasing audience of subscribers.\\" As a result, editor Dan Sinker decided to place his focus on the online website, but it has since gone offline. In its place is a statement, \\"This is it, folks. The Punk Planet website is closed.

The club was founded on 21 April 1943, during World War II, as a result of local clubs based in the city coming together to form one large club. From 1992 to 2007, the club was referred to as FC Nantes Atlantique before reverting to its current name at the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season. Nantes play in Ligue 1, the first division of Football in France. Nantes is one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight Ligue 1 titles, three Coupe de France wins and attained one Coupe de la Ligue victory. The club is famous for its jeu √† la nantaise (\\"Nantes-style play\\"), its collective spirit, mainly advocated under coaches Jos√© Arribas, Jean-Claude Suaudeau and Raynald Denoueix and for its youth system, which has produced players such as Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps, Micka√´l Landreau, Claude Mak√©l√©l√©, Christian Karembeu and J√©r√©my Toulalan. As well as Les Canaris (The Canaries), Nantes is also nicknamed Les jaunes et verts (The Green and Yellows) and La Maison Jaune (The Yellow House). History The club was founded in 1943. The first match played by Nantes as a professional team took place at the Stade Olympique de Colombes against CA Paris, where Nantes triumphed 2‚Äì0. The first home match was a defeat of the same score against Troyes. The club finished fifth at the end of this first season following which the club's manager Aim√© Nuic left the club following a dispute, and was succeeded by Antoine Raab, who took over in a player-coach role. After winning 16 consecutive matches, Nantes lost 9‚Äì0 to Sochaux. Supporters at an away match In July 1991, the club re-instated Jean-Claude Suaudeau, and in July 1992, after spending a fortnight in the second division due to an administrative decision by the DNCG (French Football's financial regulator), FC Nantes was renamed FC Nantes Atlantique, and was able to take its place in the first division back. They won the French championship in 1994/95 and in 2000/01. In 2005, Nantes narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season by defeating Metz 1-0. In 2007 Nantes finished last in Ligue 1 and were relegated to Ligue 2 after spending 44 consecutive seasons in Ligue 1. In 2008, Nantes were promoted back to Ligue 1 at the first attempt but the following season they were relegated back to Ligue 2 after finishing 19th on the table. After spending 3 seasons in Ligue 2, Nantes were once again promoted to Ligue 1 in 2013. In their first season back in the top division, Nantes avoided relegation finishing 13th on the table. After two years of stability, in the 2016/2017 Ligue 1 season, Nantes finished a highly respectable 7th on the table. For the 2017‚Äì18 season, former Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri took over as manager and after 10 games in charge had Nantes sitting 3rd on the table just behind big spending Paris Saint-Germain and AS Monaco. In the second half of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Nantes managed to only win 3 more games and finished 9th on the table. Claudio Ranieri also announced his departure from the club after only one season.https://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2018/feature-claudio-ranieris- spell-at-nantes-ends-this-evening-the-story-of-how-a-leicester-esque-campaign- turned-sour/http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/classement In the 2018‚Äì19 season, Nantes appointed Vahid Halilhod≈æiƒá as their new manager. In January 2019, the club was rocked by the news that former player Emiliano Sala had died in a plane crash over the English Channel. Nantes would end up finishing the season in 12th place. The club enjoyed a mixed campaign with the highlight being an upset victory over Paris Saint-Germain and also claiming wins over Marseille and Lyon.

Nantes' moved to their current home ground Stade de la Beaujoire- Louis Fontenau in 1984, the stadium has a capacity of 38,128. A new stadium dubbed 'YelloPark' was expected to be built and replace the Stade de la Beaujoire-Louis Fontenau as Nantes' home ground in 2022, but the project was abandoned on 26 February 2019 following refusal by the Nantes Metropolitan Council to sell lands needed for development of the site.

A remake of the 1960 film 13 Ghosts by William Castle, the film stars Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, Rah Digga, and F. Murray Abraham. It was released to theaters on October 26, 2001, shot entirely around Lower Mainland, British Columbia.  Plot  Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos and his psychic assistant Dennis Rafkin lead a team on a mission to capture a spirit called the Juggernaut. Several men, including Cyrus, are killed while the team is able to catch the ghost. Cyrus's nephew Arthur, a widower, is informed by Cyrus's estate lawyer, Ben Moss, that he has inherited Cyrus' mansion. Financially insecure, Arthur decides to move there with his two children, Kathy and Bobby, and their nanny, Maggie. Dennis meets the family as they tour the mansion. The residence is made entirely of glass sheets inscribed with Latin phrases, which Dennis recognizes as barrier spells. He discovers that the twelve angry ghosts he and Cyrus captured are imprisoned in the house, held captive by the spells. As he warns Arthur, Moss unwittingly triggers a mechanism that seals the house and releases the ghosts. He dies when a set of sliding doors cut him in half. Bobby sees several of the ghosts, including the Withered Lover - his mother Jean, who had died of injuries sustained in a house fire. He is knocked unconscious and dragged away. Dennis uses a pair of spectral glasses that allow the wearer to see the supernatural realm to avoid the ghosts. The Jackal, one of the most dangerous of the twelve, attacks Kathy and Arthur but they are saved by Kalina Oretzia, a spirit liberator who is attempting to free the ghosts. Kathy disappears, and the four adults gather in the library, where Arthur learns that Jean's ghost is also in the house. Kalina explains that the house is a machine, powered by the captive ghosts, that allows its user to see the past, present, and future. The only way to shut it down is through the creation of a thirteenth ghost from a sacrifice of love. Arthur realizes that he must become that ghost to save his children. Armed with the spectral glasses, Arthur and Dennis enter the basement to find the children. Dennis barricades Arthur behind glass to save him and allows the Hammer and the Juggernaut to beat Dennis to death. It is revealed that Cyrus faked his death to lure Arthur to the house; Kalina is his partner. Cyrus has orchestrated the abduction of Kathy and Bobby so that Arthur will become the thirteenth ghost, which will not stop the machine as Kalina had claimed, but trigger its activation. Cyrus kills Kalina and summons the ghosts to activate the machine. In the main hall, Arthur witnesses all twelve ghosts orbiting a clockwork device of rotating metal rings, with his children at the center. He fights Cyrus while Maggie disrupts the machine's controls, releasing the ghosts from its power and causing the machine to go haywire. The ghosts hurl Cyrus into the moving rings, slicing him to pieces. With the encouragement of Dennis' ghost, Arthur jumps into the machine and saves his children. The walls of the house shatter as the malfunctioning machine rips itself apart, freeing the ghosts. Jean's ghost tells them she loves them before she disappears. Maggie angrily declares she quits her nanny job, and the family peacefully leave the house.  Cast   The Ghosts  While the backstories for nearly all the ghosts are not mentioned in the movie, they are hinted at and are explicitly described in the \\"Ghost Files\\", a special feature on the DVD, with Cyrus as the narrator. With a few exceptions, they seem to become more dangerous as their numbers increase. * The First Born Son: A ghost of a little bratty boy named Billy Michaels, who loved to pretend to be a cowboy. One day, another little kid challenged Billy to a duel, but Billy‚Äôs cap gun was no match for that boy‚Äôs real steel- tipped arrow that Billy's ghost still carries. Unlike most of the ghosts, this one is a mild threat, never attacking anyone and just saying \\"I want to play.\\" * The Torso: Jimmy 'The Gambler' Gambino was a gambler in the early 1900s, who caught the attention of the Mafia. After he lost a boxing bet and didn‚Äôt have the money to pay up, the Mafia cut him into pieces and wrapped him in cellophane, dumping the remains in the ocean. His ghost appears as a torso with a severed head nearby, and is more a neutral spirit than actively hostile. * The Bound Woman: Susan LeGrow was the richest girl in town and was very popular. Her one flaw was the way she toyed with boys and men. During her senior prom night, she was killed by a jilted ex named Chet Walters, a star quarterback, after catching her cheating with another guy. Her ghost lures Bobby into the dangerous basement and still shows in her prom attire, bound ropes holding her arms. * The Withered Lover: Jean Kriticos was a happy and devoted wife and mother. She died as a result of fire injuries at St Luke's Hospital half a year before the events of the film begin. Unlike most of the ghosts, she is not dangerous; she is benevolent. * The Torn Prince: Royce Clayton was a gifted and famous teenage baseball player in the 1940s and ‚Äò50s who caught the eye of colleges around the USA. Thanks to his challenger, a greaser who set him up, Royce died in an accident caused by cut brake lines. His remains are still buried at the baseball diamond, and his ghost carries his baseball bat. * The Angry Princess: Dana Newman was a beautiful but abused lady who lived in the later 1900s. She had plastic surgeries to alter her perceived flaws, and after a botched experiment that mutilated her eye, she brutally killed herself in a bathtub at the clinic. Her ghost often carries blood, is naked, and carries the same knife she used to commit suicide. * The Pilgrimess: Isabella Smith came to North America as a colonist in order to find a new life after being an orphan in England. The tight-knit community ostracized and ignored her and used her as a scapegoat, being accused of witchcraft when crops and animals mysteriously died. She denied such accusations, but she was trapped in a burning barn but managed to escape unharmed. That sealed her fate, and she died of starvation after being condemned to the pillory that she carries with her as a ghost; her skin is badly damaged. * The Great Child: Harold Shelburne was a special-needs man who never outgrew diapers and had to be spoon fed even as a fully grown adult; he often made baby sounds. After being mocked, teased and tormented relentlessly all his life, he caused a massacre at the old freak show where he and his mother, Margaret Shelburne, lived. Some of the freaks had kidnapped and killed his mother as a joke one night. The circus owner, Jimbo, had Harold mutilated beyond recognition. His ghost appears as Harold did in life, with a small patch of hair, a bib covered in vomit and cloth diapers; he still holds the ax that he used to kill his enemies. * The Dire Mother: Margaret Shelburne, Harold‚Äôs mother, was a shy little lady, standing three feet tall. She never could stand up for herself. At the freak show where she lived, she was raped by the Tall Man, another circus freak, and gave birth to her illegitimate son Harold, whom she loved more than life itself. She smothered and spoiled him from infancy and never stopped as he grew; this is the main reason for Harold's mental handicap. The two were abused to the point where Harold killed almost the entire circus after Margaret died. As ghosts, they remain together, with Harold being protective. Like the Torso, she is not aggressive. * The Hammer: A happy and honest family man and blacksmith, George Markeley was falsely accused of stealing by a higher up named Nathan, and threatened with exile from their old Western town. George refused to leave, and his family was lynched by Nathan and his band of thugs while walking home from the town market one day. Seeking justice in the corrupt town, George took his blacksmith's hammer and killed those responsible, but the townsfolk chained him to a tree and drove railroad spikes into his body. His left hand was cut off and his hammer was crudely attached to it. His ghost is one of the more angry spirits, and is partially responsible for Dennis' death. * The Jackal: Born to a prostitute in 1887, Ryan Khun developed a sick appetite for women, attacking and raping strays and prostitutes in the night. He voluntarily went to Borehamwood Institute for treatment to cure this problem, but the medical practices made him much worse, causing him to go completely insane after years of solitary confinement, having his head locked in a cage after breaking out of his straitjacket, and developing a hatred of humanity. When the asylum burst into flames, he chose to stay behind and perish in the fire. His ghost carries his torn straight jacket with the torn cubic head cage; it is called a sign of Hell's Winter. * The Juggernaut: Horace 'Breaker' Mahoney was born very disfigured and was an outcast his entire life. His mother abandoned him at a tender age, and his dad put him to work in the junkyard, using his unusual strength to crush cars. After his dad died, Horace went insane: He would take motorists and hitchhikers, tear them apart with his bare hands and feed the remains to his dogs. After several of these murders, he was arrested. A SWAT team shot and killed him when he broke free of his hand cuffs. As a ghost, he remained at the junkyard with his body riddled with bullet holes, killing intruders. Both Dennis and Cyrus remark that his kill count numbered in the 40s, making this ghost one of the most evil and dangerous of the twelve.  Release  In the US, the film opened ranking 2nd, making $15,165,355. It spent 10 weeks in the US box office, eventually making $41,867,960 domestically, and $68,467,960 worldwide.  Reception  Reviews for the film were mostly negative. Praise was directed toward the production design but the film was criticized for its lack of scares and a number of strobe effects throughout that could cause seizures. It holds an approval rating of 15% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 94 reviews with an average rating of 3.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The production design is first rate, but 13 Ghosts is distinctly lacking in scares.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert praised the production values saying, \\"The production is first-rate...The physical look of the picture is splendid.\\" However, he criticized the story, lack of interesting characters, loud soundtrack, and poor editing. In 2005 he included it on his list of \\"Most Hated\\" films.

Plot When occultist uncle Dr. Plato Zorba wills a huge ramshackle house to his nephew Cyrus and his impoverished family, they are shocked to find the house is haunted. Their furnished residence comes complete with a creepy housekeeper, Elaine, plus a fortune in buried treasure and 12 horrifying ghosts. His family soon discovers that these spirits include a wailing lady, clutching hands, a fiery skeleton, an Italian chef murdering his wife and her lover in the kitchen, a hanging lady, an executioner holding a severed head, a fully grown lion with its headless tamer, a floating head (presumably belonging to the tamer), as well as that of Plato Zorba himself, all held captive in the eerie house looking for an unlucky thirteenth ghost to free them. Dr. Zorba leaves a set of special goggles, the only way of seeing the ghosts. However, there is someone in the house who is also looking for the hidden fortune in money and is willing to kill for it. The villain turns out to be the lawyer, Benjamen Rush. He attempts to kill Cyrus' son, Buck, using the falling bed canopy Rush had used to kill Dr. Zorba, whose ghost catches him in the act, driving the terrified Rush to his death in the bed just as Buck escapes. Rush becomes the 13th ghost, and the ghosts disappear. The next morning, Cyrus and his family count the discovered money, Buck keeps the mask used by Benjamen Rush to scare Buck's older sister, Medea, and they decide to stay, with a fortune in cash. At the end of the film the special goggles are blown into smithereens by an unknown force, witnessed by Elaine, who gets a broom and permits herself a small enigmatic smile. Cast *Charles Herbert as Buck Zorba *Jo Morrow as Medea Zorba *Rosemary DeCamp as Hilda Zorba *Martin Milner as Benjamen Rush *Donald Woods as Cyrus Zorba *Margaret Hamilton as Elaine Zacharides *John van Dreelen as Van Allen Illusion-O As with several of his more famous productions, Castle used a gimmick to promote 13 Ghosts. Audience members were given a choice: the \\"brave\\" ones could watch the film and see the ghosts in 3D. In the theaters most scenes were black-and-white, but scenes involving ghosts were shown in a \\"process\\" dubbed \\"Illusion-O.\\" The filmed elements of the actors and the sets ‚Äî everything except the ghosts ‚Äî had a blue filter applied to the footage, while the ghost elements had a red filter and were superimposed over the frame. Audiences received viewers with red and blue cellophane filters. Unlike early 3D glasses, where one eye is red and the other is cyan or blue, the Illusion-O viewer required people to look through a single color with both eyes. Choosing to look through the red filter intensified the images of the ghosts, while the blue filter \\"removed\\" them. Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film \\"a simple, old-fashioned haunted house yarn\\" that \\"would be a lot better off without this gimmick.\\" Variety wrote, \\"The idea is sound and exploitable, but the execution doesn't fully come off,\\" explaining the ghosts \\"lack personality and aren't frightening, so that there isn't sufficient tension in the sequences during which the 'ghost viewer' comes into play.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"a workmanlike but not very frightening horror film ... the ghosts, which are a dull red colour, are far less effective when witnessed than when their presence is merely suggested, especially when their viewability depends on a process as unremarkable as Illusion-O.\\" Remake The film was remade in 2001 with a spelled-out title, Thirteen Ghosts, and was directed by Steve Beck. Like the original, the film was distributed by Columbia Pictures, except in the United States and Canada, where it was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

It was also the first railway terminus in what is now Greater London. First opened in 1836, the station went through several changes of ownership, was rebuilt several times, changed its name and was relocated a couple of hundred yards away from its original site before it closed in 1915 due to cost-saving measures during the First World War. The disused station building is today part of a light industrial estate. A number of elements of the original station ‚Äì including the ticket office and remnants of the platforms ‚Äì are still visible.  History  = First station (1836‚Äì1838) = In 1833 an Act of Parliament granted the L&GR; the rights to build a viaduct from the south end of London Bridge to Greenwich and to run trains along it. However, the line was partially opened to the public well before its full length had been completed in order to maximise revenue income as soon as possible. Other companies were in the process of building their own railway lines and the L&GR; wished to gain the commercial advantage of being the first to open for business. Another consideration was the company's stock price, which stood high at the end of 1835 but was at risk of falling if the line was not soon opened. The board decided to open a stretch from Spa Road to , which served the district of Deptford. The first train left Deptford railway station for Spa Road at 8 am on 8 February 1836. Trains ran hourly on the half-hour from Spa Road, from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, with a fare to Deptford costing 6d. There were no services after dark, as there were no signals on the line and it was not illuminated. The original Spa Road station, painted by Robert Blemmell Schnebbelie in 1836 Spa Road station was within the parish of Bermondsey, which was then an industrial and working class area. From there the line crossed over marshes and market gardens to reach Deptford and Greenwich. The station itself was very basic. It was squeezed into a narrow space on a two- track viaduct with no room for buildings of any sort. The company did not even refer to it as a station but as a \\"stopping place.\\" The platforms were accessed via wooden staircases on the outside of the viaduct, the one on the south side having a small wooden hut at the bottom for issuing tickets. If the platform was full, passengers were supposed to queue on the steps to wait for the trains. In practice, though, they often queued on the track itself. The company had not originally intended to provide platforms at all and had fitted its carriages with steps to allow passengers to board from track level, but found that low platforms were more convenient. The Commissioner of Pavements required the L&GR; to maintain the staircases and to provide at least two services a day from the station. Perhaps not surprisingly given the station's physical limitations, only a month after it was opened there was a fatal accident when passenger Daniel Holmes was run over by a train. The other passengers had been waiting with others on the track when the Deptford train arrived. They climbed up on to the platform but Holmes remained on the track. The engine driver, Thomas Millender, was distracted by Holmes and collided with the waiting southbound train. A number of passengers who had already boarded the southbound train were injured and Holmes was killed instantly when Millender's runaway engine struck him. The duty policeman only just escaped also being struck and was dismissed for failing to warn the passengers in time. The accident was witnessed by George Walker, the L&GR;'s Resident Director, who subsequently wrote of the difficulties that his staff experienced in keeping people off the tracks. The L&GR; opened the line between London Bridge and Spa Road on 14 December 1836. Usage of Spa Road station dropped significantly after the opening of London Bridge railway station, and drivers began to go straight through without stopping if they had no passenger requests. This changed in March 1838 when the company's directors ordered trains to stop at Spa Road hourly throughout the day and reserved half a carriage for passengers to and from the station on Sundays and holidays. They also took steps to improve access to the station. Despite this, it was little used and in late 1838 the L&GR;'s directors decided to close the station. It was boarded up at the end of 1838 and remained out of use until 1842. = Second station (1842‚Äì1867) = Railway arch at Marine Street, just north of Spa Road. The two iron doors on the left gave access to the ticket office of the 1842‚Äì1867 station and the platform. In 1840, the L&GR; applied to Parliament for powers to widen the viaduct, which was so narrow that the carriages only had a clearance of about between their sides and the parapet wall, and about clearance in the centre. There was no room for buildings of any description anywhere on the line. The company came under pressure to reopen Spa Road station, as competition from the railway had caused the demise of a horse-drawn coach service from Bermondsey to Deptford. It agreed to construct an improved station when the line was widened. This involved moving the access staircase to the north side of the viaduct, building a waiting and booking office room in the arches and constructing a shed over the line. A local contractor, Thomas Jackson, began work on the new station in June 1842 and it opened in September, with the work costing ¬£450 (¬£33,000 at 2010 prices). The following February another life was lost at Spa Road when a man named Birmingham suffered a fatal injury in the station. The station was upgraded in August 1843 when signals were erected there, and in May 1844 the platforms were extended. The South Eastern Railway took over the L&GR; the following year and rebuilt the whole station again. The reconstruction work, which took place in March 1845, saw the demolition of the stairway and the building of a new internal stair approach from an arch in West Street (now Marine Street) next to the arch occupied by the booking office. The tracks were relaid to make them diverge slightly, providing room for an island platform about wide. A small shelter was constructed there with a roof above track level and projecting about outwards, level with the sides of the carriages. A third-class passenger was killed on 1 April 1850 when he climbed part-way out of his open carriage and hit his head on the shelter's projecting roof as his Greenwich-bound train passed through the station. A subsequent Board of Trade enquiry recommended that steps should be taken to ensure that the \\"unruly class of passengers\\" found in third class should not have the \\"power to injure themselves\\" in future. In the same year, a small shelter for ticket collectors was erected on the Spa Road platform and trains to London Bridge were stopped there to carry out ticket collections before arriving at their destination. This arrangement continued until Charing Cross railway station was opened in 1864. For some years local children exploited the ticket stops at Spa Road. The ticket collections meant that up trains had to stand there for some considerable time, close to the parapet wall and perfectly visible from street level. One regular traveller, Alfred Rosling Bennett, later recalled, = Third station (1867-1915) = Spa Road station circa 1900 In 1867 the station was resited further along the viaduct about to the east, with an entrance accessed via what is now Priter Road. It was renamed as Spa Road & Bermondsey in October 1877 (though a photograph of about 1900 shows that it was still advertised as \\"Spa Road Station\\"). When the South Eastern and Chatham Railway was formed in 1899 from the South Eastern Railway and its bitter competitor, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, the station was given another makeover. The current appearance of the station frontage dates from 1900. On 15 March 1915, the station was closed, along with Southwark Park and Deptford stations, as a wartime economy measure. Only Deptford was subsequently reopened. Spa Road continued to be used by railwaymen until September 1925, when it ceased to be used by the railway.  Spa Road railway station today  By the mid-1980s the old station had fallen into dereliction. It was left empty for many years, and the vacant land around it became a site for the illegal dumping of waste and rubbish. In 1986, British Rail, the Southwark Environment Trust and the London Borough of Southwark contributed ¬£50,000 to the restoration the station frontage and installing two commemorative plaques. The station arches and the land in front of them were redeveloped into a light industrial estate behind a block of flats, accessed via Priter Road. Parts of the station still exist; platform remnants are visible from trains travelling between Deptford or New Cross and London Bridge, and can easily be seen in satellite images. The frontage of the station is still extant and displays the signage of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The site of the ticket windows is also visible. The disused platforms can still be reached via the old ticket office and have occasionally been used in emergencies. On 8 January 1999, when two commuter trains collided and derailed in the Spa Road Junction rail crash, some passengers had to be evacuated through the old station.

This is equivalent to convolving the unknown signal with a conjugated time-reversed version of the template. The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise. Matched filters are commonly used in radar, in which a known signal is sent out, and the reflected signal is examined for common elements of the out-going signal. Pulse compression is an example of matched filtering. It is so called because the impulse response is matched to input pulse signals. Two-dimensional matched filters are commonly used in image processing, e.g., to improve the SNR of X-ray observations. Matched filtering is a demodulation technique with LTI (linear time invariant) filters to maximize SNR. It was originally also known as a North filter.After D.O. North who was among the first to introduce the concept: Re-print: See also:  Derivation  = Derivation via matrix algebra = The following section derives the matched filter for a discrete-time system. The derivation for a continuous-time system is similar, with summations replaced with integrals. The matched filter is the linear filter, h, that maximizes the output signal-to-noise ratio. :\\\\ y[n] = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h[n-k] x[k], where x[k] is the input as a function of the independent variable k, and y[n] is the filtered output. Though we most often express filters as the impulse response of convolution systems, as above (see LTI system theory), it is easiest to think of the matched filter in the context of the inner product, which we will see shortly. We can derive the linear filter that maximizes output signal-to-noise ratio by invoking a geometric argument. The intuition behind the matched filter relies on correlating the received signal (a vector) with a filter (another vector) that is parallel with the signal, maximizing the inner product. This enhances the signal. When we consider the additive stochastic noise, we have the additional challenge of minimizing the output due to noise by choosing a filter that is orthogonal to the noise. Let us formally define the problem. We seek a filter, h, such that we maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio, where the output is the inner product of the filter and the observed signal x. Our observed signal consists of the desirable signal s and additive noise v: :\\\\ x=s+v.\\\\, Let us define the covariance matrix of the noise, reminding ourselves that this matrix has Hermitian symmetry, a property that will become useful in the derivation: :\\\\ R_v=E\\\\\\\\{ vv^\\\\mathrm{H} \\\\\\\\}\\\\, where v^\\\\mathrm{H} denotes the conjugate transpose of v, and E denotes expectation. Let us call our output, y, the inner product of our filter and the observed signal such that :\\\\ y = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h^*[k] x[k] = h^\\\\mathrm{H}x = h^\\\\mathrm{H}s + h^\\\\mathrm{H}v = y_s + y_v. We now define the signal-to-noise ratio, which is our objective function, to be the ratio of the power of the output due to the desired signal to the power of the output due to the noise: :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{y_s^2}{E\\\\\\\\{y_v^2\\\\\\\\}}. We rewrite the above: :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{h^\\\\mathrm{H}s^2}{E\\\\\\\\{h^\\\\mathrm{H}v^2\\\\\\\\}}. We wish to maximize this quantity by choosing h. Expanding the denominator of our objective function, we have :\\\\ E\\\\\\\\{ h^\\\\mathrm{H}v^2 \\\\\\\\} = E\\\\\\\\{ (h^\\\\mathrm{H}v){(h^\\\\mathrm{H}v)}^\\\\mathrm{H} \\\\\\\\} = h^\\\\mathrm{H} E\\\\\\\\{vv^\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\\\\\} h = h^\\\\mathrm{H}R_vh.\\\\, Now, our \\\\mathrm{SNR} becomes :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{ h^\\\\mathrm{H}s^2 }{ h^\\\\mathrm{H}R_vh }. We will rewrite this expression with some matrix manipulation. The reason for this seemingly counterproductive measure will become evident shortly. Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry of the covariance matrix R_v, we can write :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{  {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) ^2 } { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }, We would like to find an upper bound on this expression. To do so, we first recognize a form of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality: :\\\\ a^\\\\mathrm{H}b^2 \\\\leq (a^\\\\mathrm{H}a)(b^\\\\mathrm{H}b),\\\\, which is to say that the square of the inner product of two vectors can only be as large as the product of the individual inner products of the vectors. This concept returns to the intuition behind the matched filter: this upper bound is achieved when the two vectors a and b are parallel. We resume our derivation by expressing the upper bound on our \\\\mathrm{SNR} in light of the geometric inequality above: :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{  {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) ^2 } { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) } \\\\leq \\\\frac{ \\\\left[ {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) \\\\right] \\\\left[ {(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) \\\\right] } { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }. Our valiant matrix manipulation has now paid off. We see that the expression for our upper bound can be greatly simplified: :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{  {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) ^2 } { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) } \\\\leq s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s. We can achieve this upper bound if we choose, :\\\\ R_v^{1/2}h = \\\\alpha R_v^{-1/2}s where \\\\alpha is an arbitrary real number. To verify this, we plug into our expression for the output \\\\mathrm{SNR}: :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{  {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) ^2 } { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) } = \\\\frac{ \\\\alpha^2  {(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) ^2 } { \\\\alpha^2 {(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\\\\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) } = \\\\frac{  s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s ^2 } { s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s } = s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s. Thus, our optimal matched filter is :\\\\ h = \\\\alpha R_v^{-1}s. We often choose to normalize the expected value of the power of the filter output due to the noise to unity. That is, we constrain :\\\\ E\\\\\\\\{ y_v^2 \\\\\\\\} = 1.\\\\, This constraint implies a value of \\\\alpha, for which we can solve: :\\\\ E\\\\\\\\{ y_v^2 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\alpha^2 s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s = 1, yielding :\\\\ \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}}, giving us our normalized filter, :\\\\ h = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}} R_v^{-1}s. If we care to write the impulse response h of the filter for the convolution system, it is simply the complex conjugate time reversal of the input s. Though we have derived the matched filter in discrete time, we can extend the concept to continuous-time systems if we replace R_v with the continuous-time autocorrelation function of the noise, assuming a continuous signal s(t), continuous noise v(t), and a continuous filter h(t). = Derivation via Lagrangian = Alternatively, we may solve for the matched filter by solving our maximization problem with a Lagrangian. Again, the matched filter endeavors to maximize the output signal- to-noise ratio (\\\\mathrm{SNR}) of a filtered deterministic signal in stochastic additive noise. The observed sequence, again, is :\\\\ x = s + v,\\\\, with the noise covariance matrix, :\\\\ R_v = E\\\\\\\\{vv^\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\\\\\}.\\\\, The signal-to-noise ratio is :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{y_s^2}{ E\\\\\\\\{y_v^2\\\\\\\\} }. Evaluating the expression in the numerator, we have :\\\\ y_s^2 = {y_s}^\\\\mathrm{H} y_s = h^\\\\mathrm{H} s s^\\\\mathrm{H} h.\\\\, and in the denominator, :\\\\ E\\\\\\\\{y_v^2\\\\\\\\} = E\\\\\\\\{ {y_v}^\\\\mathrm{H} y_v \\\\\\\\} = E\\\\\\\\{ h^\\\\mathrm{H} v v^\\\\mathrm{H} h \\\\\\\\} = h^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v h.\\\\, The signal-to-noise ratio becomes :\\\\mathrm{SNR} = \\\\frac{h^\\\\mathrm{H} s s^\\\\mathrm{H} h}{ h^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v h }. If we now constrain the denominator to be 1, the problem of maximizing \\\\mathrm{SNR} is reduced to maximizing the numerator. We can then formulate the problem using a Lagrange multiplier: :\\\\ h^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v h = 1 :\\\\ \\\\mathcal{L} = h^\\\\mathrm{H} s s^\\\\mathrm{H} h + \\\\lambda (1 - h^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v h ) :\\\\ abla_{h^*} \\\\mathcal{L} = s s^\\\\mathrm{H} h - \\\\lambda R_v h = 0 :\\\\ (s s^\\\\mathrm{H}) h = \\\\lambda R_v h which we recognize as a generalized eigenvalue problem :\\\\ h^\\\\mathrm{H} (s s^\\\\mathrm{H}) h = \\\\lambda h^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v h. Since s s^\\\\mathrm{H} is of unit rank, it has only one nonzero eigenvalue. It can be shown that this eigenvalue equals :\\\\ \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} = s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s, yielding the following optimal matched filter :\\\\ h = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{s^\\\\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}} R_v^{-1} s. This is the same result found in the previous subsection.  Interpretation as a least squares estimator  Matched filtering can also be interpreted as a least squares estimator for the optimal location and scaling of a given model or template. Once again, let the observed sequence be defined as :\\\\ x_k = s_k + v_k,\\\\, where v_k is uncorrelated zero mean noise. The signal s_k is assumed to be a scaled and shifted version of a known model sequence f_k: :\\\\ s_k = \\\\mu_0\\\\cdot f_{k-j_0} We want to find optimal estimates j^* and \\\\mu^* for the unknown shift j_0 and scaling \\\\mu_0 by minimizing the least squares residual between the observed sequence x_k and a \\"probing sequence\\" h_{j-k}: :\\\\ j^*,\\\\mu^* = \\\\arg\\\\min_{j,\\\\mu} \\\\sum_k \\\\left(x_k - \\\\mu\\\\cdot h_{j-k}\\\\right)^2 The appropriate h_{j-k} will later turn out to be the matched filter, but is as yet unspecified. Expanding x_k and the square within the sum yields :\\\\ j^*,\\\\mu^* = \\\\arg\\\\min_{j,\\\\mu}\\\\left[ \\\\sum_k (s_k+v_k)^2 + \\\\mu^2\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2 - 2\\\\mu\\\\sum_k s_k h_{j-k} - 2\\\\mu\\\\sum_k v_k h_{j-k}\\\\right]. The first term in brackets is a constant (since the observed signal is given) and has no influence on the optimal solution. The last term has constant expected value because the noise is uncorrelated and has zero mean. We can therefore drop both terms from the optimization. After reversing the sign, we obtain the equivalent optimization problem :\\\\ j^*,\\\\mu^* = \\\\arg\\\\max_{j,\\\\mu}\\\\left[ 2\\\\mu\\\\sum_k s_k h_{j-k} - \\\\mu^2\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2\\\\right]. Setting the derivative w.r.t. \\\\mu to zero gives an analytic solution for \\\\mu^*: :\\\\ \\\\mu^* = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_k s_k h_{j-k}}{\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2}. Inserting this into our objective function yields a reduced maximization problem for just j^*: :\\\\ j^* = \\\\arg\\\\max_j\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\sum_k s_k h_{j-k}\\\\right)^2}{\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2}. The numerator can be upper-bounded by means of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality: :\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\sum_k s_k h_{j-k}\\\\right)^2}{\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2} \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\sum_k s_k^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2}{\\\\sum_k h_{j-k}^2} = \\\\sum_k s_k^2 = \\\\mathrm{const}. The optimization problem assumes its maximum when equality holds in this expression. According to the properties of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality, this is only possible when :\\\\ h_{j-k}= u \\\\cdot s_k = \\\\kappa\\\\cdot f_{k-j_0}. for arbitrary non-zero constants u or \\\\kappa, and the optimal solution is obtained at j^*=j_0 as desired. Thus, our \\"probing sequence\\" h_{j-k} must be proportional to the signal model f_{k-j_0}, and the convenient choice \\\\kappa=1 yields the matched filter :\\\\ h_{k}=f_{-k}. Note that the filter is the mirrored signal model. This ensures that the operation \\\\sum_k x_k h_{j-k} to be applied in order to find the optimum is indeed the convolution between the observed sequence x_k and the matched filter h_k. The filtered sequence assumes its maximum at the position where the observed sequence x_k best matches (in a least-squares sense) the signal model f_k. = Implications = The matched filter may be derived in a variety of ways, but as a special case of a least squares procedure it may also be interpreted as a maximum likelihood method in the context of a (coloured) Gaussian noise model and the associated Whittle likelihood. If the transmitted signal possessed no unknown parameters (like time-of-arrival, amplitude,...), then the matched filter would, according to the Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma, minimize the error probability. However, since the exact signal generally is determined by unknown parameters that effectively are estimated (or fitted) in the filtering process, the matched filter constitutes a generalized maximum likelihood (test-) statistic. The filtered time series may then be interpreted as (proportional to) the profile likelihood, the maximized conditional likelihood as a function of the time parameter. This implies in particular that the error probability (in the sense of Neyman and Pearson, i.e., concerning maximization of the detection probability for a given false-alarm probability) is not necessarily optimal. What is commonly referred to as the Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is supposed to be maximized by a matched filter, in this context corresponds to \\\\sqrt{2\\\\log(\\\\mathcal{L})}, where \\\\mathcal{L} is the (conditionally) maximized likelihood ratio. The construction of the matched filter is based on a known noise spectrum. In reality, however, the noise spectrum is usually estimated from data and hence only known up to a limited precision. For the case of an uncertain spectrum, the matched filter may be generalized to a more robust iterative procedure with favourable properties also in non-Gaussian noise.  Frequency-domain interpretation  When viewed in the frequency domain, it is evident that the matched filter applies the greatest weighting to spectral components exhibiting the greatest signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., large weight where noise is relatively low, and vice versa). In general this requires a non-flat frequency response, but the associated \\"distortion\\" is no cause for concern in situations such as radar and digital communications, where the original waveform is known and the objective is the detection of this signal against the background noise. On the technical side, the matched filter is a weighted least squares method based on the (heteroscedastic) frequency-domain data (where the \\"weights\\" are determined via the noise spectrum, see also previous section), or equivalently, a least squares method applied to the whitened data.  Examples  = Matched filter in radar and sonar = Matched filters are often used in signal detection. As an example, suppose that we wish to judge the distance of an object by reflecting a signal off it. We may choose to transmit a pure-tone sinusoid at 1 Hz. We assume that our received signal is an attenuated and phase-shifted form of the transmitted signal with added noise. To judge the distance of the object, we correlate the received signal with a matched filter, which, in the case of white (uncorrelated) noise, is another pure-tone 1-Hz sinusoid. When the output of the matched filter system exceeds a certain threshold, we conclude with high probability that the received signal has been reflected off the object. Using the speed of propagation and the time that we first observe the reflected signal, we can estimate the distance of the object. If we change the shape of the pulse in a specially-designed way, the signal-to-noise ratio and the distance resolution can be even improved after matched filtering: this is a technique known as pulse compression. Additionally, matched filters can be used in parameter estimation problems (see estimation theory). To return to our previous example, we may desire to estimate the speed of the object, in addition to its position. To exploit the Doppler effect, we would like to estimate the frequency of the received signal. To do so, we may correlate the received signal with several matched filters of sinusoids at varying frequencies. The matched filter with the highest output will reveal, with high probability, the frequency of the reflected signal and help us determine the speed of the object. This method is, in fact, a simple version of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT takes an N-valued complex input and correlates it with N matched filters, corresponding to complex exponentials at N different frequencies, to yield N complex-valued numbers corresponding to the relative amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components (see Moving target indication). = Matched filter in digital communications = The matched filter is also used in communications. In the context of a communication system that sends binary messages from the transmitter to the receiver across a noisy channel, a matched filter can be used to detect the transmitted pulses in the noisy received signal. File:Matched Filter Total System.jpg Imagine we want to send the sequence \\"0101100100\\" coded in non polar Non-return-to-zero (NRZ) through a certain channel. Mathematically, a sequence in NRZ code can be described as a sequence of unit pulses or shifted rect functions, each pulse being weighted by +1 if the bit is \\"1\\" and by -1 if the bit is \\"0\\". Formally, the scaling factor for the k^\\\\mathrm{th} bit is, :\\\\ a_k = \\\\begin{cases} +1, & \\\\mbox{if bit } k \\\\mbox{ is 1},  -1, & \\\\mbox{if bit } k \\\\mbox{ is 0}. \\\\end{cases} We can represent our message, M(t), as the sum of shifted unit pulses: :\\\\ M(t) = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty a_k \\\\times \\\\Pi \\\\left( \\\\frac{t-kT}{T} \\\\right). where T is the time length of one bit. Thus, the signal to be sent by the transmitter is 400px If we model our noisy channel as an AWGN channel, white Gaussian noise is added to the signal. At the receiver end, for a Signal-to-noise ratio of 3 dB, this may look like: 400px A first glance will not reveal the original transmitted sequence. There is a high power of noise relative to the power of the desired signal (i.e., there is a low signal-to-noise ratio). If the receiver were to sample this signal at the correct moments, the resulting binary message would possibly belie the original transmitted one. To increase our signal-to-noise ratio, we pass the received signal through a matched filter. In this case, the filter should be matched to an NRZ pulse (equivalent to a \\"1\\" coded in NRZ code). Precisely, the impulse response of the ideal matched filter, assuming white (uncorrelated) noise should be a time-reversed complex-conjugated scaled version of the signal that we are seeking. We choose :\\\\ h(t) = \\\\Pi\\\\left( \\\\frac{t}{T} \\\\right). In this case, due to symmetry, the time-reversed complex conjugate of h(t) is in fact h(t), allowing us to call h(t) the impulse response of our matched filter convolution system. After convolving with the correct matched filter, the resulting signal, M_\\\\mathrm{filtered}(t) is, :\\\\ M_\\\\mathrm{filtered}(t) = M(t) * h(t) where * denotes convolution. 400px Which can now be safely sampled by the receiver at the correct sampling instants, and compared to an appropriate threshold, resulting in a correct interpretation of the binary message. 400px = Matched filter in gravitational-wave astronomy = Matched filters play a central role in gravitational-wave astronomy. The first observation of gravitational waves was based on large-scale filtering of each detector's output for signals resembling the expected shape, followed by subsequent screening for coincident and coherent triggers between both instruments. False-alarm rates, and with that, the statistical significance of the detection were then assessed using resampling methods. Inference on the astrophysical source parameters was completed using Bayesian methods based on parameterized theoretical models for the signal waveform and (again) on the Whittle likelihood.

Balcan was one of the most recognizable voices on the airwaves of Montreal for 30 years. Born in Saint Boniface, Manitoba in 1931, Balcan first worked as a sketch artist in the engineering department of the Canadian Pacific Railway in his native province. Balcan began his broadcast career in 1951, when he was the first announcer to sign on with CKDM, a radio station in his hometown of Dauphin, Manitoba. He was later discovered working at CKOC in Hamilton by H.T. \\"Mac\\" McCurdy, who brought Balcan to Montreal in 1963 to serve as the afternoon host at CJAD. He then became the station's morning man in 1967. Balcan moved to crosstown competitor CFCF in 1973, where he also served as an on-air host for the television service. He then returned to CJAD as the morning man in 1975, where he remained until his retirement in 1998, the longest ever to hold the position in any Montreal radio station. He became an accomplished pastel artist and was a member of the Pastel Society of Canada. His works have graced the walls of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. In 1991, he and his family established the George Balcan Bursary at Concordia University and awards given to Fine Arts students pursuing a major in painting and drawing. Balcan worked tirelessly in his community in support of many causes, including the fight against breast cancer and for juvenile diabetes research. Balcan was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1996. In 2005, he was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. He died on May 4, 2004.

It forms the forecourt to Toronto City Hall, or New City Hall, at the intersection of Queen Street West and Bay Street, and is named for Nathan Phillips, mayor of Toronto from 1955 to 1962. The square was designed by the City Hall's architect Viljo Revell and landscape architect Richard Strong. It opened in 1965. The square is the site of concerts, art displays, a weekly farmers' market, the winter festival of lights, and other public events, including demonstrations. During the winter months, the reflecting pool is converted into an ice rink for ice skating. The square attracts an estimated 1.5 million visitors yearly. With an area of , it is Canada's largest city square. Nathan Phillips Square is used regularly for art exhibits, concerts, rallies and other ceremonies. Annual events include a New Year's Eve Party and the Cavalcade of Lights Festival lighting of the official Christmas tree. The annual Nuit Blanche art festival sets up art exhibits in the Square, and has also utilized the parking garage located underneath the square. Features The square is rectangular in shape, with the edge of the city hall meeting the square on an angle on the north side. The main portion of the square is paved with two sizes of reinforced concrete slabs. The square has a reflecting pool, a peace garden, a permanent stage and several sculptures, including Three-Way Piece No. 2 (The Archer) by Henry Moore. Around the remaining perimeter of the square runs an elevated concrete walkway. Outside the walkway are treed lawns dotted with various other memorials and monuments, such as Oscar Nemon's statue of Sir Winston Churchill (c. 1977), and a Roman column. Beneath the square is one of the world's largest underground parking garages. In 2012, illuminated \\"disappearing\\" fountains were installed among the slabs, used for decoration and cooling. The Square is property of the City of Toronto. Smoking is prohibited in the entire square.http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_636.pdf =Reflecting pool and skating rink= The reflecting pool is situated in the south-east corner of the square. Spanning the reflecting pool are three concrete arches; originally just an architectural feature and support for rink lighting, these were dedicated as the Freedom Arches in 1989, to commemorate those who fought to obtain or defend freedom. At the same time, a piece of the Berlin Wall was placed at the southern base of the central arch. To the west of the reflecting pool is a pavilion where food is available; and ice skates are available for rental during the winter months when the pool is used for ice skating. =Peace Garden= The Peace Garden at Nathan Philips Square The Peace Garden was created as a memorial to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the \\"commitment of Torontonians to the principle of world peace.\\" The sundial at the south end of the garden pre-dates the peace memorial; inscribed with the words \\"In appreciation of the opportunity to serve,\\" it was originally installed in 1969, designed by G.R. Johnson (in consultation with H.H. Rogers and John C. Parkin), and presented by Nathan Phillips to the residents of Toronto. Fifteen years later, during the city's sesquicentennial, then Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau turned the first sod for the Peace Garden, which was to sit immediately north of, but also incorporate, the pre-existing sundial. The garden consists of a pavilion, a fountain, and surrounding plantings. The gazebo is a stone-clad cube with arched openings on all sides, capped with a pitched roof, and with one corner of the structure deconstructed, to signify conflict and the fragility of civilization. The fountain's pool encroaches into this removed corner, with an eternal flame placed in the water so as to appear as though it supports the pavilion structure, to symbolize hope and regeneration. Pope John Paul II lit this flame with an ember from the Peace Flame in Hiroshima, and poured into the pool water from the rivers that flow through Nagasaki. The entire monument was formally dedicated by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, in October 1984. As part of the redesign of the square, the Peace Garden was moved from the centre of the square to its western edge. =Elevated walkway= An elevated walkway extends around the square's perimeter. The elevated concrete walkway connects to the podium of the City Hall at the height of its roof and extends around the perimeter of the square. Staircases connect the walkway to the floor of the square in several locations. On the south side, the walkway extends across Queen Street to the Sheraton Hotel. On the west side, the walkway is connected to the back of the permanent stage, which also serves as a grand staircase. The walkway is closed during winter months. History The area currently occupied by the square was part of the Ward and was a major immigrant reception area during the first half of the twentieth century characterized by poverty during the late 1800s and early 1900s, with Black families settling on the site followed by the large wave of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe during this period. From 1910s leading up to World War II, the immigrant neighbourhood was gradually settled and developed by the Chinese immigrants into Toronto's first Chinatown. The future site of Nathan Philips Square in 1918. =Development of the square and opening= Following World War II, the City of Toronto government prepared to construct a civic square in Chinatown, through a by-law which prohibited further development except for public purposes or parking lots. With voter approval in 1947, the city began acquisition of sites inside Chinatown from 1948 to 1958, with expropriation and demolition of various shops and restaurants in 1955 for the development of the square. With the procurement of the land completed and the design of City Hall finalized in 1958, construction commenced in 1961. The south side of Queen Street opposite City Hall was considered a 'commercial slum' and in August 1964, Toronto City Council voted to expropriate the south side for development appropriate to the new civic square. The businesses on that side of the street included two burlesque theatres, pawn shops and a cinema. The south side was vacant at the time of the City Hall opening but was eventually occupied by a new hotel, connected by a pedestrian bridge over Queen Street to the square. The rink was completed before other features in the square, and was officially opened by Mayor Philip Givens on Sunday, 29 November 1964. This was also the first operational part of the new City Hall. It was rushed to completion before the December 1964 municipal election. Other dignitaries present that afternoon were former mayors Nathan Phillips and Allan Lamport. The rest of the square and City Hall was formally completed in September 1965. The Archer by Henry Moore, was installed in the square in 1966. To add decoration to the square, City Hall architect Viljo Revell wanted a sculpture by British sculptor Henry Moore. He selected the Three-Way Piece No. 2 (The Archer) at a cost of over . Its purchase was controversial. Toronto Mayor Philip Givens was in favour of the purchase, but some objected to the cost and to the abstract design. The City Council rejected the purchase of the sculpture, but its purchase was funded by a public subscription fund, and the sculpture was installed in 1966. After the 1972 Summit Series, the Canadian men's ice hockey win was feted with a public ceremony hosted by the mayor and the Ontario Premier. Since the 1980s, the square has been used as the set for a number of films, such as The Kidnapping of the President, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and The Sentinel. Khalsa Day is celebrated annually at the square with a day of music and food. =21st century= A design competition was launched in the start of October 2006, soliciting proposals from forty-eight local and international firms for a revitalization of the square, and, on March 8, 2007, it was announced that the team led by PLANT Architect Inc. and Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners (both of Toronto) had won the competition. The project was first estimated to cost CAD$45 million, but its final cost is expected to tally $60 million. Originally intended to be completed in 2012, the project is expected to be completed in 2014. The design is based on the idea that Nathan Phillips Square has always acted as an agora, the ancient Athenian place of public and political exchange, with the design defining the concept of the open space of theatre and that of the public squarea theatre for the city, and a square surrounded by a forested perimeter. The square's stage was revitalized with a glazed roof canopy as a part of the municipal government's revitalization program for the square. The plans included demolishing and replacing the food and skate rental kiosk, along with the addition of an upper level roof terrace overlooking the square; a two-level restaurant at the southwest corner of the square, with outdoor patio and terrace dining; a glass tourist information pavilion at the Queen and Bay Streets corner; a versatile stage structure under a glazed roof canopy; redesigned landscaping along the edges of the square that increases the number of trees, planting, mixed tree species; expansion and enhancement of the Peace Garden, with a flowering tree grove, eternal flame, and reflecting pool; landscaping and a caf√© on the podium roof of City Hall; a restaurant and bar at the Observation Deck level of the east tower of City Hall; upgrading the overhead walkways with wood decking, seating, glass balustrades, light wells and improved access; and a seasonal disappearing water fountain in the centre of the square. Sustainable design elements were also included so as to conform to Toronto's Green Standard, including a soil regeneration strategy, improved tree planting conditions, and increased biomass and number of trees; facilities for cyclists and the promotion of cycling; an improved pedestrian environment; the control of light pollution; energy efficient design; renewable energy features; opportunities for public education; attention to the on-site microclimate; and local sourcing of materials. The square redesign includes a CAD$1.2 million cycle station with storage for 380 bicycles and shower facilities. The cycle station was the cause of some minor controversy at Toronto City Council. On May 29, 2010, Mayor David Miller officially opened the first phase of the Revitalization project: the Podium Green Roof Garden. The roof garden includes diverse plantings of sedums, perennials, and trees; a Central Courtyard beneath the Council Chamber; a Public Terrace at the southeast corner of the roof, shaded by a tree planter; benches and shade structures designed to reveal the movement of the sun; and a perimeter path which acts as a walking and running circuit around the roof. New lighting has been installed, including new high-efficiency LED floodlights and a perimeter light band, to allow evening events to take place. 2010s In 2011, after the death of federal New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton, citizens flocked to the square and covered the walls, pillars and statues with messages written in chalk for Layton and his family. The Toronto sign was installed in the square in 2015 During the 2015 Pan American Games, Nathan Phillips Square was one of the sites of \\"Panamania\\", a cultural festival held in conjunction with the Games. Two temporary stages were installed and a platform for performances was installed over part of the reflecting pool. Each evening during the Games, the Square was the site of musical concerts, a medal celebration and fireworks. The square also held a count-down clock for the Games, and a \\"pop-up\\" store for Pan-Am and Para-PanAm souvenirs. A large, multi-colored-illuminated 3-D Toronto sign was also installed in the Square for the Games; the sign quickly proved to be popular with locals and tourists alike. The sign was to be relocated elsewhere at the end of 2015, however on September 13, 2015 it was announced that the sign will remain in the square permanently. The square was the host venue for the closing ceremonies of the 2015 Parapan American Games. Nathan Phillips Square was also a venue for Wheelchair tennis for the 2017 Invictus Games. The square during the Toronto Raptors victory parade in June 2019 After the Toronto Raptors won the 2019 NBA Finals, the subsequent parade on June 17, 2019, in Toronto culminated at Nathan Phillips Square, with two million people in total attendance, the largest public gathering in one place for one event in Canadian history; a shooting broke out in a portion of the square where four people were shot and injured.

The duality relations lead naturally to an uncertainty relation‚Äîin physics called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle‚Äîbetween them. In mathematical terms, conjugate variables are part of a symplectic basis, and the uncertainty relation corresponds to the symplectic form. Also, conjugate variables are related by Noether's theorem, which states that if the laws of physics are invariant with respect to a change in one of the conjugate variables, then the other conjugate variable will not change with time (i.e. it will be conserved). Examples There are many types of conjugate variables, depending on the type of work a certain system is doing (or is being subjected to). Examples of canonically conjugate variables include the following: * Period and frequency: the longer a musical note is sustained, the more precisely we know its frequency, but it spans a longer duration and is thus a more-distributed event or 'instant' in time. Conversely, a very short musical note becomes just a click, and so is more temporally-localized, but one can't determine its frequency very accurately.\\"The Chirplet Transform\\", IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 43(11), November 1995, pp 2745‚Äì2761 * Doppler and range: the more we know about how far away a radar target is, the less we can know about the exact velocity of approach or retreat, and vice versa. In this case, the two dimensional function of doppler and range is known as a radar ambiguity function or radar ambiguity diagram. * Surface energy: Œ≥ dA (Œ≥ = surface tension; A = surface area). * Elastic stretching: F dL (F = elastic force; L length stretched). =Derivatives of action= In classical physics, the derivatives of action are conjugate variables to the quantity with respect to which one is differentiating. In quantum mechanics, these same pairs of variables are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. * The energy of a particle at a certain event is the negative of the derivative of the action along a trajectory of that particle ending at that event with respect to the time of the event. * The linear momentum of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its position. * The angular momentum of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its orientation (angular position). * The mass-moment (\\\\mathbf{N}=t\\\\mathbf{p}-E\\\\mathbf{r}) of a particle is the negative of the derivative of its action with respect to its rapidity. * The electric potential (œÜ, voltage) at an event is the negative of the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the density of (free) electric charge at that event. * The magnetic potential (A) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the density of (free) electric current at that event. * The electric field (E) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the electric polarization density at that event. * The magnetic induction (B) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the magnetization at that event. * The Newtonian gravitational potential at an event is the negative of the derivative of the action of the Newtonian gravitation field with respect to the mass density at that event. =Quantum theory= In quantum mechanics, conjugate variables are realized as pairs of observables whose operators do not commute. In conventional terminology, they are said to be incompatible observables. Consider, as an example, the measurable quantities given by position \\\\left (x \\\\right) and momentum \\\\left (p \\\\right) . In the quantum mechanical formalism, the two observables x and p correspond to operators \\\\widehat{x} and \\\\widehat{p} , which necessarily satisfy the canonical commutation relation: : [\\\\widehat{x},\\\\widehat{p\\\\,}]=\\\\widehat{x}\\\\widehat{p\\\\,}-\\\\widehat{p\\\\,}\\\\widehat{x}=i \\\\hbar For every non-zero commutator of two operators, there exists an \\"uncertainty principle\\", which in our present example may be expressed in the form: : \\\\Delta x \\\\, \\\\Delta p \\\\geq \\\\hbar/2 In this ill-defined notation, \\\\Delta x and \\\\Delta p denote \\"uncertainty\\" in the simultaneous specification of x and p . A more precise, and statistically complete, statement involving the standard deviation \\\\sigma reads: : \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_p \\\\geq \\\\hbar/2 More generally, for any two observables A and B corresponding to operators \\\\widehat{A} and \\\\widehat{B} , the generalized uncertainty principle is given by: : {\\\\sigma_A}^2 {\\\\sigma_B}^2 \\\\geq \\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{2i} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\left [ \\\\widehat{A},\\\\widehat{B} \\\\right ] \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\right)^2 Now suppose we were to explicitly define two particular operators, assigning each a specific mathematical form, such that the pair satisfies the aforementioned commutation relation. It's important to remember that our particular \\"choice\\" of operators would merely reflect one of many equivalent, or isomorphic, representations of the general algebraic structure that fundamentally characterizes quantum mechanics. The generalization is provided formally by the Heisenberg Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak h_3, with a corresponding group called the Heisenberg group H_3 . =Fluid mechanics= In Hamiltonian fluid mechanics and quantum hydrodynamics, the action itself (or velocity potential) is the conjugate variable of the density (or probability density).

It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall, and is connected to Stanley Dock to the east and Salisbury Dock to the west. History The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley, and opened in 1848 along with four other Liverpool docks. The dock was named after Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood and was intended to handle relatively small vessels only. The Liverpool Corporation had a berth for its refuse boats in Collingwood Dock for many years. A bascule road bridge spans the passage between Collingwood and Stanley Docks. Present Collingwood Dock has been little altered since construction. The dock is part of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area and is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to the Pier Head. Collingwood dock is home to the Glaciere Maritime Academy.

It represents the distortion of a returned pulse due to the receiver matched filterWoodward P.M. Probability and Information Theory with Applications to Radar, Norwood, MA: Artech House, 1980. (commonly, but not exclusively, used in pulse compression radar) of the return from a moving target. The ambiguity function is defined by the properties of the pulse and of the filter, and not any particular target scenario. Many definitions of the ambiguity function exist; some are restricted to narrowband signals and others are suitable to describe the delay and Doppler relationship of wideband signals. Often the definition of the ambiguity function is given as the magnitude squared of other definitions (WeissWeiss, Lora G. \\"Wavelets and Wideband Correlation Processing\\". IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, pp. 13‚Äì32, Jan 1994). For a given complex baseband pulse s(t), the narrowband ambiguity function is given by :\\\\chi(\\\\tau,f)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty s(t)s^*(t-\\\\tau) e^{i 2 \\\\pi f t} \\\\, dt where ^* denotes the complex conjugate and i is the imaginary unit. Note that for zero Doppler shift (f=0), this reduces to the autocorrelation of s(t). A more concise way of representing the ambiguity function consists of examining the one-dimensional zero-delay and zero-Doppler \\"cuts\\"; that is, \\\\chi(0,f) and \\\\chi(\\\\tau,0), respectively. The matched filter output as a function of time (the signal one would observe in a radar system) is a Doppler cut, with the constant frequency given by the target's Doppler shift: \\\\chi(\\\\tau,f_D). Background and motivation Pulse-Doppler radar equipment sends out a series of radio frequency pulses. Each pulse has a certain shape (waveform)‚Äîhow long the pulse is, what its frequency is, whether the frequency changes during the pulse, and so on. If the waves reflect off a single object, the detector will see a signal which, in the simplest case, is a copy of the original pulse but delayed by a certain time \\\\tau‚Äîrelated to the object's distance‚Äîand shifted by a certain frequency f‚Äîrelated to the object's velocity (Doppler shift). If the original emitted pulse waveform is s(t), then the detected signal (neglecting noise, attenuation, and distortion, and wideband corrections) will be: :s_{\\\\tau,f}(t) \\\\equiv s(t-\\\\tau)e^{i 2\\\\pi f t}. The detected signal will never be exactly equal to any s_{\\\\tau,f} because of noise. Nevertheless, if the detected signal has a high correlation with s_{\\\\tau,f}, for a certain delay and Doppler shift (\\\\tau,f), then that suggests that there is an object with (\\\\tau,f). Unfortunately, this procedure may yield false positives, i.e. wrong values (\\\\tau',f') which are nevertheless highly correlated with the detected signal. In this sense, the detected signal may be ambiguous. The ambiguity occurs specifically when there is a high correlation between s_{\\\\tau,f} and s_{\\\\tau',f'} for (\\\\tau,f) eq (\\\\tau',f'). This motivates the ambiguity function \\\\chi. The defining property of \\\\chi is that the correlation between s_{\\\\tau,f} and s_{\\\\tau',f'} is equal to \\\\chi(\\\\tau-\\\\tau', f-f'). Different pulse shapes (waveforms) s(t) have different ambiguity functions, and the ambiguity function is relevant when choosing what pulse to use. The function \\\\chi is complex-valued; the degree of \\"ambiguity\\" is related to its magnitude \\\\chi(\\\\tau,f)^2. Relationship to time‚Äìfrequency distributions The ambiguity function plays a key role in the field of time‚Äìfrequency signal processing,E. Sejdiƒá, I. Djuroviƒá, J. Jiang, ‚ÄúTime- frequency feature representation using energy concentration: An overview of recent advances,‚Äù Digital Signal Processing, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 153-183, January 2009. as it is related to the Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution by a 2-dimensional Fourier transform. This relationship is fundamental to the formulation of other time‚Äìfrequency distributions: the bilinear time‚Äìfrequency distributions are obtained by a 2-dimensional filtering in the ambiguity domain (that is, the ambiguity function of the signal). This class of distribution may be better adapted to the signals considered.B. Boashash, editor, ‚ÄúTime-Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing ‚Äì A Comprehensive Reference‚Äù, Elsevier Science, Oxford, 2003; Moreover, the ambiguity distribution can be seen as the short-time Fourier transform of a signal using the signal itself as the window function. This remark has been used to define an ambiguity distribution over the time-scale domain instead of the time- frequency domain.Shenoy, R.G.; Parks, T.W., \\"Affine Wigner distributions,\\" IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP-92., pp.185-188 vol.5, 23-26 Mar 1992, doi: 10.1109/ICASSP.1992.226539 Wideband ambiguity function The wideband ambiguity function of s \\\\in L^2(R) is:L. Sibul, L. Ziomek, \\"Generalised wideband crossambiguity function\\", IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP '81.01/05/198105/1981; 6:1239‚Äì1242. :WB_{ss}(\\\\tau,\\\\alpha)=\\\\sqrt{{\\\\alpha}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty s(t)s^*(\\\\alpha (t-\\\\tau)) \\\\, dt where {\\\\alpha} is a time scale factor of the received signal relative to the transmitted signal given by: :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{c+v}{c-v} for a target moving with constant radial velocity v. The reflection of the signal is represented with compression (or expansion) in time by the factor \\\\alpha , which is equivalent to a compression by the factor \\\\alpha^{-1} in the frequency domain (with an amplitude scaling). When the wave speed in the medium is sufficiently faster than the target speed, as is common with radar, this compression in frequency is closely approximated by a shift in frequency Œîf = fc*v/c (known as the doppler shift). For a narrow band signal, this approximation results in the narrowband ambiguity function given above, which can be computed efficiently by making use of the FFT algorithm. Ideal ambiguity function An ambiguity function of interest is a 2-dimensional Dirac delta function or \\"thumbtack\\" function; that is, a function which is infinite at (0,0) and zero elsewhere. :\\\\chi(\\\\tau,f) = \\\\delta(\\\\tau) \\\\delta(f) \\\\, An ambiguity function of this kind would be somewhat of a misnomer; it would have no ambiguities at all, and both the zero-delay and zero-Doppler cuts would be an impulse. This is not usually desirable (if a target has any Doppler shift from an unknown velocity it will disappear from the radar picture), but if Doppler processing is independently performed, knowledge of the precise Doppler frequency allows ranging without interference from any other targets which are not also moving at exactly the same velocity. This type of ambiguity function is produced by ideal white noise (infinite in duration and infinite in bandwidth).Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar By Krzysztof Kulpa (Google Books) However, this would require infinite power and is not physically realizable. There is no pulse s(t) that will produce \\\\delta(\\\\tau) \\\\delta(f) from the definition of the ambiguity function. Approximations exist, however, and noise-like signals such as binary phase- shift keyed waveforms using maximal-length sequences are the best known performers in this regard.G. Jourdain and J. P. Henrioux, \\"Use of large bandwidth-duration binary phase shift keying signals in target delay Doppler measurements,\\" J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 299‚Äì309 (1991).

These bounds are sharp and are achieved if and only if s(t) is a Gaussian function.  Square pulse  Ambiguity function for a square pulse Consider a simple square pulse of duration \\\\tau and amplitude A: :A (u(t)-u(t-\\\\tau)) \\\\, where u(t) is the Heaviside step function. The matched filter output is given by the autocorrelation of the pulse, which is a triangular pulse of height \\\\tau^2 A^2 and duration 2 \\\\tau (the zero-Doppler cut). However, if the measured pulse has a frequency offset due to Doppler shift, the matched filter output is distorted into a sinc function. The greater the Doppler shift, the smaller the peak of the resulting sinc, and the more difficult it is to detect the target. In general, the square pulse is not a desirable waveform from a pulse compression standpoint, because the autocorrelation function is too short in amplitude, making it difficult to detect targets in noise, and too wide in time, making it difficult to discern multiple overlapping targets.  LFM pulse  Ambiguity function for an LFM pulse A commonly used radar or sonar pulse is the linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse (or \\"chirp\\"). It has the advantage of greater bandwidth while keeping the pulse duration short and envelope constant. A constant envelope LFM pulse has an ambiguity function similar to that of the square pulse, except that it is skewed in the delay- Doppler plane. Slight Doppler mismatches for the LFM pulse do not change the general shape of the pulse and reduce the amplitude very little, but they do appear to shift the pulse in time. Thus, an uncompensated Doppler shift changes the target's apparent range; this phenomenon is called range-Doppler coupling. Multistatic ambiguity functions The ambiguity function can be extended to multistatic radars, which comprise multiple non-colocated transmitters and/or receivers (and can include bistatic radar as a special case). For these types of radar, the simple linear relationship between time and range that exists in the monostatic case no longer applies, and is instead dependent on the specific geometry ‚Äì i.e. the relative location of transmitter(s), receiver(s) and target. Therefore, the multistatic ambiguity function is mostly usefully defined as a function of two- or three-dimensional position and velocity vectors for a given multistatic geometry and transmitted waveform. Just as the monostatic ambiguity function is naturally derived from the matched filter, the multistatic ambiguity function is derived from the corresponding optimal multistatic detector ‚Äì i.e. that which maximizes the probability of detection given a fixed probability of false alarm through joint processing of the signals at all receivers. The nature of this detection algorithm depends on whether or not the target fluctuations observed by each bistatic pair within the multistatic system are mutually correlated. If so, the optimal detector performs phase coherent summation of received signals which can result in very high target location accuracy.T. Derham, S. Doughty, C. Baker, K. Woodbridge, \\"Ambiguity Functions for Spatially Coherent and Incoherent Multistatic Radar,\\" IEEE Trans. Aerospace and Electronic Systems (in press). If not, the optimal detector performs incoherent summation of received signals which gives diversity gain. Such systems are sometimes described as MIMO radars due to the information theoretic similarities to MIMO communication systems.G. San Antonio, D. Fuhrmann, F. Robey, \\"MIMO radar ambiguity functions,\\" IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, Vol. 1, No. 1 (2007).

From 2003 to 2008 it produced a fanzine, initially called Rancid News until issue 9, changing its name to Last Hours from issue 10 till the final issue, 17, in May 2008. All 17 issues were edited by Edd Baldry before he stood down as editor. Since 2008 Last Hours has become a publishing collective, launching a website, and releasing two books in the autumn of 2009, Excessive Force and Diary of a miscreant Rancid News At its inception Rancid News was a punk zine, which began circulation in April 2003 with interviews from AFI, One Minute Silence, and Johnny Truant, alongside articles, columns and reviews. Rancid News was initially launched at a time when the Fracture and Reason To Believe zines were still in existence. After those publications ceased, Rancid News assumed their mantel documenting the UK punk scene. A key difference between Rancid News and the aforementioned zines is that Rancid News was sold outside gigs, and in record and comic stores rather than being available free. It was compared to San Francisco- based Maximum RocknRoll, due largely to similar political beliefs and style of music covered.Boarts Larson, Christine, Slug and Lettuce #82, August 2004 Rancid News was often connected with the Household Name records scene, featuring most of the label's bands between 2003 and 2005. Rancid News was also distributed by many of the Household Name Records bands, including Five Knuckle, Captain Everything!, Adequate Seven, Howards Alias, and Antimaniax amongst others. At its height Rancid News distributed around 4,000 copies around the UK and Europe. The zine was printed on newsprint and most issues were 116 pages long, with a colour cover, and saddle stitch binding. In early 2005 the name Rancid News was considered a hindrance. People mistakenly assumed the fanzine had something to do with the punk rock band Rancid and it was felt that it forced contributors to focus too heavily on music. The final issue of Rancid News, published in February 2005, gave an indication of the changing direction, with a greater emphasis on radical culture in general and with particular focus on political articles, vegan recipes and longer columns. The name Last Hours was agreed on in a meeting in March 2005, with the first issue - issue 10 - of the fanzine being released in June 2005, with subsequent issues to be released every six months. It maintained a balance between interviews with punk bands and political articles. It was published under the strapline 'Radical culture and punk rock'. The print production remained the same as Rancid News until issue 13, when the fanzine again changed direction with the first perfect bound edition, and an issue dedication to 'Punk rock and comics'. It marked the first time that interviews, articles or reviews relating to punk rock took up less than 50% of the fanzine. After issue 13 each issue of Last Hours was themed in one way or another, most often around the principle article of the zine. So, issue 14 focussed on acoustic punk rock, issue 15 on anarcho-punk compilations, issue 16 on DIY punk rock houseshows, and issue 17 on radical illustration. In all of the issues of Last Hours anarchist politics and radical culture took prominence over the music. Last Hours live Last Hours regularly put on gigs in London under the nomicker Last Hours live. During 2006 these were most often at The Square, a squatted social centre in Russel Square, where Last Hours put on, amongst others, The Steal, Ghost Mice, Attack Vipers and The King Blues. During 2007 Last Hours continued to put on gigs in squatted social centres around London, including The Vortex, in Stoke Newington, and The New Camberwell Social centre off Camberwell New Road, Kennington. In late 2007 Last Hours live started putting on gigs at the Cross Kings, Kings Cross, to launch Last Hours issue 16, and for the first five months of 2008 had monthly gigs at the venue, including one of Fall of Efrafa's few London shows. In addition to putting on gigs members of the Last Hours/ Rancid News collective have been involved in a number of squatted social centres, for example in 2003 with involvement in the Blackstar collective, 2004 with the In Arms Reach collective, which squatted a building off London's Oxford Street for a two-week punk festival, and 2005 at the Institute for Autonomy on Gower Street, London. London Zine Symposium In 2005 two members of the Rancid News collective established the London Zine Symposium, which for the first year was held in the Institute for Autonomy. It has become an annual event, and in 2009 had over 1,000 attendees with talks given by Roger Sabin, Teal Triggs, Barcelona Zine Library, and Alex Wrekk from Portland, United States. Up until 2010 the event had been organised by members of the Rancid News or Last Hours collective. Hiatus After issue 17 Last Hours was placed on a brief hiatus as Edd Baldry stepped down as editor of the publication. Other members of the collective pushed for the publication to be migrated to the internet, and a regular resource for the anti-authoritarian and punk communities in the UK. The website was relaunched in early 2009 and long articles written about the protests against the attack on Gaza, photo essays about the G20, and responses to Ian Tomlinson's death. It also started publishing a podcast and offering regular vegan recipes. \\"Creative resistance\\" During 2009 Last Hours changed its strapline from 'Radical culture and punk rock' to 'Creative resistance', indicating a greater focus on radical politics and a move away from punk culture. In the autumn of 2009 Last Hours released its first two books. 'Excessive Force' was a 150-page comic's anthology against the police, with the subtitle, 'Police everywhere, justice nowhere'. It featured artwork from 17 international illustrators about abuses of power by the police. It was a benefit for FitWatch and LDMG, two organisations working to curtail police abuses. Excessive Force was the first of what will become a regular comix anthology being produced by Last Hours. At the same time the collective was working on 'Diary of a miscreant', a book collecting ten years of the comic zine Morgenmuffel, by Isy Morgenmuffel. It offered a document on the anti-globalisation movement through the prism of an anarcha-feminist, vegan who was heavily involved in the manifestations during that period. Last Hours, in 2010, aims to publish books about the London Zine Symposium, the squatting movement in the UK and a series of posters offering alternative perspectives on subjects such as anarchy, prisons and the general election. It will also be creating a film about the UK small-press and fanzine community.

It is situated in the Vauxhall area of Liverpool and is part of the northern dock system. The dock is connected to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the east and Collingwood Dock to the west. History Titanic Hotel, North Warehouse and Rum Warehouse Designed by Jesse Hartley, it opened on 4 August 1848. The dock is the only one in Liverpool which was built inland, all the others being built out from the foreshore. The original quay warehouses are of a similar design to those at Albert Dock and are grade II* listed buildings. The warehouses were built to five storeys, covering an area of . Part of the northern quay warehouse was demolished after sustaining damage in an air raid during the Second World War. The southern quay warehouse remains, however no longer on a quay. Between 1897-1901, the southern part of the dock was filled in to build the large Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse by Anthony George Lyster. The tobacco warehouse stands between the new quay between and the older southern quay warehouse. There are two entrances to the Stanley Dock complex at the south end from Regent Road and two at the north from Great Howard Street, via sets of three granite towers. These towers are similar in design to the towers in other Liverpool docks, and originally had sliding gates set into the thickness of the wall. There is also a link to the canal which opened in 1848, via the bridge under Great Howard Street, also designed by Hartley. The adjoining branch canal is in length and was built with a staircase of four locks, each apart, with a width of . The staircase was built by J. B. Hartley. Regeneration The dock is the focal point of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area. In 2006, work commenced on a ¬£20 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway towards the Pier Head. As of March 2007, plans have been unveiled for the warehouses to be redeveloped into office space and a total of 930 apartments. The plans involve digging out the centre of the tobacco warehouse to create a garden- filled courtyard. The site featured as part of the Most Haunted Live! Liverpool investigation in January 2009 and in the 2011 superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger. The remaining parts of the northern warehouse were in a \\"poor\\" condition, and on the Heritage at Risk Register 2011, but were approved for redevelopment. The northern warehouse has since been developed in to a hotel devoted to the White Star Line's RMS Titanic liner, which has strong links to the area's history of docks and shipping.

It was originally marketed to amateur musicians as a budget external synthesizer with an original list price of $695. However, it became more famous along with its compatible modules as an early de facto standard in computer music. Since it was made prior to the release of the General MIDI standard, it uses its own proprietary format for MIDI file playback. Within Roland's family of Linear Arithmetic (LA) synthesizers, the multitimbral MT-32 series constitutes the budget prosumer line for computer music at home, the multitimbral D-5, D-10, D-20 and D-110 models constitute the professional line for general studio use, and the high- end monotimbral D-50 and D-550 models are for sophisticated multi-track studio work. It was the first product in Roland's line of Desktop Music System (DTM) packages in Japan. Features Like the Roland D-50 Linear Synthesizer, it uses Linear Arithmetic synthesis, a form of sample-based synthesis combined with subtractive synthesis, to produce its sounds. Samples are used for attacks and drums, while traditional synthesis assures the sustain phase of the sounds. The original MT-32 comes with a preset library of 128 synth and 30 rhythm sounds, playable on 8 melodic channels and one rhythm channel. MT-32 Owner's Manual. It also features a digital reverberation effect. Successors (see below) added a library of 33 sound effects. Because of the absence of a piano attack sample, it cannot play a convincing acoustic piano sound. Sounds are created from up to 4 partials which can be combined in various ways (including ring modulation). With 32 partials available overall, polyphony depends on the tonal complexity of the music, and 8 to 32 notes can be played simultaneously. The MT-32 by default assigns its parts 1~8 and R(hythm) to respond on input MIDI channels 2~9 and 10 respectively. By consequence, MIDI files using the popular channel 1 or the other channels 11~16 cannot have those parts played on the MT-32. However, the MT-32's melodic parts can be shifted down to respond to channels 1~8 using a button combination or through MIDI system exclusive messages, enabling improved compatibility with non- MT-32-specific MIDI sequences. Additionally, in 1993 Roland released the \\"GM2MT\\" SysEx pack, which can be used to reprogram the MT-32 and compatibles to match General MIDI specifications as closely as possible.http://cms.rolandus.com/assets/media/exe/MT2GM.EXE 64 of the 128 patches (the limit of possible variations) are completely new or modified sounds, with additional sounds having been added to drum channel 10. Despite this, compatibility with GM is still limited by the lack of parts (9 on the MT-32, 16 per GM specification) and reversed panpot compared to MMA MIDI specifications. The utility was predated by a pack called \\"MT32GS\\", released by Mike Cornelius in 1992.http://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/midi.songs/unsorted/M/mt32gs.doc The CM- Panion, by Gajits Music Software, was an Amiga editor which worked with the MT-32.

While it uses a MT-32 (New) PCB, the chassis is different. MT-32 compatible models To target computer users, Roland released a number of CM (Computer Music) modules. They came without an LCD display and had most buttons removed. CM modules are compatible with MT-32, but feature 33 additional sound effect samples which many games took advantage of. These sound effects cannot be heard on an MT-32. Early models share a similar design to MT-32 (New). Control CPU is an Intel P8098 and DAC is a Burr-Brown PCM54. *Roland CM-32L: Released in 1989, this Roland CM has only a volume knob, a MIDI message and a power-on indicator as external controls. *Roland CM-64: A combination of the CM-32L with the sample-based CM-32P, a cut-down \\"computer music\\" version of the Roland U-110. The CM-32P part plays on MIDI channels 11-16 which are not used by the CM-32L part. *Roland LAPC-I: ISA bus expansion card for IBM PCs and compatibles. Includes the MPU-401 interface. In later models, the DAC is a Burr-Brown PCM55, and vibrato is noticeably faster. *Roland CM-32LN: Sound module for the NEC PC-98 series notebook computers, featuring a special connector for direct connection to the computer's 110-pin expansion port. Released in Japan only. *Roland CM-500: A combination of the CM-32LN with the Roland GS-compatible Roland CM-300, the \\"computer music\\" version of the Roland SC-55. Released around 1992. *Roland LAPC-N: C-Bus expansion card for the NEC PC-98 series of computers. Released in Japan only. Sound quality problems Given the MT-32 was intended to be a relatively low-cost prosumer product, many corners were cut in the design of its DAC output. For example, the circuitry needed to properly calibrate the DACs was omitted, resulting in distortion of the analog signal. ~~http://anotherunknowntime.com/music/rwi-mt-32-mod.pdf~~ http://www.pdf- archive.com/2012/12/18/roland-mt-32-rwi-mod/ Despite having the capabilities of a professional synthesizer module, the noisy output of the MT-32 caused it to be generally considered unsuitable for professional studio use, although it was considered sufficient for use as the sound engine within other Roland prosumer products of the period. For example, the first generation of E-series home keyboards produced by the company, the first being the E-20 (and its associated modular version the RA-50 arranger), use a highly modified MT-32 motherboard. However, an aftermarket modification was available from Real World Interfaces to improve the MT-32's sound quality and generally increase its suitability for professional use. =Digital overflow= The MT-32 and compatible modules use a parallel 16-bit DAC at a sampling rate of 32000 Hz. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio without investing in higher- quality components, the volume of the digital signal fed into the DAC is doubled by shifting all 15 non-sign-carrying data bits to the left, which amounts to multiplying the amplitude by two while keeping the noise floor constant at the analogue output. However, if this doubled amplitude exceeds the amount that can be represented with 16 bits, an arithmetic overflow occurs, audible as a very loud popping or cracking noise that occurs whenever the original signal crosses +16384/-16384 (the value of bit 14 lost in the bit shift). This bit shift is implemented differently between module generations. In first-generation modules, this bit shift is performed at the connection between the data bus and DAC:Roland Corporation: MT-32 Service Notes, Second Edition. January 1988.

However, since bit 14 is dropped completely, the effective resolution is reduced to 15 bits, and since the DAC's least significant bit is not connected at all and thus not changing with the sign, additional one-bit noise is produced, audible at low signal levels. In second-generation modules, the bit shift is performed at the connection between the LA32 sound generation chip and the data bus:Roland Corporation: MT-32 Service Notes, Third Edition. October 1988. Original (non-shifted) data bit # Connection \\\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 output of LA32 synthesizer chip 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 input to reverberation chip 15 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 14 input to DAC    +- most significant data-carrying bit +- sign bit This means that the reverberation chip will \\"see\\" the overflow noise and thus reverberate it. However, since the DAC's least significant bit is connected and does change with the sign, the sound quality is improved slightly over the earlier implementation. To prevent digital signal overflow and its audible result, the digital output volume must be kept low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower main volume on the unit's front panel, which directly controls the software main volume setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the main volume knob and the software main volume setting only modify the volume of the analogue output using voltage-controlled amplifiers and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part's volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead. =A third-party solution= In the period of 1989 to 1993,http://www.firstpr.com.au/robin/cv.html Robin Whittle of Real World Interfaces offered aftermarket modifications to the MT-32 to address its sound quality issues, as well as improve the functionality of the reverberation unit, provide discrete analog outputs for the internal reverb send and reverb return, and provide battery backup of the MT-32's settings. According to documentation written in 1990, these modifications were only available for the first-generation MT-32, and not the later \\"headphone\\" model or any of the other MT-32 derivatives. Note that the RWI modifications were intended for those using the MT-32 professionally, and may cause some minor compatibility issues with video game soundtracks intended for a stock MT-32. In particular the changes to the reverb unit functionality will likely cause an RWI modified MT-32 to render reverberation differently from what was intended, with possibly detrimental effects. Compatibility problems First generation units, having control ROM versions below 2.00, require a 40 millisecond delay between system exclusive messages. Some computer games which were programmed to work with the compatible modules (see above) or later ROM versions that do not require this delay, fail to work with these units, producing incorrect sounds or causing the firmware to lock up due to a buffer overflow bug, requiring turning the unit off and on. However, some games were designed to exploit errors in earlier units, causing incorrect sound on later revisions. Also, some games were written to use instruments not found in the MT-32 models, and require a compatible module, such as a CM-32L, for proper sound playback. Music for PC games Despite its original purpose as a companion to other professional MIDI equipment, the MT-32 became one of several de facto standards for PC computer game publishers. Sierra On-Line, a leading PC game publisher of the time, took an interest in the sound-design of its PC games. Sierra secured a distribution deal to sell the MT-32 in the US, and invested heavily in giving its game titles (at the time) state-of-the-art sound by hiring professional composers to write in-game music. King's Quest IV, released in 1988, was the first Sierra title with a complete musical soundtrack scored on the MT-32. The MT-32 with a necessary MPU-401 interface cost $550.00 to purchase from Sierra when it first sold the device. Although the MT-32's high price prevented it from dominating the end-user market of gamers, other PC publishers quickly followed Sierra's lead, expanding the role of music in their own game titles with Roland supporting the industry by releasing CM modules for computer users. The MT-32 remained popular for musical composition well into the early 1990s, when the game-industry began to shift toward CD Audio. The proliferation of the General MIDI standard, along with competition from less expensive \\"wavetable\\" sample-based soundcards, led to the decline of musical soundtracks using the MT-32's proprietary features. Games that played General MIDI tracks on the MT-32 initialized the MT-32's sound bank to approximate the General MIDI Level 1 (GM1) specification, but avoided any of the MT-32's hallmark music-synthesis features, adhering to GM1's rather limited set of controllers. Emulation Due to the popularity of the MT-32 as a music playback device for computer games, many modern sound cards provide a simple \\"MT-32 emulation mode\\", usually realized by way of a sound mapping comprised either of General MIDI instruments rearranged to roughly represent the MT-32's preset sound bank, or of samples directly recorded from the original unit. Results are often considered poor, as the sampling technology used can not reflect the pitch- and time-variable characteristics of the original synthesizer technology, with the programming of custom sounds (see above) not being supported at all. One exception is the Orchid SoundWave 32 card released by Orchid Technology in 1994, whose on-board digital signal processor (DSP) allowed for a more faithful reproduction of the original sound characteristics. More recently, there have been attempts at emulating the LA synthesizer technology in software using images of the original PCM and control ROMs. The most notable of these emulators is the open-source project Munt,https://sourceforge.net/projects/munt/ which emulates the MT-32 hardware by way of a virtual device driver for Microsoft Windows, or a virtual MIDI device for OS X, BSD and Linux. It is also incorporated into ScummVM, an open-source adventure game interpreter, as of version 0.7.0. Munt is based on an earlier MT-32 Emulation Project, which was the source of a short-lived legal argument over distribution of the original ROM images with Roland Corporation, who manufactured the MT-32 and claims copyright on the ROM's data. Roland offers emulation of classic synthesizers via the Roland Cloud subscription service. Support for the D-50 was notably added in June 2017.

Bartholomew Fair is a Jacobean comedy in five acts by Ben Jonson. It was first staged on 31 October 1614 at the Hope Theatre by the Lady Elizabeth's Men company.Gurr (1992, 233). Written four years after The Alchemist, five after Epic≈ìne, or the Silent Woman, and nine after Volpone, it is in some respects the most experimental of these plays.Hibbard, p. xiv. The play was first printed in 1631, as part of a planned second volume of the first 1616 folio collection of Jonson's works, to be published by the bookseller Robert Allot‚Äîthough Jonson abandoned the plan when he became dissatisfied with the quality of the typesetting. Copies of the 1631 typecast were circulated, though whether they were sold publicly or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The play was published in the second folio of Jonson's works in 1640‚Äì41, published by Richard Meighen.Jonson's original 1616 folio collection of his works was reprinted in 1640, a volume sometimes called the second edition of the first folio. Meighen's 1641 volume contained later Jonson pieces, including Bartholomew Fair. Background The play is set at Bartholomew Fair, which from 1133 to 1855 was one of London's preeminent summer fairs. It opened on 24 August each year at Smithfield, in the northwestern part of the city. Smithfield, a site of slaughterhouses and public executions, was a fitting place for a fair that was part commerce and part spectacle. At once a trading event for cloth and other goods and a pleasure fair, the four-day event drew crowds from all classes of English society. Jonson's play uses this fair as the setting for an unusually detailed and diverse panorama of London life in the early seventeenth century. The one day of fair life represented in the play allows Jonson ample opportunity not just to conduct his plot but also to depict the vivid life of the fair, from pickpockets and bullies to justices and slumming gallants. Jonson also uses the characters that he creates as a way to comment on the social, religious and political conflicts of London society in Jacobean England. Synopsis The play begins with an extended bit of metadrama; the company's stage-keeper enters, criticising the play about to be performed because it lacks romantic and fabulous elements. He is then pushed from the stage by the book-keeper, who (serving as prologue) announces a contract between author and audience. The contract appears to itemise Jonson's discontentment with his audiences: Members are not to find political satire where none is intended; they are not to take as oaths such innocuous phrases as \\"God quit you\\"; they are not to \\"censure by contagion\\", but must exercise their own judgment; moreover, they are allowed to judge only in proportion to the price of their ticket. Perhaps most important, they agree not to expect a throwback to the sword-and-buckler age of Smithfield, for Jonson has given them a picture of the present and unromantic state of the fair. The play proper begins with a proctor and amateur dramatist Littlewit and his friends, Quarlous and Winwife; they are plotting how to win Dame Purecraft (a widow, and Littlewit's mother-in-law) from Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, a canting, hypocritical Puritan. This colloquy is interrupted by the entrance of Wasp, the irascible servant of Cokes, a country simpleton who is in town to marry Grace Wellborn. Grace is the ward of Adam Overdo, a Justice of the Peace; Overdo's wife is Cokes's sister. All of these characters are at Littlewit's to get a marriage license; having obtained it, they indulge Cokes's wish to visit the fair. Littlewit and his friends also plan to go to the fair to see a puppet-show Littlewit wrote. To overcome Busy's likely objections, they pretend that Win (Littlewit's wife) has a pregnant craving for roast pork. The Renaissance audience, familiar with stage satire of Puritans, would not have been surprised that Busy, far from abhorring the fair and its debauchery, is ready to rationalise his presence there as allowable and even godly. The first act ends with both groups, the genteel Overdos and the raffish Littlewits, headed for the fair. The fair propels these characters through experiences that put their social identities under extreme strain. Justice Overdo, well- read in the \\"disguised prince\\" tradition, assumes a disguise to ferret out wrongdoing at the fair; he is beaten by Wasp, falsely accused by Edgeworth, a cut-purse, and put in the stocks. Quarlous and Winwife engage Edgeworth to steal the marriage license from Wasp; he does so when Wasp is arrested after starting a fight. Wasp, too, is put in the stocks. Winwife has abandoned his plan to marry Dame Purecraft; instead, he and Quarlous fight for Grace's hand. Win Littlewit and Mistress Overdo are enlisted as prostitutes by the pimp Whit; Zeal-of-the-land Busy is arrested for preaching without license and put into the stocks. Cokes is robbed several times by Edgeworth and other denizens of the fair. All the imprisoned characters escape when Trouble-All, a seeming madman for whom Dame Purecraft has conceived a sudden passion, fights with the guards. The climax of the play occurs at the puppet show. Madame Overdo and Win are brought in, masked, as prostitutes; Madame Overdo is drunk. Overdo is still in disguise, and Quarlous has disguised himself as Trouble-All; in this guise, he stole the marriage license from Winwife and made it into a license for himself and Purecraft. The puppet show, a burlesque of Hero and Leander and Damon and Pythias, proceeds until Busy interrupts, claiming that the play is an abomination because the actors are cross-dressed. The puppets refute him decisively by raising their clothes, revealing that they have no sex. Busy announces himself converted into a \\"beholder\\" of plays. At this point, Justice Overdo reveals himself, intent on uncovering the \\"enormities\\" he has witnessed at the fair. He is in the process of punishing all of the various schemers and malefactors when his wife (still veiled) throws up and begins to call for him. Abashed, Overdo takes the advice of Quarlous and forgives all parties; Winwife marries Grace, Quarlous marries Purecraft, and all the characters are invited to Overdo's house for supper. Puritans Zeal-of-the-land Busy is Jonson's second foray, after The Alchemists Tribulation and Ananais, into a field of satire common in Jacobean drama: satire against Puritans. Various factors combined to make the godly or \\"precisians\\" obvious targets of ridicule. Though religious violence was comparatively uncommon in Jacobean England, the memory of such violence was fresh enough to make marginal believers or outsiders potential sources of anxiety or threat. This element of threat was especially notable in the second decade of James's reign, when the tenuous Calvinist consensus in the English Church began to disintegrate. In this context, stage attacks on the godly may have served to channel and release broader anxieties about social trends. Playwrights also had a more immediate reason for this animosity; Puritans had opposed the public theatre almost from its inception. Hostility to drama was not, of course, limited to separatists or Puritans; preachers of all shades of belief denounced the plays as profane and the theatres as sites of theft, drunkenness, and licentiousness. Correctly or not, playwrights treated Puritans as the main source of these attacks. On stage, the Puritan is a hypocritical, judgmental, and long-winded figure, masking his lusts behind a vocal obsession with trivialities; Busy, for example, announces his intention to eat pork at the fair merely to refute the charges of \\"Judaism\\" he claims are levelled at Puritans, and he ends up consuming two whole pigs. Performance history The induction allows for a more specific date of performance than is usual for Renaissance plays; the premi√®re took place on 31 October 1614 at the Hope Theatre in Bankside. Entries in the Revels accounts indicate that the performance was repeated at Whitehall for James I the next day. The royal account also lists ten pounds paid to Nathan Field for acting in the play; in the fifth act, Jonson causes Cokes to ask the puppetmaster, \\"Which is your best actor now...your Burbage...your Field?\\" There is no further record of performance until 1661, although it was likely to have remained in repertory to some degree until its anti-Puritan sentiments made it unwise to revive it. (William Oldys reports a traditional view that the inscription on Jonson's tomb (\\"O rare Ben Jonson\\") refers to the applause this play received, after the failure of Catiline,Herford and Simpson, Vol. 1, p. 183. indicating some degree of popularity. Samuel Pepys records seeing it four times in 1661, twice with the puppet show and twice without (8 June 27 June, 31 August and 7 September 1661). The play appears to have been revived intermittently through the earlier part of the eighteenth century; after that, in keeping with the waning taste for non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama in general and for Jonson in particular, the play fell into obscurity. It retained a degree of esteem in the study even as it disappeared from the boards; both Isaac Reed and Horace Walpole praised its wealth of invention in their accounts of Renaissance drama. John Brown revised the play and offered it to David Garrick; Garrick refused it, however, and Brown's text is lost. As with many long-ignored plays, Bartholomew Fair returned to the stage in a production by the Phoenix Society‚Äîthis one, in 1921 at the New Oxford Theatre. Its first professional revival came in 1949, when George Devine directed it at the Edinburgh International Festival; the next year, the same production appeared at the Old Vic. The puppets in this production were performed by George Speaight. The Bristol Old Vic produced the play in 1966. Terry Hands directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1969; this production included Ben Kingsley as Winwife and Helen Mirren as Win Littlewit. The production, which cut the long text and freely mixed period and modern properties, received generally negative reviews. The play was also performed (some time in the 1960s) at the University of California, Berkeley, with Stacey Keach playing Overdo. Richard Eyre produced the play for the National Theatre; his first production as head of the theatre, it was performed on the Olivier Stage in mid-Victorian costume. David Bamber, David Burke, and Stephen Moore were among the cast. Of this production, Eyre himself writes, \\"What felt as though it might have been a true popular success ‚Ä¶ shows itself to be dismal and unachieved. In 1998, Laurence Boswell directed the play for the RSC at the Swan Theatre. Featuring Zubin Varla and Poppy Miller, the production attempted to update Jonson's cheerfully downscale milieu with \\"Newcastle United shirts, garish yellow tweed and plenty of atmospheric sleaze\\" according to The Times; this review was mildly favourable,albemarle-london.com as were the others. The production was later revived at the Young Vic. The Stratford Shakespeare Festival mounted the New World's first professional production of the play in 2009, directed by Antoni Cimolino with original music composed by Steven Page. The cast featured Tom McCamus, Lucy Peacock, and Juan Chioran. The play was performed in 2019 at the Sam Wannamaker Theatre (part of Shakespeare's Globe) in London. Notes References *Barish, Jonas.

It is located at 65 Bond Street in Toronto's Garden District. St. Michael's was designed by William Thomas, designer of eight other churches in the city, and was primarily financed by Irish immigrants who resided in the area. The cathedral has a capacity of 1600. St. Michael's Cathedral is a major building of faith in downtown Toronto. It was originally constructed away from the city's centre, but over time the city has grown to encompass it. It was constructed to better serve the growing Roman Catholic population of Toronto. It is a prime example of the English Gothic Revival style of architecture. On September 29, 2016, the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel, the cathedral was elevated to a minor basilica.https://www.facebook.com/archtoronto/photos/a.324038377629138.83147.204943969538580/1283867851646181/?type=3&theater; Archdiocese The cathedral is home to Canada's largest English-speaking Catholic archdiocese. The current archbishop is Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 December 2006. In addition to worship services, the church sponsors a number of outreach programs for nearby residents. History The original designs for St. Michael's were designed by William Thomas. On April 7, 1845, construction began on St. Michael's Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, a three-story rectory adjacent to the Neo- Gothic cathedral. Both buildings were designed by William Thomas. Townspeople dug out the foundation by hand in return for a barbecue. Shipwrights made the interior columns out of maple and oak. On May 8, 1845, Bishop Power laid the cornerstone for the cathedral in the four-year-old diocese. Some fragments of a stone pillar from the old Norman-style York Minster Cathedral in England and some small pieces of the oak roof of that same cathedral were sealed within St. Michael's cornerstone. St. Michael's is a 19th-century interpretation of the Minster's 14th century English Gothic style. The connection with York Minster is appropriate, since Toronto was known as the town of York from its settlement in 1793 until it was incorporated in 1834 and the name was changed back. Bishop Power died on October 1, 1847, having contracted typhus while tending to his flock. His funeral was held at St. Paul's, and he was buried in the crypt of the unfinished St. Michael's Cathedral.\\"History of the Cathedral\\", St. Michael's Cathedral Also buried in the crypt is a man who fell from the roof during construction. St_MichaelsCathedral_12.pdf \\"Restoration of St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral: creeks, bones and a missing stone\\", National Post The cathedral was dedicated on August 29, 1848, to St. Michael the Archangel. On September 29, 1848, the cathedral was consecrated after substantial work by the Honourable John Elmsley and his friend Samuel G. Lynn to reduce the debt.\\"A Short History of St. Michael's Cathedral\\", St. Michael's Cathedral pamphlet The seventy nine meter bell tower, which contains two bells, was consecrated in 1866. The cathedral played an instrumental role in the founding of nearby St. Michael's Hospital when the Sisters of Saint Joseph, who came to Toronto at the request of Bishop Charbonnel to operate an orphanage and settlement house, responded to the need for care during a diphtheria epidemic in 1892. An Ontario Heritage Trust marker at the church notes its importance in the city's history. An additional plaque was installed on March 28, 1982, by the Archdiocese of Toronto at the rectory. Between 1852 and 1856, the rectory was home to St. Michael's College until it moved to its present location near the University of Toronto. St. Michael's College School, an all- boys school in the Toronto neighborhood of Forest Hill, was previously the high school section of the original college. The choir was started in 1926, and the original parish school founded in 1900 evolved into the present-day choir school. The choirboys from the school have presented a Christmas concert at the cathedral every year since 1939. The school continues to operate jointly under authority of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music and the Toronto Catholic District School Board. Architectural style St. Michael's Cathedral is built in the Gothic revival style. Since it was originally constructed by William Thomas from 1845 to 1848, the building has undergone two major renovations; the completion of the tower and spire was done by firm Gundry & Langley from 1865 to 1867, and the addition of dormers was done by Joseph Connolly in 1890. The interior of the church, divided into a large nave and two tall aisles, is lavishly decorated. The tall arcade, supported by graceful colonnettes, gives the interior space a feeling of openness and adds to the grand sense of scale that the building imposes. Church Street. St. Michael's Cathedral is located to the northwest of Church and Shuter streets in Toronto, with the parish office at 200 Church Street. The building is oriented on an off-east‚Äìwest axis aligned perpendicular to Church Street, with the main entrance on its west side located at 65 Bond Street. In adherence with the tradition of medieval churches, the cathedral's high altar is in the east end of the building, facing Jerusalem. The general composition of the building resembles that of a 13th or 14th century Gothic cathedral; however, the design is simplified and does not contain elements such as flying buttresses, transepts, or ribbed vaults. Also, because there are no transepts, the cathedral itself does not assume the typical cruciform shape of most medieval Gothic cathedrals.Kleinschmidt, Beda. \\"Transept.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 28 January 2016 Conversely, the secondary altars, or side-chapels, divide the cathedral in two down its length, providing a slight outcrop visible from the exterior. The building can be further subdivided down its length by the nine bays framed by the buttresses on the exterior of the building. The cathedral's tower supports a large iron spire located over its west entrance. At its tallest point, the tower reaches or approximately 26 stories above the ground, surpassing the height of many of the surrounding buildings. The scale of the cathedral is quite large within the context of its immediate surroundings; however, when examined in context with the surrounding office towers, the size of the cathedral shrinks considerably. From the exterior, the building maintains a distinctly Gothic appearance characterized by its pointed arches, buttressed walls, stone moulding and sharp iron accents. The building is set-back considerably from the street and features a tall iron fence around its perimeter, which further contributes to the building's sharp appearance.Arthur, Eric Ross, and T. Ritchie. Iron: cast and wrought iron in Canada from the seventeenth century to the present. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982. Print. The fence allows the building to maintain a semi- private front yard, featuring a stone-paved roundabout on its west side and a garden along its south side. Access from the east side of the building is limited due to the connection with the cathedral's rectory. =Exterior= Western entrance to St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica. The exterior fa√ßade of the church is a cream-coloured brick with stone accents. The exterior has a very neutral colour scheme, which contrasts the beauty of the interior. Teal- coloured shingles contrast gently with the cream exterior walls. In regards to shape, all of the fa√ßades vary considerably. The western fa√ßade houses the main entrance and pinnacle tower, and is arguably the most impressive side of the church. It faces Bond Street, with the building set back from the property line to create a small forecourt. The spire reaches a height of 260 feet. Much of the northern fa√ßade is hidden by the rectory and St. Michael's Choir School's main building. What little can be seen is spoiled by the protruding fire escape exit. The eastern fa√ßade, while not as impressive as the western fa√ßade, is, arguably, the most varied. A second school building occupies a site on the west side of Bond Street. Typical characteristics structures of Gothic Architecture include pointed arches called ‚Äòogivals‚Äô, flying buttresses, transverse arms, clerestory windows, pinnacles, and ribbed vaults, many of which are displayed in St. Michaels Cathedral. St. Michael's is a good example of a basilica, a large, rectilinear space with a longitudinal axis. The church runs along an east‚Äìwest axis, with an extruded portion running north‚Äìsouth, but not nearly as big as the main roof axis. The main axis is represented by the sloped roofs meeting together at the exact middle of the church. All axes are either parallel or perpendicular to each other, so the exterior of church has a very linear and symmetrical feel. =Interior= The floor plan for St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica. On the inside, the centre aisle along the main axis between the pews used for formal processions dominates. It is also used by parishioners taking their seats and going up for communion. The interior of the cathedral is laid out to create 5 designated spaces: a foyer, aka the narthex, the balcony, central aisle, left aisle and right aisle. When entering the church, the narthex creates a space that separates the public space from the sacred space. Marble stoups that contain holy water are located to the sides of the doors. If you proceed downstairs, there is the Crypt Chapel and Gift Store. Three sets of double-doors mirroring the front entrances allow guests into the cathedral. When entering the sacred space of the cathedral, its mass is arranged linearly based on a vertical axis, with two main arcades of stone. The two main arcades consists of ivory piers with patterned spandrels of blue and red, however, string courses outline the decorated triforium. The first three piers closest to the altar are topped with red abacuses to define the sacred space. The left and right aisles begin with ribbed vaults and then transition into an exposed beam ceiling. The interior walls are painted grey stone over plaster. The walls are lined with wall arcades. Facing the aisles, an etching of a gothic window profile is incrusted on each of the wooden benches. At the back of the cathedral are lacquered wooden sculptures. In the back corners of the Cathedral there are four wooden confessionals mimicking the arcade arches. The panels of the confessional are decorated with crosses. Sixteen cast-iron lanterns hang from the tall aisles that light up the cathedral. About midway down the aisles, there are two small chapels; the Blessed Virgin chapel on the north behind the baptismal front, and the Sacred Heart chapel on the south, decorated with small colourful stone tiles. Lit candles flickering in red and blue illuminate the sides of the church. Classic artwork like The Last Supper, as well as other religious paintings of Jesus, priests, and John the Baptist hang above the sanctuary. These paintings, murals and vignettes were done in the 1930s. Various sculptures of saints sit along the side aisles in front of the stained glass windows. The St. Michael's church choir sit on the right side of the altar. Behind the altar is a large ‚Äúsemi- circular oak reredos with one large episcopal chair of the Archbishop and six smaller chairs on either side for members of the clergy. =Stained-glass windows= Stained- glass window above the sanctuary of the cathedral depicts the crucifixion. It is one of three stained-glass windows in the church. Unlike many of the cathedrals constructed during the Gothic Revival Period St. Michael's retains a rich and colourful interior characteristic of classic Gothic cathedrals. The stained-glass in the Cathedral is of the ‚Äúantique‚Äù variety which is hand-blown in typical medieval style resulting in deeper colour when compared to typical machine-rolled glass used in other churches at the time. The largest piece of stained glass, located on the east side of the building was imported from France in 1858 and created by √âtienne Th√©venot, the same artist who created some of the windows for Notre Dame and various other churches in Paris. The stained-glass windows located on the north and south walls originate from Austria and Bavaria and were installed during the late 1800s and early 1900s replacing the original clear pane. Despite the intentional Gothic style evident in many of the designs of these windows they are actually late-baroque in style. The eastern stained glass window above the altar, the focus of the church's interior is the stained glass window of the crucifixion. The tableau was installed in 1958 by √âtienne Th√©venot, a French pioneer of the medieval glass revival. Blue, yellow and red are the most prominent colours in the window. The deep blue sky with small blood-red squares of glass leading in the regular grid fall into larger and smaller bands of maroon, plum, and purple enlivened by emerald, viridian and gold. The central panel of the oculus there is a depiction of the Blessed Sacrament symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Underneath the stained glass window is an intricate wooden reredos with gold and green detailing. =Restorations= The exterior of the cathedral has remained relatively unchanged over the last 100 years. In 1864, the Toronto firm Gundry and Langley added an enlarged sacristy to the cathedral. In 1866, the same firm was also responsible for the addition of the tower and spire which adorns the west entrance of the cathedral. The interior of the basilica in 2017. In 1880, the current three-manual pipe organ was installed in the cathedral's gallery by Archbishop Joseph Lynch. The dormered windows located on the roof were added some time in the 1890s with the intent to improve the cathedral's appearance; it is believed that architect Joseph Connolly was responsible for their design.Arthur, Eric Ross, and Stephen A. Otto. Toronto: no mean city. 3rd ed. Toronto & Buffalo, 1986. Print. The interior of the building has remained the same in terms of its plan; however, since the Second Vatican Council, the original high altar was dismantled and used to create a new tabernacle shrine, now located to the south of the sanctuary, while a new table altar was placed in the centre of the sanctuary. Most of the present paintings that adorn the roof and walls of the cathedral date to 1937, with several smaller ones having been added since, the most recent in 1982.Cook, Brian. St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto, a short history and guide. Toronto: Toronto : St. Michael's Cathedral, 1989. Print To the right of the altar, there is a wooden monument for the Blessed Sacrament that is the result of a re-design of 1980 directed by Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter. In 2011, restorations are taking place that will include the west facade being cleaned, bringing the bricks back to their original yellow colour. In June 2015 it was announced that the 168 year old Cathedral would be closing for the next nine months to deal with safety concerns over a long- running restoration process.Ferreira, Victor. \\"St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral in Toronto to close for nine months to deal with structural safety concerns\\", National Post, June 17, 2015 St. Paul's Basilica planned to add three weekend Masses to accommodate parishioners from St. Michael's.\\"St. Michael's Cathedral closed over safety issues\\", National Catholic Register, June 17, 2015 The cathedral was slated to open briefly in December 2015 for Christmas masses before closing again until March 2016.Balca, Dario. \\"St. Michael's Cathedral to reopen after major renovations\\", CTV News, December 7, 2015 Concrete pillars replaced existing ones after it was discovered that mortar was failing.O'Shea, Sean.

He is one of the founders of the Cuban nueva trova, along with Silvio Rodr√≠guez and Noel Nicola. His music, originating in the Trova, Son and other traditional styles of early 20th Century Cuban music, set him apart from the style of Silvio Rodr√≠guez. Biography Pablo Milan√©s, widely known as Pablito, moved with his family from Bayamo to Havana in 1950. He studied in the Conservatorio Municipal de La Habana, at the time the most prestigious musical school in the country. His first public performance was in 1956. By age 15, he was active in \\"bohemian\\" musical circles in Havana, associated the so-called \\"filin\\" musicians. Although he supported the Cuban Revolution, in 1965 he was sent to the UMAP agricultural forced-labor camp in Camag√ºey. In 1967, he escaped and fled to Havana to denounce the injustice of the labor camp. This resulted in his imprisonment, first for two months in La Caba√±a, an 18th-century fortress in Havana, and then for a time in a prison camp. He was released when the prison camp was closed due to international pressure. In 1969, he became part of the Grupo de Experimentaci√≥n Sonora, a seminal group of young musicians, many of whom became founding members of the nueva trova, which started as a movement with a concert given by Pablo, Silvio Rodriguez, and Noel Nicola on February 18, 1968. Until the late 1980s, nueva trova was the unofficial musical style of the Cuban Revolution. Since his first recording (\\"Versos sencillos de Jos√© Mart√≠\\" in 1973), he has issued more than 40 solo records, and many more in collaboration with other artists from Cuba, elsewhere in Latin America, and Spain. His first record with original songs (the eponymous \\"Pablo Milan√©s\\") was not issued until 1976. The heyday of his creativity occurred probably in the early 1980s, with his records \\"El guerrero\\", \\"Yo me quedo\\", and \\"Comienzo y final de una verde ma√±ana\\". Within the context of the nueva trova, Pablo is widely considered one of the closest to the traditional roots of Cuban music, while being open to diverse musical influences from other contemporary traditions, such as Brazilian music and Blues. The range of his compositions extends from starkly political anthems to inspired love songs. He has set the poems of Cuban writers such as Jos√© Mart√≠ and Nicol√°s Guill√©n to music. Some of his most important musical influences have been Mar√≠a Teresa Vera, Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Barbarito Diez, Benny Mor√©, Lucho Gatica, and Johann Sebastian Bach. He has lived in Vigo, Spain, with his Spanish wife and two sons since 2004. In 2014, he received a kidney transplant, receiving an organ donated by his wife. Since relocating to Spain, Milan√©s has been publicly critical of some aspects of the Cuban government, though he remains dedicated to the Cuban Revolution. His willingness to speak openly about the failures of the revolution strained his relations with Silvio Rodriguez. Lately, he has not participated in pro-government campaigns.

Additionally, the validation of migrated data for completeness and the decommissioning of legacy data storage are considered part of the entire data migration process. Data migration is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade, or consolidation, and it is typically performed in such a way as to be as automated as possible, freeing up human resources from tedious tasks. Data migration occurs for a variety of reasons, including server or storage equipment replacements, maintenance or upgrades, application migration, website consolidation, disaster recovery, and data center relocation. The standard phases , \\"nearly 40 percent of data migration projects were over time, over budget, or failed entirely.\\" As such, to achieve an effective data migration, proper planning is critical. While the specifics of a data migration plan may vary‚Äîsometimes significantly‚Äîfrom project to project, the computing company IBM suggests there are three main phases to most any data migration project: planning, migration, and post-migration. Each of those phases has its own steps. During planning, dependencies and requirements are analyzed, migration scenarios get developed and tested, and a project plan that incorporates the prior information is created. During the migration phase, the plan is enacted, and during post-migration, the completeness and thoroughness of the migration is validated, documented, closed out, including any necessary decommissioning of legacy systems. For applications of moderate to high complexity, these data migration phases may be repeated several times before the new system is considered to be fully validated and deployed. Planning: The data, applications, etc. that will be migrated are selected based on business, project, and technical requirements and dependencies. Hardware and bandwidth requirements are analyzed. Feasible migration and back-out scenarios are developed, as well as the associated tests, automation scripts, mappings, and procedures. Data cleansing and transformation requirements are also gauged for data formats to improve data quality and to eliminate redundant or obsolete information. Migration architecture is decided on and developed, any necessary software licenses are obtained, and change management processes are started. Migration: Hardware and software requirements are validated, and migration procedures are customized as necessary. Some sort of pre-validation testing may also occur to ensure requirements and customized settings function as expected. If all is deemed well, migration begins, including the primary acts of data extraction, where data is read from the old system, and data loading, where data is written to the new system. Additional verification steps ensure the developed migration plan was enacted in full. Post-migration: After data migration, results are subjected to data verification to determine whether data was accurately translated, is complete, and supports processes in the new system. During verification, there may be a need for a parallel run of both systems to identify areas of disparity and forestall erroneous data loss. Additional documentation and reporting of the migration project is conducted, and once the migration is validated complete, legacy systems may also be decommissioned. Migration close-out meetings will officially end the migration process. =Project versus process= There is a difference between data migration and data integration activities. Data migration is a project by means of which data will be moved or copied from one environment to another, and removed or decommissioned in the source. During the migration (which can take place over months or even years), data can flow in multiple directions, and there may be multiple migrations taking place simultaneously. The ETL (extract, transform, load) actions will be necessary, although the means of achieving these may not be those traditionally associated with the ETL acronym. Data integration, by contrast, is a permanent part of the IT architecture, and is responsible for the way data flows between the various applications and data stores‚Äîand is a process rather than a project activity. Standard ETL technologies designed to supply data from operational systems to data warehouses would fit within the latter category. Categories Data is stored on various media in files or databases, and is generated and consumed by software applications, which in turn support business processes. The need to transfer and convert data can be driven by multiple business requirements, and the approach taken to the migration depends on those requirements. Four major migration categories are proposed on this basis. =Storage migration= A business may choose to rationalize the physical media to take advantage of more efficient storage technologies. This will result in having to move physical blocks of data from one tape or disk to another, often using virtualization techniques. The data format and content itself will not usually be changed in the process and can normally be achieved with minimal or no impact to the layers above. =Database migration= Similarly, it may be necessary to move from one database vendor to another, or to upgrade the version of database software being used. The latter case is less likely to require a physical data migration, but this can happen with major upgrades. In these cases a physical transformation process may be required since the underlying data format can change significantly. This may or may not affect behavior in the applications layer, depending largely on whether the data manipulation language or protocol has changed. However, some modern applications are written to be almost entirely agnostic to the database technology, so a change from Sybase, MySQL, DB2 or SQL Server to Oracle should only require a testing cycle to be confident that both functional and non- functional performance has not been adversely affected. =Application migration= Changing application vendor‚Äîfor instance a new CRM or ERP platform‚Äîwill inevitably involve substantial transformation as almost every application or suite operates on its own specific data model and also interacts with other applications and systems within the enterprise application integration environment. Furthermore, to allow the application to be sold to the widest possible market, commercial off-the-shelf packages are generally configured for each customer using metadata. Application programming interfaces (APIs) may be supplied by vendors to protect the integrity of the data they have to handle. It is also possible to script the web interfaces of vendors to automatically migrate data. =Business process migration= Business processes operate through a combination of human and application systems actions, often orchestrated by business process management tools. When these change they can require the movement of data from one store, database or application to another to reflect the changes to the organization and information about customers, products and operations. Examples of such migration drivers are mergers and acquisitions, business optimization, and reorganization to attack new markets or respond to competitive threat. The first two categories of migration are usually routine operational activities that the IT department takes care of without the involvement of the rest of the business. The last two categories directly affect the operational users of processes and applications, are necessarily complex, and delivering them without significant business downtime can be challenging. A highly adaptive approach, concurrent synchronization, a business-oriented audit capability, and clear visibility of the migration for stakeholders‚Äîthrough a project management office or data governance team‚Äîare likely to be key requirements in such migrations.  Migration as a form of digital preservation  Migration, which focuses on the digital object itself, is the act of transferring, or rewriting data from an out-of-date medium to a current medium and has for many years been considered the only viable approach to long-term preservation of digital objects. Reproducing brittle newspapers onto microfilm is an example of such migration. = Disadvantages = * Migration addresses the possible obsolescence of the data carrier, but does not address the fact that certain technologies which run the data may be abandoned altogether, leaving migration useless. * Time-consuming ‚Äì migration is a continual process, which must be repeated every time a medium reaches obsolescence, for all data objects stored on a certain media. * Costly ‚Äì an institution must purchase additional data storage media at each migration.

Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system, the minority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat. The position could be considered similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition in parliamentary systems. In bicameral legislatures, the counterpart to the minority leader in the lower house is the Speaker, and the majority leader is hence only the second-most senior member of the majority caucus. Contrastingly, in upper houses, the titular Speaker is frequently a separately elected officer such as a lieutenant governor or vice president. The minority leader is often assisted in his/her role by one or more whips, whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote against the position of the party leaders. Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures (such as demotion from choice committee assignments) for members who violate the party line; decisions such as these are often made by the minority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders. In a state where the executive branch and both houses of the state legislature are controlled by the other party, the minority leader of one of the houses (most often the upper one) may be seen as the most senior member of the party in that state with regard to state government (although inferior in rank to a United States Senator or United States Representative, if there be such in that party from that state). At times, particularly during crucial legislation, the minority leader may be consulted by the opposite leader in order to more easily get things passed and ensure that provisions important to the interests the minority party be included. The level of partisanship in state legislative bodies varies greatly from one state to another.

She was an early advocate of a child-centered approach to education and parenting, and was also a suffragist. She is best known for her book on education Barnets √•rhundrade (1900), which was translated in English in 1909 as The Century of the Child.Barnets √•rhundrade at Project Runeberg Biography =Early life= Ellen Key was born at Sundsholm mansion in Sm√•land, Sweden, on 11 December 1849.Ellen Key - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Her father was Emil Key, the founder of the Swedish Agrarian Party and a frequent contributor to the Swedish newspaper Aftonposten. Her mother was Sophie Posse Key, who was born into an aristocratic family from the southernmost part of Sk√•ne County. Emil bought Sundsholm at the time of his wedding; twenty years later he sold it for financial reasons. Ellen was mostly educated at home, where her mother taught her grammar and arithmetic and her foreign-born governess taught her foreign languages. She cited reading Amtmandens D√∏tre (The Official's Daughters, 1855) by Camilla Collett and Henrik Ibsen's plays Kj√¶rlighedens komedie (Love's Comedy, 1862), Brand (1865), and Peer Gynt (1867) as her childhood influences. When she was twenty years old, her father was elected to the Riksdag and they moved to Stockholm, where she would capitalize on the access to libraries. Ellen Key also studied at the progressive Rossander Course.Ambj√∂rnsson, Ronny, Ellen Key: en europeisk intellektuell, Bonnier, Stockholm, 2012 =1870s= After a correspondence with Urban von Feilitzen, who wrote Protestantismens Maria-kult (The Protestant Cult of Mary, 1874), she had written a review of the book for a periodical, under the pseudonym Robinson. His book gave her thoughts structure, helping to define her beliefs concerning the role of women as mothers and nurturers. Key hoped Feilitzen would leave his wife, as they did not share similar interests, but he refused. In the summer of 1874, Key traveled to Denmark and studied their folk colleges. Folk colleges were institutions of higher learning for young people from the countryside. One of her early ambitions was to found a Swedish folk high school, but instead she decided, in 1880, to become a teacher at Anna Whitlock's school for girls in Stockholm. Shortly after she moved to Stockholm, she befriended Sophie Adlersparre, who was the editor of Tidskrift f√∂r Hemmet (Journal for the Home), founded in 1859 by Adlersparre and Rosalie Olivecrona. In 1874 Tidskrift f√∂r Hemmet published her first article. It was about Camilla Collett, and other articles soon followed. She would also do some biographical studies on George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Fredrika-Bremer- f√∂rbundet (the Fredrika Bremer Society), the liberal women's organization, was founded in 1884. Many of the writers for Tidskrift f√∂r Hemmet were members. =1880s= In 1883, Key began teaching at Anton Nystr√∂m new school, the People's Institute, which was founded in 1880. She also helped organize \\"The Twelves\\", a group of twelve upper class ladies who sponsored and organized social functions to help improve working class ladies' manners. Even though Key did share a lot of similar beliefs with the members of Fredrika-Bremer- f√∂rbundet, two main issues made her oppose the group in the mid-1880s: the importance of sexuality and the social significance of the biological differences between women and men. 1886 saw Key publishing Om reaktionen mot kvinnofr√•gan (On the Reaction against the Woman Question) which was highly critical and argued against the egalitarian tendencies of the Swedish women's movement. The piece was published in Gustaf af Geijerstam's journal Revy i litter√§ra och sociala fr√•gor (Review of Literary and Social Issues). Also in 1886, she wrote a review of En sommarsaga (A Summer Story, 1886) by Anne Charlotte Leffler in the short-lived journal Fram√•t (Forward). She was critical of the piece for having one woman's attempt to combine marriage, motherhood, and a career as an artist. In 1886, she became one of the founders of the Swedish Dress Reform Society. Key contributed to three journals all with different views on women's rights: Tidskrift f√∂r Hemmet, Dagny, and Fram√•t. The latter was edited by G√∂teborg Alma √Ökermark and tended to have taboo information, including publishing texts on syphilis, sexual repression and socialism. Mathilda Malling's Pyrrhus-segrar (Pyrrhic Victories), published in 1886 under the pseudonym Stella Kleve, was very controversial among Scandinavian intellectuals. The story dealt with a dying young woman, who laments that if she had done the things she wanted to do, she may not be dying. Also in Naturenliga arbetsomr√•den f√∂r kvinnan (Natural Lines of Work for Women) and Kvinnopsykologi och kvinnlig logik (Female Psychology and Logic, 1896) Key said a \\"monogamous heterosexual relationship aimed toward procreation formed the crux of a woman's happiness and fulfillment.\\" In 1889, she published N√•gra tankar om huru reaktioner uppst√•, j√§mte ett genm√§le till d:r Carl v. Bergen, samt om yttrande och tryckfrihet (Some Thoughts about How Reactions Begin), which marked her a social radical, which she would never deny. =Changing views= Key grew up in an atmosphere of liberalism, and throughout the 1870s her political beliefs were radically liberal. She was republican-minded, with the idea of freedom holding vast importance for her. As the 1880s advanced, her thinking became even more radical, affecting first her religious beliefs and then her views on life in society in general. This was the outcome of extensive reading. During the latter part of the 1880s and particularly in the 1890s, she began to read socialist literature and turned increasingly towards socialism. Key was raised in a rigid Christian household, but while growing up she started questioning her views. From 1879 she studied Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer and T. H. Huxley. In the autumn of that year she met both Huxley and Haeckel, the German biologist and philosopher, in London. The principle of evolution, in which Ellen Key had come to believe, was also to have an influence on her educational views. She is quoted as having said: :\\"Side by side with the class war, the culture war must ceaselessly be waged by the young and among the young upon whom rests the responsibility of making the new society better for all than the old could be.\\" =Later life= In the late 1880s/early 1890s, Key decided to write biographies of women who had prominent roles in Swedish intellectual life; they were: Victoria Benedictsson, Anne Charlotte Leffler, and Sonia Kovalevsky. She would also write about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Carl Jonas Love Almqvist. The Cambridge Chronicle of Cambridge, Massachusetts on October 19, 1912 noted that in The Atlantic Monthly, Ellen Key, the Swedish writer, who has had such immense influence over the woman movement throughout Europe, makes her first appearance in an American periodical with her article on \\"Motherliness\\".The Cambridge Chronicle, Cambridge, Massachusetts, October 19, 1912, p. 20 The Woman Movement by Ellen Key was published in Swedish in 1909, and in an English translation in 1912 by G. P. Putnam's Sons.https://archive.org/details/thewomanmovement00keyeuoft After she retired from teaching, she met and helped the young poet Rainer Maria Rilke. She was later painted by Hanna Pauli. In Die Antifeministen (The Antifeminists, 1902) by Hedwig Dohm cited both Key and Lou Andreas-Salom√© as anti-feminists. She died on 25 April 1926 at the age of seventy-six. Selected works Ellen Key started her career as a writer in the mid-1870s with literary essays. She became known to a large public through the pamphlet On Freedom of Speech and Publishing (1889). Her name and her books then became the topic of lively discussions. The following work focuses on her views on education, personal freedom, and the independent development of the individual. These works include: *Individualism and Socialism (1896) *Images of Thought (1898) *Human- beings (1899) *Lifelines, volumes I-III (1903‚Äì06) *Neutrality of the Souls (1916). On education, her earliest article may be Teachers for Infants at Home and in School in Tidskrift f√∂r hemmet (1876). Her first more widely read essay, Books versus Coursebooks, was published in the journal Verdandi (1884). Later, in the same journal, she published other articles A Statement on Co- Education (1888) and Murdering the Soul in Schools (1891). Later she published the works Education (1897) and Beauty for All (1899). In 1906 came Popular Education with Special Consideration for the Development of Aesthetic Sense. In the last books Key views aesthetics, as beauty and art, from the aspect of the elevation of humanity.From Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education. (Copyright UNESCO: International Bureau of Education 2000) Several of Key's writings were translated into English by Mamah Borthwick, during the period of her affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Among her best-known works published in English: *The Morality of Woman (1911) *Love and Marriage (1911, repr. with critical and biographical notes by Havelock Ellis, 1931) *The Century of the Child (1909) *The Woman Movement (1912) *The Younger Generation (1914) *War, Peace, and the Future (1916).The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Copyright 2001-05 Columbia University Press. Legacy She has inspired writers such as Selma Lagerl√∂f, Marika Stjernstedt, Waka Yamada and Elin W√§gner. Maria Montessori wrote that she predicted the 20th Century would be the century of the child.Montessori, Maria (1972). The Secret of Childhood, New York, Ballantine Books. Havelock Ellis wrote positively on her studies of human sexuality. Key maintained that motherhood is so crucial to society that the government, rather than their husbands, should support mothers and their children. These ideas regarding state child support influenced social legislation in several countries. A substantial collection of Key's papers is at the Royal Library in Stockholm. In the 1890s, Key commissioned the Strand house designed by architect Yngve Rasmussen. In the 1890s, it was \\"a centre for the politically radical intellectual and artistic avant-garde of Stockholm\\". Key's house has become a foundation and tourist spot.

Ballito is about north of Durban. It forms part of the KwaDukuza Local Municipality, and iLembe District Municipality. Dolphins are common on this stretch of the North Coast shoreline, hence the nickname Dolphin Coast. History The town was established in 1954 as a private township, by the Glen Anil Development Corporation/Investments which was headed up by Dr Edward (Eddie) Rubenstein (1903‚Äì1972). The town's name was borrowed from a glossy advert for Ballito hosiery made by Ballito Hosiery Limited of St. Albans, England. The area was originally portion of a sugar cane farm at Compensation Beach owned by Basil Townsend. The Sunday Tribune printed in 1954 an advert for Ballito Bay inviting potential investors to the North Coast with prices of land from R790.00 (395 SA Pounds). By 1964 the zonings for Ballitoville's residential buildings, hotels and a caravan park had already been incorporated into the town plan known as Compensation Beach and this area stretched out from Willard Beach to Clark Bay, Salmon Bay and Port Zimbali. A brochure with the first marketing pictures of Ballito, was put out to attract the holiday makers to invest in the area with the slogan: \\"Buy, Build & Play at Ballito Bay, The Caribbean of the North Coast ‚Äì Natal\\". Ballito, Salt Rock and Shaka's Rock are favourite holiday destinations for local South Africans and also foreign tourists on their way to Zululand and the historical battlefields. Jack Nash (1914‚Äì2016) gives a personal history from the early beginning of Ballito through to 1986 when he left the area and includes a history of some of the early pioneers and characters of the town. These include his father-in-law, Reg Fripp, who built many of the early houses. Jack Nash, who lived until shortly before his death in Amber Valley, Howick, own history includes being the Estate Agent for Glen Anil in Ballito through to him being the Chairman of the Ballito and the North Coast Publicity Associations. Jack's wife Gaye Nash n√©e Fripp, the young ballet dancer holding the \\"little ball\\" or ballito above her head in the full page press release to publicise the then new township in the Sunday Tribune of 23 November 1954, still lives in Howick. Tourism Today Ballito is a thriving community of its own with ties to primary and high schools in and around Ballito, Umhlanga, Stanger and Tongaat. Ballito has grown exponentially in recent times and has two shopping malls, Lifestyle centre and The Junction. Fantastic family adventure attractions such as the crocodile farm and microlight flights and tours. It is a holiday destination with hotels and self-catering accommodation, swimming (Willard) and surfing beaches (Boulder). A promenade about long along the beach front allows for walking and jogging. The Gunston 500 surfing contest, renamed Ballito Pro sponsored by Billabong, has been shifted from the Bay of Plenty in Durban's Golden Mile to Ballito where it is held annually in July. Business sector Ballito's business sector has also grown significantly with a large commercial business park bordering the N2 freeway. With a full service industry within the commercial business park, Ballito now caters to a growing business community on the North Coast. Enterprise iLembe, the region's investment arm, has been formed to develop Ballito and the iLembe area as an investment destination of choice. The development of the King Shaka International Airport and Dube City to the south have also contributed significantly to the growth of Ballito. Growth In recent years, there has been a population boom in Ballito. Various secure or gated estates, the largest being Zimbali Coastal Resort & Estate followed by Simbithi, have been built in and around the town on land that was previously used as sugar cane farms. Many new hotels and resorts have opened, drawing even more tourists into this picturesque part of the KwaZulu-Natal coast. Plans are currently on the table for new schools to be constructed, a new town centre, a taxi rank, and a larger clinic. The main entrance to Ballito from the N2 highway has been upgraded, with the construction of an multi level interchange to ease traffic, the widening of the road to four lanes in Ballito Drive, and proper pedestrian walkways.

SET was not itself a payment system, but rather a set of security protocols and formats that enabled users to employ the existing credit card payment infrastructure on an open network in a secure fashion. However, it failed to gain attraction in the market. Visa now promotes the 3-D Secure scheme. Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a system for ensuring the security of financial transactions on the Internet. It was supported initially by Mastercard, Visa, Microsoft, Netscape, and others. With SET, a user is given an electronic wallet (digital certificate) and a transaction is conducted and verified using a combination of digital certificates and digital signatures among the purchaser, a merchant, and the purchaser's bank in a way that ensures privacy and confidentiality  History and development  The SET Design Team at Visa International offices in Foster City, California, July, 1996 in a picture to commemorate the publication of the work, which was followed by a lunch on San Francisco Bay. SET was developed by the SET Consortium, established in 1996 by Visa and Mastercard in cooperation with GTE, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, SAIC, Terisa Systems, RSA, and VeriSign.Merkow p.248 The consortium‚Äôs goal was to combine the card associations' similar but incompatible protocols (STT from Visa/Microsoft and SEPP from Mastercard/IBM) into a single standard. SET allowed parties to identify themselves to each other and exchange information securely. Binding of identities was based on X.509 certificates with several extensions.SET Specification Book 2 p.214 SET used a cryptographic blinding algorithm that, in effect, would have let merchants substitute a certificate for a user's credit card number. If SET were used, the merchant itself would never have had to know the credit-card numbers being sent from the buyer, which would have provided verified good payment but protected customers and credit companies from fraud. SET was intended to become the de facto standard payment method on the Internet between the merchants, the buyers, and the credit-card companies. Unfortunately, the implementation by each of the primary stakeholders was either expensive or cumbersome. There were also some external factors that may have complicated how the consumer element would be integrated into the browser. There was a rumor circa 1994-1995 that suggested that Microsoft sought an income stream of 0.25% from every transaction secured by Microsoft's integrated SET compliant components they would implement in their Internet browser.  Key features  To meet the business requirements, SET incorporates the following features: * Confidentiality of information * Integrity of data * Cardholder account authentication * Merchant authentication  Participants  A SET system includes the following participants: * Cardholder * Merchant * Issuer * Acquirer * Payment gateway * Certification authority =How it works= Both cardholders and merchants must register with the CA (certificate authority) first, before they can buy or sell on the Internet. Once registration is done, cardholder and merchant can start to do transactions, which involve nine basic steps in this protocol, which is simplified. # Customer browses the website and decides on what to purchase # Customer sends order and payment information, which includes two parts in one message: #:a. Purchase order ‚Äì this part is for merchant #:b. Card information ‚Äì this part is for merchant‚Äôs bank only. # Merchant forwards card information (part b) to their bank # Merchant‚Äôs bank checks with the issuer for payment authorization # Issuer sends authorization to the merchant‚Äôs bank # Merchant‚Äôs bank sends authorization to the merchant # Merchant completes the order and sends confirmation to the customer # Merchant captures the transaction from their bank # Issuer prints credit card bill (invoice) to the customer  Dual signature  As described in : The message digest (MD) of the OI and the PI are independently calculated by the customer. These are concatenated and another MD is calculated from this. Finally, the dual signature is created by encrypting the MD with the customer's secret key. The dual signature is sent to both the merchant and the bank. The protocol arranges for the merchant to see the MD of the PI without seeing the PI itself, and the bank sees the MD of the OI but not the OI itself. The dual signature can be verified using the MD of the OI or PI, without requiring either the OI or PI. Privacy is preserved as the MD can't be reversed, which would reveal the contents of the OI or PI.

R. Patil (16 August 1957 - 16 February 2015) was an Indian politician from the state of Maharashtra. He was an MLA for Tasgaon vidhan sabha constituency from 1991 to 2015. He was an important leader of modern Maharashtra. He was a member of the Nationalist Congress Party. He became Home Minister of Maharashtra for the second time after the 2009 Maharashtra assembly election victory of the Congress-NCP alliance. He was also the former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Early life R. R. Patil, popularly known as \\"Aaba\\", (Marathi :‡§Ü‡§¨‡§æ) was born on 16 August 1957 in the village of Anjani, in the Tasgaon taluka, Sangli district in the State of Maharashtra. Despite his father being the village head, their financial condition was not good. He completed most of his education under the government scheme of \\"Earn & Learn\\". He obtained a B.A. and an LL.B. from Shantiniketan college in Sangli. Career Patil was a member of Sangli Zillah Parishad from 1979 to 1990 from Savlaj constituency, then was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly in 1990, 1995, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 representing Tasgaon, in Sangli district. He became the Chief Whip of the Congress Party in the assembly as well as the chairman of the public accounts committee of the assembly in 1996-97 and 1998-99\\\\. After 1999 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, he became the Rural Development Minister of Maharashtra in the Congress-NCP coalition government in October 1999. He became the Home Minister of Maharashtra on 25 December 2003. After taking charge of Home Ministry, he also sought guardianship of naxal activity affected district Gadchiroli. Since then, in spite of many naxal attacks, he encouraged natives to support elected government through some developmental work for them. On 1 November 2004, he was sworn in as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra. He was also the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party's Maharashtra unit and NCP legislative party in Maharashtra. He was the most respected politician in Maharashtra, also christened as 'Mr Clean' in political circles due to his clean image in the erstwhile tainted political party and also due to cleanliness awareness initiatives like \\"Gadage Baba Swachata Abhiyan\\" & \\"Tantamukt Gaon\\". Controversy His comments in the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks have drawn severe criticism for downplaying the gravity of the situation. He was quoted as saying, \\"They (the terrorists) came to kill 5,000 people but we ensured minimal damage\\". Sources close to him have argued that his comments are being taken out of context and that he did not intend to downplay the grievous attack. He resigned on 1 December 2008 after further remarks on the attacks. When asked at a press conference whether the terror strike was an intelligence failure Patil said, \\"It is not like that. In big cities like this, small incidents do happen. It's [sic] is not a total failure.\\" Patil's words drew flak from many quarters. Mumbai residents who saw him say this on television or were told about it by reporters pointed out the irony of politicians making such statements after being provided high security.

The province began the process of updating its laws to recognize same-sex marriage after the passage in the House of Commons of Canada of the Civil Marriage Act, the federal law recognizing such marriages. It had been one of only four provinces and territories, with Alberta, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, where same-sex marriage had not already been legalized by court challenges prior to the passage of the law. Background On December 10, 2004, Premier Pat Binns stated that his Government would wait for federal legislation to resolve the issue. It is unclear how Binns would have reacted if a provincial court had found the man-woman definition of marriage in violation of the Charter rights of gays and lesbians. Provincial legislation After the House of Commons of Canada passed the Civil Marriage Act in June 2005, provincial Attorney-General Mildred Dover announced that the province would bring provincial legislation in line with the law, which passed through the Senate in July and received royal assent the next day on July 20, 2005.(Globe and Mail) However, Ms. Dover announced that same-sex marriage licences would not be issued until the province's laws were updated. This was different from how the process has worked in other provinces; in those where courts called for same-sex marriage, and in Alberta after the Civil Marriage Act was passed. Complaints immediately arose charging that the delay imposed by the province was illegal and violated the legal rights of same-sex couples. In response to these complaints, the province reversed its position. The first same-sex couple to wed on Prince Edward Island were Dr. Chris Zarow and Constance Majeau on August 20, 2005, as reported by the Charlottetown Guardian. In May 2008, provincial law was finally updated and brought in line with federal legislation. A bill amending the Marriage Act, the Adoption Act and many other acts was given royal assent. It replaced the words \\"husband and wife\\" with the gender-neutral term \\"spouses\\" in the Marriage Act. The Adoption Act was amended by allowing same-sex couples to adopt children jointly. The law took effect on 19 December 2009.TABLE OF PUBLIC ACTS References External links * Prince Edward Island Category:Prince Edward Island law ","title":"Same-sex marriage in Prince Edward Island"},{"id":"1135529","text":"Hardiness of plants describes their ability to survive adverse growing conditions. It is usually limited to discussions of climatic adversity. Thus a plant's ability to tolerate cold, heat, drought, flooding, or wind are typically considered measurements of hardiness. Hardiness of plants is defined by their native extent's geographic location: longitude, latitude and elevation. These attributes are often simplified to a hardiness zone. In temperate latitudes, the term most often describes resistance to cold, or \\"cold-hardiness\\", and is generally measured by the lowest temperature a plant can withstand. Hardiness of a plant is usually divided into two categories: tender, and hardy. (Some sources also use the erroneous terms \\"Half-hardy\\" or \\"Fully hardy\\".) Tender plants are those killed by freezing temperatures, while hardy plants survive freezing--at least down to certain temperatures, depending on the plant. \\"Half-hardy\\" is a term used sometimes in horticulture to describe bedding plants which are sown in heat in winter or early spring, and planted outside after all danger of frost has passed. \\"Fully hardy\\" usually refers to plants being classified under the Royal Horticultural Society classifications, and can often cause confusion to those not using this method. Plants vary greatly in their tolerance of growing conditions, and are capable of adaptation to changes in climate on their own to some extent. The selective breeding of varieties capable of withstanding particular climates forms an important part of agriculture and horticulture. Part of the work of nursery growers of plants consists of cold hardening, or hardening off their plants, to prepare them for likely conditions in later life. Winter hardiness Winter-hardy plants grow during the winter, or at least remain healthy and dormant. Apart from hardy evergreens, these include many cultivated plants, including varieties of cabbage and broccoli, and all kinds of carrot. Some bulbs ‚Äì such as tulips ‚Äì need cold winters to bloom, while others ‚Äì such as freesia ‚Äì can survive a freezing winter. Many domestic plants are assigned a hardiness zone that specifies the climates in which they can survive. Winter gardens are dependent upon the cultivation of winter-hardy plants. Mechanisms Woody plants survive freezing temperatures by suppressing the formation of ice in living cells or by allowing water to freeze in plant parts that are not affected by ice formation. The common mechanism for woody plants to survive down to ‚Äì40 ¬∞C (‚Äì40 ¬∞F) is supercooling. Woody plants that survive lower temperatures are dehydrating their cells, allowing water to freeze between cell walls and the cells to survive. Plants normally considered hardy may not survive freezing if they are not readily acclimated, which renders them unable to use these mechanisms. Hardiness ratings Heather, Calluna vulgaris, one of Britain's hardiest plants (North York Moors) Various hardiness ratings are published. In the USA, the most widely used is the USDA system of hardiness zones based on average minimum yearly temperatures. This system was developed specifically for the extremely diverse range of conditions in the United States (US), from baking desert to frozen tundra. Another commonly used system is the Sunset Climate Zone system. This system is much more specific to climates (i.e. precipitation, temperature, and humidity based) and less dependent on the yearly minimum. In contrast the United Kingdom (UK) and Western Europe have an oceanic climate, and experience a narrower range of temperatures that is tempered by the presence of the Gulf Stream. This results in areas like western Scotland experiencing relatively mild winter conditions that enable the growing of subtropical plants, despite being well to the north of subtropical climate areas. The Royal Horticultural Society has published a set of hardiness ratings applicable to the UK. The ratings range from H1a to H7. H1a, higher than , applies to tropical plants permanently under glass in heat; while H7, below , applies to very cold-tolerant plants such as heathers. Most outdoor plants in the UK fall within the range H4, (hardy in the average winter) to H5, (hardy in a cold winter). Also, the average minimum temperature in the UK is much warmer than the average minimums in most of the US (see Hardiness Zone ). This means that the coldest areas in the UK would be considered USDA Zone 7, plants considered 'Fully Hardy' in the UK may not be hardy below Zone 7 in the US. In addition to cold tolerance, plant hardiness has been observed to be linked to how much stress specific plants are undergoing into the winter, or even how fast the onset of cold weather is in a specific year. This means that often stressed plants will exhibit less cold tolerance than plants that have been well maintained. Plants may also die if the winter changes from balmy to exceptionally cold in a short period of time.

The Canadian territory began granting marriage licences to same-sex couples upon the granting of royal assent to the federal Civil Marriage Act. Legal proceedings In December 2004, Justice Minister Charles Dent stated that the Northwest Territories Government would not issue marriage licences to same-sex couples until a court ruling or federal legislation legalized them. However, he indicated that the territory would not contest any lawsuit on the subject, and would comply with such a ruling or law. On May 20, 2005, a Yellowknife couple, Jason Perrino and Colin Snow, sued the Northwest Territories Government over the right to get married, saying that refusing them a licence is a violation of their Charter rights. The territorial Supreme Court was supposed to hear the case on Friday, May 27, 2005; however, it was adjourned for some three weeks at the request of a couple who wanted intervenor status in the case to oppose same-sex marriage. Pro-\\"family\\" activists Ruby and Laurin Trudel of Yellowknife applied to intervene in the lawsuit. They had been members of Yellowknife's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada until it started to share communion and the pulpit with the United Church, a denomination which had begun blessing same-sex unions. The couple was granted intervenor status, and on June 17, 2005, CBC North reported that the intervenors had requested party status in the case. If it had been granted by the territorial Supreme Court, it would have given them more direct involvement in the case, and the right to appeal in the event the judge sided with the plaintiffs' request to allow same-sex marriage in the territory. The case was again put off again for nearly another three weeks, and was set to resume on July 6. On June 30, the financial support for the Trudels evaporated. Their lawyer withdrew his services. The Trudels decided to proceed alone, without legal representation.Same-sex marriage case delayed On July 6, Ruby Trudel, alone, testified before the Supreme Court. She apologized to the court for her lack of knowledge of court procedures, and said that she was not homophobic: \\"While we do not support, encourage or endorse their lifestyle, we hold nothing against them personally.\\" She said that those who promote the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage have been \\"rendered voiceless at the federal level.\\" Actually, the debates in the Canadian Senate were in full swing at that time. She expressed concern over the possibility of persecution of Christian clergy if same-sex marriage were to become legalized. She said: \\"If the application before this court were to succeed, there is every reason to believe that repercussions against people of conscience and religion....will soon begin to occur here also.\\" They asked that the court not impose costs on them: \\"Costs incurred to this point already exceed our ability to pay.\\"SAME-SEX MARRIAGES (SSM) IN CANADA: Northwest Territories A ruling never came from the territorial Supreme Court, after royal assent of the Civil Marriage Act, which automatically struck down the territory's marriage law so it could include same-sex couples. The couple who challenged the Northwest Territory law were awarded $5,000 in legal fees to cover court costs, a judge ruled. On October 17, 2005, Supreme Court Justice Virginia Schuler ordered the Federal Government, and therefore Canadian taxpayers, to reimburse the plaintiffs for costs they incurred during their legal challenge. Territorial legislation In June 2002, the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories approved amendments to the Adoption Act allowing same-sex couples to adopt children jointly, and the Family Law Act changing the definition of spouse to grant same-sex couples limited legal rights. Further legislation was passed in March 2005. On March 7, 2017, the Legislative Assembly approved the Marriage Act (). The Act defines marriage as \\"a voluntary union of two persons to the exclusion of all others\\", and uses gender-neutral language when referring to spouses. It received royal assent on March 10, and went into effect on June 1, 2017. Furthermore, the Human Rights Act, enacted in 2002, prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples; the Act outlawing discrimination based on marital status and sexual orientation.

Ronald K. Burek. \\"The NEAR Solid-State Data Recorders\\". Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest. 1998\\\\. Due to the high integration density of modern computer memory chips, the individual memory cell structures became small enough to be vulnerable to cosmic rays and/or alpha particle emission. The errors caused by these phenomena are called soft errors. Over 8% of DIMM modules experience at least one correctable error per year.DRAM Errors in the Wild: A Large-Scale Field Study This can be a problem for DRAM and SRAM based memories. The probability of a soft error at any individual memory bit is very small. However, together with the large amount of memory modern computersespecially serversare equipped with, and together with extended periods of uptime, the probability of soft errors in the total memory installed is significant. The information in an ECC memory is stored redundantly enough to correct single bit error per memory word. Hence, an ECC memory can support the scrubbing of the memory content. Namely, if the memory controller scans systematically through the memory, the single bit errors can be detected, the erroneous bit can be determined using the ECC checksum, and the corrected data can be written back to the memory.  Overview  It is important to check each memory location periodically, frequently enough, before multiple bit errors within the same word are too likely to occur, because the one bit errors can be corrected, but the multiple bit errors are not correctable, in the case of usual (as of 2008) ECC memory modules. In order to not disturb regular memory requests from the CPU and thus prevent decreasing performance, scrubbing is usually only done during idle periods. As the scrubbing consists of normal read and write operations, it may increase power consumption for the memory compared to non-scrubbing operation. Therefore, scrubbing is not performed continuously but periodically. For many servers, the scrub period can be configured in the BIOS setup program. The normal memory reads issued by the CPU or DMA devices are checked for ECC errors, but due to data locality reasons they can be confined to a small range of addresses and keeping other memory locations untouched for a very long time. These locations can become vulnerable to more than one soft error, while scrubbing ensures the checking of the whole memory within a guaranteed time. On some systems, not only the main memory (DRAM-based) is capable of scrubbing but also the CPU caches (SRAM-based). On most systems the scrubbing rates for both can be set independently. Because cache is much smaller than the main memory, the scrubbing for caches does not need to happen as frequently. Memory scrubbing increases reliability, therefore it can be classified as a RAS feature. = Variants = There are usually two variants, known as patrol scrubbing and demand scrubbing. While they both essentially perform memory scrubbing and associated error correction (if it is doable), the main difference is how these two variants are initiated and executed. Patrol scrubbing runs in an automated manner when the system is idle, while demand scrubbing performs the error correction when the data is actually requested from main memory.

Plot summary Loosely related to the author's highly regarded novel The Stand, the story occurs on an August night on Anson Beach, New Hampshire, with a group of former college students who survived a catastrophic plague caused by a virus called A6, or \\"Captain Trips\\". They believe the virus spread out of Southeast Asia and wiped out most of humanity. The characters have a grim and dark outlook, having recently taken a man dying of the plague (and seemingly out of his mind with delirium) and burned him on a pyre as a half-serious black-magic human sacrifice. The main character of the story, Bernie, reflects upon this new world and reminisces about \\"the time before\\" when he went to Anson Beach in his youth years before the plague. All the members of Bernie's group characters had all survived a virus called A2, which supposedly made them immune to A6. But one character, Needles, reveals to Bernie that he has contracted A6. Bernie admits to himself that deep down they know that A2 is not a guarantee against A6, and that they will probably all be dead by Christmas. Bernie's girlfriend keeps up the pretense, accepting Bernie's explanation that Needles must have lied about having A2 so the others would not leave him behind. Unlike The Stand, the world in this story is lingering on somewhat longer, as shown by the fact that the characters are still able to get two radio stations (run by survivors), and that some people are still dying of the superflu months after the height of the outbreak. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations \\"Night Surf\\" was adapted into a short film in 2001 by writer-director Peter Sullivan. The film continues to play at numerous festivals and has been well received by King fans and general audiences alike.

Biography  Berger was born in Neuses (now part of Coburg), Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Germany. After attending Casimirianum, where he gained his abitur in 1892, Berger enrolled as a mathematics student at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena with a view to becoming an astronomer. After one semester, he abandoned his studies and enlisted for a year of service in the cavalry. During a training exercise, his horse suddenly reared and he landed in the path of a horse-drawn cannon. The driver of the artillery battery halted the horses in time, leaving the young Berger shaken but with no serious injuries.Dean Radin (2006), Entangled Minds, 21. His sister, at home many kilometres away, had a feeling he was in danger and insisted their father telegram him. The incident made such an impression on Berger that, years later in 1940, he wrote: \\"It was a case of spontaneous telepathy in which at a time of mortal danger, and as I contemplated certain death, I transmitted my thoughts, while my sister, who was particularly close to me, acted as the receiver.\\"Hans Berger (1940), Psyche, 6. On completion of his military service, and obsessed by the idea of how his mind could have carried a signal to his sister, Berger returned to Jena to study medicine with the goal of discovering the physiological basis of \\"psychic energy\\".Radin (2006), Entangled Minds, 21. His central theme became \\"the search for the correlation between objective activity in the brain and subjective psychic phenomena\\".Hans Berger bio After obtaining his medical degree from Jena in 1897, Berger joined the staff of Otto Ludwig Binswanger (1852‚Äì1929) who held the Chair in psychiatry and neurology at the Jena clinic. Habilitated in 1901, he qualified as a senior university lecturer in 1906 and physician-in-chief in 1912, eventually succeeding Binswanger in 1919.H. R. Wiedemann (1994), \\"Hans Berger\\" in European Journal of Pediatrics, Vol. 153, Number 10, 705. He also collaborated with two famous scientists and physicians, Oskar Vogt (1870‚Äì1959) and Korbinian Brodmann (1868‚Äì1918), in their research on lateralization of brain function. Berger married his technical assistant, Baroness Ursula von B√ºlow, in 1911 and later served as an army psychiatrist on the Western front during World War I. Hans Berger bio Answers.com He was elected Rector of Jena University in 1927. In 1924, Berger succeeded in recording the first human electroencephalogram (EEG). Filled with doubt, he took five years to publish his first paper in 1929 which demonstrated the technique for \\"recording the electrical activity of the human brain from the surface of the head\\". Millet (2002), \\"The Origins of EEG\\" (ISHN). His findings were met with incredulity and derision by the German medical and scientific establishments.\\"[...] the medical and scientific establishments met him with incredulity and overwhelming skepticism when they did not ignore him altogether.\\" Millet (2002), The Origins of EEG (ISHN). Having visited the EEG laboratory at Jena in 1935, American roboticist William Grey Walter noted that Berger: > was not regarded by his associates as in the front rank of German > psychiatrists, having rather the reputation of being a crank.

In 1938, at the retirement age of 65, Berger was made Professor Emeritus in Psychology. According to biographers Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva, the appointment occurred in an unceremonious manner as his relationship with the Nazi regime was particularly strained.\\"Dr. Hans Berger\\" Online document of the Dept of Neurology, Univ. of Illinois at Chicago. Niedermeyer, Ernst and Lopes da Silva, Fernando (2005). Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Numerous sources report that, given their hostile relationship, the Nazis forced Berger into retirement that same year with a complete ban of any further work on EEG. These biographical accounts were contradicted in 2005 by Ernst Klee, a German journalist specializing in the exposure and documentation of Nazi medical crimes.That Berger was a member of the SS has yet to be double-checked for this article. The German-language source provided is: Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945, 41 In 2005, Dr Susanne Zimmermann, medical historian at the University of Jena, found evidence that Berger had not been forced into retirement but had \\"served on the selection committee for his successor\\"Quoted in R. Douglas Fields (2009), The Other Brain: From Dementia to Schizophrenia, 150 Google Books Berthold Kihn, who was sacked as a Nazi after the war. Moreover, official records at the University of Jena dating from the 1930s proved that Berger had served on the Erbgesundheitsgericht (Court for Genetic Health) that imposed sterilizations while his diaries contained anti-Semitic comments.Fields (2009), The Other Brain: From Dementia to Schizophrenia, 150-151 Google Books Dr Zimmermann's findings corroborated research published in Germany in 2003 documenting Berger's invitation by the SS racial hygienist Karl Astel to work for the EGOG (Court for Genetic Health) in 1941.

Entangled Minds, 23. Berger committed suicide by hanging on June 1, 1941 in the southern wing of the clinic.  Research  Among his many research interests in neurology, Berger studied brain circulation, psychophysiology and brain temperature. However his main contribution to medicine and neurology was the systematic study of the electrical activity of the human brain and the development of electroencephalography (EEG), following the pioneering work done by Richard Caton (1842‚Äì1926) in England with animals. In 1924, Berger made the first EEG recording of human brain activity and called it Elektrenkephalogramm. An early EEG recording done by Berger Using the EEG he was also the first to describe the different waves or rhythms which were present in the normal and abnormal brain, such as the alpha wave rhythm (7.812‚Äì13.28 Hz), also known as \\"Berger's wave\\"; and its suppression (substitution by the faster beta waves) when the subject opens the eyes (the so-called alpha blockade). He also studied and described for the first time the nature of EEG alterations in brain diseases such as epilepsy. His method involved inserting silver wires under the patients scalp, one at the front of the head and one at the back. Later he used silver foil electrodes attached to the head by a rubber bandage. As a recording device he first used the Lippmann's capillary electrometer, but results were disappointing. He then switched to the string galvanometer and later to a double-coil Siemens recording galvanometer, which allowed him to record electrical voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt. The resulting output, up to three seconds in duration, was then photographed by an assistant.

He contributed to the fields of mathematical economics and especially game theory. Shapley is generally considered one of the most important contributors to the development of game theory since the work of von Neumann and Morgenstern.Roth, A.E., Introduction to the Shapley Value, in \\"The Shapley Value: Essays in Honor of Lloys S. Shapley\\", Cambridge University Press, 1988. With Alvin E. Roth, Shapley won the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \\"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\\"  Life and career  Lloyd Shapley was born on June 2, 1923, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the sons of astronomers Harlow Shapley and Martha Betz Shapley, both from Missouri. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and was a student at Harvard when he was drafted in 1943. He served in the United States Army Air Corps in Chengdu, China and received the Bronze Star decoration for breaking the Soviet weather code. After the war, Shapley returned to Harvard and graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1948. After working for one year at the RAND Corporation, he went to Princeton University where he received a Ph.D. in 1953. His thesis and post-doctoral work introduced the Shapley value and the core solution in game theory. Shapley defined game theory as \\"a mathematical study of conflict and cooperation.\\" After graduating, he remained at Princeton for a short time before going back to the RAND corporation from 1954 to 1981. In 1950, while a graduate student, Shapley invented the board game So Long Sucker, along with Mel Hausner, John Forbes Nash, and Martin Shubik.Hausner, M., Nash, J. F., Shapley, L. S. & Shubik, M., (1964), \\"So Long Sucker, A Four-Person Game\\", Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Israeli economist Robert Aumann said Shapley was \\"the greatest game theorist of all time.\\"Hagerty, James, Lloyd Shapley: 1923-2016, Wall Street Journal, March 19‚Äì20, 2016, p. A7. Lloyd Shapley in Stockholm 2012 From 1981 until his death, Shapley was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), serving at the time of his death as a professor emeritus there, affiliated with the Mathematics and Economics departments. He died on March 12, 2016, in Tucson, Arizona, after suffering from a broken hip, at the age of 92. Shapley was an expert Kriegspiel player, and an avid baseball fan.  Contribution  Along with the Shapley value, stochastic games, the Bondareva‚ÄìShapley theorem (which implies that convex games have non-empty cores), the Shapley‚ÄìShubik power index (for weighted or block voting power), the Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem, the concept of a potential game (with Dov Monderer), the Aumann‚ÄìShapley pricing, the Harsanyi‚ÄìShapley solution, the Snow‚ÄìShapley theorem for matrix games, and the Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma & theorem bear his name. According to The Economist, Shapley \\"may have thought of himself as a mathematician, but he cannot avoid being remembered for his huge contributions to economics\\". The American Economic Association noted that Shapley was \\"one of the giants of game theory and economic theory\\". Besides, his early work with R. N. Snow and Samuel Karlin on matrix games was so complete that little has been added since. He has been instrumental in the development of utility theory, and it was he who laid much of the groundwork for the solution of the problem of the existence of Von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern stable sets. His work with M. Maschler and B. Peleg on the kernel and the nucleolus, and his work with Robert Aumann on non-atomic games and on long-term competition have all appeared in economic theory. Shapley argued with his sons about whether he should accept the Nobel Prize at all. He opined that his father, the astronomer Harlow Shapley, deserved it more. His sons persuaded him to accept it and accompanied him to Stockholm.Hagerty, James, Lloyd Shapley: 1923-2016, Wall Street Journal, March 19‚Äì20, 2016, p.A7  Awards and honors  * Bronze Star, U.S. Army Air Corps, 1944 * Procter Fellow, Princeton University, 1951‚Äì52 * Fellow, Econometric Society, 1967 * Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1974 * Member, National Academy of Sciences, 1978 * John von Neumann Theory Prize, 1981 * Honorary Ph.D., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1986 * Fellow, INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences), 2002 * Distinguished Fellow, American Economic Association, 2007 * Fellow, American Mathematical Society, 2012List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved July 18, 2013. * Sveriges Riksbank Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2012 * Golden Goose Award, 2013  Selected publications  * A Value for n-person Games [1953], In Contributions to the Theory of Games volume II, H.

The French Transformisme was a term used by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809 for his theory, and other 19th century proponents of pre-Darwinian evolutionary ideas included √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Robert Grant, and Robert Chambers, the anonymous author of the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Opposition in the scientific community to these early theories of evolution, led by influential scientists like the anatomists Georges Cuvier and Richard Owen and the geologist Charles Lyell, was intense. The debate over them was an important stage in the history of evolutionary thought and would influence the subsequent reaction to Darwin's theory. Terminology Transmutation was one of the names commonly used for evolutionary ideas in the 19th century before Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species (1859). Transmutation had previously been used as a term in alchemy to describe the transformation of base metals into gold. Other names for evolutionary ideas used in this period include the development hypothesis (one of the terms used by Darwin) and the theory of regular gradation, used by William Chilton in the periodical press such as The Oracle of Reason. Transformation is another word used quite as often as transmutation in this context. These early 19th century evolutionary ideas played an important role in the history of evolutionary thought. The proto-evolutionary thinkers of the 18th and early 19th century had to invent terms to label their ideas, but it was first Joseph Gottlieb K√∂lreuter who used the term \\"transmutation\\" to refer to species who have had biological changes through hybridization. The terminology did not settle down until some time after the publication of the Origin of Species. The word evolution was quite a late-comer: it can be seen in Herbert Spencer's Social Statics of 1851, and there is at least one earlier example, but it was not in general use until about 1865‚Äì70. Historical development Al-Dinawari (828‚Äì896), considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Book of Plants, discussed plant evolution from its birth to its death, describing the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Ibn Miskawayh's al-Fawz al-Asghar and the Brethren of Purity's Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa) developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on Charles Darwin and his inception of Darwinism, but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic. > [These books] state that God first created matter and invested it with > energy for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of vapour which > assumed the shape of water in due time. The next stage of development was > mineral life. Different kinds of stones developed in course of time. Their > highest form being mirjan (coral). It is a stone which has in it branches > like those of a tree. After mineral life evolves vegetation.

Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad. English translations of the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity were available from 1812, while Arabic manuscripts of the al-Fawz al-Asghar and The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa were also available at the University of Cambridge by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly Charles Darwin.[citation needed] In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity. The following statements from his 1377 work, the Muqaddimah, express evolutionary ideas: > We explained there that the whole of existence in (all) its simple and > composite worlds is arranged in a natural order of ascent and descent, so > that everything constitutes an uninterrupted continuum. The essences at the > end of each particular stage of the worlds are by nature prepared to be > transformed into the essence adjacent to them, either above or below them. > This is the case with the simple material elements; it is the case with > palms and vines, (which constitute) the last stage of plants, in their > relation to snails and shellfish, (which constitute) the (lowest) stage of > animals. It is also the case with monkeys, creatures combining in themselves > cleverness and perception, in their relation to man, the being who has the > ability to think and to reflect. The preparedness (for transformation) that > exists on either side, at each stage of the worlds, is meant when (we speak > about) their connection. Plants do not have the same fineness and power that > animals have. Therefore, the sages rarely turned to them. Animals are the > last and final stage of the three permutations. Minerals turn into plants, > and plants into animals, but animals cannot turn into anything finer than > themselves. Numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Khazini, discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the Renaissance and may have influenced Western philosophy and science. Diagram from the 1844 book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by Robert Chambers shows a model of development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M). Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a hypothesis on the transmutation of species in Philosophie Zoologique (1809). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century. A radical British school of comparative anatomy (the Edinburgh school) which included the surgeon Robert Knox and the anatomist Robert Grant was closely in touch with Lamarck's school of French Transformationism, which contained scientists such as √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Grant developed Lamarck's and Erasmus Darwin's ideas of transmutation and evolutionism, investigating homology to prove common descent. As a young student Charles Darwin joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor Robert Jameson whose journal published an anonymous paper in 1826 praising \\"Mr. Lamarck\\" for explaining how the higher animals had \\"evolved\\" from the \\"simplest worms\\" ‚Äì this was the first use of the word \\"evolved\\" in a modern sense. Jameson's course closed with lectures on the \\"Origin of the Species of Animals\\". The computing pioneer Charles Babbage published his unofficial Ninth Bridgewater Treatise in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ad hoc miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers anonymously published an influential and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed an ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations led to the unfolding of a preordained orthogenetic plan woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like Adam Sedgwick, and radical materialists like Thomas Henry Huxley, who disliked Chambers' implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. Darwin himself openly deplored the author's \\"poverty of intellect\\", and dismissed it as a \\"literary curiosity.\\" However, the high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, and its popular success, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later. It also influenced some younger naturalists, including Alfred Russel Wallace, to take an interest in the idea of transmutation. Opposition to transmutation Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades. In Britain, where the philosophy of natural theology remained influential, William Paley wrote the book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy, at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Although the geologist Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology (1830‚Äì1833) he criticized and dismissed Lamarck's theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its \\"centre of creation\\" and was designed for this particular habitat, but would go extinct when this habitat changed. This 1847 diagram by Richard Owen shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates. Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with idealism, such as Goethe, Hegel and Lorenz Oken. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of \\"archetypes\\" in the divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and Gideon Mantell, Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding Vestiges, would be factors in his decision to ensure that his theory was fully supported by facts and arguments before publishing his ideas.

Mosquito orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single, heart-shaped, usually ground-hugging leaf and one to many small, green, pinkish or purplish flowers on a fleshy stalk. They are found in New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. Description Orchids in the genus Acianthus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a single egg-shaped, heart-shaped or lobed leaf at the base. They have small, roughly spherical, underground tubers from which the flower stems arise. Lacking true roots, they have root-like stolons which develop \\"daughter\\" tubers at their ends. These orchids spend the dry, summer months dormant until, following late-summer or autumn rains, the leaf appears. The leaf is glabrous, sometimes ground-hugging, more usually held above the ground and is often purplish-red on the lower surface. Sometimes the leaves of plants with flowers are different from those lacking them. The leaves of all Australian species are very similar, making them hard to identify to species level in the absence of flowers. Flowers appear in the cooler months, usually in autumn, winter or spring, There are one to many resupinate small, green, pinkish or purplish flowers in diameter. The flowers are held on an upright, narrow but fleshy stalk, blend in with their surrounding and often resemble mosquitoes. The sepals are longer than the petals and usually have a long, thin extension on their end. The dorsal sepal is broader than the lateral ones and sometimes forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals project forward beneath the labellum and the petals spread widely or curve backwards against the ovary. The labellum is heart-shaped and has a prominent callus. The fruit is a thin- walled, glabrous capsule, containing a large number of winged seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. He described three species (A. fornicatus, A. exsertus and A. caudatus) but did not nominate a type species. Orchids in this genus are closely related to those in the genus Caladenia. Some Australian species, formerly included in Acianthus, have been transferred to other genera, such as Acianthella. The genus name (Acianthus) is derived from the Greek ake or akis, \\"a point, needle\\" and anthos \\"flower\\" referring to the pointed perianth and the acuminate floral segments. Distribution and habitat Of the 25 extant species, 15 are endemic to New Caledonia (including L'√éle-des-Pins), 9 to Australia and one to New Zealand. (One species, A. ledwardii, described from Burleigh Heads in 1938, has not been seen since 1939.) Of the Australian species, 7 are found in New South Wales, 6 in Queensland, 3 in Victoria and 2 in South Australia. The sole New Zealand example, A. sinclairii occurs on both North and South Islands, as well as on Raoul, Stewart, Chatham and Three Kings Islands. Mosquito orchids species grow in small groups in forests on decaying litter, occasionally on partially decayed logs. They sometimes form dense vegetative colonies, in sheltered forest or heathland, and are often found underneath shrubs and bracken. Ecology The labellum of Acianthus species produces a sweet nectar which is contained in a sunken area at the base of the labellum. The flowers of Australian species open in sequence up the flowering spike, each flower open for a few days, and are pollinated by fungus gnats from the families Anisopodidae, Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae. Usually only a small percentage of the plants in a colony have flowers. Flies on Acianthus caudatus have been observed to move up the labellum, probing with their proboscis until they reach the nectar, where the up and down \\"pumping\\" action of their bodies brings them into contact with the viscidium and pollinia which then adhere to the insect's body. When these are carried to another flower, a similar action causes the pollinia to attach to the receptive stigma. Use in horticulture Mosquito orchids are easy to grow in plastic or ceramic pots. They need to be watered regularly except when dormant over summer and to be repotted every one or two years.

It is located in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois. Constructed of granite, the tomb has a single-story rectangular base, surmounted by an obelisk, with a semicircular receiving room entrance- way, on one end, and semicircular crypt or burial-room opposite. Four flights of balustraded stairs‚Äîtwo flanking the entrance at the front and two at the rear‚Äîlead to a level terrace. The balustrade extends around the terrace to form a parapet where near the center are several statues located at the base of the obelisk. The obelisk rises 117 feet (36m) high. A bronze recasting of sculptor Gutzon Borglum's head of Lincoln in the U.S. Capitol rests on a pedestal in front of the entrance way. Inside the ground level entrance is a rotunda with connecting hallways to the burial room. Marble is used throughout the interior and several well-known, specially cast statues of Lincoln are displayed. A stained glass window and flags adorn the crypt, which is centered around a red marble cenotaph. At the close of the ceremonies and events marking Lincoln's death, his body was placed in a nearby receiving tomb and later in the state tomb. The mausoleum is owned and administered by the State of Illinois as Lincoln Tomb State Historic Site. It was designated one of the first National Historic Landmarks in 1960, and thus became one of the first sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, when that designation was created. History On April 15, 1865, the day President Lincoln died, a group of Springfield citizens formed the National Lincoln Monument Association and spearheaded a drive for funds to construct a memorial or tomb.National Park Service: Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings Upon arrival of the funeral train on May 3, Lincoln lay in state in the Illinois State Capitol for one night. After funeral and burial services the next day, his coffin was placed in a receiving vault at Oak Ridge Cemetery, the site Mrs. Lincoln requested for burial. In December, her husband's remains were removed to a temporary vault not far from the proposed memorial site. The location of the temporary vault is today marked with a small granite marker on the hill behind the current tomb. In 1871, three years after laborers had begun constructing the tomb, the body of Lincoln and those of the three youngest of his sons were placed in crypts in the unfinished structure. In 1874, upon completion of the memorial, which had been designed by Larkin Goldsmith Mead, Lincoln's remains were interred in a marble sarcophagus in the center of a chamber known as the \\"catacombs,\\" or burial room. In 1876, however, after two Chicago criminals failed in an attempt to steal Lincoln's body and hold it for ransom, the National Lincoln Monument Association hid it in another part of the memorial, first under wood and other debris and then buried in the ground within the tomb. When Mrs. Lincoln died in 1882, her remains were placed with those of Lincoln, but in 1887 both bodies were reburied in a brick vault beneath the floor of the burial room. By 1895, the year the State acquired the memorial, it had fallen into disrepair. During a rebuilding and restoration program from 1899‚Äì1901, all five caskets were moved to a nearby subterranean vault. Following completion of the restoration, State officials returned them to the burial room and placed that of Lincoln in the sarcophagus it had occupied in 1874‚Äì1876. Within a few months, however, at the request of Robert Todd Lincoln, the President's only surviving son, Lincoln's remains were moved to their final resting place - a concrete vault below the surface of the burial room. In 1930‚Äì31 the State reconstructed the interior of the memorial in an Art Deco style. Rededicated in the later year by President Herbert Hoover, it has undergone little change since that time. The Lincoln Tomb was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Design and layout The bronze prototype casting by Daniel Chester French of his 1920 sculpture in the Lincoln Memorial in the rotunda of Lincoln's Tomb. Several famous Lincoln sculptures line the crypt, including one of Abraham Lincoln: The Man The tomb is in the center of a 12¬Ω acre (51,000 m¬≤) plot. Constructed of granite from Biddeford, Maine, dressed at Quincy, Massachusetts, it has a rectangular base surmounted by a -high obelisk and a semicircular entrance way. A bronze reproduction by sculptor Gutzon Borglum's of his head of Lincoln in the U.S. Capitol rests on a pedestal in front of the entrance way. Four flights of balustraded stairs‚Äîtwo flanking the entrance at the front and two at the rear‚Äîlead to a level terrace. The balustrade extends around the terrace to form a parapet. Originally open to the public, the terrace has since been closed due to safety concerns. Infantry and Cavalry statues at the corners of the obelisk. In the center of the terrace, a large and ornate base supports the obelisk. On the walls of the base are 37 hewn stones, cut to represent raised shields, each engraved with the name of a State at the time the tomb was built. Each shield is connected to another by two raised bands, and thus the group forms an unbroken chain encircling the base. Four bronze statues adorn the corners of the latter. They represent the infantry, navy, artillery, and cavalry of the Civil War period. In front of the obelisk and above the entrance stands a full-length statue of Lincoln. The tomb's design architect and sculptor, Larkin G. Mead, designed and executed these carvings and statues. The interior of the memorial, constructed of marble from Minnesota, Missouri, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Utah, Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium, contains a rotunda, a burial room, and connecting corridors. A down-scaled bronze prototype by Daniel Chester French of his 1920 statue in the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., dominates the entrance foyer. The walls of the rotunda are decorated with 16 marble pilasters, which are separated by marble panels. The pilasters symbolize Lincoln and the 15 Presidents who preceded him. The room also contains 36 bronze panels, one for each state at the time of Lincoln's death. The ceiling is of palladium leaf. The Art Deco Burial Room Corridors lead from the rotunda to the burial room at the rear of the memorial. Located in niches along the corridor walls are eight statues by prominent sculptors depicting various phases of Lincoln's life. Four bronze tablets on the walls are engraved with the Farewell Address, the Gettysburg Address, a portion of the Second Inaugural Address, and a biographical sketch. Large gold stars in sets of 12 at each corner of the memorial represent the 48 states in the Union at the time of its 1930 redecoration. Mary Todd Lincoln's crypt in the Burial Room is next to those of her sons rubbing Lincoln's nose for good luck. The burial room features black and white marble walls and a ceiling of gold leaf. At its center stands the cenotaph, a 7-ton block of reddish marble inscribed with Lincoln's name and the years he lived. It marks the approximate location of the burial vault, which is 30 inches behind and 10 feet below. Nine flags are arranged in a semicircle around the cenotaph. Seven of them‚Äîthe State flags of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois‚Äîcommemorate the homes of Lincoln and his ancestors. The eighth and ninth are the U.S. Flag and the Presidential flag. The inscription \\"Now he belongs to the ages,\\" reputedly spoken by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton at the time of Lincoln's death, is inscribed in the wall above a stained glass window. Along the south wall of the burial room are four crypts containing the remains of Mrs. Lincoln and three of Lincoln's four sons, Edward, Willie, and Tad (the eldest, Robert Todd Lincoln, is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, alongside his wife and son). The tomb was built with additional crypts for members of Lincoln's family in addition to the four spaces already used. However, as the remaining members of Lincoln's family chose to be buried elsewhere, the other crypts remain empty. Adjacent memorials Also part of the site overseen by the State of Illinois, and a short distance from the tomb, three war memorials have been erected: 1\\\\. The World War II Illinois Veterans Memorial was dedicated in December 2004. This memorial honors the 987,000 Illinois men and women who served in World War II and the 22,000 who gave their lives. Its focal point is a white 22-ton concrete globe flanked on two sides by black granite walls. Stainless steel buttons on the globe identify major battles, and quotations from military leaders, and Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman are engraved on the wall. 2\\\\. The Korean War Memorial honors 1,748 Illinoisans killed during the 1950-53 Korean War. This memorial was dedicated on June 16, 1996. The memorial consists of a twelve-foot-tall bronze bell, with a diameter of twelve feet, mounted on a granite base. At the circumference of the bell are four niches, each with a larger-than-life figure representing a branch of the armed services. Inscribed on the base are the names of Illinoisans killed in Korea. A carillion system in the Memorial plays brief musical programs at regular intervals. 3\\\\. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial honors the almost 3,000 Illinoisans killed during the Vietnam War, and was dedicated in 1988. The memorial has a circular layout allowing visitors to enter the interior courtyard from any direction. The names of those killed or missing in action are on five granite slabs, each slab representing one of the branches of the United States Military.

The battle was not decisive, but it did result in the Austrians obtaining their goal by capturing the Polish capital Warsaw. Battle The battlefield's terrain is dominated by several villages and by the river Utrata, which during the April thaw is usually unfordable. The only way to cross the river is at the ponds of Raszyn, Dawidy or Michalowice, which were all under Polish control. After a preparatory cannonade starting at 14.00, the Austrian infantry attacked the Polish screening forces around 15.00. The Poles gradually yielded terrain. Austrian attempts to outflank the Polish position near Jaworowo were unsuccessful. After the village of Falenty was captured at 16.00 Poniatowski launched a counterattack which evicted the Austrians from the town and re-established the Polish line. Around 17.00 a combined attack was launched against Raszyn. Repulsed by the Saxon units, the Austrians called up reinforcements and took the town around 19.00 but were unable to progress beyond the last houses of the village. The Poles again counterattacked at 21.00 and drove the Austrians from Raszyn but were unable to recapture the causeway. Fighting progressed until 22.00 when the Poles evacuated the battlefield. Aftermath After the Austrian army withdrew to the other side of the swamps, prince J√≥zef Poniatowski ordered his forces to withdraw towards Warsaw. However, since the city fortifications were in a very bad shape and the Saxon expeditionary force withdrew towards their homeland, Poniatowski decided to leave Warsaw undefended and withdraw to several fortresses located nearby (most notably to Modlin Fortress and Serock). The capital was seized with little opposition, but it was a Pyrrhic victory since the Austrian commander diverted most of his forces there at the expense of other fronts. In the following weeks Greater Poland was defended by the Corps of General Henryk DƒÖbrowski and the Polish cavalry seized Lw√≥w. Finally, Poniatowski left only a small force near Warsaw to prevent the Austrians from leaving it and moved the rest of his forces southwards, which led to capturing the city of Krak√≥w. On 14 October 1809 the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn was signed between Austria and France. According to it, Austria lost approximately 50,000 square kilometres of land inhabited by over 1,900,000 people. The territories annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw included the lands of Zamo≈õƒá and Krak√≥w as well as 50% of income of the Wieliczka salt mines. Afterwards, Poniatowski was presented with the grand-aigle de la L√©gion d'honneur, a saber of honor, and a lancer's shako. The Battle of Raszyn is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"RASZYN 19 IV 1809\\".

The company established Victor Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, when early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based there at the beginning of the 20th century. At a time when actors received no screen credits, Carl Laemmle of the Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP) had begun promoting Lawrence's name and image, making her into America's \\"First Movie Star.\\" Harry Solter had already been directing Lawrence at IMP and with their own studio, he made a large number of film shorts starring his wife, many of which co-starred Owen Moore and King Baggot. In addition the studio teamed Moore with Fritzi Brunette in several of its productions. However, with the amalgamation of several studios to create the colossal Universal Film Manufacturing Company, Lawrence and Solter had little choice but to sell out in 1913. With Solter no longer involved, Universal brought in young directors such as Allan Dwan and James Kirkwood, Sr. The Victor entity remained in use until 1917 when it was absorbed completely into Universal.

He is best known for his tenures in the English progressive rock band Yes as guitarist and keyboardist from 1997 to 2000 and as full-time bassist since June 2015, following the death of original bassist Chris Squire. He is known for working with former and current Yes members in other capacities as well. In addition to his involvement with Yes, he is the frontman of progressive rock groups World Trade, Circa and formerly Lodgic. In 2017, he joined Asia alongside Yes bandmate Geoff Downes after the death of original singer and bassist John Wetton. He is also a solo artist, having released ten studio albums to date. Early life Sherwood was born on March 14, 1965 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was born into a musical family; his father Bobby Sherwood was an actor, musician, and big band leader and his mother Phyllis is a former singer and drummer. His brother Michael was a singer and keyboardist. Sherwood's godfather was late comedian Milton Berle. Career =Lodgic and World Trade= Sherwood's music career started when he joined a band called Lodgic formed by Michael. Billy played bass and sang, while Michael played keyboards and sang back up. Lodgic also included Guy Allison on keyboards, Jimmy Haun on guitar and Gary Starns on drums. They eventually moved the band to Los Angeles in 1980. After many years of trying to get things together, they recorded their debut album Nomadic Sands, released in 1985. After Lodgic broke up, Sherwood put together a new band with Guy Allison. They recruited guitarist Bruce Gowdy and drummer Mark T. Williams to form World Trade. They recorded their self-titled debut in 1989, with Sherwood taking on the roles of engineer, mixer, and producer again, along with his band duties as bassist and lead singer. Sherwood got back together with his bandmates from World Trade and released Euphoria in 1995, with Jay Schellen replacing Williams on drums. In 2017, Sherwood reunited with World Trade to record a third album titled Unify, which was released on August 4, 2017. =Yes= By 1989, Sherwood was invited to meet Yes bassist Chris Squire after singer and record executive Derek Shulman suggested his name. By this time, Yes had suffered a setback when singer Jon Anderson had left and formed Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH). Sherwood was invited to jam with the remaining Yes members, Squire, guitarist Trevor Rabin, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Tony Kaye, with the intention of Sherwood on lead vocals. By the time the five had recorded some demos, they merged with members of ABWH in 1990 to become an eight-man formation of Yes, which lasted until 1992. The two groups recorded songs for Union (1991), which features the first song that Sherwood and Squire wrote together, \\"The More We Live - Let Go\\". Sherwood struck up a friendship with Squire that would lead him to work with him throughout the next 20 years. In 1994, Sherwood toured with Yes as additional guitarist and keyboardist on their tour supporting Talk (1994) tour. Sherwood would co-produce, engineer and mix the new studio tracks for their following studio albums, Keys to Ascension (1996) and Keys to Ascension 2 (1997). Following Rick Wakeman's departure in 1997 Sherwood and Squire continued to write songs, which Yes decided to record for their next studio album, Open Your Eyes (1997). This made Sherwood become a full-time member of the group, playing rhythm guitar and keyboards. The addition of Igor Khoroshev in 1997 left Sherwood to handle backing guitar and vocals for live shows. In 2000, after recording and touring their next album, The Ladder (1999), Sherwood left the group. A live album and DVD of the show at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, Sherwood's hometown, was released as House of Yes: Live from House of Blues. On May 19, 2015, it was officially announced that Squire would be undergoing treatment for acute erythroid leukemia, and that Yes would continue their 2015 North American tour with Sherwood filling Squire's role. After Squire's passing on June 27, 2015, Sherwood (along with other former and current members of Yes) made a public statement expressing his grief. In regards to his new role as the now-permanent bassist for Yes: \\"Chris said to me, 'play the music, be yourself and make me proud'. It's my true desire now [to] live up to his wishes.\\" =Conspiracy= After his departure from Yes, Sherwood worked with Squire to release the album Conspiracy, which includes some work they composed together some years before. Following that, Sherwood composed his first solo album called The Big Peace in which he played most of the instruments and also produced. The album was a sort of back to basics of his progressive roots. In 2003, Sherwood released The Unknown, another album with Chris Squire as Conspiracy. More recently, Sherwood has been working on further tribute albums, notably Back Against the Wall and Return to the Dark Side of the Moon, tributes to Pink Floyd's The Wall and The Dark Side of the Moon respectively. The latter includes a new track recorded with Tony Kaye. =Circa and Yoso= In 2007, a new band with Sherwood, Alan White, Tony Kaye and Jimmy Haun was announced, called Circa. With the release of their debut album Circa 2007 and a live DVD concert, Circa has played various live dates. White left the band and was replaced by Jay Schellen. On January 14, 2009, Circa self-released on the Internet its second studio album, Circa HQ. This time, White was not available due to his commitments with Yes (who had begun a new tour). Sherwood's long time friend, collaborator and drummer, Jay Schellen, replaced White on the album. After a short international tour, Sherwood and co. started another project with former Toto singer, Bobby Kimball. Kimball, Sherwood, Tony Kaye and Jimmy Haun formed new band, Yoso, with a debut studio album in April 2009. Haun later abandoned the line-up (in order to focus on his work for adverts). He was replaced by Yes tribute band guitarist, Johnny Bruhns. Schellen chose to focus on his work in Asia Featuring John Payne and, after a number of other drummers, the band toured with Scott Connor on drums. Yoso then disbanded. In 2011, Circa returned with a new line-up of Sherwood, Kaye, Bruhns and Connor, while Sherwood released his fifth solo album, What was the Question?. In 2012, Sherwood wrote, produced, arranged and performed on The Prog Collective, an album featuring vocal or instrumental contributions from many of the progressive rock artists he had worked with over the years. He reprised the concept with a similar collection of artists for Epilogue, released in 2013. On October 8, 2013, they released the official video to William Shatner's record Ponder The Mystery, followed by a sold-out tour with Circa. Ponder The Mystery also features appearances of Steve Vai, Robby Krieger, Al Di Meola, George Duke, Vince Gill, Dave Koz, Rick Wakeman and Edgar Winter. On July 8, 2016, Sherwood re-grouped with Circa to release their fourth album titled Valley Of The Windmill. =Other projects= During the hiatus of Yes, Squire put together the Chris Squire Experiment, having Sherwood as the lead singer while playing some guitar and keyboards. Sherwood then went on to record a project called The Key with guitarist Marty Walsh, though they would not release the album until 1997. Behind the board, Sherwood worked with Mot√∂rhead, Dangerous Toys, and Paul Rodgers (formerly of Bad Company) as producer and engineer. Sherwood also guested on Toto's Kingdom of Desire album, singing and playing bass. He also produced a couple of tribute albums, including Jeffology, a tribute to Jeff Beck. Sherwood then joined Yes on tour as an additional musician, playing guitar and keyboards for their tour in support of Talk. Sherwood appeared along with William Shatner in the Season 14 premiere of Hell's Kitchen where they met blue team as part of their reward for winning the signature dish challenge. Sherwood is also credited for writing the theme song for the online anime series, Kung Fu Jimmy Chow. Sherwood worked as producer, mixer and engineer, including on more tribute albums: Dragon Attack, a tribute to Queen; Salute to AC/DC; and Crossfire, a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan. On 11 January 2017, it was announced that Sherwood would be filling in on bass and lead vocals for John Wetton for tour dates in the spring of 2017 while Wetton underwent chemotherapy, having been chosen by Wetton himself. Wetton died on 31 January 2017 and the tour went forward with Sherwood. In 2019, Asia's line- up changed with Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal joining on guitar and lead vocals and Sherwood remaining on just bass and backing vocals. In May 2019, Billy and his partner Elisa Furr, along with Jay Schellen, Guy Allison and John Thomas (who has worked with Vixen) formed a new band together featuring Furr on vocals. In July 2020, fellow Yes member Jon Davison announced a new side project featuring himself, Sherwood and Schellen called Arc of Life. He also said they had completed an album that would be released late 2020 or early 2021.https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb- edfdt-e462f3?utm_campaign=a_share_ep&utm;_medium=dlink&utm;_source=a_share =Solo career= In August 2008, Billy Sherwood's released his third solo album, At the Speed of Life, for which he received an award that year as the best Progressive Rock Producer. On May 20, 2019, it was announced that Sherwood was working on his tenth solo album, titled Citizen: In The Next Life, which was released on July 12, 2019. Equipment Sherwood mainly plays Carvin guitars, 6- and 12-string; his main guitar, which he's played since his first stint in Yes, is a red Carvin, Telecaster-shaped, with a Roland V-guitar pickup. His acoustic guitars are made by Babicz. He uses Line 6 amplifiers with 4x12\\" cabinets. As a bassist, Sherwood plays Spector basses through Tech-21 amps with 2-4X12\\" cabinets. He has previously played Kubicki, Tobias, Fender and Turner basses and still plays many of these in studio sessions.

Biography Born Nicolas Luc-Olivier Merson in Paris, France, he grew up in an artistic household, the son of Charles-Olivier Merson, a painter and art critic. He studied under Gustave Chassevent at the √âcole de Dessin and then Isidore Pils at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Merson had his first work exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1866 and three years later was awarded the Prix de Rome. During the five years spent working in Italy, he concentrated on religious and historical subjects for his art. Back in France, in 1875 he won the first- prize medal at the exhibition by the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais. Notre-Dame de Paris, one of Merson's best-known paintings, was created in 1881 as a result of the huge popularity of the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. With its mystical Gothic imagery, its style reflects the influence of the then evolving Symbolist movement. Merson did major decorative commissions for such institutions as the Palais de Justice, the Louis Pasteur Museum, and the mosaic in the chancel vault in the Basilica of the Sacr√© C≈ìur. He also did the artwork for stained-glass windows, an example of which can be found in the Church of the Holy Trinity Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His profile was raised considerably after being awarded a gold medal for his painting at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, and in 1892 he was elected to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts. Merson was one of the first artists to buy photographs from Eug√®ne Atget. The \\"Type Merson\\" design of 1900 was still being used in 1927 for the French post offices in Egypt; Merson's name is barely visible in the lower left of the frame. By 1900 Merson was designing postage stamps for the French post and the Monaco post. He was teaching at the Acad√©mie Vitti in 1903. By 1908 he had been contracted by the Bank of France to create a number of designs for some of the country's banknotes. Between 1906 and 1911 he taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, with students such as Cl√©ment Serveau, who would also eventually design stamps and banknotes himself. In recognition of his contribution to French culture, Merson was awarded the Legion of Honor. Also during this period, it is reported that Merson had under his tutelage the French painter Henri Alphonse Barnoin. Merson died in Paris in 1920, his work largely forgotten as a result of the overwhelming popularity of the avant-garde art forms as seen in the works of the Impressionists and other artistic movements. Named as a Knight of the Legion of Honor during his life, he was elevated to the level of Commander posthumously. Among Merson's pupils were the American painter Claire Shuttleworth and the Swiss printmaker Martha Cunz.Studer, Daniel. Martha Cunz 1876-1961: Eine Schweizer Jugendstilk√ºnstlerin in M√ºnchen.

In 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to prison for fraud and forgery. The sentence was reduced from 7 to 5 years in prison, on appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear a subsequent appeal. Film and theatrical career =Film= Born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario, Drabinsky graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1973, and was called to the bar in Ontario in 1975. Entering into the entertainment business in 1978 as an independent commercial film producer (through Tiberius Entertainment Limited, formed with Joel Michaels) and film distributor (through Pan-Canadian Film Distributors Inc., formed with Nat Taylor), he was credited as the producer for: :* The Disappearance (1977) :* The Silent Partner (1978) :* The Changeling (1980) :* Tribute (1980) :* The Amateur (1981) :* Losin' It (1983) :* The Gospel of John (2003) :* Half Light (2004) :* Barrymore (2011) In April 1979, he and Nat Taylor co-founded Cineplex Theatres, which created a chain of multiplex theatres for the Canadian market. By May 1984, it had acquired the Canadian Odeon Theatre chain, thus becoming Cineplex Odeon and a major player in the industry. It expanded further through the acquisition of several US theatre chains, but he left the company in December 1989. =Theatre= He leveraged his ownership of the Pantages Theatre in Toronto to form the publicly traded theatre production company, Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc., also known as Livent. The company expanded, building or refurbishing several theatres, including the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, and entered into management deals with others in Toronto, Vancouver, and New York. It became noted for its productions (which earned a total of 19 Tony Awards out of a total of 61 nominations) of: :* Phantom of the Opera (1989 Canadian production) :* Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1992 Canadian production) :* Kiss of the Spider Woman (1992 Canadian production)* :* Show Boat (1993 Canadian production)** :* Ragtime, (1996 original production) :* Sunset Boulevard (1995 Canadian production) :* Fosse (1999 Broadway production)* * Tony Award for Best Musical, ** Tony Award for Best Musical Revival =After Livent= Beginning in 2002, Drabinsky dabbled for a few years with the Toronto-based film production and direct marketing company, Visual Bible International Inc. (OTCBB: VBII). Although he and Livent co- founder Myron Gottlieb were both purported to be creative consultants to the company, they were instrumental in building VBII's business model and trying to find an American executive to serve as President and CEO to serve as a mouthpiece to Wall Street. They were indeed running the company behind the scenes as fugitives from American prosecutors. One executive who was recruited by the executive search firm Korn Ferry and offered the position, Stuart Hotchkiss, a former Time Inc. executive, declined the job after learning about Drabinsky's and Gottlieb's legal woes and being told by then company Chairman and Toronto dentist, Dr. Steven Small, that he would not be able to fire either consultant should the need arise. VBII was put into receivership by an Ontario court in 2005. Drabinsky is still active in the Canadian entertainment industry, through Tiberius Entertainment (now known as Garth H. Drabinsky Productions). In 2011, it promoted the film Barrymore at the Toronto International Film Festival, based on the play with Christopher Plummer. Drabinsky is now partnering with former CBC executive Richard Stursberg to raise funds for two musicals. Drabinsky closed Sousztaka after receiving bad reviews. Livent insolvency and subsequent proceedings In November 1998, Livent sought bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada, claiming a debt of $334 million, and securities regulators in both Canada and the US began investigating Livent's books. =Canadian proceedings= On March 25, 2009, Drabinsky and Livent co-founder Myron Gottlieb were found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario Superior Court for misstating the company's financial statements between 1993 and 1998., discussing Drabinsky was sentenced to seven years in jail on August 5, 2009 for his role in the case., discussing Drabinsky filed an appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal with respect to his sentence on September 3, 2009. During that appeal, he remained free on bail. On September 13, 2011, the Court of Appeal, while upholding the convictions, reduced Drabinsky's sentence to 5 years. Drabinsky applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the application was dismissed without costs on March 29, 2012. Drabinsky was originally held at Millhaven Institution, for assessment. In December 2011, he was transferred to serve out his sentence at Beaver Creek Institution, a minimum security prison, located in Gravenhurst, Ontario, and was released on day parole in February 2013. Drabinsky was granted full parole on January 20, 2014. Administrative proceedings were initiated against Livent, Drabinsky and others by the Ontario Securities Commission in 2001, and they were suspended in 2002 until all outstanding criminal proceedings had been completed. In February 2013, the OSC announced that hearings would take place on March 19, 2013, in the matter. Myron Gottlieb and Gordon Eckstein, who were the other parties in the proceedings, subsequently entered into settlement agreements with the OSC in September 2014 and May 2015 respectively. In 2017, the Ontario Securities Commission permanently banned Drabinsky from becoming a director or officer of any public company in Ontario. The OSC also prohibited him from acting as an investment promoter, and banned him from trading securities (other than as a retail investor, for trades within his RRSP or through a registered dealer for accounts in his name only). =US proceedings= In January 1999, Livent reached an administrative settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, while civil and criminal proceedings were simultaneously pursued against Drabinsky, Gottlieb and certain other former Livent employees. In 2005, former investors in Livent corporate bonds won a $23.3 million settlement against Drabinsky and Gottlieb in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for which enforcement of the judgment was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2008.; leave to appeal dismissed, On June 25, 2019, legal authorities in New York dismissed all outstanding criminal charges against Drabinsky (almost 20 years after accusing him of fraud involving Livent Inc.) with prejudice. Assistant United States attorney, Sarah Eddy, said the dismissal is appropriate because Mr. Drabinsky had already been prosecuted in Canada for the fraud. While the outstanding charges had been dormant for many years, they impeded Mr. Drabinsky from being able to travel to the United States, for fear of extradition. Drabinsky is now free to travel to-and-from the United States, and has been doing so frequently while working on his new musical, Paradise Square (formerly titled, Hard Times). =Disbarment= On July 17, 2014 Drabinsky was disbarred by the Tribunal of the Law Society of Upper CanadaGray, Jeff and Janet McFarland, \\"Ontario's law Society disbars Garth Drabinsky\\", Globe and Mail (Toronto). for unbecoming conduct, having been found guilty of defrauding the public and forging certain financial statements. The Tribunal's order, effective immediately, revoked his licence to practice law in the province of Ontario.Law Society of Upper Canada v. Drabinsky, 2014 ONLSTH 139 (17 July 2014) =Order of Canada= On November 29, 2012, Governor General David Johnston signed an Ordinance of Termination revoking Drabinsky's membership in the Order of Canada, originally conferred in 1995 in the Officer grade. Drabinsky subsequently filed an application in the Federal Court of Canada to block his removal, which was dismissed on January 9, 2014. He subsequently appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard in December 2014, and rejected the following month,, affirming Drabinsky v. Advisory Council of the Order of Canada 2015 FC 21 (8 January 2014) when the court held that there was \\"no basis\\" for it to intervene in the matter.

He was the first full-time minister of Abyssinian Congregational Church in Portland, Maine, where he led a station on the Underground Railroad, and served for decades at Siloam Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York. Early life and education Amos No√´ Freeman was born in Rahway, New Jersey. He was orphaned and raised within the church from an early age. As a child, he was sent to attend the African Free School in Manhattan, then matriculated to Phoenix High School in New York City, established by his mentor Rev. Theodore Sedgewick Wright. Freeman returned to his native New Jersey to attend Rahway Academy, and later transferred to the Oneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York. It had recently been founded by radical Presbyterian minister, Rev. Beriah Green. Freeman was one of four African Americans in the first year class of 33; others were Amos Beman, who became a good friend; Alexander Crummell, and Henry Highland Garnet.Swift, David Everett, Black Prophets of Justice: Activist Clergy Before the Civil War, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989, p. 178. Upon graduating from Oneida Institute in the early 1830s, Freeman moved back to New Jersey, first to New Brunswick, then Newark, to teach in the \\"colored\\" public schools. Marriage and family In 1839 in Newark, Freeman married Christiana Taylor Williams (1812-1903), born in Red Hook on Hudson, New York. She was a recently manumitted domestic slave and black descendant of Philip H. Livingston (1769, Jamaica-1831, New York), grandson of Philip Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; and Barbara Williams, an enslaved woman of African descent born in Jamaica. Christiana Williams had worked in one or more of Livingston's households in New York state. The Freemans had a family, including a daughter, Mary Freeman. She married Rev. Robert Foster Wheeler. One of their daughters, Laura Wheeler Waring, became a portrait painter known for her work during the Harlem Renaissance. She was among the first African-American artists to have works exhibited by the Harmon Foundation, and was commissioned by them to do portraits of prominent African Americans.Art and Culture: Exploring Freedom/Laura Wheeler Waring, African American World, PBS-WNET. Ministry Freeman was ordained as a minister by the New York Presbytery in 1840. In 1841, he and his wife moved to Portland, Maine, where he was installed as the first pastor of the Abyssinian Congregational Church, now the third oldest surviving black church in the United States. It became a center of the anti-slavery movement and part of the Underground Railroad. Freeman became the most well-known African American in Maine because of his leadership there; he was a strong supporter of education and also ran a school affiliated with the church. For a decade, he and his wife provided support to fugitive slaves at the church and in their home.\\"Abyssinian Congregational Church\\", Portland Freedom Trail, 2007. In 1852, Rev. Freeman became the pastor of Siloam Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, founded in 1849. He served there from 1852 to 1860. He was a longtime friend of Amos Gerry Beman, a prominent black minister active in the Northeast.Swift (1989), Black Prophets of Justice, p. 300. In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester, New York. His was one of 5 names attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, The Claims of Our Common Cause, along with Frederick Douglass, James Monroe Whitfield, Henry O. Wagoner, and George Boyer Vashon.Douglass, Frederick. Frederick Douglass: Selected speeches and writings. Chicago Review Press, 2000. p260-271 In 1857 Freeman moderated the annual meeting of the Evangelical Association of Colored Ministers of Congregational and Presbyterian Churches, which met from 1856 to 1859 to confirm their distinctive vocation; that year they met at the Central Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. In 1859 Freeman hosted this meeting at the Siloam Church, by which time there were 27 black churches in the group.Swift (1989), Black Prophets of Justice, p. 310. While Rev. Freeman lived in Brooklyn in the mid-1850s, he secretly sheltered and aided Anna Maria Weems, a young fugitive slave, on her journey to freedom in Canada. Jacob Bigelow, a Washington, DC lawyer, disguised her as a boy. They met Dr. Ellwood Harvey of Philadelphia in front of the White House in November 1855, and Weems pretended to be a male buggy driver. She drove Harvey from Washington to Philadelphia, where Harvey took her to the house of another abolitionist, William Still, for Thanksgiving. The next day Dr. Harvey took Weems across the river to Camden, New Jersey, and on to New York City. In Brooklyn he took her to Rev. Charles Ray's house. Ray took her to the home of Lewis Tappan, where the only photo of Weems was taken in her \\"boy disguise\\". Rev. Freeman accompanied Weems from there by train to Canada, where she reached safety at her uncle and aunt's house in Ontario. It is likely that is where Freeman first met the radical American abolitionist, John Brown. Later Brown stopped at Freeman's church in Brooklyn in 1859, while en route to his raid at Harpers Ferry. Later years In 1860, Rev. Freeman was called as pastor of the Congregationalist Talcott Street Church in Hartford, Connecticut. Four years later, Rev. Freeman and family returned to Brooklyn, where he rejoined the congregation at Siloam Presbyterian Church. Freeman served there until his retirement in 1885. Christiana Williams Freeman worked at the Colored Orphans Home in New York City, where she helped protect the children during the New York Draft Riots of 1863. Rev. Freeman died at his home in Brooklyn. Both Freemans are buried at The Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn.

It was designed by Frederick William Cumberland and is a prime example of Gothic Revival architecture. Ontario Heritage Trust St. James' Church The church building is designated under the Ontario Heritage Act, and it is the episcopal seat of the Anglican Church of Canada's Archbishop of Toronto. Royal St. George's College, on Howland Avenue, is the church's choir school and is open to boys in grades 3 through 12. History King Street, with the church in the background. The building was the second church to be built there. The Anglican parish of St. James was established in 1797 in the then-town of York. In 1807, the first church was built of wood. It was used in 1813 during the War of 1812 as a hospital and subsequently robbed and damaged by the American troops. Shortly after, in 1818, the church was enlarged and a bell tower addition was completed. The bell was used as a fire bell for the town. In 1833, the wooden structure was taken down and replaced by a stone structure in the Neoclassical style. In January 1839, the church burned down and was reconstructed. Upon reopening in December 1839, the church became a cathedral. St. James Cemetery, the parish cemetery, was moved in the 1840s to St. James-the-Less at Parliament and Bloor, although there are still unmarked graves under the modern parking lot. In 1849, the cathedral was destroyed in the first Great Fire of Toronto. An international architectural competition was held to replace it, drawing eleven entries from Canada and the United States. Frederick William Cumberland and Thomas Ridout's Gothic Revival design placed first, followed by the submissions of John Ostell and Kivas Tully respectively. Construction began on July 1, 1850, and the Ohio stone and brick cathedral was opened to the public in 1853. The cathedral's original organ was built in 1853 by Samuel Russell Warren. Upon his death in 1867, John Strachan, Toronto's first Anglican bishop, was buried in a vault beneath the high altar. Dean Henry James Grasett (1808‚Äì1882) was also buried here. The current church building, c. 1890s It was not until 1873‚Äì1874 that the tower and spire, the transepts, and the pinnacles and finials were completed by architect Henry Langley. The spire was the tallest structure in Canada upon completion and would remain so for another 25 years until the construction of Toronto's Old City Hall. The tower's clock was installed one year later. In 1889, side galleries and aisles were removed, and the choir stalls and organ console were installed in the chancel. In 1936, St. George's Chapel was dedicated, and the organ was overhauled by Casavant Fr√®res. Major renovations were completed in 1982. The parish celebrated its bicentenary in 1997, when the peal of 12 change ringing bells was installed as the largest peal in North America.

Part of the land was to have been part of the original cemetery, and the developers planned to move the graves in order to clear the land. A public outcry ensued, and a deal was made to sell off a parking lot to the northwest of the cathedral for the SP!RE condominium development. =Notable funerals= Ted Rogers was held at the church In addition to the funerals of former Bishops of Toronto, there have been notable funerals at St. James for other prominent people from the Toronto area, including: * George Snell (1907‚Äì2006), former Bishop of Toronto from 1966 to 1972http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/snell-was-a-real- missionary-bishop-7051 ‚Äì funeral in 2006 * Ted Rogers (1939‚Äì2008), businessman and founder of Rogers Communications ‚Äì funeral on December 9, 2008 * Jim Flaherty (1949‚Äì2014), former Ontario MPP, federal MP and minister of finance ‚Äì state funeral on April 16, 2014 * Rob Ford (1969‚Äì2016), former Mayor of Toronto and city councillor (Ward 2) ‚Äì civic funeral on March 30, 2016 The Rev. George Okill Stuart, who served from 1800 to 1812, and the Rev. John Strachan are the only graves located within the cathedral. Architecture St. James Cathedral's Gothic Revival architecture is reflected throughout the structure. Every part of a Gothic cathedral is directly related to a \\"core dimension\\" which is used as an effort to achieve harmony and organic unity within the building where everything is linked rationally and proportionally, creating a coherent whole. Every element in the cathedral‚Äîincluding the stained glass windows, the pointed arches, high ceilings, the pinnacles, even the flying buttresses‚Äîallow as much light as possible to flood the interior. The Gothic style means an aesthetically unified whole, but the combination of different architectural elements such as the ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and pointed arches allows for generous illumination of the interior space with natural light. =Exterior= The exterior features several spires built of stone The cathedral's exterior is composed of white brick and Ohio sandstone. Several layers of brick in the facade create strong, square inset designs around the lancet windows of the clerestory. This allows for a play of light and shadow that dramatizes the heaviness of the wall, and was the effect of emphasizing the wall's depth by partially cutting into it. The spires are built of stone and decorated with pinnacles and dormers, and ball flower ornaments atop the pinnacles. Tower walls are reinforced with square and octagonal buttresses that taper abruptly with generous weatherings at transitional points and terminate in pinnacles, some with slender colonettes abutting chamfered edges, with ribbed, stepped, or gable caps. These buttresses are accented by heavy weatherings in lighter coloured stone (creating visual contrast while drawing attention to the points of stress on the building), and topped with pinnacles, thus emphasizing their massiveness, structural function, and verticality. They provide spatial rhythm on the east and west facades. A careful balance between horizontal and vertical elements can be observed throughout the interior and exterior of the church. On the exterior, a dog-toothed fret runs along the aisle roofline, while on the interior, a band of continuous painted bosses similarly run along the top of the aisle wall. These horizontal bands balance the composition against the verticality of the exterior tower and pinnacles, and the interior pointed arches of the nave arcade, creating a sense of stability and repose. At , the tower and spire have remained the tallest in Canada and the second tallest in North America after St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York‚Äîalthough the spire of St. James is still shorter than the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory in Montreal, which is the tallest church in the Western Hemisphere. The tower has five bells that still ring through the city today, and the chiming clock is \\"one of the finest examples of a chiming public clock anywhere in the world.\\" At the turn of the 20th century, St James' Cathedral was still the tallest building in Toronto, and was often the first thing immigrants noticed when they stepped off the train at the old Union Station. The total length of the cathedral is , with a maximum width of . A four sided arch with steeple was erected alongside the cathedral as a military memorial. =Interior= The pipe organ is located atop the principal entrance of the building Over the principal entrance, a carved organ cover rises over a royal coat of arms, while Minton tile-work lies underfoot. The organ has 5000 pipes and includes the original gallery organ from 1853 over the main south entrance at the rear of the cathedral. Trumpet pipes have since been added to the gallery organ. The front chancel and aisle pipes were added in 1916. In the interior, the absence of galleries frees the vertical movement of the arcade and clerestory. A high-pitched roof of heavy timber, crowned with enriched ribs and carved bosses creates a sense of shelter to the nave. The exposed rafters of the roof of the nave are articulated structural elements, and broad tie-beams and decorative cornices accent the joints. The elegant vault of the apsidal chancel, though expressing the thrust from the vault in the ribs that flow down to the ground, is a sham vault of lath and plaster that is coloured to represent stone. The division of the interior into six bays is reflected on the exterior by the buttresses along the east and west elevations. Pews flow through the arcade in rows of four, gallery fronts, and chancel panelling is all black walnut, as are the Corinthian capitals. Glazing bars of windows in sash of varying widths are reminiscent of Gothic tracery, creating divisions in the stained glass. Stained-glass windows atop the church's altar The cathedral is oriented on a north-south axis, whereas the traditional orientation is on an east-west axis with the altar at the east end. The orientation, decided by the design committee at the time, conforms to the symbolic representation of the church at the time, where the conflict with the American troops was apparent. The pews are oriented in central rows, with aisles on each side. The comfort of the seating was not highly regarded in the design.  Music  Uniquely within the city of Toronto, the fully professional 18-voice cathedral choir sings at the Eucharist (11:00 am) and Evensong (4:30 pm) each Sunday. Its repertoire spans eight centuries. Choral Eucharist is also celebrated at 9:00 am each Sunday and is sung by a group of volunteers. The cathedral's pipe organ can be heard in recitals each Tuesday at 1:00 pm and Sunday at 4:00 pm throughout the year. The recital series is curated by the cathedral's organist, David Simon.  St. James Park  To the east of the Cathedral is St. James Park, an urban public park that is owned by both the church and the City of Toronto government. The park is bounded by the Cathedral to the west, Adelaide Street East to the north, Jarvis Street to the east and King Street to the south. It is located across King Street from St. Lawrence Hall. Created in the early 20th century (the east and south sides around the park required demolition of a series of three-storey buildings), the park's Postmodern landscaping is Victorian-inspired, with formal gardens and a water fountain.St. James Park webpage Two walkways with park benches cross the park diagonally, with a large ornamental gazebo in the middle functioning as a central meeting place. The formal gardens are located in the southern quadrant of the park as defined by the X-shaped walkway plan, and the formal gardens have two paths intersecting at the fountain. Maintenance of the park is performed by Toronto Parks staff, and the formal gardens are tended by members of the Garden Club of Toronto. The park is often used for wedding photo shoots. In fall 2011, the park was occupied by members of Occupy Toronto.

Annual events  = Carnival = Most years towards the end of the school year the Student Activity Council holds the school's annual Carnival. The event generally contains large inflatables, games, popcorn, cotton candy, music, and other fun activities. During the 2018/2019 school year the Student Activity Council was able to offer the Carnival free of charge to the entire student body. = Semi-Formal = Since 2010 Heart Lake's Student Activity Council has held its annual Semi-Formal with varying themes each year. The only exception was the 2018/2019 school year when sales were too low and the Semi-Formal had to be canceled. = Talent Show = Annual Heart Lake Talent Show occurs every April, and tryouts happen two months before in February. Students may pay $2 to attend, which also allows them to miss their period 4 class on that day. Unlike buyouts, even those students who have paid cannot leave the school property and must attend the talent show. Students who have teachers who are helping out with the talent show as their period 4 teachers may attend the show for free, if the seats are still available. In 2008, there were 6 performances: martial arts, juggling, rapping, two singing performances, and modern Indian dance. Students have amateurly videotaped the performances with the school's permission and uploaded onto YouTube for 2007 and 2008 talent shows (refer to section below for the playlist link). = School Drama Production = Heart Lake's Drama production occurs annually in May, based on various classical novels and plays. 2009's You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown was Heart Lake's first ever musical production.

Link Crew allows the school to choose one hundred Grade 11s and 12s to be linked with freshmen throughout the year. The \\"Link Leaders\\" help the freshman get involved by informing them about the activities put on by the school and local communities. These students also help to bridge the gap between freshmen and the rest of the school, when the younger students may feel like they don't belong. The leaders are a positive role model for the freshman students during the important transition from middle school to high school. = Regional Enhanced learning program = Heart Lake's Regional Enhanced Learning Program is designed for exceptional intellectual-gifted students who require extensive modification of the regular school program. To enter the program, you must have already been designated exceptional intellectual-gifted/ The program strives to maximize each student's potential, develops their capacity for self-directed learning, and encourages interaction among gifted peers. Only specific coursers are offered at this level, which includes Grade 9-12 English, Grade 9-12 Math, Grade 9 -12 Sciences, Grade 10 History, Grade 9 Geography, Grade 9-12 French and a few others. For these courses the gifted students are placed into a single class, going at around the same pace as the regular academic students, with some modifications.

Given the acronym \\"GMBD\\", players suggest phrases including \\"Great Miami's Beaches, Delightful\\" and \\"Great Men Born Dead\\" Acrophobia is an online multiplayer word game. The game was originally conceived by Andrea Shubert, and programmed by Kenrick Mock and Michelle Hoyle in 1995. Originally available over Internet Relay Chat, the game has since been developed into a number of variants, as a download, playable through a browser, via Twitter or through Facebook. Background Created by Andrea Shubert in the mid to late 1990s, she developed a \\"spiritual successor\\" called TAG: The Acronym Game for startup gaming company play140. Game play Players enter a channel hosted by a bot which runs the game. In each round, the bot generates a random acronym. Players compete by racing to create the most coherent or humorous sentence that fits the acronym - in essence, a backronym. After a set amount of time expires, each player then votes anonymously via the bot for their favorite answer (aside from their own). Points are awarded to the most popular backronym. Bonus points also may be given based on the fastest response and for voting for the winning option. Some implementations give the speed bonus to the player with the first answer that received at least one vote; this is to discourage players from quickly entering gibberish just to be the first. Bonus points for voting for the winner helps discourage players from intentionally voting for poor answers to avoid giving votes to answers that might beat their own. Some versions of the game were criticized for the ease with which players could disrupt games with obscenities, and the anonymous nature of the site meant that there were no repercussions for this behavior. Usually, nonsense backronyms will score low and the most humorous sounding backronym which effectively makes a sentence from the initials will win. Some rounds may have a specific topic that the answers should fit, although enforcement of the topic depends on solely on the other players' willingness to vote for off-topic answers. Acrophobia was commended as an online game that showed the potential for educational use, and that its use of technology allowed \\"imaginative play, instant feedback, and [an] unusual scoring system.\\" An example game typically goes as follows: *a 3-letter round *a 4-letter round *a 5-letter round *a 6-letter round *a 7-letter round Then, it goes back to 3 letters and starts the cycle over. Once one player reaches 30 points, the top two players at this point are chosen to face-off. In the face-off rounds, the two players enter their acronyms and everyone else votes not knowing which acronym is from which player. Each face- off round lasts about 20 seconds and consists of: *a 3-letter round *a 4-letter round *a 5-letter round The player with the most points from the face-off round wins the game. Reception Acrophobia was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Puzzle Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Smart Games Challenge 2. However, it won GameSpot's 1997 \\"Best Online- Only Game\\" award; the editors wrote, \\"Besides being a fun and very addictive game, the great thing about Acrophobia is the social experience.\\"  References   External links  * Wired article about Acrophobia * Baltimore Sun article * Video of Acrophobia gameplay Category:1995 video games Category:Windows games Category:Word games Category:Online games Category:Internet Relay Chat Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Acrophobia (game)"},{"id":"1135655","text":"People of the Black Mountains is an historical novel by Raymond Williams. This book is a work in two volumes, published in 1989 and 1990. It features a great diversity of people in a single place across the ages. Most of them are ordinary people living unprivileged lives. It is told thorough a series of flashbacks featuring an ordinary man in modern times. He is looking for his grandfather who has not returned from a hill-walk, but has visions of the past as it might have been. It begins in the Old Stone Age and extends through to the Middle Ages, telling a series of fictionalized short stories about ordinary people in the Welsh-border region of the Black Mountains where he was born and grew up. The series is solidly based on what archaeologists have found ‚Äì some of the tales are speculative reconstructions based on real burials. It has been praised for \\"brilliant clarity and imaginative vision\\" (Sunday Telegraph) and hailed as \\"the great historic novel Wales has long deserved\\" (Wales on Sunday). The story-sequence would have extended to modern times had Williams lived to finish it. What exists is a complete story arc extending from the Old Stone Age to the late-Mediaeval period. The story begins in the Old Stone Age and was intended to come right up to modern times, always focusing on ordinary people. He had completed it as mediaeval times when he died in 1988.

It is the successor of WATFOR. WATFIV was used from the late 1960s into the mid-1980s. WATFIV was in turn succeeded by later versions of WATFOR. Because it could complete the three usual steps (\\"compile-link-go\\") in just one pass, the system became popular for teaching students computer programming. History In the early 1960s, newly formed computer science departments started university programs to teach computer programming languages. The Fortran language had been developed at IBM, but suffered from slow and error- prone three-stage batch processing workflow. In the first stage, the compiler started with source code and produced object code. In the second stage, a linker constructed a complete program using growing libraries of common functions. Finally, the program was repeatedly executed with data for the typical scientific and business problems of customers. Each step often included a new set of punched cards or tape. Students, on the other hand, had very different requirements. Their programs were generally short, but usually contained logic and syntax errors, resulting in time-consuming repetition of the steps and confusing \\"core dumps\\" (It often took a full day to submit and receive the successful or failed output from the computer operator). Once their programs worked correctly, they were turned in and not run again. In 1961, the University of Wisconsin developed a technology called FORGO for the IBM 1620 which combined some of the steps. Similar experiments were carried out at Purdue University on the IBM 7090 in a system called PUFFT. =WATFOR 7040= In summer 1965, four undergraduate students of the University of Waterloo, Gus German, James G. Mitchell Richard Shirley and Robert Zarnke, led by Peter Shantz, developed a Fortran compiler for the IBM 7040 computer called WATFOR. Its objectives were fast compilation speed and effective error diagnostics at both compile and execution time. It eliminates the need for a separate linking step and, as a result, FORTRAN programs which contain no syntax errors are placed into immediate execution. Professor J. Wesley Graham provided leadership throughout the project. This simple, one-step process allowed non-experienced programmers to learn programming with lower cost in time and computing resources. To aid in debugging, the compiler uses an innovative approach to checking for undefined variables (an extremely common mistake by beginning programmers). It uses a diagnostic feature of the 7040 that can deliberately set areas of memory to bad parity. When a program tries to reference variables that hadn't been set, the machine takes an interrupt (handled by the Watfor runtime routines) and the error is reported to the user as an undefined variable. This has the pleasant side effect of checking for undefined variables with essentially no CPU overhead. WATFOR quickly gained popularity and over 75 institutions installed it on their IBM 7040 systems. The distribution of the compiler was handled by Sandra Bruce (n√©e Hope). =WATFOR 360= In 1966, the University planned to replace the 7040 with an IBM System/360 computer, which was much faster but not software compatible. A team of full-time employees and undergraduate students was formed to write an IBM 360 version. The project members, Betty Schmidt, Paul Dirksen, Paul H. Cress, Lothar K. \\"Ned\\" Kesselhut, Bill Kindree and Dereck Meek, who were later joined by Mike Doyle, Rod Milne, Ron Hurdal and Lynn Williams, completed 360 WATFOR in the early part of 1967. Many other institutions (universities, colleges, businesses and governmental agencies) started using the WATFOR compiler to meet needs similar to those experienced at the University of Waterloo. The distribution of the software and customer support was carried on by Sandra Ward. =WATFIV= As a result of proposals from the SHARE user group Fortran committee and others, a new version called WATFIV was produced in 1968. WATFIV introduced new features such as CHARACTER variables and direct-access input-output. The Association for Computing Machinery presented Paul Cress and Paul Dirksen the Grace Murray Hopper Award for contributions to the WATFOR and WATFIV projects in 1972. The WATFIV compiler was included in the DATAPRO Honour Roll for 1975 and 1976. People involved with maintenance and enhancement included Bernie Murphy, Martin Wiseman and Yvonne Johnson. WATFIV was pronounced as \\"WHAT FIVE\\", but, as was realized at the time, could also (almost) still be pronounced as \\"WHAT FOR\\", as in WAT-F-IV (Waterloo Fortran IV). Universities and corporations used these compilers and a number of other software products have been developed in the WATFOR tradition. For example, a version for the COBOL programming language is called WATBOL. Daniel D. McCracken said \\"it is no exaggeration to suggest that WATFOR revolutionized the use of computers in education.\\" At one point, more than 3,000 mini and mainframe computer licenses and over 100,000 microcomputer licenses were held worldwide for this family of software products. =WATFOR-11, -S and -11S= In 1974, a compiler with characteristics similar to the IBM implementation was created for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer and called WATFOR-11. The team members, Jack Schueler, Jim Welch and Terry Wilkinson, were later joined by Ian McPhee who had added new control statements to the WATFIV compiler for structured programming (SP). These new statements included the block IF (later included in the ANSI X3.9-1978 language standard), WHILE, UNTIL, and others. WATFIV-S was announced in 1974 and a few months later, WATFOR-11S (the \\"S\\" indicating the new SP features) was also announced. The original SP features were later enhanced with additional statements by Bruce Hay in WATFIV-S in 1980 and by Jack Schueler in WATFOR-11S in 1981. =WATFOR-77= During the 1970s, the ANSI X3J3 subcommittee (the FORTRAN language standard group) developed a new language standard which was officially approved in April, 1978. This standard, designated FORTRAN 77, introduced many new statements into the language. In fact, the previous language standard FORTRAN 66 is a very small document and describes, what is in effect, a subset of most implementations of FORTRAN. For example, the WATFIV and WATFOR-11 implementations are based upon the IBM definition of FORTRAN-IV. As programmers used the FORTRAN 77 features, a new compiler was required to combine the advantages of the WATFIV compiler with the new language standard. In January 1983, a project to develop a FORTRAN 77 compiler was started at Watcom Systems Inc. Under the leadership of Jack Schueler, Watcom employees and undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo's Co-operative Computer Science program became involved in the creation of the WATFOR-77 compiler. The major work was done by Geno Coschi, Fred Crigger, John Dahms, Jim Graham, Jack Schueler, Anthony Scian and Paul Van Oorschot. They were assisted by Rod Cremasco, John McCormick, David McKee and Brian Stecher. Many of the team members from former compiler projects provided input. These included Bruce Hay, Ian McPhee, Sandra Ward, Jim Welch and Terry Wilkinson. Unlike previous compilers, a significant portion of WATFOR-77 was written in a portable systems language to ease the implementation of the compiler on other computer systems. Earlier WATFOR compilers were written entirely in machine- dependent assembly language. Two components of the compiler are not portable. The code generator translates FORTRAN statements into native computer instructions and stores them in memory. The first version of WATFOR-77 generates instructions for the IBM 370 computer architecture. Most of the execution-time support (undefined variable checking, subscript evaluation, intrinsic functions) was written in assembly language for good performance. In September 1984, the first version was installed at the University of Waterloo for the Department of Computing Services. It was an implementation for IBM 370 computers running the VM/SP CMS operating system. A few months earlier, in May 1984, a project started to implement the WATFOR-77 compiler on the IBM Personal Computer. This project included Geno Coschi, Fred Crigger, Tim Galvin, Athos Kasapi, Jack Schueler, Terry Skomorowski and Brian Stecher. In April 1985, this second version of WATFOR-77 was installed at the University of Waterloo for use by students of the Faculty of Engineering. The compiler can run on a 256K IBM Personal Computer using IBM PC DOS 2.0 and does not require special floating-point hardware. In the fall of 1985, a Japanese version of WATFOR-77 was delivered to IBM Japan for the IBM JX Personal Computer. This version produces Japanese language error messages and supported the Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana character sets for variable names and character strings. To support the JX, the Language Reference manual and User's Guide were translated into Japanese. Another version of WATFOR-77 with the same features mentioned above was also developed for Japanese IBM PS/55 family of personal computers in Spring 1988. During the summer of 1986, the IBM PC version of WATFOR-77 was adapted to run on the Unisys ICON which runs the QNX operating system. Since QNX is quite different from IBM PC DOS, parts of the run-time system were rewritten. This implementation of WATFOR-77 was made available in September 1986. During the summer of 1985, a project was started to adapt WATFOR-77 to the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computer series running the VMS operating system. The members of this project included Geno Coschi, Marc Ouellette, Jack Schueler and Terry Skomorowski. This implementation was made available in March 1987. Also, in the spring of 1988, a new project was begun to develop an optimizing FORTRAN 77 compiler. This compiler uses the code generator from the Watcom C compiler, which produces superior machine code to other C compilers. The FORTRAN 77 optimizing compiler was first shipped in mid-1990. In October 1990, the 25th anniversary of WATFOR was celebrated. Many involved in the development of the WATFOR compilers were invited to the University of Waterloo for a reunion. In spring 1992, a version of WATFOR-77 was adapted to the NEC PC-9801 family of personal computers. This version was similar to the IBM PS/55 version but modified to accommodate architectural differences. In January 1992, development of a 32-bit version of WATFOR-77 for Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 personal computers began. The first version was shipped in the fall of 1992. As late as 1995, classes for programming in WATFIV were still being held at the University of Mississippi, led by Professor Charles H. (Chuckie) Franke. See also * Watcom * Donald B.

The present Bangor Cathedral, dedicated to Deiniol, is said to be on the site where his monastery stood. He is venerated in Brittany as Saint Denoual. In English and Latin his name is sometimes rendered as Daniel. Life According to a Latin Life of Deiniol, preserved in Peniarth MS226 and transcribed in 1602 by Sir Thomas Williams of Trefriw, he was the son of Abbot Dunod Fawr, son of Pabo Post Prydain. The family, having lost their land in the North of England, were given land by the king of Powys, Cyngen ap Cadell. Dunod embraced the religious life and founded the monastery at Bangor-is-y-coed on the Dee.\\"St.Deiniol\\", Stories of the Saints, Oystermouth Parish, Swansea Deiniol is said to have studied under Cadoc of Llancarfan. Sir David Trevor describes Deiniol as one of the seven blessed cousins who had spent part of his early life as a hermit \\"on the arm of Pembrokeshire\\" but was called to be a bishop despite deficiencies in his formal education. Deiniol soon left Powys for Gwynedd where he founded the monastery of Bangor under the patronage of Maelgwn Gwynedd who endowed it with lands and privileges, later raising it to the rank of the official seat of a bishop, sharing a common boundary with the principality of Gwynedd. Deiniol spent the remainder of his days here as Abbot and Bishop. He attended the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi in c. 545 with Saint David when the subject of rules for penance was being discussed. He was apparently consecrated in 545 by David. According to the Annales Cambriae Deiniol died in 584 and was buried on Bardsey Island.Martyrologium Romanum, 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), page 509. His cult in North Wales was quite extensive and several churches are dedicated to him, including Worthenbury near Wrexham and Hawarden, Flintshire in the north of Wales (as well as other churches in Flintshire). There are also dedicated churches at Llangarron, Llanfor, Llanuwchllyn, Eyton, and Itton; near Cardigan Bay there is a village of Llandeiniol - \\"parish of St Deniol\\" - which was once the name of Itton. Legacy The churches of Hawarden and of Marchwiel are dedicated to Deiniol and there are also dedications at Itton in Monmouthshire and Llangarron in Herefordshire. William Ewart Gladstone dedicated St Deiniol's Library, a residential library in Hawarden, Flintshire, for arts students, in 1896. In the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for WalesNational Calendar for Wales, accessed 6 February 2012 he is commemorated on the traditional date of 11 September.

(Retd) Surendra Kulkarni, who has occupied the post since January 2015 as the 17th principal. The idea for the college was proposed in 1869 by Colonel Walter. It was founded in 1875 and Colonel Sir Oliver St John became its first principal.List of Principals of Mayo College . Accessed 11 November 2007 The founder's intention was to create an \\"Eton of India\\". The 1st Earl of Lytton, Viceroy of India, said in a speech on campus in 1879: :The idea was well expressed long ago by Colonel Walter in an excellent and most suggestive report which may have influenced Lord Mayo when he founded the present college. In that very sensible report Colonel Walter pointed out that what was then most needed for the education of India's young rulers and nobles was an Indian Eton. Mayo is India's Eton and you are India's Eton boys.Mayo College as India's Eton A speech by the Earl of Lytton in 1879 It aimed to provide the leaders of the princely states with an education similar to that given by Eton College. The British built Mayo for the sons of the Indian upper classes, particularly the princes and nobles of India. The school houses 800 pupils aged between 9 and 18. Coat of arms The coat of arms was composed from the design furnished by Lockwood Kipling, a former principal of the School of Arts, Lahore, and father of Rudyard Kipling. In the upper centre of the shield are Mayo Arms and Quarterings, a Lion Rampant and an open hand. On the right and left are the sun and the moon, typical of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi, the two great families of Rajputs.

He disapproved of manufactured products that were unsafe, showy, maladapted, or essentially useless. His products, writings, and lectures were collectively considered an example and inspired many designers. Papanek was a philosopher of design and as such he was an untiring, eloquent promoter of design aims and approaches that would be sensitive to social and ecological considerations. He wrote that \\"design has become the most powerful tool with which man shapes his tools and environments (and, by extension, society and himself).\\"Papanek has taught at universities and art colleges throughout his life and has won many important design awards. He has done a lot of design work for UNESCO, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many third world countries, which can be called \\"world citizens\\". Papanek is diligent in writing, and his most important works include \\"Designing for the Real World\\", \\"Designing for People's Scales\\", and \\"Green Law\\". Among them, \\"Design for the Real World\\" has the greatest impact, and the book has been translated into more than 24 languages.  Early life  Papanek was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1923. He attended public school in England and immigrated to the US in 1930s, where he studied design and architecture. Papanek studied with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona in the 1940. He earned his bachelor's degree at Cooper Union in New York (1950) and did graduate studies in design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.A. 1955). Papanek was interested in humankind as such and pursued an interest in anthropology, living and working for several years with Navajos, Inuit, and Balinese. Indeed, Papanek felt that when design is simply technical or merely style- oriented, it loses touch with what is truly needed by people. Papanek believes that if the design is only based on art, craft and style, people's real needs will be excluded. In his view, taking into account the aesthetic value or feel of a product is just a subset of the designer's responsibilities. Since then, he has designed many products for UNESCO and the world health organization. His interest in design is all-encompassing, often considering its consequences for people and the environment. He also believed that many American designs had some drawbacks, including many safety risks and unreasonable factors.  Career  \\"One of my first jobs after leaving school was to design a table radio,\\" Papanek wrote in Design for the Real World. \\"This was shroud design: the design of external covering of the mechanical and electrical guts. It was my first, and I hope my last, encounter with appearance design, styling, or design ‚Äòcosmetics‚Äô.\\" And further, he opined: \\"Only a small part of our responsibility lies in the area of aesthetics.\\" In the same book, Papanek wrote: \\"Much recent design has satisfied only evanescent wants and desires, while the genuine needs of man have often been neglected by the designer.\\" Victor Papanek taught at the Ontario College of Art, the Rhode Island School of Design, Purdue University, the California Institute of the Arts (where he was dean), head of the Department of Product Design in the School of Design at North Carolina State College and other places in North America. He headed the design department in the Kansas City Art Institute from 1976 to 1981. In 1981, he became the J.L. Constant Professor of Architecture and Design at the University of Kansas. He also worked, taught, and consulted in Sweden, England, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Finland and Australia. Papanek created product designs for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Volvo of Sweden contracted him to design a taxi for the disabled. With his interest in all aspects of design and how they affected people and the environment, Papanek felt that much of what was manufactured in the U.S. was inconvenient, often frivolous and even unsafe. He worked with a design team that prototyped an educational television set that could be utilized in the developing countries of Africa and produced in Japan for $9.00 per set (cost in 1970 dollars). His designed products also included a remarkable transistor radio, made from ordinary metal food cans and powered by a burning candle, that was designed to actually be produced cheaply in developing countries. His design skills also took him into projects like an innovative method for dispersing seeds and fertilizer for reforestation in difficult-to-access land, as well as working with a design team on a human-powered vehicle capable of conveying a half-ton load, and another team to design a very early three-wheeled, wide-tired all- terrain vehicle. As Papanek traveled around the world, he gave lectures about his ideas for ecologically sound design and designs to serve the poor, the disabled, the elderly and other minority segments of society. He wrote or co- wrote eight books. How could the designer, who must (like others) make a living actually serve ‚Äòreal needs‚Äô of human beings? ‚ÄúI have tried to demonstrate that by freely giving 10 percent of his time, talents, and skills the designer can help.‚Äù In other words, a willingness to volunteer. Papanek received numerous awards, including a Distinguished Designer fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. The following year he received the IKEA Foundation International Award. He died in Lawrence, Kansas, aged 74.  Important work  \\"Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change\\"(1971)The most important book by American design theorist Victor Papanek. In this controversial book at the time, Papanek put forward his new view on the purpose of design, that is, design should serve the people; design should not only serve healthy people but also must consider serving the disabled. The problem of the use of the earth ‚Äôs limited resources should be seriously considered, and the design should serve the protection of the limited resources of the planet we live on. Victor Papanek had a direct impact on the trend of green design. He first proposed the concept of design ethics, that is, what are we designing for? In the tumultuous wave of the \\"pop\\" design movement, some people began to seriously raise the issue of \\"design purpose\\" from the perspective of design theory. This is an essential starting point for modern design ethics and modern design purpose theory. It is precisely because of this starting point that more in-depth development of design theory has emerged in the future. In Victor's view, even a classic design may become continuously improved due to new materials, new technologies, new processes, and new concepts produced in the new era. However, it is precisely this design idea that is too precise and meticulous. The design value it contains is too grand. The design must display higher values in addition to aesthetics and function, that is: design is a continuous evolution of human beings to the self-world. This view is regarded by the highly consumerist business world as an \\"unconventional\\" utopian fantasy. This has created a weird phenomenon. Designers think they can change the world. Victor also thinks that design can change the world. But the world has not been completely changed. The reason is that designers are trying to change the world on a wrong path, and the real world is ignored by everyone. There may be many reasons for the above situation. The original responsibility may be from the defects of design education: The disadvantage of design school seems to be that the professional skills are taught too much, thus neglecting those trends that are closely related to design, such as society and environment. , Economy and changing pop culture. It is the technicalism that has led designers to gradually become professional technicians of the type known as \\"artists\\" by exterior decorators and the public. And, even for skills, today's design schools are also on a conservative and moderate route. Bauhaus, composition and Swiss internationalism. Even students are required to work on hand-made, posters, prints, screen printing, etc., completely forgetting that after 2000 is a new era of touch screen and online data processing. This is the era of CSS, HTML5, and dynamic interactive programs. Learning to use compasses and hammers is meaningless to designers of this era. Victor said: ‚Äú‚ãØ‚ãØ Learning must be a fanatical experience ‚ãØ‚ãØ Because learning is change. Education is a program in which the environment changes the learner and the learner changes the environment‚Äù. This is called completeness. Integrated design means that the designer should not excessively pursue the depth of design skills, but should focus on the breadth of design connotation (and design responsibility). After all, the design work is to communicate with people and connect with each other and the current society. Dependent. Nowadays, many of the issues about design responsibility that Victor explained in the 70 ‚Ä≤s have been solved in the new millennium. He attributed the public policies and resources that many designers cannot reach to the radical attitude of design responsibility. It cannot be resolved for a long time. Although many problems in the old world have been solved, new problems are still emerging. Every generation of designers is facing new problems of each generation. New problems of each generation of designers still need to be prompted by radical views to improve. In this sense, Victor ‚Äôs attitude still has reference value, even in the academic world. Said that he described an \\"unreal\\" real world.  Bibliography  = Books authored by Papanek = *Papanek, Victor (1971).

His reputation was of a stern disciplinarian who was one of the harshest and most effective whips. His sense of the popular mood led him know when to sacrifice unpopular ministers. He protected the appeasement-supporting government as long as he could. However, some argue that there were weaknesses of his system because of the number of high-profile rebellions during his tenure. Background and education Margesson was the third child and elder son of Sir Mortimer Margesson and Lady Isabel, daughter of Frederick Hobart-Hampden, Lord Hobart, and sister of the 7th Earl of Buckinghamshire. He grew up in Worcestershire and was educated at Harrow School and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He did not complete his degree, choosing instead to seek his fortune in the United States of America. Margesson volunteered at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and served as an adjutant in the 11th Hussars. Early political career, 1922‚Äì1931 After the war, Margesson entered politics at the suggestion of Lord Lee of Fareham. In the 1922 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Upton. Very soon after his election, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Labour, Anderson Montague-Barlow. In the 1923 general election, he lost his seat, but at the 1924 general election, he returned to Parliament for Rugby, the seat for which he would sit for the next eighteen years. He defeated future Liberal National leader Ernest Brown in the process. Margesson was appointed Assistant Government Whip. Two years later, he became a more senior whip with the title Junior Lord of the Treasury until the Conservatives' defeat, in the 1929 general election. In August 1931, he was reappointed to the same position upon the formation of the National Government. Government Chief Whip, 1931‚Äì1940 Following the November 1931 general election, he was promoted to the senior position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (Government Chief Whip). Margesson's position was in many ways unprecedented, having the task of keeping in power a grouping composed of the Conservatives, National Labour and two groups of Liberals (the official Liberal Party and the Liberal National Party) all behind a single government that sought to stand above partisan politics. With the government commanding the support of 556 MPs, as opposed to just 58 opposition members, his main task was to ensure that the government stayed together and was able to pass contentious legislation without risking a major breach within the government. That proved tricky several times, as different sections of the National combination came to denounce areas of government policy. Margesson adopted a method of strong disciplinarianism combined with selective use of patronage and the social effect of ostracism to secure every vote possible. An example of his methods was his letter to the House of Commons' youngest member, the future minister John Profumo, after the Norway Debate, in which Profumo had opposed other Conservatives. Margesson's letter included the following extraordinary passage: \\"And I can tell you this, you utterly contemptible little shit. On every morning that you wake up for the rest of your life you will be ashamed of what you did last night.\\" On that occasion, his methods failed. Despite such behaviour, Margesson remained a much-liked individual, with many members expressing personal admiration for him. Away from his duties he was known to be quite sociable, and within the parliamentary party; few bore him ill. However, a major faultline lay over the question of introducing protective tariffs on imports as a prelude to negotiating a customs union within the British Empire. The proposed policy had deeply divided the Conservatives over the previous 30 years, but by then, they, with most of the National Labour and Liberal National members of the government, had become in favour of the policy during the Great Depression. However the Liberal Party remained committed to the principle of free trade and were deeply reluctant to compromise. Whilst the Liberals themselves barely commanded the support of 33 MPs, they were one of only two parties in the government with a long independent history, and there were fears that their withdrawal would turn the National Government into a mere Conservative rump, something that National Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald wished to avoid. At one stage, it was agreed that members of the cabinet would suspend the principle of cabinet collective responsibility and agree to differ on tariffs. Matters were complicated again by the question of Cabinet appointments. When the Liberal President of the Board of Education Sir Donald Maclean died, Margesson insisted that to appoint another Liberal, merely on the basis of party balance, would inflame tensions in Conservative MPs, could lead to a poor appointment and would maintain an imbalance, the Liberals having one more Cabinet minister than the Liberal Nationals did despite the latter having two more MPs. National Labour Lord Privy Seal Lord Snowden was increasingly siding with the Liberals on all key divisions, thus providing a surrogate. The appointment of the Conservative Lord Irwin upset the Liberals, who had no promise that the next Cabinet vacancy would be filled by a Liberal. In the summer of 1932, the Ottawa Agreement was negotiated between the dominions, and free trade seemed a dead cause within government. In September, the Liberals resigned their ministerial offices but did not withdraw complete support for the government until the following November. However the National Government did not break up, as the remaining National Labour and Liberal National elements remained in government. In 1933, Margesson was appointed to the Privy Council. In 1935, the Government also came under fire from the Diehard Conservative wing of the Conservative Party over plans to implement the Government of India Act 1935, which would grant India more autonomy. The policy was widely felt to be a hangover from the previous Labour government and one that few Conservative governments would have implemented. Many believed that the plan would not have been pursued except for both a desire to prove the government's nonpartisan credentials and Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin's determination to implement the policy. For some, the question of the success of the policy became a question of the survival of the National Government. Opponents to Indian Home Rule found several spokespersons, most notably Winston Churchill, and they harried the government at every stage, with nearly one hundred Conservative MPs voting against the third reading of the Bill, the highest number of Conservatives to vote against a three-line whip in the twentieth century. Still, the Bill passed easily. Margesson was retained as Chief Whip when Baldwin became Prime Minister in June 1935 but had to face further rifts in the party over foreign policy and other matters. The government's majority was cut to 250 in the November 1935 general election. In December, the leaking of the proposed Hoare-Laval Plan to grant two-thirds of Abyssinia to Italy outraged some Conservative MPs. Margesson's reading of the mood led to the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare being dropped from the government to soothe feelings and keep the government in power. The late 1930s were a turbulent time within the National Government, with rebellions over foreign policy, over unemployment, over agriculture and other matters routinely threatened to rock the government. Margesson was instrumental in heading off many of the rebellions and limiting damage caused by others. He was instrumental in warding these off for Baldwin and then Neville Chamberlain. However, a well of discontent with the government's foreign policy grew, especially after Britain entered World War II. Eight months into the conflict, severe reverses in the Norwegian campaign led to the two-day \\"Norway Debate\\" of 7 and 8 May 1940 in which the government came under severe criticism from its own supporters and witnessed a massive rebellion on a motion of confidence. The government maintained a majority, but Margesson's soundings revealed that that majority was imperilled unless the political composition of the government was widened. When Chamberlain realised that he was unable to do so, he resigned and was succeeded by Churchill. Margesson was referred to in the book \\"Guilty Men\\" by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym \\"Cato\\"), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany. Secretary of State for War, 1940‚Äì1942 Margesson (standing, second from right) with other members of the Churchill Coalition War Cabinet Many were surprised that Churchill retained Margesson as Chief Whip, little realising that there was no personal animosity between the two and that Churchill would have had less regard for Margesson if he had not carried out his functions as Chief Whip. Margesson proved a useful buttress of support as Churchill consolidated his position in government. Margesson, who was living at the Carlton Club since his recent divorce, was present when it was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 14 October 1940. He was left homeless and had to sleep for a time on a makeshift bed in the underground Cabinet Annexe.the event is also discussed in Their Finest Hour, Volume II of Churchill's History of the Second World War, p.285Stewart 2000, p.443 When, at the end of 1940, the position of Secretary of State for War fell vacant, Margesson was promoted to it. Margesson proved competent and efficient, but in February 1942, Britain suffered severe military setbacks, including the loss of Singapore. Churchill was forced to make changes to his ministerial team and find scapegoats for the disasters. Margesson was dropped and replaced by his own Permanent Under- Secretary P. J. Grigg, an unprecedented move. Margesson was first told of the change by Grigg himself but accepted his fate as necessary for the government's future. Later that year, he was made Viscount Margesson, of Rugby in the County of Warwick. His political influence waned sharply. He subsequently worked in the City of London. Family Margesson married Frances, daughter of Francis Howard Leggett, in 1916. They had one son and two daughters but were divorced in 1940. Their second daughter, the Hon. Mary, married Lord Charteris of Amisfield. Lord Margesson died in the Bahamas in December 1965, aged 75, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only son, Francis.

The event marked the end of the Vietnam War and the start of a transition period to the formal reunification of Vietnam into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.. The PAVN, under the command of General VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng, began their final attack on Saigon on April 29, 1975, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces commanded by General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n suffering a heavy artillery bombardment. By the afternoon of the next day, the PAVN had occupied the important points of the city and raised their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace. The city was renamed H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City, after the late North Vietnamese President H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh. The capture of the city was preceded by Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of almost all the American civilian and military personnel in Saigon, along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians who had been associated with the southern regime. A few Americans chose not to be evacuated. US ground combat units had left South Vietnam more than two years prior to the fall of Saigon and were not available to assist with either the defense of Saigon or the evacuation. * * (originally published in the May 1975 issue of Leatherneck Magazine) * (The article describes the experiences of three American women who stayed on, and mentions 12 Americans who stayed) * (Article by an American journalist who chose not to be evacuated) * (Article asserting that about 70 Americans stayed behind and containing details of some individual cases) * (mentions NBC correspondents Jim Laurie and Neil Davis who stayed after the evacuation) The evacuation was the largest helicopter evacuation in history. In addition to the flight of refugees, the end of the war and the institution of new rules by the communists contributed to a decline in the city's population.Desbarats, Jacqueline. \\"Repression in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam: Executions and Population Relocation\\", from The Vietnam Debate (1990) by John Morton Moore.

North Vietnamese advance Situation of South Vietnam before the capture of Saigon (lower right) on April 30, 1975 The rapidity with which the South Vietnamese position collapsed in 1975 was surprising to most American and South Vietnamese observers, and probably to the North Vietnamese and their allies as well. For instance, a memo prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Army Intelligence and published on March 5 indicated that South Vietnam could hold out through the current dry season‚Äîi.e., at least until 1976.Todd, 433. These predictions proved to be grievously in error. Even as that memo was being released, General D≈©ng was preparing a major offensive in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, which began on 10 March and led to the capture of Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt. The ARVN began a disorderly and costly retreat, hoping to redeploy its forces and hold the southern part of South Vietnam, south of the 13th parallel.Tanner, 303. Supported by artillery and armor, the PAVN continued to march towards Saigon, capturing the major cities of northern South Vietnam at the end of March‚ÄîHu·∫ø on the 25th and ƒê√† N·∫µng on the 28th. Along the way, disorderly South Vietnamese retreats and the flight of refugees‚Äîthere were more than 300,000 in ƒê√† N·∫µngDawson, xiii.‚Äîdamaged South Vietnamese prospects for a turnaround. After the loss of ƒê√† N·∫µng, those prospects had already been dismissed as nonexistent by American CIA officers in Vietnam, who believed that nothing short of B-52 strikes against Hanoi could possibly stop the North Vietnamese.Snepp, 280. By April 8, the North Vietnamese Politburo, which in March had recommended caution to D≈©ng, cabled him to demand \\"unremitting vigor in the attack all the way to the heart of Saigon.\\"Todd, 248. On April 14, they renamed the campaign the \\"H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh campaign\\", after revolutionary leader H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, in hopes of wrapping it up before his birthday on May 19.Todd, 249. Meanwhile, South Vietnam failed to garner any significant increase in military aid from the United States, snuffing out President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu‚Äôs hopes for renewed American support. On April 9, PAVN forces reached Xu√¢n L·ªôc, the last line of defense before Saigon, where the ARVN 18th Division made a last stand and held the city through fierce fighting for 11 days. The ARVN finally withdrew from Xu√¢n L·ªôc on April 20 having inflicted heavy losses on the PAVN, and on April 21 President Thi·ªáu resigned in a tearful televised announcement in which he denounced the United States for failing to come to the aid of the South.NEWS.BBC.co.uk BBC on this Day  21  1975: Vietnam's President Thieu resigns. The North Vietnamese front line was now just from downtown Saigon.Dawson, xv. The victory at Xu√¢n L·ªôc, which had drawn many South Vietnamese troops away from the Mekong Delta area, opened the way for PAVN to encircle Saigon, and they soon did so, moving 100,000 troops in position around the city by April 27. With the ARVN having few defenders, the fate of the city was effectively sealed. The ARVN III Corps commander, General To√†n, had organized five centers of resistance to defend the city. These fronts were so connected as to form an arc enveloping the entire area west, north, and east of the capital. The Cu Chi front, to the northwest, was defended by the 25th Division; the Binh Duong front, to the north, was the responsibility of the 5th Division; the Bien Hoa front, to the northeast, was defended by the 18th Division; the Vung Tau and 15 Route front, to the southeast, were held by the 1st Airborne Brigade and one battalion of the 3rd Division; and the Long An front, for which the Capital Military District Command was responsible, was defended by elements of the re-formed 22nd Division. South Vietnamese defensive forces around Saigon totaled approximately 60,000 troops.Willbanks, p. 257. However, as the exodus made it into Saigon, along with them were many ARVN soldiers, which swelled the \\"men under arms\\" in the city to over 250,000. These units were mostly battered and leaderless, which threw the city into further anarchy. Evacuation The rapid PAVN advances of March and early April led to increased concern in Saigon that the city, which had been fairly peaceful throughout the war and whose people had endured relatively little suffering, was soon to come under direct attack.Weinraub. Many feared that once the communists took control of the city, a bloodbath of reprisals would take place. In 1968, PAVN and VC forces had occupied Hu·∫ø for close to a month. After the communists were repelled, American and ARVN forces had found mass graves. A study indicated that the VC had targeted ARVN officers, Roman Catholics, intellectuals and businessmen, and other suspected counterrevolutionaries.Pike. More recently, eight Americans captured in Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt had vanished and reports of beheadings and other executions were filtering through from Hu·∫ø and ƒê√† N·∫µng, mostly spurred on by government propaganda.Tanner, 312. Most Americans and citizens of other countries allied to the United States wanted to evacuate the city before it fell, and many South Vietnamese, especially those associated with the United States or South Vietnamese government, wanted to leave as well. As early as the end of March, some Americans were leaving the city.Dawson, xiv. Flights out of Saigon, lightly booked under ordinary circumstances, were full.Butterfield. Throughout April the speed of the evacuation increased, as the Defense Attach√© Office (DAO) began to fly out nonessential personnel. Many Americans attached to the DAO refused to leave without their Vietnamese friends and dependents, who included common-law wives and children. It was illegal for the DAO to move these people to American soil, and this initially slowed down the rate of departure, but eventually the DAO began illegally flying undocumented Vietnamese to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.Snepp, 312. On April 3, President Gerald Ford announced \\"Operation Babylift\\", which would evacuate about 2,000 orphans from the country. One of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy planes involved in the operation crashed, killing 155 passengers and crew and seriously reducing the morale of the American staff.Snepp, 304 In addition to the over 2,500 orphans evacuated by Babylift, Operation New Life resulted in the evacuation of over 110,000 Vietnamese refugees. The final evacuation was Operation Frequent Wind which resulted in 7,000 people being evacuated from Saigon by helicopter. =American administration plans for final evacuation= By this time the Ford administration had also begun planning a complete evacuation of the American presence. The planning was complicated by practical, legal, and strategic concerns. The administration was divided on how swift the evacuations should be. The Pentagon sought to evacuate as fast as possible, to avoid the risk of casualties or other accidents. The U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham Martin, was technically the field commander for any evacuation since evacuations are part of the purview of the State Department. Martin drew the ire of many in the Pentagon by wishing to keep the evacuation process as quiet and orderly as possible. His desire for this was to prevent total chaos and to deflect the real possibility of South Vietnamese turning against Americans and to keep all-out bloodshed from occurring. Ford approved a plan between the extremes in which all but 1,250 Americans‚Äîfew enough to be removed in a single day's helicopter airlift‚Äîwould be evacuated quickly; the remaining 1,250 would leave only when the airport was threatened. In between, as many Vietnamese refugees as possible would be flown out.Kissinger, 540-1. American evacuation planning was set against other administration policies. Ford still hoped to gain additional military aid for South Vietnam. Throughout April, he attempted to get Congress behind a proposed appropriation of $722 million, which might allow for the reconstitution of some of the South Vietnamese forces that had been destroyed. Kissinger was opposed to a full-scale evacuation as long as the aid option remained on the table because the removal of American forces would signal a loss of faith in Thi·ªáu and severely weaken him.Snepp, 330. There was also a concern in the administration over whether the use of military forces to support and carry out the evacuation was permitted under the newly passed War Powers Act. Eventually White House lawyers determined that the use of American forces to rescue citizens in an emergency was unlikely to run afoul of the law, but the legality of using military assets to withdraw refugees was unknown.Snepp, 303. =Refugees= While American citizens were generally assured of a simple way to leave the country just by showing up to an evacuation point, South Vietnamese who wanted to leave Saigon before it fell often resorted to independent arrangements. The under-the-table payments required to gain a passport and exit visa jumped sixfold, and the price of seagoing vessels tripled.Snepp, 352. Those who owned property in the city were often forced to sell it at a substantial loss or abandon it altogether; the asking price of one particularly impressive house was cut 75 percent within a two-week period.Brown, 318. American visas were of enormous value, and Vietnamese seeking American sponsors posted advertisements in newspapers. One such ad read: \\"Seeking adoptive parents. Poor diligent students\\" followed by names, birthdates, and identity card numbers.Todd, 311. Political movements and attempts at a negotiated solution As the North Vietnamese chipped away more and more at South Vietnam, internal opposition to President Thi·ªáu continued to accumulate. For instance, in early April, the Senate unanimously voted through a call for new leadership, and some top military commanders were pressing for a coup. In response to this pressure, Thi·ªáu made some changes to his cabinet, and Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m resigned.Snepp, 287 This did little to reduce the opposition to Thi·ªáu. On April 8, a South Vietnamese pilot and communist, Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Trung, bombed the Independence Palace and then flew to a PAVN-controlled airstrip; Thi·ªáu was not hurt.Snepp, 316. Many in the American mission‚ÄîMartin in particular‚Äîalong with some key figures in Washington, believed that negotiations with the communists were still possible, especially if Saigon could stabilize the military situation. Ambassador Martin's hope was that North Vietnam's leaders would be willing to allow a \\"phased withdrawal\\" whereby a gradual departure might be achieved in order to allow helpful locals and all Americans to leave (along with full military withdrawal) over a period of months. Opinions were divided on whether any government headed by Thi·ªáu could effect such a political solution.Snepp, 289. The Provisional Revolutionary Government‚Äôs foreign minister had, on April 2, indicated that the PRG might negotiate with a Saigon government that did not include Thi·ªáu. Thus, even among Thi·ªáu‚Äôs supporters, pressure was growing for his ouster.Snepp, 319 President Thi·ªáu resigned on April 21. His remarks were particularly hard on the Americans, first for forcing South Vietnam to accede to the Paris Peace Accords, second for failing to support South Vietnam afterwards, and all the while asking South Vietnam \\"to do an impossible thing, like filling up the oceans with stones.\\"Todd, 296. The presidency was turned over to Vice President Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng. The view of the North Vietnamese government, broadcast by Radio Hanoi, was that the new regime was merely \\"another puppet regime.\\"Todd, 298. Last days :All times given are Saigon time. =PAVN encirclement= Map showing PAVN encirclement of Saigon On April 27, Saigon was hit by PAVN rockets ‚Äì the first in more than 40 months. With his overtures to the North rebuffed out of hand, Tran resigned on 28 April and was succeeded by General Duong Van Minh. Minh took over a regime that was by this time in a state of utter collapse. However, he had longstanding ties with the Communists, and it was hoped he could negotiate a ceasefire, however Hanoi was in no mood to negotiate. On 28 April PAVN forces fought their way into the outskirts of the city. At the Newport Bridge (), about five kilometres (three miles) from the city centre, the VC seized the Th·∫£o ƒêi·ªÅn area at the eastern end of the bridge and attempted to seize the bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN 12th Airborne Battalion. As Bien Hoa was falling, General Toan fled to Saigon, informing the government that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat.Willbanks, p. 275. At 18:06 on 28 April, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech three A-37 Dragonflies piloted by former Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) pilots, who had defected to the Vietnamese People's Air Force at the fall of Da Nang, dropped six Mk81 250 lb bombs on Tan Son Nhut Air Base damaging aircraft. RVNAF F-5s took off in pursuit, but they were unable to intercept the A-37s. C-130s leaving Tan Son Nhut reported receiving PAVN .51 cal and 37 mm anti-aircraft (AAA) fire while sporadic PAVN rocket and artillery attacks also started to hit the airport and air base., C-130 flights were stopped temporarily after the air attack but resumed at 20:00 on 28 April. At 03:58 on 29 April, C-130E, #72-1297, flown by a crew from the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron, was destroyed by a 122 mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at the base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhat. At dawn on 29 April the RVNAF began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A-37s, F-5s, C-7s, C-119s and C-130s departed for Thailand while UH-1s took off in search of the ships of Task Force 76. Some RVNAF aircraft stayed to continue to fight the advancing PAVN. One AC-119 gunship had spent the night of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching PAVN. At dawn on 29 April two A-1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at until one was shot down, presumably by an SA-7 missile. At 07:00 the AC-119 was firing on PAVN to the east of Tan Son Nhut when it too was hit by an SA-7 and fell in flames to the ground. At 06:00 on April 29, General Dung was ordered by the Politburo to \\"strike with the greatest determination straight into the enemy's final lair.\\"Todd, 347. After one day of bombardment and general offensive, the PAVN were ready to make their final push into the city. At 08:00 on 29 April Lieutenant General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh, commander of the RVNAF and 30 of his staff arrived at the DAO Compound demanding evacuation, signifying the complete loss of RVNAF command and control. =Operation Frequent Wind= A U.S. Marine provides security as American helicopters land at the DAO compound South Vietnamese refugees arrive on a U.S. Navy vessel during Operation Frequent Wind The continuing rocket fire and debris on the runways at Tan Son Nhut caused General Homer D. Smith, the U.S. defense attach√© in Saigon, to advise Ambassador Martin that the runways were unfit for use and that the emergency evacuation of Saigon would need to be completed by helicopter.Smith. Originally, Ambassador Martin had intended to effect the evacuation by use of fixed-wing aircraft from the base. This plan was altered at a critical time when a South Vietnamese pilot decided to defect, and jettisoned his ordnance along the only runways still in use (which had not yet been destroyed by shelling). Under pressure from Kissinger, Martin forced Marine guards to take him to Tan Son Nhat in the midst of continued shelling, so he might personally assess the situation. After seeing that fixed-wing departures were not an option (a decision Martin did not want to make without firsthand responsibility in case the helicopter lift failed), Martin gave the green light for the helicopter evacuation to begin in earnest. Reports came in from the outskirts of the city that the PAVN were closing in.Tanner, 313. At 10:48 a.m., Martin relayed to Kissinger his desire to activate Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter evacuation of US personnel and at-risk Vietnamese.At 10:51 on 29 April, the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Operation Frequent Wind. The American radio station began regular play of Irving Berlin's \\"White Christmas\\", the signal for American personnel to move immediately to the evacuation points.Todd, 353. Under this plan, CH-53 and CH-46 helicopters were used to evacuate Americans and friendly Vietnamese to ships, including the Seventh Fleet, in the South China Sea. The main evacuation point was the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhat; buses moved through the city picking up passengers and driving them out to the airport, with the first buses arriving at Tan Son Nhat shortly after noon. The first CH-53 landed at the DAO compound in the afternoon, and by the evening, 395 Americans and more than 4,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated. By 23:00 the U.S. Marines who were providing security were withdrawing and arranging the demolition of the DAO office, American equipment, files, and cash. Air America UH-1s also participated in the evacuation.Esper, George, \\"Copters Ending Vietnam Era\\", The Washington Star, Washington, D.C., Tuesday April 29, 1975, page A-1. The original evacuation plans had not called for a large-scale helicopter operation at the United States Embassy, Saigon. Helicopters and buses were to shuttle people from the embassy to the DAO Compound. However, in the course of the evacuation it turned out that a few thousand people were stranded at the embassy, including many Vietnamese. Additional Vietnamese civilians gathered outside the embassy and scaled the walls, hoping to claim refugee status. Thunderstorms increased the difficulty of helicopter operations. Nevertheless, the evacuation from the embassy continued more or less unbroken throughout the evening and night. At 03:45 on the morning of April 30, Kissinger and Ford ordered Martin to evacuate only Americans from that point forward. Reluctantly, Martin announced that only Americans were to be flown out, due to worries that the North Vietnamese would soon take the city and the Ford administration's desire to announce the completion of the American evacuation.Todd, 366. Ambassador Martin was ordered by President Ford to board the evacuation helicopter. The call sign of that helicopter was \\"Lady Ace 09\\", and the pilot carried direct orders from President Ford for Ambassador Martin to be on board. The pilot, Gerry Berry, had the orders written in grease- pencil on his kneepads. Ambassador Martin's wife, Dorothy, had already been evacuated by previous flights, and left behind her suitcase so a South Vietnamese woman might be able to squeeze on board with her. \\"Lady Ace 09\\" from HMM-165 and piloted by Berry, took off at 04:58 ‚Äì had Martin refused to leave, the Marines had a reserve order to arrest him and carry him away to ensure his safety.Todd, 367. The embassy evacuation had flown out 978 Americans and about 1,100 Vietnamese. The Marines who had been securing the embassy followed at dawn, with the last aircraft leaving at 07:53. 420 Vietnamese and South Koreans were left behind in the embassy compound, with an additional crowd gathered outside the walls. The Americans and the refugees they flew out were generally allowed to leave without intervention from either the North or South Vietnamese. Pilots of helicopters heading to Tan Son Nhat were aware that PAVN anti-aircraft guns were tracking them, but they refrained from firing. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the evacuation would lessen the risk of American intervention, had instructed D≈©ng not to target the airlift itself.Snepp, 478. Meanwhile, members of the police in Saigon had been promised evacuation in exchange for protecting the American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during the evacuation.Tanner, 314. Although this was the end of the American military operation, Vietnamese continued to leave the country by boat and, where possible, by aircraft. RVNAF pilots who had access to helicopters flew them offshore to the American fleet, where they were able to land. Many RVNAF helicopters were dumped into the ocean to make room on the decks for more aircraft. RVNAF fighters and other planes also sought refuge in Thailand while two O-1s landed on .Todd, 370. Ambassador Martin was flown out to the , where he pleaded for helicopters to return to the embassy compound to pick up the few hundred remaining hopefuls waiting to be evacuated. Many Vietnamese nationals who were evacuated were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. Decades later, when the U.S. government reestablished diplomatic relations with Vietnam, the former embassy building was returned to the United States. The historic staircase that led to the rooftop helicopter pad in the nearby apartment building used by the CIA and other US government employees was salvaged and is on permanent display at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan. =Final assault and capitulation= In the early hours of April 30, Dung received orders from the Politburo to attack. He then ordered his field commanders to advance directly to key facilities and strategic points in the city.Snepp, 551. The first PAVN unit to enter the city was the 324th Division.Snepp, 568. By daybreak, it was obvious that the ARVN's position was untenable. On the morning of 30 April PAVN sappers attempted to seize the Newport Bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN Airborne. At 09:00 the PAVN tank column approached the bridge and came under fire from ARVN tanks which destroyed the lead T-54, killing the PAVN Battalion commander. The ARVN 3rd Task Force, 81st Ranger Group commanded by Major Pham Chau Tai defended Tan Son Nhut and they were joined by the remnants of the Loi Ho unit. At 07:15 on 30 April the PAVN 24th Regiment approached the Bay Hien intersection () 1.5 km from the main gate of Tan Son Nhat Air Base. The lead T-54 was hit by M67 recoilless rifle and then the next T-54 was hit by a shell from an M48 tank. The PAVN infantry moved forward and engaged the ARVN in house to house fighting forcing them to withdraw to the base by 08:45. The PAVN then sent three tanks and an infantry battalion to assault the main gate and they were met by intensive anti-tank and machine gun fire knocking out the three tanks and killing at least twenty PAVN soldiers. The PAVN tried to bring forward an 85mm antiaircraft gun but the ARVN knocked it out before it could start firing. The PAVN 10th Division ordered eight more tanks and another infantry battalion to join the attack, but as they approached the Bay Hien intersection they were hit by an airstrike from RVNAF jets operating from Binh Thuy Air Base which destroyed two T-54s. The six surviving tanks arrived at the main gate at 10:00 and began their attack, with two being knocked out by antitank fire in front of the gate and another destroyed as it attempted a flanking manoeuvre. At 10:24, Minh announced an unconditional surrender. He ordered all ARVN troops \\"to cease hostilities in calm and to stay where they are\\", while inviting the Provisional Revolutionary Government to engage in \\"a ceremony of orderly transfer of power so as to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed in the population.\\"Associated Press, \\"Minh Surrenders, Vietcong In Saigon\\". At approximately 10:30 Major Pham at Tan Son Nhut Air Base heard of the surrender broadcast of President Minh and went to the ARVN Joint General Staff Compound to seek instructions. He called General Minh who told him to prepare to surrender. Pham reportedly told Minh, \\"If Viet Cong tanks are entering Independence Palace we will come down there to rescue you, sir.\\" Minh refused Pham's suggestion and Pham then told his men to withdraw from the base gates. At 11:30 the PAVN entered the base. At Newport Bridge the ARVN and PAVN continued to exchange tank and artillery fire until the ARVN commander received President Minh's capitulation order over the radio. While the bridge was rigged with approximately 4000lbs of demolition charges, the ARVN stood down and at 10:30 the PAVN column crossed the bridge. PAVN T-54/55 tanks under the command of Colonel B√πi T√≠n burst through the gates of the Independence Palace around noon. They found Minh and 30 of his advisors sitting in chairs on the palace steps, waiting for them. As Colonel Tin approached, Minh said \\"The revolution is here. You are here.\\" He added, \\"We have been waiting for you so that we could turn over the government.\\" T√≠n curtly replied, \\"There is no question of your transferring power. Your power has crumbled. You cannot give up what you do not have.\\" Later that afternoon, Minh went on the radio for the final time and announced, \\"I declare [that] the Saigon government is completely dissolved at all levels.\\" The Vietnam War was over. Aftermath =Turnover of Saigon= Victory parade, 7 May 1975 The communists renamed the city after Ho Chi Minh, former President of North Vietnam, although this name was not frequently used outside official business.Dawson, 351. Order was slowly restored, although the by-then-deserted U.S. Embassy was looted, along with many other businesses. Communications between the outside world and Saigon were cut. The Viet Cong machinery in South Vietnam was weakened, owing in part to the Phoenix Program, so the PAVN was responsible for maintaining order and General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Tr√†, Dung's administrative deputy, was placed in charge of the city. The new authorities held a victory rally on May 7.Dawson, xvi. One objective of the Communist Party of Vietnam was to reduce the population of Saigon, which had become swollen with an influx of people during the war and was now overcrowded with high unemployment. \\"Re-education classes\\" for former soldiers in the ARVN indicated that in order to regain full standing in society they would need to move from the city and take up farming. Handouts of rice to the poor, while forthcoming, were tied to pledges to leave Saigon for the countryside. According to the Vietnamese government, within two years of the capture of the city one million people had left Saigon, and the state had a target of 500,000 further departures. Following the end of the war, according to official and non-official estimates, between 200,000 and 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to re-education camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while they were being forced to do hard labor. =The evacuation= Whether the evacuation had been successful or not has been questioned following the end of the war. Operation Frequent Wind was generally assessed as an impressive achievement ‚Äì VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng stated this in his memoirs and The New York Times described it as being carried out with \\"efficiency and bravery\\".New York Times, \\"The Americans Depart\\" On the other hand, the airlift was also criticized for being too slow and hesitant, and it was inadequate in removing Vietnamese civilians and soldiers who were connected with the American presence. The U.S. State Department estimated that the Vietnamese employees of the U.S. Embassy in South Vietnam, past and present, and their families totaled 90,000 people. In his testimony to Congress, Ambassador Martin asserted that 22,294 such people were evacuated by the end of April.Snepp, 565. In 1977, National Review alleged that some 30,000 South Vietnamese had been systematically killed using a list of CIA informants left behind by the US embassy.Le Thi Anh, \\"The New Vietnam\\", National Review, April 29, 1977. \\"According to Frank Snepp, a CIA analyst who served in Saigon, the American Embassy was not able to destroy its top-secret files during the frantic evacuation, and among the information that fell into Communist hands was a list of 30,000 Vietnamese who had worked in the Phoenix Program, a U.S.-sponsored operation responsible for the elimination of thousands of Communist agents. A full report on the massacre of those 30,000 Phoenix cadres is said to have reached the desk of the French ambassador to Saigon by late 1975; he communicated it to Washington, where nothing was done with it.\\" Commemoration April 30 is celebrated as a public holiday in Vietnam as Reunification Day (though the official reunification of the nation actually occurred on 2 July 1976) or Liberation Day (Ng√†y Gi·∫£i Ph√≥ng). Along with International Workers' Day on May 1, most people take the day off work and there are public celebrations. Among overseas Vietnamese the week of April 30 is referred to as \\"Black April\\" and it is also commemorated as a time of lamentation for the fall of Saigon and the fall of South Vietnam as a whole.

E. Farndale, The Secret of Mow Cop, Epworth Press, London, 1950. The denomination emerged from a revival at Mow Cop in Staffordshire. Primitive meant \\"simple\\" or \\"relating to an original stage\\"; the Primitive Methodists saw themselves as practising a purer form of Christianity, closer to the earliest Methodists. Characteristics Primitive Methodists were characterised by the relatively plain design of their chapels and their low church worship, compared to the Wesleyan Methodist Church, from which they had split. Its social base was among the poorer members of society, who appreciated both its content (damnation, salvation, sinners and saints) and its style (direct, spontaneous, and passionate). It was democratic and locally controlled and offered an alternative to the more middle-class Wesleyan Methodists and the establishment-controlled Church of England, which were not at all democratic in governance. Even so, it was too formal for some adherents, who moved on to Pentecostalism.J. E. Minor, \\"The Mantle of Elijah: Nineteenth-century Primitive Methodism and Twentieth-century Pentecostalism.\\" Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society London (1982), 43#6-1, pp. 141‚Äì149. Growth was strong in the mid-19th century. Membership declined after 1900 because of growing secularism in society, competition from other Nonconformist denominations such as William Booth's Salvation Army, a resurgence of Anglicanism among the working classes, and competition among various Methodist bodies.Gerald T. Rimmington, \\"Methodism and society in Leicester, 1881‚Äì1914,\\" Local Historian (2000) 30#2, pp. 74‚Äì87. Gradually the differences between the Primitive Methodists and the Wesleyans became smaller, and the two denominations eventually merged, together with the United Methodists, to become the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932. In the United States, the Primitive Methodist Church has continued to this day, and some individual British Methodist churches also retain their Primitive traditions. Origins A drawing of Hugh Bourne, one of the early Primitive Methodist leaders Lorenzo Dow preaching, engraving by Lossing-Barrett, 1856 Primitive Methodism originated in \\"Camp Meetings\\" held in the area of The PotteriesInformation on the Potteries at Mow Cop's relationship to primitive Methodism can be found at http://www.thepotteries.org/chapel/009.htm at Mow Cop, Staffordshire, on 31 May 1807. This led, in 1811, to the joining together of two groups, the 'Camp Meeting Methodists' and the Clowesites led by Hugh Bourne and William Clowes, respectively. The movement was spawned from the followers of these men. Bourne and Clowes were charismatic evangelists. Both had reputations for zeal and were sympathetic to ideas the Wesleyan Connexion condemned. Their belief that was most unacceptable to the Wesleyan Connexion was their support for so-called camp meetings. These were day-long, open air meetings involving public praying, preaching and Love Feasts. Clowes was a first-generation Methodist convert‚Äîat the age of 25 he renounced his desire to be the finest dancer in England. The movement was also influenced by the backgrounds of the two men: Clowes had worked as a potter while Bourne had been a wheelwright. Both of them had been expelled from the Wesleyan Connexion‚ÄîBourne in 1808, and Clowes in 1810. The reason given for Clowes' expulsion was that he had behaved \\"contrary to the Methodist discipline\\" and therefore \\"that he could not be either a preacher or leader unless he promised to attend no more Camp Meetings\\".Joseph Ritson, The Romance of Primitive Methodism, Edwin Dalton, Primitive Methodist Publishing House, London, 1909, p. 86. It seems likely that this was not the only concern regarding the pair. Bourne's association with the American evangelist Lorenzo Dow would have put him in a dim light with Wesleyan leaders. The Wesleyan leadership's hostility to Dow is demonstrated by a threat Dow received from prominent Wesleyan Thomas Coke (twice president of the Conference, in 1797 and 1805) on Dow's arrival in London around 1799. Coke threatened to \\"write to Lord Castlereagh to inform him who and what you are, [and] that we disown you,... then you'll be arrested and committed to prison\\". The Wesleyan Connexion was also concerned about Bourne and Clowes' association with the \\"Magic Methodists\\" or \\"Forest Methodists\\" led by James Crawfoot, the \\"old man of Delamere Forest\\". Crawfoot was significant to both Bourne and Clowes and was for a time their spiritual mentor. He held prayer meetings where people had visions and fell into trances. Crawfoot, according to Owen Davies, had developed a reputation for possessing supernatural powers. Indeed, Henry Wedgwood, writing later in the century, recalled that many locals at the time were terrified of the magical powers of an innkeeper called Zechariah Baddeley, but that they considered Baddeley's powers nothing next to Crawfoot's prayers and preaching. The enthusiasm associated with revivalism was seen as disreputable by the early 19th century establishment. In 1799, the Bishop of Lincoln claimed that the \\"ranter\\" element of Methodism was so dangerous that the government must ban itinerancy. Men like Bourne and Clowes were not educated, and their preaching and mass conversion was felt as threatening. The Wesleyan Methodists, such as Coke, wanted to distance themselves from such populism. The death of John Wesley removed a restraining influence on popular Methodism: there was no obvious leader or authority, and power was invested in the Wesleyan Conference. The Wesleyans formally split from the Church of England, which led them to greater organisation and self-definition, and the leadership could now withhold the tickets of members like Bourne and Clowes who did not behave in the way expected by the Conference. The result was less tolerance for internal dissent, and a weakening of the movement's leadership. The Camp Meeting Methodists looked back to the early days of the Methodist movement and considered that field preaching was acceptable.John Edwards, Peter Gentry and Roger Thorne, A Methodist Guide to Bristol and the South-West, Methodist Publishing House, 1991. . Page 9: \\"Here Kingswood Methodist missionary work began. On his first day in Bristol, Sunday April 1st 1739, Wesley went with George Whitefield to Hanham Mount and heard his friend preach to the miners. A week later he preached there himself ...\\"John Wesley's Journal: Abridged Edition, London, 1903 pp. 65‚Äì66: \\"I could scarce reconcile myself at first to this strange way of preaching in the fields, of which he set me an example on Sunday; having been all my life (till very lately) so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin, if it had not been done in church.\\" Despite their exclusion from the Connexion, Clowes and Bourne and the assistants who appeared to help them became involved in a task which The Romance of Primitive Methodism saw as a work of primary evangelisation.Ritson, op. cit., p. 99: \\"The pioneers of Primitive Methodism were to an extraordinary degree inspired with the passion of Divine love, and made ceaseless war upon the kingdom of darkness.\\" The same book also regards the Primitive Methodist denomination as an independent growth rather than as an offshoot of mainstream Methodism.Ritson, op. cit., p. 89: \\"If it has been our glory, it was at the outset also our salvation, that we did not originate in a secession.\\" Methodist response to the political situation The leadership of the newly formed Methodist Church was made particularly sensitive to criticism by international events. Britain had been involved in almost perpetual war with France since 1793. A succession of defeats to allies and the threat of the 'Continental System' increased tension at home. The establishment faced an alarming threat in the shape of the revolutionary anti-monarchical beliefs of the French government. The war and the French Revolution encouraged a fear of a rebellion in Britain. The repressive laws enacted by the second Pitt ministry came from fear of internal dissent. In this atmosphere the Methodist leadership feared repression and strove to avoid antagonising the government. The Methodist movement challenged the Church of England‚Äîan institution widely regarded as a bulwark of national stability. As Hugh McLeod highlights, Methodist members and preachers could be outspoken in their criticism of the Church of England. The movement grew rapidly, especially amongst the expanding working classes. The combination of rapid growth, popular appeal, and enthusiasm alarmed many. Fear of the Methodist membership seems to have been shared to an extent by the Wesleyan leadership. Dr Coke even suggested he would not be surprised if, \\"in a few years some of our people, warmest in politics and coolest in religion, would toast‚Ä¶ a bloody summer and a headless king.\\" The leadership reacted to criticism and their own fears by introducing further discipline. They expelled the prominent Alexander Kilham in 1795, and one year later they forbade any itinerant from any publishing without the sanction of the newly created book committee. From 1805 the use of hymnals not issued by the Book Room was banned, and in 1807 Camp Meetings were condemned. Through discipline they hoped they could evade the tarnish of disloyalty. The leadership reacted badly to Lorenzo Dow, and Bourne's association with him. Dow was a republican and a millenarian. He made wild anti-establishment speeches and did not distinguish between religion and politics. In a tract of 1812, he preached that \\"May not the 'Seventh Trumpet' now be sounding, and the 'seven last plagues' be pouring out?\\" Dow accused the British government of being tyrannical and repugnant to God's laws of nature. As a separate church, conscious of their own public image and fearing repression, they felt they had to disassociate themselves from him. The Wesleyan leadership's measures to evade repression led to the imposition of greater internal discipline. Members who were seen as a liability were expelled. Views that were anti-establishment were condemned. Wesleyan propaganda The Wesleyan leadership did not undertake to improve their reputation with discipline alone. Through propaganda they capitalised on the greater level of discipline in an attempt to reform their image. Hempton claims the Methodists used propaganda to project an industrious and well disposed image. The Methodist Magazine was utilised to print supportive tracts about the monarchy, praising the King's wariness of reformers. The movement was portrayed as a conservative force; the leadership claiming Methodism promoted \\"subordination and industry in the lower orders.\\" While promoting this image of Methodists, the Wesleyan leadership also moved to escape old slurs. One obstacle to Methodist respectability was their association with ignorance and superstition. The leadership tried to shake off this reputation. In Wales, 1801, they warned their members against involvement in sorcery, magic, and witchcraft, and in 1816 fifty members of the Portland Methodist Society were struck off for maintaining belief in the supernatural. Not only does this demonstrate that the Wesleyan transition to denominational conservatism resulted in less toleration for alternate beliefs; it also demonstrates that there was less toleration for non-bourgeois beliefs. This illustrates why the association of Bourne and Clowes with Crawfoot was unacceptable to the leadership. It also suggests a gulf between the outlook of the Wesleyan leadership and the Methodist rank and file. Disillusion with Wesleyan leaders There was a level of disillusionment with the Wesleyan leadership. There was a level of dissatisfaction with the leadership's conservatism and with their financial policies. The reaction of the Yorkshire membership to the leadership's support of the government after Peterloo is illustrated by the rumour that the Wesleyan leadership had \\"lent the government half a million of money to buy cannon to shoot them with\\". When a local preacher in North Shields criticised the actions of the magistrates at Peterloo, he faced criticism from itinerants and 'respectable friends.' The leadership judged however, that they could not afford to expel this preacher because of the support he commanded locally. This incident demonstrated that the leadership was not representing the interests and views of some Methodists. The leadership's policies frequently did not favour poorer Methodists. The leadership introduced numerous measures to raise money. They introduced weekly and quarterly dues, yearly collections, the payment of class and ticket money, and seat rents. These fees bore severely on the poor during the war years, and in the depression that followed. They also opened a gulf between richer and poorer members. Seat rents marginalised a chapel's poor, while exalting the rich. The poor were often relegated to the least popular part of the chapel, and implicitly their involvement was devalued. One of the earliest chapels was at Walpole Old Chapel, Suffolk. Attendance at the chapel, which had once been a means of pride in the face of social superiors, now reinforced their inferiority. Likewise such developments led to the disillusionment of rural Methodists. The poor contributions of many rural societies to the Connexional funds resulted in pastoral neglect. Illustrative of the disillusionment of many, a pamphleteer in 1814 said \\"You complain the preachers never call to see you unless you are great folks... Well you may see the reason; you can do nothing for them; money they want and money they must and will have\\". The disillusionment of many Methodists with the leadership of the Wesleyan Conference increased the possibility of schism. What was at stake The crucial factor was that these events occurred at a time when the movement had more to lose than ever before. Following their exit from the Church of England, chapel building and a larger ministry became a necessity. In addition to this the Connexion invested in schools, pension funds, and foreign missions. Also, through hard work and clean living, many Methodists had increased their wealth and owned property. All of this could be lost to a fearful wartime government or a baying mob. The Wesleyan \\"clergy\\" derived their income from the Church and had a vested interest in ensuring a conservative policy. It was easier for men from the lower sorts, artisans like Bourne and Clowes,Bourne was a successful businessman (a carpenter whose contacts included supplying pit-props for local coal mines) and Clowes was a master potter, who had worked his way up from working in potteries as a young boy and married into the Wedgwood family. They both had considerable education, though not at university like John Wesley, but rather through their own hard work earning a living. Did they have less to lose? What counted for them was a sense of the call of God to continue the evangelistic work of John Wesley. In taking the name \\"Primitive Methodist\\" the Prims looked back to the original and unspoiled Christianity of both John Wesley and (Wesley's reference) of the Book of Acts. In contrast to the academic treatises on Primitive Methodism which the bulk of this article reflects, original Primitive Methodist sources including the definitive histories by Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, early biographies of Hugh Bourne such as that by Jesse Ashworth from personal acquaintance, and Joseph Ritson's classic The Romance of Primitive Methodism present a picture of a vibrant movement which the establishment was unwilling to entertain. This was due in part to weariness of persecutions during the 18th century, as well as political upheavals following the French Revolution and various wars in which Britain was engaged. In fact, Bourne was very much concerned that things be done decently and in order, and worked hard to build up the official (Wesleyan) Methodist Circuit of which he had once been a member. He had founded and built at least one Chapel, largely at his own expense, given to the Circuit. It was the issue of Camp Meetings, which Bourne and his companions saw to be clearly blessed by God, that led to their expulsion from membership. They had not sought to found a new and separate denomination. to put revivalism ahead of expediency. They had less to lose. The Primitive Methodist movement can therefore be said to have started in reaction to the Wesleyan drive towards respectability and denominationalism. It was a movement led by the poor and for the poor. Similarities to the Wesleyans and differences from them Perceived irreconcilable differences led to the schism of the Methodists movement and the formation of Primitive Methodism. In the early 20th century, however, the Wesleyans and Primitives were reconciled and reunited. The structure of the Primitive Methodists, though superficially broadly similar to the Wesleyan Connexion, also showed some pronounced differences. Both Primitives and Wesleyans employed a connexion system, employing a combination of itinerant and local preachers. Both their organisations included an array of local, circuit, district, and connexion officials and committees. According to James Obelkevich, Primitive Methodism was more decentralised and democratic. Julia Werner concurs that the movement was decentralised. Most decisions and day-to- day policy were decided at a local level. The circuits were virtually autonomous and their administration was not dominated by church officials, but by the laity. The expansion of the movement, through the commissioning of new missions, was directed by individuals or circuits, and not by a central authority. Decisions affecting the whole movement were taken at the annual meetings. Even these meetings were highly democratic, with the laity outnumbering the itinerants in voting power. The \\"church\\" could not dictate policy to its members. Compare the expulsions of Kilham from the Wesleyans (1795) and an outspoken \\"malcontent\\" from the Primitive Methodists (1824). While Bourne had to engage in a long and difficult argument before winning a vote, Dr Coke rejected a democratic decision-making process. In the early years of Primitive Methodism the membership had considerable power and freedom. Primitive Methodist preachers and communities differed from their Wesleyan counterparts. Although the Wesleyans tended towards respectability, Primitives were poor and revivalist. According to J. E. Minor, Primitive Methodist preachers were less educated and more likely \\"to be at one with their congregations\\" or even \\"dominated by them\\". Primitive Methodist preachers were plain speaking in contrast to Wesleyan services \\"embellished with literary allusions and delivered in high-flown language\\". Primitive Methodist preachers were plainly dressed and poorly paid. Though Wesleyan ministers in 1815 could command about ¬£100, a house and a horse, the Primitive Methodist superintendent of the Gainsborough circuit received ¬£62 12s in 1852. The second minister at the Gainsborough circuit received ¬£36, about as much a farm labourer. If Primitive Methodist preachers did not have enough money they were expected to turn to the Lord for support. There was also a disparity between the wealth of their congregations. The Wesleyan congregations were more likely to be from a lower middle class, or artisan, background than the Primitive Methodists. Primitive Methodists were most likely to be small farmers, servants, mill workers, colliers, agricultural labourers, weavers and framework knitters. The Primitive Methodist movement exalted its poor congregations by glorifying plain dress and speech. They promoted it for two reasons. Firstly they thought plain dress was enjoined by the Gospel and secondly because it made them distinctive. In a time when Wesleyans sought assimilation and respectability, they wanted to stand out as a \\"peculiar people\\". The Primitive Methodist movement made a virtue out of their difference. =Preaching and revivalism= The Primitives were more likely to go against society's norms. The Primitive Methodist maintenance of revivalism is indicative of this. They were visible and noisy; they made use of revivalist techniques such as open air preaching. Their services were conducted with a fanatical zeal that the Wesleyan leadership would have found embarrassing. The hymns they sang were heavily influenced by popular culture and not considered respectable.For a history of the hymns see introduction to The Primitive Methodist Hymnal 1890. They were often sung to popular tunes and they were full of references to Heaven as a place of opulence. As Werner comments, their hymns were a contrast to the \\"more staid hymns sung in Wesleyan chapels\\". All their members were considered equal and were addressed as brother or sister; even children were able to participate fully. Many children actually became preachers, for instance boy preachers such as Thomas Brownsword, Robinson Cheeseman and John Skevington. There were also many girl preachers, such as Elizabeth White and Martha Green, who preached as 15-year- olds. The Wesleyan Conference condemned female ministry in 1803, so effectively closed its doors to female preaching. Women were limited to working in Sunday Schools and speaking at \\"Dorcas Meetings\\". By contrast, Primitive Methodism allowed the poor, the young, and women to gain public influence. The Primitive Methodists were more receptive to the views of such people, and as a consequence took a different line on the supernatural. Wesleyans were trying hard to distance themselves from superstition, and superstitious popular culture. The Primitive Methodists engaged with popular beliefs in their presentation of God as one whose powers could be called upon by preachers. Examples of this can be found in the Primitive Methodist Magazine. For instance the December edition from 1824 contains an anecdote of a cripple being healed through her conversion to Primitive Methodism. Likewise the November edition from the same year contains a chapter on \\"raising the dead\\" (V) under the title A Treatise on the Cultivation of the Spiritual Gifts. Primitive Methodists saw the Lord's work in everything. The Primitive Methodist Magazine of 1821 asserting that the movement had begun \\"undesigned of man\\" and was an example of \\"Divine Providence\\". The magazine continues to reveal further examples of God's power and favour towards them. A man who set out against the Primitive Methodists was struck down by illness, and a preacher who became lost and stranded was saved when the Lord sent people to find him. The leadership clearly believed in what many at the time would have derided as popular superstition. For example, Clowes claimed to have fought with the Kidsgrove Boggart as a young man and Bourne believed in witches. About a woman he met at Ramsor, Bourne wrote, \\"I believe she will prove to be a witch. These are the head labourers under Satan, like as the fathers are the head labourers under Jesus Christ.... For the witches throughout the world all meet and have connection with the power devil\\". The magazine finds the exaltations of the laity to be one of the most important happenings at the Camp Meetings. For instance, it reports that at Sheshnall 1826, one woman fell to the ground under the purifying power of the Lord, while another cried aloud. =Common factors= The Primitive and the Wesleyan Methodists had much in common. They were both initially very anti-Catholic. Their social background was not completely different. There were many poor Wesleyans. It was in influence that middle-class Wesleyans dominated the movement, not in numbers. Many Wesleyans did not agree or abide by official policy. Many were sympathetic to revivalism and popular culture. The existence of an alternative sect, Primitive Methodism, did not end dissent. In official policy and outlook the two movements had much in common. They both centred their teaching on the Bible and shared a similar outlook on society and morality. The Primitives were more radical than the Wesleyan Methodists. Armstrong claims, Thomas Cooper found the Primitive Methodists \\"demurred to [his] reading any book but the Bible, unless it was a truly religious book\\". Likewise, both the Primitive and Wesleyan Methodists wanted to reform popular behaviour. Again the Primitives were more radical than the Wesleyans and less in keeping with bourgeois correctness. Bourne was not just in favour of temperance, he disagreed with alcohol altogether and thought of himself as the father of the teetotal movement. The Primitive Methodists were a religion of popular culture. While the Wesleyans attempted to impose elements of middle-class culture on the lower classes, Primitive Methodists offered an alternate popular culture. They timed their activities to coincide with sinful events. For instance, as an alternative to the race week at Preston they organised a Sunday School children's parade and a \\"frugal feast\\". Both tried to inculcate the doctrine of self-help into the working class. They promoted education through Sunday Schools, though the Primitives distinguished themselves by teaching writing. Through a combination of discipline, preaching and education both Primitive and Wesleyan Methodism sought to reform their members morality. By 1850 the Primitives and Wesleyans were showing signs that they could surmount their differences. Primitive Methodism was mellowing. It was less distinctively non-middle-class by 1850 and more in keeping with social norms. Less emphasis was placed on the supernatural. In 1828 Bourne said of trances, \\"This thing still occasionally breaks out. It is a subject at present not well understood and which requires to be peculiarly guarded against impropriety and imposture.\\" Hymns about hell were sung less frequently and the Providence section of the Primitive Methodist Magazine declined in importance and was dropped altogether in 1862. The revivalist enthusiasm of the Primitive leadership dimmed. Even Clowes once an ardent enthusiast became, \\"convinced that religion does not consist in bodily movements, whether shouting, jumping, falling, or standing.\\" The Primitives became less ardent in their support of the female right to ecclesiastical equality. In 1828 women were forbidden from becoming superintendents, and in mid-century there ceased to be biographies eulogising female preachers in the Methodist Magazine. Elizabeth Bultitude, the last of the women roving preachers died in 1890.Preaching changed considerably. Services became characterised by their decorum and the ministry was increasingly professional. The dress code was dropped in 1828 and preaching became more urban based. The community's values were more in line with middle-class respectability: Parkinson Milson reported that local preachers and class leaders were offended at his plain speech. =Convergence begins= In the 1820s the Primitive Methodists were showing signs of increased conformity. At the same time the Wesleyan Methodists were relaxing their opposition to revivalism. In 1820 the Conference permitted an altered form of camp meeting but gave it a different name. Wesleyan preachers adopted door-to-door techniques and in 1822 there were numerous open air meetings. The official Wesleyan attitude was not only softening in regard to Primitive Methodist revivalist techniques. It was also softening in regard to the Primitive Methodist promotion of non-worldliness. The Methodist Magazine printed a series of articles \\"On the Character of the Early Methodists\\". The magazine praised their \\"plain dress\\" and \\"simplicity of manners\\". This represented an attempt to re-engage with the poor. By 1850, both Primitive and Wesleyan Methodists were finding that their differences were less significant and passionate. In 1864 the Primitives established Elmfield College in York. The Primitives were becoming more like the Wesleyan Methodists. The same forces that promoted schism in Wesleyan Methodism operated on Primitive Methodism. Their leaders became more conservative as they got older. They showed signs of moving away from revivalism and of an intent to impose greater discipline on the membership. They experienced some schisms in the 1820s. These Primitive Methodist troubles were blamed on the admission of \\"improper\\" preachers and \\"questionable characters\\". The sentiment of this explanation is similar to Bunting's comments that \\"schism from the body will be a less evil than schism in it.\\" The problems in the 1820s were often related to money matters. A decision by the conference of 1826 to impose tighter financial discipline on the circuits led to an exodus of members and thirty itinerants. The movement became more geared towards consolidation through greater organisation. In 1821 preachers were called upon to record their activities and in 1822 a preachers' manual was published. Preachers now had guidelines, an element of accountability had been introduced, and the leadership had asserted that the connexional accounts had priority over spreading the word. Bible A leading theologian of the Primitive Methodists was Arthur Peake, Professor of Biblical Criticism at University of Manchester, 1904‚Äì1929. He popularized modern biblical scholarship, including the new \\"higher criticism\\". He approached the Bible not as the infallible word of God, but as the record of revelation written by fallible humans.Timothy Laursen, \\"A. S. Peake, the Free Churches and modern biblical criticism\\". Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester (2004) 86#3 pp. 23‚Äì53. Organisation and conferences In Scotland the Primitive Methodists were poorly funded and had trouble building churches and supporting ministers.Margaret Batty, \\"Primitive Methodism in Scotland 1826‚Äì1932\\", Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society 55 (2006), pp. 237‚Äì251. Organisationally, the Prims followed many Wesleyan precedents, including grouping local societies into Circuits, and from 1824, grouping Circuits into Districts. By 1824 there were 72 Circuits and four Districts ‚Äî Tunstall, Nottingham, Hull, and Sunderland. From 1820, the Primitive Methodists held an annual conference, which was nominally the church's ultimate legal authority. However, from 1843 to 1876 the District Meetings grew in power and popularity at the expense of Conference (Lysons: 22 and ch. 4).

It is centred around Yonge Street and York Mills Road located in the district of North York. In 2010, it encompassed the fourth and seventh most affluent postal codes in Canada.Canada's Richest Postal Codes It is recognized as a millionaires' mile, alongside the other Toronto neighbourhoods of The Bridlepath, Forest Hill, Lawrence Park, and Rosedale. Part of the area is also known as Hoggs Hollow, named for James Hogg, a Scottish settler who settled in the area in 1824 and operated the mill on Yonge Street at the Don River north of the Town of York (now Toronto), by his sons John and William in 1856. Another portion is named St. Andrew-Windfields. St. Andrew-Windfields most famous resident was the popular Canadian Philanthropist E. P. Taylor who left Canada towards the latter years of his life and donated Parkland (now Windfields Park) and his mansion (now the Canadian Film Centre). History The area name is linked to saw and grist mills that dotted the Don River, which flows through York Mills. The Town of York Mills became part of the Township of North York. TTC's North Yonge Railways line in York Mills, 1936. The area once linked by radial railways (Metropolitan line and the successor North Yonge Railways) and Highway 11, now can be reached via Highway 401, GO Transit, and Toronto Transit Commission buses and York Mills station on the Yonge-University Spadina subway line. In 1953, York Mills, along with North York, was severed from York County, joining other municipalities to form the regional government of Metropolitan Toronto. The area was the site of a tragic accident on March 17, 1960, when five Italian construction workers on a water main project were killed in a tunnel fire. North York later became a borough, and then a city, and was merged with five other municipalities and a regional government to form the new \\"City of Toronto\\" in 1998. Today, the area is home to luxury condos and high-end homes. Houses in York Mills are highly distinguishable and contribute greatly to the proclaimed affluence of the neighbourhood. 50% of occupied dwellings are single detached houses. Many have been rebuilt and customized to taste, with heavily renovated front yards. In between 2001 and 2006, property values have increased by 47.6%.Statistics Canada Census, 2006 The second type of most occupied dwelling is apartments reaching five or more storeys, inhabited by 28% of the population.Statistics Canada Census, 2006 The average price for condominiums in the area ranges from C$800,000 to C$3,000,000, while the average price of a detached home is just above C$4,000,000. Geography The Toronto ravine system is prominently featured in the neighbourhood. From Yonge Street eastward, the roads slope upward but plateau as they reach Bayview Avenue. The natural environment is also highly integrated into the neighbourhood, with development seeming to build around it. The presence of greenery is a protected and distinguishable feature of York Mills. =Man-made environment= South of York Mills Road and Yonge Street sits the sub-neighbourhood of Hoggs Hollow. Houses in this residential area are embedded into the natural landscape, which ascends southward. The directional slope and other natural features serve as identifiable landmarks, edges, and paths, making this area highly legible in terms of a Lynchian analysis. The area has more community-oriented characteristics that make it distinct from the rest of York Mills. Most notably, residents manage a community board located in the centre of this sub-neighbourhood. York Mills Centre is the tallest commercial building in the neighbourhood. As York Mills is a mainly residential neighbourhood, commercial activity occurs strictly at intersections of major arterials. At Yonge Street and York Mills Road, the tallest commercial building in the neighbourhood, York Mills Centre, holds large office and retail spaces, occupied most notably by the human resources services supplier, Randstad Interim. The York Mills Shopping Centre at the intersection of York Mills Road and Bayview Avenue, provides local groceries through the Metro supermarket, Shoppers Drug Mart, and local meat shop. It is set back from the roads by a large parking lot, consistent with the neighbourhoods dependency on automobiles. Along York Mills Road in between major intersections, there are only single detached houses. The pedestrian paths are very close to roads. Residential area here leaves no space for any commercial opportunities, thus commercial nodes are only available at the intersection of major arterial roads. There is very little public space. Properly maintained parks are often playgrounds for children. Actual parks do not properly serve the public as well with its lack of seating and walkways, which discourages overall usage. Free parking compared to the high hourly rates of the rest of Toronto points to space in York Mills as being an inexpensive commodity, yet there is very little space actually available for development. The current Official Plan does not provide for the anticipation of future development., Toronto Official Plan Landmarks Built in 1857, Miller Tavern is a local landmark in York Mills. Points of interest in York Mills: * Don Valley Golf Course * George S. Pratt House * Miller Tavern * St.John's Anglican Church * William and Elizabeth Harrison House * Windfields Park * York Mills Shopping Centre Education Two public school boards operate schools in York Mills, the English-first language Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the French-first language Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV). √âcole secondaire √âtienne-Br√ªl√© is one of two public secondary schools located in York Mills. TDSB also operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, York Mills Collegiate Institute. TDSB also operate six schools that provide primary education. They include: * Dunlace Public School * Harrison Public School * Owen Public School * Rippleton Public School * St. Andrew's Middle School * Windfield Middle School CSV operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, √âcole secondaire √âtienne-Br√ªl√©. They do not operate an elementary school in the neighbourhood, with CSV elementary students residing in York Mills, attending schools in other neighbourhood. The separate school boards for the City of Toronto, the English-based Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the French-based Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM) also offer schooling to residents of York Mills, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/TCDSB students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. Transportation York Mills station is a subway station in York Mills. As a result of the man-made environment, large lots, and sprawled out nodes of commercial activity, the neighbourhood is highly reliant on the automobile for everyday activities, with approximately two thirds of the York Mills population using it as a primary mode of transportation . Having Highway 401 in such close proximity adds to the benefits of owning a car, as the degree of mobility to the rest of Toronto greatly increases. Public transit is reported to be less than a quarter of the population's primary method of commute.Statistics Canada Census, 2006 Deeper in the residential areas, pedestrian walkways are often only found on one side of the road. As much of the land surrounding the major arterials are claimed by private residences, there is no room to develop along pedestrian paths and make walking a more appealing option. The combined effect of this lack of appeal, poor infrastructural maintenance, and extended distance in between points of interests justify the populations' avoidance of walking, with a mere three percent of the population claim walking as their primary mode of commute.Statistics Canada Census, 2006 York Mills is an example of a neighbourhood stuck within the cycle of auto-dependency. Public transportation is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Services provided TTC include Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity of the Toronto subway, and several bus routes. The TTC operates one subway station in the neighbourhood, York Mills station. Oriole GO Station is also situated in the northeast of the neighbourhood, providing access to GO Transit's regional commuter railway.

It consists of the area surrounding the intersection of Albion Road and Islington Avenue in the former City of Etobicoke. (Etobicoke merged with five other municipalities and a regional government to form the new City of Toronto in 1998.) The borders of Thistletown are generally delineated by the Humber River: the West Branch to the south, slightly beyond the river to the east, and to the William Osler Health Centre - Etobicoke General Hospital just above the river in the north. The western border is Kipling Avenue, though the part of the neighbourhood west of Islington is sometimes considered a separate area named Beaumonde Heights. This area has seen many changes and many ethnic groups arrive and flourish. Presently the corners of Albion and Islington in Thistletown has a large presence of East Indian stores and services. They are joined by a variety of Caribbean/West Indian, Indian, Sri Lankan, and Pakistani stores. 43% of those living in this area, more specifically the CT-0250.05 are of South Asian origin, with those of Afro-Caribbean origin making up 22%. One landmark is the Franklin Carmichael Art Group at 34 Riverdale Drive, is named for Group of Seven member Franklin Carmichael by an art foundation founded by his widow and Dr. Ann Curtin. History John Grubb built his home in Thistletown in 1832. The village of Thistletown (originally called St Andrew's) was planned for John Grubb (1783-1850) in 1847 around the intersection of Albion Road and Islington Avenue. Grubb migrated from Scotland to Etobicoke in 1833. The property was part of John Grubb's farmlands. Grubb was a promoter of the Albion and the Weston plank toll road companies, an elected member of the Home District Council and a magistrate. Although originally known as St. Andrew's (likely to honour his Scottish roots after the Patron Saint of Scotland), Thistletown was renamed in honour of Dr. William Thistle, the local physician. In 1933 Thistletown became a Police village and 2 trustees were elected. In the late 1950s development from the expanding city of Toronto reached Thistletown when a subdivision, Albion Gardens, was developed on local potato farm to the north and east of Albion Road.

It was founded in 1914 through the efforts of a group of 25 sailing and ice-boating enthusiasts. The club is a member of the Detroit Regional Yacht-racing Association (DRYA). The clubhouse is prominently visible and a well-known landmark along the shoreline of the lake north of Detroit. History The Mediterranean Revival clubhouse was conceptualized by Boston architect Guy Lowell, who was commissioned in the 1920s to design the building. Tragically, Lowell died at sea before his plans were fully developed, but his concept of the clubhouse combining pale stucco walls and terracotta tiles, topped by a 187-foot steeple, was posthumously adopted for the club. The bell tower also serves as a navigational aid for boaters on the lake. The clubhouse officially opened on July 4, 1929, virtually on the eve of the Great Depression. The club was able to survive the depression and the Second World War, and it later saw a series of upgrades and enhancements to the premises that included an expanded kitchen, updated dining rooms, new recreational facilities, a modernized harbor, and a swimming pool. In 1997, the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club was accorded the ultimate honor of being named the \\"Number One Yacht Club in America\\" in a national survey of professional club managers. Clubhouse The 131' UNITY leaving the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club harbor in 2009 Upon entering the club a 50-foot foyer leads to a rotunda which leads to points throughout the club. A bronze sculpture of Wheeler Williams, entitled \\"Rhythm of the Waves\\", is a prominent feature. Amenities of the club, besides the marina itself, include a bowling alley that is open from September until May, an Olympic-size pool, several clay tennis courts, two lighted paddle tennis courts and a sailing center. The club includes 3 restaurants, a main ballroom, four bars, a pool deck and Wine Cellar. The club facilities have been updated and modernized several times. The harbor has been enlarged and improved as membership quadrupled. However, the architectural integrity of Lowell's original design and the views of Lake St. Clair have been maintained. A view of the club is shown as a background to the rolling credits at the end of the movie Gran Torino (2008) starring Clint Eastwood.

The band is known for its leftist political statements in many of its songs. Some of the band's songs have been used in protests.  Name and symbols  The group's name literally means \\"The Fish-Snake\\". It is also, however, a Hebrew spoonerism on the phrase ' (, \\"New Driver\\"), which appears on signs which must be affixed to the back of vehicles driven by people who have just recently received a driving license. The band's icon, depicting a child urinating, comes from a Hebrew idiom loosely translated as I will show you from where the fish pisses () meaning something akin to \\"I will show you how it's done.\\" Musical Style Like many Israeli pop musicians such as Teapacks and the Idan Raichel project, Hadag Nahash blends Western pop music with Eastern elements to create a sound tapestry containing influences from funk and world music. The band notes that although its style is hip-hop- oriented, its music is placed in that section in Israel because marketing executives at the group's label did not know how to classify the band's style, despite it being closer to groups such as the Brand New Heavies rather than Wu-Tang Clan or A Tribe Called Quest. History Hadag Nahash has been a major contributor to the Israeli hip-hop scene, and is presently one of Israel's most successful bands, with eight studio albums released to date. The band's songs call for peace, tolerance and equality, and include political and social protest. Most songs are written by Sha'anan Streett, the band's lead vocalist. On 15 September 2000, Hadag Nahash released its first studio album \\"Hamechona Shel Hagroove\\" (, \\"The Groove Machine\\"), which was written by and composed by the entire band. The album included well-known songs such as \\"Lo Mevater\\" and \\"Af Ehad,\\" which both featured Israeli singer Mazi Cohen. Hadag Nahash's second studio album, \\"Lazuz\\" (, \\"To Move\\"), was released on 10 January 2003 and produced by Yossi Fine. The album was an immediate success and sold over 30,000 copies, with hits such as \\"Gabi ve Debi,\\" \\"Misparim,\\" and \\"Lo Frayerim.\\" The song \\"Bella Belissima\\" was also featured on popular crime drama TV show NCIS in 2007, creating a path for Hadag Nahash music to trickle in through to the United States and worldwide. The album featured famous Israeli musicians such as Berry Sakharof. \\"Gabi ve Debi\\" was notable for its political message. Hadag Nahash sings about meeting Gabby and Debby, characters from a children's show that was part of the Let's Learn English series, who, in the show, had a magic stick that could transport them to any time and place. They offer to take the narrator wherever he wants - as long as it has a positive Zionistic message for the children. The three visit first Herzl and then Trumpeldor, two famous promoters of Zionism, and find each to be a far cry from their idealized images. Most notably they see Herzl on drugs and offering them the same, using a paraphrase of the motto of Zionism: \\"If you will it, it is not a legend.\\" This audacious and controversial song is typical of Hadag Nahash. Yossi Fine also produced the band's third studio album, \\"Homer Mekomi\\" (, \\"Local Material\\"), which was released in 2004. The biggest hit out of the album was \\"Shirat Hasticker\\" (, \\"The Sticker Song\\"), which was written by Israeli novelist David Grossman.Curriculum based on \\"The Sticker Song\\" The lines of the song are all slogans seen on Israeli bumper stickers. The opposing political slogans are juxtaposed to create an angry and ironic portrait of political and religious life in Israel. Other notable songs from the album are \\"Halifot,\\" \\"Hakafa Metzaltzelet\\" and \\"Rak Po\\". The album attained platinum status and the band was named Band of the Year by Galgalatz and Reshet Gimel, Israel's leading popular radio stations. In 2006, Hadag Nahash released their fourth studio album, \\"Be'ezrat Hajam\\" (, With Help of the Jam, a wordplay on the expression \\"With God's Help\\"), which was named Album of the Year at the Israel Music Awards. The album, recorded at In the Pocket studios in California, was the first album in which the vocals were divided equally between Sha'anan Streett and DJ Guy Mar. \\"Be'ezrat Hajam\\" contained the hit \\"Hine Ani Ba\\" (, \\"Here I Come\\") written by Guy Mar about moving from his hometown Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. \\"Hine Ani Ba\\" is also an example of a song with a political or cultural message, as it depicts a cultural struggle between Jerusalem, a symbol of Israel's heritage, and Tel Aviv, a hub for young people and nightlife.Snakes, fishes, rhymes and Hollywood interest for Jerusalem nightlife One marker of its success is that this song is also featured in the Adam Sandler movie You Don't Mess with the Zohan. In March 2008 Hadag Nahash released its first live album, Hadag Nahash Live, released both as a CD and a DVD. In December 2009, Hadag Nahash released the first single from its sixth album (fifth studio album), 6: a protest song against the rising internal violence in Israeli society, called \\"Od Ach Ehad\\" (, \\"One More Brother\\"). Further singles from the album were \\"Shir Nehama,\\" which featured Israeli traditional guitarist Yehuda Keisar; \\"Ani Ma'amin\\"; and \\"Lo Maspik.\\" The latter was selected by EA Games for soundtrack of The Sims 3 expansion pack The Sims 3: Late Night, and was re-recorded in Simlish. In February 2013, Hadag Nahash released their sixth studio album, \\"Zman Lehitorer\\" (Time To Wake Up). This album included hit songs such as \\"Zman Lehitorer\\", \\"Kovlana Al Miflagot Israel\\", \\"Pizmon\\", and \\"Yom Shishi\\". In March 2016, the band's seventh studio album, \\"Shutafim Ba'am\\" (Partners of the People), was released. It included songs such as \\"Ten Ii Mangina\\", which was worked on with Israeli artist Avraham Tal, \\"Lo Ma She Yapil Oti\\", which featured rapper Peled, and \\"Legal Eyes\\", which was released in both Hebrew and English. Hadag Nahash released their hit single \\"Od Yihye Tov\\" (Things Will Get Better) in early 2017, and it climbed to the top of the charts instantly. Since their first album in 2000, the music of Hadag Nahash has reached worldwide, even stretching to Western countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Their eighth studio album, \\"Welcome to Israel\\", was released in March 2018, and it instantly took off. It features 14 brand- new songs, including the previously-released singles \\"Od Yihye Tov\\" (Things Will Get Better), \\"Matzbi'im BaRaglaim\\" (Vote With Your Feet), and \\"Sa!\\" (Go!). The title song, \\"Welcome to Israel\\", is an eclectic, traditional Middle-Eastern-style song, which perfectly reflects the tone of the album. This album draws influences from famed music styles such as dubstep and electronica, while still keeping in line with the traditional flavour of Hadag Nahash which audiences around the world love. Their most recent song, , was released as a single on 3 August 2020 and was produced by Johnny Goldstein. The lyrics reference ongoing protests against the thirty-fifth government of Israel, calling to \\"break the cycle of Miri, Bibi, Miki, Bibi, Benny, Bibi\\" and asking for the release of Avera Mengistu.

Orange also manufactures amplifiers for bass guitar, speaker cabinets for instrument amplifiers and combination amplifiers. History Orange amplifier and cabinet with the distinctive tolex. =1960s= Orange was founded in 1968 by musician and electronics designer Clifford Cooper of London and opened premises at 3 New Compton Street in London's West End. Initially, Cooper used only the basement as a professional recording studio, the studio featured an IBC mixing console originally owned by Joe Meek, producer of The Millionaires. The studio was failing to meet its overheads so on September 2nd 1968 the ground floor premises were opened as a music shop, where in order to cover wage costs, Cooper sold his own band equipment. Difficulties in obtaining stock meant that the new Orange shop at first dealt only in second hand equipment. Fortunately, many musicians around that time preferred older, used or beaten up guitars as they were considered to be of better quality and have more character than the new ones available. The Orange shop was the first to cater for this market. The difficulties faced in stocking the shop led Cooper to decide to begin designing Orange's own amplifiers and in the late autumn of 1968 Huddersfield based company Radio Craft, owned by Mat Mathias, was appointed to produce the first Orange branded amplifiers. Whilst in London, Orange shop salesman Mick Dines became closely involved with the design of Orange cabinets. As a touring musician, Dines understood the rigours equipment was subjected to on the road and was instrumental in ensuring that durability was at the forefront of the design with features such as the basketweave grillecloth and the wooden skids which not only gave strength but improved the sound dramatically by acoustically coupling the cabinet to the stage or wooden floor. It is a common misconception that the earliest Orange amplifiers were jointly produced by Orange and Matamp, the brand name that Mathias used on his own design of amplifiers. This was not the case. Radio Craft produced hi-fi guitar amplifiers which, whilst ideal for bass guitar produced a tone far too clean and flat for electric lead guitars. Early Orange Matamp amplifiers were built by Radio Craft to Cooper's design to provide the new generation of guitarists with the sustain they demanded. The front end was modified and Cooper changed the chassis from lightweight aluminium to enamelled steel. The Orange logo was designed to be clearly visible on stage. When the design was delivered to Radio Craft, Mathias suggested that a small Matamp logo be added, which as a courtesy to Mathias, Cooper agreed to, making Matamp a model name. The first of the Orange Matamp amplifiers were 100 watt valve amps and were produced in very small numbers in the rear of tobacconist shop owned by Mathias. Demand for Orange amplifiers grew quickly and Radio Craft was unable to keep up with orders. It became apparent that larger premises were vital. Mathias was unable to finance the move so in 1969, Cooper Mathias Ltd was formed to replace Radio Craft. Cooper's feeling was that a 50/50 partnership would be to the advantage of all parties rather than to simply finance Radio Craft with the benefit of cheaper overheads in Huddersfield than in London. The central plan behind Cooper Mathias was to increase capacity and productivity to a level at which the service could be offered to other amplifier companies. =1970s= The factory in Cowcliffe near Huddersfield was opened in early 1970. Mathias would drive from Huddersfield with a small number of completed amplifier chassis which would be fitted into sleeves, boxed, and despatched from the Orange Shop in London. At this time business in London was moving very rapidly; however, the situation in Huddersfield was much slower. Whilst visiting the factory for a production meeting, Cooper was struck by the slow pace of production. Large numbers of back orders meant that production at Cowcliffe was failing to keep up with demand and the low number of units being produced caused the operation to be non cost effective and not covering its overheads. The decision was taken to end Orange's relationship with Matamp. Cooper and Mathias remained on friendly terms despite the split, with Cooper describing Mathias as \\"a real gentleman for whom I have always had nothing but the greatest admiration.\\" After the decision to cease production in Huddersfield, Cooper located premises in a derelict shop on the corner of Neil's Yard and Short's Gardens in the Covent Garden area of London. This move was to increase productivity and to provide more room for cabinet making, amp testing, and storage, with cabinets being produced on the ground floor and amplifiers in the basement. In 1971, whilst driving in London, Cooper noticed the new road signs being introduced into the UK used graphic symbols rather than words and asked the design team to come up with a set of custom symbols that would clearly show what the control was for and would make sense to users who may not be familiar with English. It was in 1972 that John James, Orange's Research and Development Engineer, designed what would become one of the world's most iconic amplifiers, The \\"Graphic Valve Amplifier,\\" nicknamed simply \\"Pics Only\\", which was a reference to the unique front graphic panels. Early models of the Pics Only were known as \\"Plexis\\" because they had a plastic reverse printed perspex panel secured on an orange steel backplate fixed to the chassis. With later models the front panel was not plastic but silk screen printed metal plates. The Pics Only was the start of the new sound now associated with Orange and has remained the influence for the design and sound of Orange Amplifiers. With demand for Orange amplifiers still increasing it was necessary once again to seek larger premises and locate a proper factory facility. In 1973, production was moved to 17 Upland Road, Bexleyheath, in Kent. There a proper production line was possible, and this resulted in a marked increase in the number of amplifiers and cabinets being completed, an average of one amp per worker per day. This more industrial approach meant that amplifiers and cabinets could be lined up, 20‚Äì30 units at a time, and completed sequentially. This period saw distribution of Orange products in the US for the first time. It was also in 1973 that the Pics Only was redesigned. As well as some electronic modifications, the front panel was amended resulting in the Graphic 120 \\"Pics & Text\\" amplifier which was launched in 1974. In 1975, Orange launched the Custom Reverb Twin MKII which was introduced to compete directly with the Fender Twin Reverb; similarly priced, this amp featured a Hammond spring reverb, a tremolo, and a master volume. It was initially available only as a 50 Watt but the success of this model as a versatile studio amplifier led to a 100 Watt version being produced. Unusually, this model featured black with silver fleck speaker cloth rather than the iconic Basketweave grille cloth. The Orange brand was well established as a manufacturer of valve amps by the mid-1970s, but Cooper was keen to diversify the Orange product range and include solid state amplifiers for the first time. OMEC, which stands for Orange Music Electronic Company, was formed. Cooper engaged designer Peter Hamilton with the brief to design a computerised amp. The only way to achieve this was with the use of SSI and MSI (small and medium scale logic chips.) At the time there was a stark choice, largely due to cost, between TTL (transistor-transistor logic) which consumed a large amount of power but was readily available and well proven or a new technology from RCA called COS-MOS which was low power consumption but prone to static damage. At the time COS-MOS was considered too risky to use. That technology led to today's CMOS microcontrollers with built in static protection, low power consumption, and millions of transistors on a single chip. Hamilton's design was known as the OMEC Digital Programmable Amplifier and was the world's first digitally programmable amplifier. Real DSP was not readily available until the mid-1990s so the OMEC Digital was effectively a digitally controlled analogue amplifier. A drawback to using TTL became apparent quite quickly as the programmable memory took almost an amp at 5 watts, so any settings were lost as soon as the amplifier was turned off. A back up battery was added in the event of a brief power cut but these would only last approximately one hour. Ultimately, the OMEC Digital Amplifier proved to be innovative but ahead of its time and would require a huge amount of investment to make it financially viable. Whilst the programmable computerised amplifier was perhaps released a decade too soon, Orange continued to produce solid state amplifiers, with the denim clad Jimmy Bean amp being released in 1976. The low cost but high quality integrated circuit chips used in the OMEC allowed for a wealth of innovative signal processing technology to be adapted to other amplifiers and, when coupled with a proven power amp design, led to the launch of a series of solid state amps and matching cabinets throughout 1976 to 1979. By the late 1970s the music world had moved on significantly from the psychedelic hippie movement of the 1960s and the decision was taken to update the design of the range. The typeface was changed to a more modern font, the sleeve was lowered to give a sleeker look, and the basketweave grille was changed to a black material with a different level of sound transparency. As part of this major makeover in 1978/1978 Orange divided its product range into Orange Sound Reinforcement and Orange Instrument Amplification. Sound reinforcement included PA, mixing desks, and solid state power amps. Examples of models from this period include the Series Two and the Hustler range of guitar and bass amplifiers. In 1978 the Orange Shop closed when the buildings on New Compton Street were demolished. Production ceased at the Bexleyheath factory in 1979 when two major overseas distributors going into liquidation within a short period of time made the production line no longer viable. =1980s= Throughout the 1980s production of Orange Amplifiers was extremely limited with Cooper continuing to build and sell in small quantities to special order. =1990s= The Orange Gibson Years 1993‚Äì1997 Following Mathias' death in 1989, his sons Peter and Richard continued the business until 1992 when the company was sold to amplifier enthusiast Jeff Lewis. In 1993, Gibson licensed the name to manufacture Orange Amplification. Gibson decided to have their Orange amplifiers made by Matamp in Huddersfield again in order to keep the \\"Made in England\\" identity. The first Gibson era Orange reissues released were the Graphic 120 and Overdrive 120 launching in 1994 followed by the Graphic 80 and Overdrive 80. Sonically, there was a marked difference between these reissues and the original 1970s Pics & text heads. The capacitors fitted in the EQ section had Series Two Overdrive Head values. A small number of Orange Super Bass 120 reissues were also made based on the circuit of the 1979 Series Two Super Bass. The 1990s Orange reissues were not commercially successful and it was mutually agreed that the licence would not be renewed. In February 1997, Gibson handed the Orange name back to Cliff Cooper. 1997‚Äì1999 =The Second Coming of Orange= With the brand back under Cooper's control, guitarist and valve amplifier expert, Adrian Emsley was brought in as technical director with the brief to update and refresh the product range. Guitarist Noel Gallagher had used Orange almost exclusively on the early Oasis albums and as in the early days of Orange, Cooper was keen to get opinions from leading guitarists so Cooper and Emsley approached Gallagher to talk through any requirements that would improve his sound. Gallagher was using an Orange Overdrive which he required more crunch from. As a result, changes were made to the Overdrive circuit, including modifications to the phase inverter and preamp. A standby switch replaced the output socket on the rear. The modifications suggested by Gallagher formed the basis of the OTR amplifier (Oscillatory Transition Return). In 1998, the AD Series was launched. Initially consisting of the AD30 head without reverb, the AD30R, a 2√ó12 combo with reverb, and the AD15 combo, which was available with 10\\" or 12\\" speakers. The range received critical and commercial acclaim and attracted major artists such as former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist Jeremy Spencer. In 1999, The AD15 won the Editor's Pick Award from the US Guitar Player magazine ‚Äì Orange being the first British company in that category to do so. The award saw global interest not only in the AD15 but in Orange as a brand and was a major factor in re-establishing the company. =2000s= The millennium era has seen unprecedented diversification of the Orange product range, from clothing to personal computers. Some notable events during this period include: * 2001 Orange opens USA offices in Atlanta, Georgia. * 2006 The Tiny Terror is launched. * 2008 40th anniversary year ‚Äì Orange produce 40 hand made Custom Shop amps each with a girl's name. * 2009 Orange move into new headquarters in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. * 2010 Cliff Cooper's son Charlie designs and launches the OPC (Orange Personal Computer) aimed at the musician/home studio market. Orange open a custom designed factory in China. * 2013 45th anniversary of the founding of the company. * 2018 50th anniversary of the founding of the company. Legacy Companies =Orange Studios= Before Orange Amps, there was Orange Studios. Cliff Cooper built the studio with his friend Brian Hatt over the course of the summer, hand-cutting, stripping, and soldering every wire. \\"Our basement studio had a great vibe,\\" Cooper recounts, \\"It was very large and, as nobody lived or worked on either side, volume wasn't an issue. Most bands preferred to come in for night sessions.\\" =Orange Hire= Orange Hire was created to provide the PA and backline for larger venues and outdoor summer festivals such as Reading and the Isle of Wight. A fleet of Mercedes 405D vans were converted into state-of-the-art hire vehicles all were radio equipped and had full amp repair facilities fitted. In 1972, Orange Hire was awarded the contract to provide PA equipment for music at the Olympic Games in Munich. =Orange Management= Orange Management was formed in 1969 signing up artists such as John Miles, Smokie, Nigel Benjamin (ex Mott The Hoople) and his band English Assassin, Cock Sparrer and The Realistics amongst others. Not limited to musical artists, in 1971 motorcycle stunt rider and model Eddie Kidd was signed to Orange Management. =Orange Records= It became apparent that while the studios were being used to record demos, many artists were finding it difficult to secure a record deal with a major label. A pressing and distribution deal was signed with Pye Records for the UK and soon afterwards licensing deals for overseas territories. The \\"Voice of the World\\" logo of an Orange tree sitting upon a globe was used for the label with a full colour sleeve; however, with the flower power movement waning, it was decided in the early 1970s to change the look to a black background with gold lettering. =Orange Publishing= Orange publishing was formed in 1969. Former Head of Copyright at EMI, Dennis Sinnott was appointed by Cliff Cooper to establish Orange Publishing and over the next five years signed a variety of bands including Cock Sparrer, The Little Roosters, The Tremeloes and Kenny Ball. Many of whom had records out on the Orange label. Orange Publishing, (now known as Orange Songs.) has a large catalogue with numerous copyrights, including the Grand Rights to several musicals and film scores. =Orange Agency= Orange Agency was also formed in 1969 as a means to tie together all Orange music related activities. Working from premises at 4 New Compton Street bands and artists were booked into venues around the UK. Joe Cocker was booked into The Pheasantry Club in London's Kings Road in Chelsea, which resulted in Orange Agency becoming the sole booking agents for the venue. Bookings for The Marquee and other famous London venues followed the business grew rapidly and began booking tours, flying in acts from America to tour throughout Europe.  Products  Power pop/punk band Magnapop play with stacks of Orange amps in 2011 =Amplifier chronology= For ease of reference, the production of Orange Amplifiers divides into five broad eras.

In the 19th century, it was a separate municipality. It is located in the area around Yonge Street and Finch Avenue in the district of North York between the east and west branches of the Don River. North York was a city that was merged with five other municipalities to form the amalgamated \\"new\\" City of Toronto in 1998. History It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th century. Newtonbrook's early industries included saw and grist mills on the east and west branches of the Don River. The town's Newton Brook Wesleyan Church was named after Reverend Robert Newton. In 1847, Lieutenant Colonel William S. Durie of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada subdivided part of his Newtonbrook property. The resulting subdivision is now Drewry Avenue.\\"Heritage Toronto Mondays: Community of Newtonbrook\\" UrbanToronto 18 July 2011 Residences in Newtonbrook. Residential developments in Newtonbrook began during the 1950s. In the 1950s, Newtonbrook was subdivided for a massive residential development. Most of the town's landmarks were removed, except for the Newtonbrook Schoolhouse and the Newtonbrook General Store. Just one house from the original Drewry Avenue subdivision remains. As of the end of 2006, Newtonbrook is northernmost area of City of Toronto affected by the infill development (mainly along the Finch Ave. and Yonge St. corridors). Older detached and semi-detached houses from the 1950s are demolished (or converted to mixed residential-commercial use) and townhouse complexes are built in their place. There is also an increasing number of new custom built homes in this neighbourhood. A new low-rise condo building had been built on northwest corner of Yonge and Drewry. Demographics Chinese is the second-most spoken language in the area after English. Korean is well behind as the third. Together they make up over 40% of the ethnic minorities in the area. The area also has significant Russian and Jewish and Iranian minorities. The average income in the area is above the average for Toronto and a majority of residents live in single detached or semi-detached houses, which they own. Education Newtonbrook Secondary School is one of three public secondary schools situated in Newtonbrook. Three public school boards operate schools that offer primary and secondary education. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular public school board that operates two secondary schools in the neighbourhood, Newtonbrook Secondary School and Drewry Secondary School (formerly Lewis S. Beattie Secondary School). Both schools were part of the North York Board of Education. The Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) is a separate public school board that also operates one an all-boy secondary school in Newtonbrook, Brebeuf College School. In addition to English-based public school boards, the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM) also operates a secondary school in Newtonbrook, √âcole secondaire catholique Monseigneur-de-Charbonnel. CSCM is a French-based separate public school board. The school and headquarters are leased from the TDSB. However before 1998, Brebeuf and Charbonnel were part of the Metropolitan Separate School Board when it was an English and French board at the time. TCDSB and TDSB operate several schools in Newtonbrook that provide primary education. They include: * Cummer Valley Middle School (TDSB), opened in 1960 as Northmount Junior High School * Fisherville Senior Public School (TDSB) * Pleasant Public School (TDSB) * R. J. Lang Elementary and Middle School (TDSB) * St. Agnes Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Paschal Baylon Separate School (TCDSB) Recreation Centerpoint Mall is a shopping mall located in the north of the neighbourhood. There are several shopping malls and plazas located within the neighbourhood, including Centerpoint Mall, on Steeles Avenue and Yonge Street, and Newtonbrook Plaza. Newtonbrook is also home to several municipal parks, as well as the Finch Hydro Corridor. Parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. Transportation Public transportation in the neighbourhood is also serviced by the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) bus service. Newtonbrook is served by Finch subway station, which is the northern terminus of the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity, located just south of the neighbourhood. In addition to TTC services, public transit services may also be accessed at Finch Bus Terminal, which provides access to GO Transit's commuter and regional buses. York Region Transit and Viva Rapid Transit may also be accessed from the terminal. Notable people It is the birthplace and hometown of Nobel Prize winner and Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Pearson was born at a manse in the intersection of Yonge Street and Hendon Avenue, now the site of the North American Centre. His father was the local Methodist minister and Lester was born in the parsonage.

The series was a predecessor to the Z-car in the Fairlady line, and offered a competitor to the European MG, Triumph, Fiat and Alfa Romeo sports cars. The line began with the 1959 S211 and continued through 1970 with the SP311 and SR311 lines. The Fairlady saw competitors follow its introduction, with examples called the Honda S500, the Toyota Sports 800, and the Daihatsu Compagno. In Japan, it represented one of three core products offered by Nissan at Japanese Nissan dealerships called Nissan Shop, alongside the Datsun Truck and the Datsun 1000. The Datsun SRL 2000 was the two-seat roadster that made their name. Paul Newman started his racing career in one. It had a potent 1,982cc overhead cam engine with dual SU type side draft carbs and a five- speed transmission. In 1991, Nissan introduced a limited number two-door convertible styled in a retro appearance to the Datsun Sports called the Nissan Figaro. S211 The first Datsun Sports model was the 1959 S211. It used a 988 cc C-series straight-4 producing . The S211 was based on the Datsun 211 sedan. Incorporated into the side trim were the side badges, which said \\"Datsun 1000\\". It was designed by Yuichi Ohta, who had previously designed the Datsun DC-3 and the prototype to the S211, the A80X. Both the A80X and S211 featured fiberglass bodywork, influenced by the Chevrolet Corvette. Only 20 examples of the S211 were built, making the S211 the rarest of all Datsun models. Datsun S211, with provision for side curtains SPL212/SPL213  The SPL212 was introduced in 1960. This was the first Datsun sports car imported to the US. The letter L means \\"left hand drive\\". Now with steel bodywork, it was built in slightly higher volume than the S211, with 288 produced through 1961. The SPL212 was based on the Datsun 223 truck. It had a 1.2 L (1189 cc) E-series straight-4 engine producing . A 4-speed manual transmission was specified, and an a-arm suspension with torsion bars was used in front. Drum brakes were used all around. This was the first vehicle to bear the \\"Fairlady\\" name. The badge on the trunk lid was the same badge that was used on the Datsun 223 truck. It was named in reference to the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. The SPL212 and later SPL213 were sold only on the export market; they were named for their engine displacement. In 1960, production of the Fairlady was moved from Yokohama to the Nissan Shatai plant in Hiratsuka. These cars are quite valuable. In 1996 a set of unrestored cars (SPL212) sold for US$100,000. The SPL213, produced in 1961 and 1962, is very similar to the SPL212. The main difference is the dual-carburetor \\"E-1\\" engine which pumped out , a large increase in such a small and light car. Like the SPL212, the SPL213 was based on the Datsun 223 truck. 217 examples were built. SP310/SPL310  The first true Datsun sports car was the 1963 SP310 \\"Fairlady 1500\\" model (right hand drive), and the SPL310 (left hand drive). In America it was known as the Datsun 1500. The SP310 was based on a modified Bluebird 310 sedan platform instead of the truck platform of earlier models. It featured an 85 hp 1.5 L (1,497 cc) G15 engine (from the Cedric) but with a single SU carburettor. Only 300 SPL310's were equipped with the single carb and these first few had only 77 HP as opposed to the 85 HP of the dual carb models built in 1964 and 1965. A four-speed manual transmission was the only shifting option and has a non-syncro'd first gear. The rear axle used the shafts and differential also from the Cedric. It was a well-equipped car with a transistor radio, tonneau cover, map lights, and a clock. The first SP310s (1963‚Äì1964) also had a unique sideways third seat in the rear. =Marketing= To coincide with the 1964 Summer Olympics, Nissan established the gallery on the second and third floors of the San-ai building, located in Ginza, Tokyo. To attract visitors, Nissan started using beautiful female showroom attendants where Nissan held a competition to choose five candidates as the first class of Nissan Miss Fairladys, modeled after \\"Datsun Demonstrators\\" from the 1930s who introduced cars. The Fairlady name was used as a link to the popular Broadway play of the era My Fair Lady. Miss Fairladys became the marketers of Datsun Fair Lady 1500.Nissan recalls the birth of Miss FairladyThe Birth of Miss Fairlady SP311/SPL311 Many changes were made for 1965. Though the 1.5 L SP310 continued in production through January, a new 1.6 L R16-powered SP311 and SPL311 joined it. The new model was first shown at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show, but did not enter production until March 1965. The restyling was executed in part by Count Albrecht Goertz, who would later be involved with designing the first Fairlady Z. Marketed as the Fairlady 1600, or the Datsun Sports 1600 in many export markets including North America, it featured 14 inch wheels and minor exterior changes. The SPL311 was also known in the United States, on the West Coast, as the \\"Roadster\\". The front suspension was independent, utilizing coil springs over hydraulic shocks. Rear suspension was a common leaf springs design, dampened with hydraulic shocks. The 1600 SPL311 came with a pair of SU carburators. The engine produced . The R16 is an in- line four cylinder OHV engine. Early SPL311 came with a high compression engine that had three main bearings, hydraulic lifters, a cast iron block and cast iron head. Timing of the distributor could be easily adjusted to reduce pre-ignition knock and thereby tune for questionable quality gasoline. Engines in later SPL311 had 5 main bearings and this addressed a design weakness. Top speed for the SPL311 with approximately 91 octane gasoline was approximately 105 mph. The axle gearing suffered from design limitations and Datsun performance parts offered a cooling system as a retrofit. Steering utilized a worm gear design. The hood badge said \\"Datsun\\" in individual letters, the rear badge said \\"Datsun 1600\\", and the side badges said \\"Fairlady\\" (Japanese market) or \\"Datsun 1600\\" (export market). The SP311 continued in production through April 1970. The first Nissan Silvia coupe shared the SP311's platform. The CSP311 Silvia had an R16 engine developing 96 hp and used a modified Fairlady chassis. The Silvia was the first car fitted with Nissan's new R engine. The R engine was a further development of the 1,488 cc G engine. Early in 1968 the 1600, just as the bigger 2000, was updated to meet new safety legislation. Toggle switches, a padded dashboard and padded center of the steering wheel were new inside. The door handles were flush fit lifting units, while the windshield was taller with a top mounted internal rear view mirror. SR311/SRL311 The introduction of the 1967 SR311 and SRL311 saw a major update. Produced from March 1967 ‚Äì 1970, the SR311 used a 2.0 L (1,982 cc) U20 engine and offered a five-speed manual transmission, somewhat unexpected for a production car at the time. The first-year cars (known as \\"half year\\" cars) are sought as there were fewer than 1,000 produced which are unencumbered with the 1968 model year emissions and safety changes. The in-line, four cylinder U20 engine had a cast iron block and aluminum alloy head. The new SOHC engine produced . An optional Competition package included dual Mikuni/Solex carburetors; a special \\"B\\" model camshaft for ; higher limit gauges; and a license plate surround. In Australia there were no emission restrictions and all 2.0 litre cars were fitted with the Competition package as standard.Brook, P, 2000 Banzai Productions Due to the 2.0 litre engine, Japanese versions were regarded as expensive, specialized, sports cars due to the annual road tax obligation.

As the expression suggests, when a person runs the aisles in a worship setting, he leaves his seat and runs down the aisles between seating sections, or he may run around the interior perimeter of the meeting house. A biblical basis for the act known as running the aisles is difficult to establish. Nevertheless, in the Pentecostal worship tradition, spontaneous expressions inspired by the moving of the Spirit are highly valued, and in many congregations the spontaneous running of aisles has traditionally been an acceptable expression of joy. Typically those Pentecostals who run the church aisles do not do so unless they feel that they are overwhelmed by the presence of the Holy Spirit at a point in the service when the congregation in general is sensing His moving. It may be reasonable to classify running as a form of dancing. It is worth noting that running occurs at times in modern Jewish folk dancing. Opponents of this expression of worship argue that it violates Paul's instructions on orderly worship found in 1 Corinthians 14:26-40, as well as contradicting the idea that one of the \\"fruits\\" of the Holy Spirit is self-control (Galatians 5:23). At its basic level, however, opponents of such a belief hold a different view of the work of the Holy Spirit.

It was founded in 1986 to create data and voice networking products after Matthews was forced out of his original company Mitel. According to Matthews, he saw that data networking would grow far faster than voice networking, and he had wanted to take Mitel in much the same direction, but the 'risk-averse' British Telecom-dominated Mitel board refused and effectively ousted him. The name Newbridge Networks comes from Sir Terry Matthews' home town of Newbridge in south Wales. Newbridge quickly became a major market player in this area using the voice switching and software engineering expertise that was prevalent in the Ottawa area. The company initially had innovative channelbank products, which allowed telcos with existing wiring to offer a wide variety of new services. Newbridge also offered (for the time) the industry's most innovative network management (46020 NMS) and ISDN TAP 3500, RS-232C 3600 Mainstreet PC 4601A and ACC \\"river\\" routers (Congo/Amazon/Tigris etc.), including distributed star- topology routing through both proprietary software over the unused facilities' data links in optical hardware and telco switches. Starting in 1992 the company became increasingly focused upon and well known for its family of ATM products such as the MainStreet 36150 and MainStreet Xpress 36170 (later renamed Alcatel 7470). Newbridge later absorbed some routing technology that had been abandoned by Tandem Computers, with the purchase of Ungermann-Bass and entered the pure data networking market with a traditional routing and switching product. This was in addition to its internally developed ViViD product line, which was a network-wide distributed routing product (ridge or routing bridge‚Äîbridges with a centralized routing server).

Music by Philip Glass, libretto and original direction by Mary Zimmerman and Arnold Weinstein. The piece is presented in one act consisting of ten scenes without break. Galileo Galilei is Glass' 18th opera, and draws from letters of Galileo and his family, and various other documents, to retrospectively journey through Galileo's life. Opening with him as an old, blind man after the trial and Inquisition for his heresy, it explores his religiosity as well as his break with the church, and expands into the greater, oscillating relationship of science to both religion and art. It reaches its end with Galileo ‚Äî as a young boy ‚Äî watching an opera composed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei, who was a member of the Florentine Camerata, an association of artists who are credited with creating the art form that came to be known as opera. Ironically, his father's opera is about the motions of the celestial bodies. The opera has been revived with new productions in 2012 by Madison Opera and Portland Opera. The Portland Opera production was recorded by Orange Mountain Music. Production notes All genius meets with extreme resistance before it is accepted as truth. In the case of Galileo, it was the mere hypothesis that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The notion was considered heretical and blasphemous by scholars and clergy alike. Much was done to destroy Galileo's reputation. And since they could not do so through scientific proof, they did so through slander and threats of torture. It was not until recently that the Catholic Church finally admitted that they were wrong in persecuting Galileo. It took hundreds of years for them to admit the mistake. Galileo died believing that all of the advancements he had made in science were for naught. His books were banned, and his name was disgraced. All of this, for suggesting a theory that turned out to be true. In addition to depicting Galileo's trials before the Inquisition, the opera also allows us a glance into Galileo's more personal side. Namely, in showing us his relationship to his daughter Maria Celeste, who was a nun. Maria Celeste shared her father's love of learning and science, but also understood that he was a man of great faith. She recognized that science was the very subject that served to deepen his faith, and she encouraged him on this path. The two met rarely. They were separated not only by distance, but by Galileo's often ailing health. Sadly, they were ultimately separated by her death at the age of 33, a source of incredible sadness for Galileo. However, their connection in this opera serves to give his story a more personal rendering. The story itself is told backwards through time. It begins with an aged Galileo, blinded from having looked at the Sun too often and ends with him as a child. This is related to the function of a telescope, which works by reversing images with lenses. Much of the staging in this production is representative of Galileo's theories and follows the patterns of the discoveries, planets, and constellations that his inventions made known to the world. Synopsis ;Scene 1 Opening Song In the final days of his life, the now blind Galileo Galilei remembers the things in his life that he can no longer see. ;Scene 2 Recantation The officials of the Catholic Church rebuke the scientist for not relenting on his theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The Pope hands down his sentence, and then reminds Galileo of a time when they walked in the garden as friends. ;Scene 3 Pears Marie Celeste, the daughter of Galileo, sends her intense devotion love and support through letters that are accompanied by elements of her garden at the convent. ;Scene 4 Trial Galileo is summoned before two Cardinals of the Catholic Church to answer questions regarding his book \\"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World\\". ;Scene 5 Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World As Galileo pens his book, the fictitious characters come alive to discuss the theories presented. Here, the Older Galileo becomes the Younger Galileo. ;Scene 6 Incline Plane The theories and experiments are put to the test in Galileo's laboratory. ;Scene 7 A Walk in the Garden Galileo and his great friend Cardinal Barberini discuss Galileo's newest book in the Garden. After the Cardinal's feeble attempt at poetry, Galileo expresses his fear of his enemies. Barberini warns Galileo not to continue with his theories regarding the planets. ;Scene 8 Lamps While at mass with his daughter, Galileo observes the swinging of a lamp suspended from the ceiling moving in pendulum fashion and explains his theory to Marie. ;Scene 9 Presentation of the Telescope Galileo presents his invention to the Duchess and her Ladies in Waiting. The Duchess and Galileo reminisce about a time in their youth when they watched an opera together composed by Galileo's father, Vincenzo. ;Scene 10 Opera within the Opera The Duchess and Galileo, now children, are in the audience as his father's opera is performed. The magical story of the planetary figures becomes the vehicle through which Galileo is reunited with his deceased daughter.

It first appeared in the film Return of the Jedi (1983) as a multi-tentacled alien beast whose immense, gaping maw is lined with several rows of sharp teeth. The sarlacc in the film inhabits the Great Pit of Carkoon, a hollow in the sand of the desert planet Tatooine. In the original Return of the Jedi, the sarlacc is simply a barbed hole in the desert sand which characters fall into and are consumed; some are pulled into the sarlacc's mouth by its tentacles. In the 1997 Special Edition of the film, computer-generated tentacles and a beak emerge from the opened mouth. Besides Return of the Jedi, the creature and others like it are featured in Star Wars literature. Like other aspects of Star Wars, the sarlacc became a part of popular culture. The creature was incorporated into the merchandising campaign that accompanied the release of Return of the Jedi. It is the subject of analysis and humor in works of literature unassociated with Star Wars.Peter Biskind, Gods And Monsters: Movers, Shakers, and Other Casualties of the Hollywood Machine (New York: Nation Books, 2004), p. 129, .Stefan Demetriou, How to Disappear Completely (Oxford, Eng.: Reverb, 2005), p. 166, .  Depiction  The sarlacc first appeared in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, wherein Jabba the Hutt attempts to drop Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca into the creature's mouth; but Luke frees himself and the others with the aid of Lando Calrissian and R2-D2, while Princess Leia strangles Jabba. According to the Star Wars Databank, the sarlacci inhabit remote, inhospitable locations in the galaxy, but defy taxonomic classification, in so far as most texts claim that the sarlacc is an arthropod (as in The Essential Guide to Alien Species and The Wildlife of Star Wars), while its anchored root system and spore-based method of reproduction suggest a plant origin.\\"Sarlacc\\". Star Wars Databank. Retrieved December 21, 2015. A sarlacc reproduces by releasing spores through outer space, which arrive on a planet or asteroid, and there excavate a pit to capture prey.\\"Sarlacci spores\\", Stephen J. Sansweet, Star Wars Encyclopedia (New York: Del Rey, 1998), p. 258, . Steve Sansweet's Star Wars Encyclopedia describes the sarlacc as an \\"omnivorous, multi-tentacled creature with needle-sharp teeth and a large beak\\".\\"Sarlacc\\", Star Wars Encyclopedia, p. 258. The sarlacc rests at the base of a giant pit where the entirety of its body is buried except for the gaping mouth, which may reach three meters (10 feet) in diameter. The sarlaac uses its four legs to anchor itself underground. Astrophysicist and science fiction author Jeanne Cavelos compares the sarlacc's hunting method to that of the antlion.Jeanne Cavelos, The Science of Star Wars: An Astrophysicist's Independent Examination of Space Travel, Aliens, Planets, and Robots as Portrayed in the Star Wars Films and Books(New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 71, . The sarlacc's mouth also has similarities with that of the lamprey. Because most sarlacci inhabit isolated environments and rely on prey to stumble into their pit, they rarely feed; the digestive system dissolves prey into nutrients over a period of several thousand years. If no living prey is available, a sarlacc relies on its root system to absorb nutrients. One sarlacc located on an airless moon feeds on cometary material rich in oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.J. D. Montgomery, \\"A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett\\", in Tales from Jabba's Palace, ed. Kevin J. Anderson (paperback; New York: Bantam Spectra, 1996), p. 364, . The sarlacc's stomach is lined with vessels that attach themselves to a swallowed victim and maws for quick digestion or breaking apart large prey. The maws close when exposed to bright lights. The stomach also contains neurotoxins, which induce hallucinations in prey which \\"suggest that the sarlacc somehow absorbs the intelligence of all its victims, who live on in disembodied torment\\". A sarlacc can communicate with its victims through this stolen consciousness: In one Star Wars short story, an unnamed Jedi explains that \\"sarlacci do interesting things with messenger RNA: over the course of millennia, they can attain a sort of group consciousness, built out of the remains of people they've digested. I talked to such a sarlacc, once a few decades ago\\". Jawa with the spore of a sarlacc from \\"Fortune, Fate, and the Natural History of the Sarlacc\\", Star Wars Tales 6 (2000) In the anthology Tales from Jabba's Palace (1995), edited by Kevin J. Anderson, Dan'l Danehy Oakes's story \\"Shaara and the Sarlacc: The Skiff Guard's Tale\\" is told by one of Jabba the Hutt's soldiers, who tells Boba Fett that his sister Shaara and her Imperial stormtrooper captors were thrown into the pit, whereupon the sarlacc swallowed the stormtroopers, but expelled Shaara, for reasons unknown.Dan'l Danehy-Oakes, \\"Shaara and the Sarlacc: The Skiff Guard's Tale,\\" Tales from Jabba's Palace, p. 345. In the short story \\"A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett\\", by Daniel Keys Moran under the pseudonym of J. D. Montgomery, Boba Fett struggles to free himself from the belly of the sarlacc. As Fett is digested, the creature converses with him mentally in the voice of an alien named Susejo, eaten by the sarlacc four thousand years earlier. Having caused his jet pack to explode, Fett uses a concussion grenade to blast himself free.Montgomery, \\"A Barve Like That,\\" pp. 355-356, italics in the original. Years later, Fett is recognized by the sarlacc upon approach. In the non-canonical Dark Horse comic book \\"Fortune, Fate, and the Natural History of the Sarlacc\\", written by Mark Schultz and illustrated by Kellie Strom, the sarlacc seen in Return of the Jedi is the offspring of an older sarlacc on Tatooine. Shortly after the execution of an unknown alien named Grubbat Fhilch, the sarlacc releases a spore that attaches to an Imperial stormtrooper's dewback. The stormtroopers hire a group of Jawa scavengers to clean the dewbacks, from which one jawa acquires the spore. The young sarlacc escapes from the jar only to be swallowed by a spider-like creature, which it consumes from within, and later forms the Great Pit of Carkoon.Mark Schultz, \\"Fortune, Fate, and the Natural History of the Sarlacc,\\" illustrated by Kellie Strom, in Star Wars Tales 6 (Dark Horse Comics, 2000). Sarlacci have made minor appearances in Star Wars video games such as Super Star Wars (1992), Shadows of the Empire (1996), Star Wars: Demolition (2000), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002), Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike (2003), and Star Wars: Battlefront (2004). The MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies (2003) shows one of the smaller sarlacci in the Star Wars galaxy on the remote planet Dathomir. It has also made an appearance in Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Star Wars: Empire at War and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008), where a sarlacc much larger than the one on Tatooine is first an ally of a Jedi Knight, and later used as a base for the Empire (even building structures inside the creature itself). A duel is fought beside the sarlacc in this game between Starkiller and Shaak Ti, until Ti falls backwards into the sarlacc's open mouth. In Super Star Wars, the \\"Sarlacc Pit Monster\\" acts as a boss early into the game. It is depicted as a large, worm-like creature with tentacles, and shoots rocks at Luke.  Concept and creation  The design of the sarlacc creature-- originally called the \\"Sloth Pit\\"Laurent Bouzereau, Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays (New York: Del Rey, 1997), p. 253, --seen in Return of the Jedi evolved during the concept, creation, and filming processes. Early concept sketches portrayed a creature with several moving tentacles and a pronounced beak; but Star Wars creator George Lucas, did not have the technology or financial resources to realize this concept in the 1983 film. Concept art for the sarlacc by Industrial Light & Magic Special effects artists Stuart Freeborn, Phil Tippett, and the crew of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) constructed a pit in the desert sands of Yuma, Arizona, that contained a gaping mouth with jagged teeth and tentacles. At the time, the pit (with Jabba the Hutt's sail barge) constituted one of the largest motion picture sets ever constructed.From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga, narrated by Mark Hamill (1985; VHS, CBS Fox Video, 1992). A hydraulic system was designed to animate the creature, but the blowing sand clogged the mechanism. The film crew instead used poles and wires to move the creature's tentacles. Lucas was not satisfied with the effect, complaining, \\"There was nothing alive about the whole thing.\\"George Lucas, commentary, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Special Edition (VHS, 20th Century Fox, 1997). Working on the giant set was an arduous task, according to the crew members involved. Tippett told Starlog magazine, \\"We were working the creature at the bottom of a gorge, so we got no breeze. Sand constantly fell down upon us\\". In addition to operating the sarlacc, many technicians were standing in as skiff guards in full wardrobe. Tippett remarks, \\"[We] were covered with [sand and] glue from the costumes. I almost cracked on that one. I think I cried, it was so terrible.\\"Phil Tippett, interview with Starlog, quoted in Lee Pfeiffer and Michael Lewis, The Films of Harrison Ford (3rd ed.;New York: Citadel Press, 2002), p. 132, . Actress Carrie Fisher recalled that many of the crew and stunt men who fell into the creature during filming suffered broken legs and sprained ankles.Carrie Fisher, commentary, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Special Edition (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004). ILM crew members received some satisfaction when they dismantled the set at the conclusion of filming and sold it to Mexico as scrap. The one condition of the sale was that the materials were not to be resold as souvenirs.Pfeiffer and Lewis, Films of Harrison Ford, p. 132. CGI beak and tentacles The sarlacc design underwent a series of changes when Lucas released the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi in 1997. Employing the new technology of computer-generated imagery (CGI), ILM amended the creature's appearance with the addition of CGI tentacles and a beak inside the sarlacc's mouth. According to Lucas, it \\"just looks much more realistic and more threatening ... it helps the scene considerably.\\" Subsequent depictions of the sarlacc in Star Wars fiction are based on this revised design. Some of the special effects from the 1983 film were retained in the Special Edition. The tentacle that captures the skiff guard Kithaba and pulls him into the sarlacc mouth is from the original film, as well as the tentacle that attaches to Lando Calrissian's leg.  In popular culture  Aside from Star Wars fiction and merchandising, popular fiction author Stefan Demetriou uses the sarlacc as a descriptive term for slowness, a reference to the creature's extended digestive process. The sarlacc became part of Return of the Jedi's merchandising campaign that accompanied the theatrical release of the film. Parker Brothers produced a board game in 1983 called Battle at Sarlacc's Pit that was sold in the United States and Canada. Players collect points for battling their way through Gamorrean guards, Boba Fett, and a Nikto on Jabba the Hutt's sail barge, pushing them overboard into a cardboard sarlacc.Description of Battle at Sarlacc's Pit at Board Game Geek; last accessed July 10, 2006; instructions available from Hasbro. The game, which sold for only a few years, is a collector's item.Geoffrey T Carlton, Star Wars Super Collector's Wish Book: Identification & Values (Paducah, Ky.: Collector Books, 2003), p. 273, . Hollywood journalist and humor writer Peter Biskind muses that George Lucas went to great extremes to remove aspects of sex and sexuality from the plot of the Star Wars films. Biskind, however, asserts that Lucas created a \\"nightmarishly explicit image of threatening female sexuality\\" in the form of the sarlacc: \\"The Jabba episode culminates in an explicit vagina dentata fantasy, as Luke and his pals have to walk a phallic gangplank into the pullulating maw--festooned with long, curved teeth --of the giant sarlacc in its 'nesting place'.\\" Premiere magazine reviewer Tim Bissell complained, \\"Lucas sent his trilogy‚Äôs most arresting character Boba Fett to a \\"death\\" so inglorious--falling headlong into the vagina dentata of Tatooine's sarlacc--that its only payoff was a burp gag.\\"Tim Bissell, \\"The Importance of Being Fett: A brief history of one of the most popular characters in the Star Wars universe,\\" at Premiere Magazine; last accessed July 10, 2006. In the TV series Peep Show, Mark Corrigan references \\"the pit of sarlacc\\" when finishing off the remains of a packet of crisps. In 2018, a cave that was discovered in British Columbia, Canada was unofficially named Sarlacc's Pit. In the TV series Ghost Wars (2017-2018), Billy McGrath (performed by Kim Coates) refers to the inability of people to leave town due to the events triggered by the earthquake. In conversation with town's major Val McGrath-Dufresne (performed by Luvia Petersen), Val points out that he had been able to get into town, so \\"If there¬¥s a way in, there¬¥s gotta be a way out.\\", to which Billy replies \\"Tell that to a sarlacc.\\" The front cover of Randall Munroe's book What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions features a T. rex being lowered into a sarlacc pit.

Biography = Early years= Born in Woodford, Essex, he grew up, within a family of musicians, in Hollywood Way, Highams Park, a suburb of Chingford, and attended Selwyn Boys' (Junior) School in Highams Park and later Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow. He had violin and piano lessons before settling eventually on the clarinet at the age of 16, after hearing a record of the Benny Goodman Quartet. Soon afterwards, inspired by Johnny Hodges, he learned to play the alto saxophone. He began his career on the British jazz scene after studying at London's Royal Academy of Music (where his jazz interests were frowned upon) and then national service in the Royal Air Force, during which he played alto sax and clarinet for RAF Music Services. He attended the Paris Jazz Festival in 1949 and played with Charlie Parker. Parker's comments about Dankworth led to the engagement of the young British jazz musician for a short tour of Sweden with the soprano-saxophonist Sidney Bechet. In 1949, Dankworth was voted Musician of the Year. =1950s= In 1950, Dankworth formed a small group, the Dankworth Seven, as a vehicle for his writing activities as well as a showcase for several young jazz players, including himself (alto sax), Jimmy Deuchar (trumpet), Eddie Harvey (trombone), Don Rendell (tenor sax), Bill Le Sage (piano), Eric Dawson (bass) and Tony Kinsey (drums). Vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder also sang and recorded with this ensemble. After three successful years, the group was wound up, although it re-formed for several reunions over the years. Dankworth formed his big band in 1953. The band was soon earning plaudits from the critics and was invited to the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival, the first British group to receive an invite.Dankworth Plans Trip to Newport, The Tatler, May 6, 1959 The New York Times critic said of this appearance \\"Mr. Dankworth's group ... showed the underlying merit that made big bands successful many years ago ‚Äì the swinging drive, the harmonic colour and the support in depth for soloists that is possible when a disciplined, imaginatively directed band has worked together for a long time. This English group has a flowing, unforced, rhythmic drive that has virtually disappeared from American bands\\". More succinctly, Gerard Lascelles of The Tatler, noted that 'The Dankworth orchestra blew magnificently'.Jazz at Two Festivals, The Tatler, September 2, 1959 The band performed at the Birdland jazz club in New York City, and shortly afterwards shared the stage with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for a number of concerts. Dankworth's band also performed at a jazz event at New York's Lewisohn stadium where Louis Armstrong joined them for a set. By now, Cleo Laine's singing was a regular feature of Dankworth's recordings and public appearances. After her divorce from George Langridge became final, in 1957, Dankworth married Cleo Laine in secret at Hampstead Registry Office in 1958. The only witnesses at the wedding were Dankworth's friend, pianist Ken Moule, and arranger David Lindup. In 1959, Dankworth became chair of the Stars Campaign for Inter-Racial Friendship, set up to combat the fascist White Defence League. =1960s= In 1961, Dankworth's recording of Galt MacDermot's \\"African Waltz\\" reached the UK Singles Chart, peaked at No. 9, and remained in the chart for 21 weeks. American altoist Cannonball Adderley sought and received Dankworth's permission to record the arrangement and had a minor hit in the US as a result. The piece was also covered by many other groups. In 1967 drummer Ronnie Stephenson's part on \\"African Waltz\\" was adapted by the Jimi Hendrix Experience's Mitch Mitchell to form the basis of the drum part on \\"Manic Depression\\". Dankworth's friendship with trumpeter Clark Terry led to Terry's being a featured soloist on Dankworth's 1964 album The Zodiac Variations, together with Bob Brookmeyer, Zoot Sims, Phil Woods, Lucky Thompson and other guests. Other Dankworth recordings during this period featured many other respected jazz names. Some were full-time members of the Dankworth band at one time or another, like Tony Coe, Mike Gibbs, Peter King, Dudley Moore, George Tyndale, Daryl Runswick, John Taylor and Kenny Wheeler, while others such as Dave Holland, John McLaughlin, Tubby Hayes and Dick Morrissey were occasional participants. Dankworth began a second career as a composer of film and television scores (often credited as \\"Johnny Dankworth\\"). Among his best-known credits are the original themes for two British TV programmes, The Avengers (used from 1961 to 1964) and Tomorrow's World. He also wrote the scores for the films Darling (1965) and Modesty Blaise and Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment (both 1966). He appeared in the film All Night Long (1962) with Dave Brubeck and Charles Mingus ‚Äì playing himself ‚Äì and played on the theme to the satirical BBC show The Frost Report in 1966. Dankworth was commissioned to write a piece for the 1967 Farnham Festival; and produced \\"Tom Sawyer's Saturday\\"; written for full orchestra and narrator: \\"a sort of 'Peter and the Wolf' which could be played by most reasonably competent youth orchestras\\".Programme Notes: Essex Youth Orchestra Charity concert in the Royal Festival Hall, 28 May 1972 During this active period of recording, the Dankworth band nevertheless found time for frequent live appearances and radio shows, including tours in Britain and Europe with Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan and Gerry Mulligan, and concerts and radio performances with Lionel Hampton and Ella Fitzgerald. =1970s and 1980s= Dankworth's friendship with Duke Ellington continued until the latter's death in 1974. He recorded an album of symphonic arrangements of many Ellington tunes featuring another Ellingtonian trumpet soloist Barry Lee Hall. Dankworth also retained his Ellington links by performing with the Ellington Orchestra under the direction of Duke's son, Mercer Ellington. Dankworth recorded various symphonic albums with Dizzy Gillespie and the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and others. Other jazz musicians with whom Dankworth performed include George Shearing, Toots Thielemans, Benny Goodman, Herbie Hancock, Hank Jones, Slam Stewart and Oscar Peterson. He always had an enthusiasm for jazz education, for many years running the Allmusic summer schools at the Stables in Wavendon near Milton Keynes, a theatre that Cleo and he created (January 1970) in their back garden. From 1984 to 1986, Dankworth was professor of music at Gresham College, London, giving free public lectures. In 1982, Dankworth was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. =Later work= He appeared with Craig David on Later with Jools Holland on BBC Two. He set up his own record label, Qnotes, in 2003, to reissue some of his old recordings as well as new ones. They include a number with Julian Lloyd Webber, Dudley Moore and members of his family. Dankworth and Laine's two children are both jazz musicians: Alec Dankworth is a bassist who was also a member of his father's band, and Jacqui Dankworth is a singer. Dankworth was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2006 New Year's Honours List. He and Dame Cleo Laine were one of the few married couples where both partners held titles in their own right. Sir John remained an active composer into later life, and he wrote a jazz violin concerto for soloist Christian Garrick to play. This work had its world premiere at the Nottingham Royal Concert Hall on 3 March 2008 in partnership with the Nottingham Youth Orchestra. Sir John himself took to the stage and challenged the young players to improvise with him. In October 2009 at the end of a US tour with his wife, Sir John was taken ill. The couple cancelled a number of UK concert dates for the following month. Dankworth did return to the concert stage for just one solo at the London Jazz Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in December 2009. He played his sax from a wheelchair. He also played in John & Cleo's Christmas Show from 17 to 20 December 2009 at 'the Stables' in Wavendon. =Death= John Dankworth died on 6 February 2010, aged 82,Stephen Graham, Jazz breaking news: Giant of British Jazz Sir John Dankworth Dies at 82, Jazzwise, 6 February 2010. on the afternoon before a show celebrating the 40th anniversary of the foundation of his Stables theatre. His funeral took place on 1 March 2010 at Milton Keynes Crematorium, followed by a memorial service held at the Stables the same day.

She is a member of the Danish Social Democrats, and was Lord Mayor of Copenhagen from 1 January 2006 to 2010. Bjerregaard was Education Minister from 27 September to 19 December and again from 13 February 1975 to 22 December 1978. 1973 and from 1975 to 1978 in the Cabinets of Anker J√∏rgensen I, II and III, and Social Minister from 1979 to 1981 in Anker J√∏rgensen's fourth cabinet. She was European Commissioner for the Environment from 1994 to 1999 and Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen IV from 2000 to 2001. Political career She was a member of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) from 21 September 1971 to 22 January 1995 and from 20 November 2001 until 8 February 2005. She was a minister of various cabinets under Anker J√∏rgensen, and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. In 1971 she was elected to the Odense City Council where she served just one term and resigned in 1973. In 1971 and 1975-1978 she held the position as minister of education, where she changed the Primary School Act in 1975 with the support from the majority of the other parties. On 5 November 1975 Bjerregaard hired an external chancellor for Roskilde University. Venstre and Conservative People's Party wanted to abolish the university, but thanks to the independent politician, former Conservative People's Party member Hans J√∏rgen Lembourn, the university was saved. In 1976 she introduced restricted admission at the universities meanwhile secured the protection of minorities. In 1977 Bjerregaard got the law about Erhvervsfaglige Grunduddannelser - EFG (Vocational basic training) approved. With former head of department Erik Ib Schmidt she launched the ambitious, complete education plan U 90 from 1978. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ritt changed her stance on EU. After being an opponent for many years, she became chairman The Danish European Movement (Den Danske Europabev√¶gelse). Bjerregaard was the European Commissioner for Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection in the Santer Commission from 1995 to 1999, representing Denmark. She has attended at least one Bilderberg Group meeting on 8‚Äì11 June 1995. She has also attended Trilateral Commission meetings in 1992, 1998 and 2002. She has been involved with various organisations. She was vice-president of both OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly and Socialist International Women (SIW) from 1992 to 1994. Four days after Bjerregaard was appointed minister of food in February 2000, the first case of mad cow disease, a dangerous brain disease, occurred. With the ministry Bjerregaard acted fast and consistently. The butchering methods were changed and a ban on risk products was installed. These consistent measures were first not received well, neither by the farmers nor the food industry. Especially the initiative to withdraw certain foods from the retailers was criticised. But later on the industry realized that the measures protected the consumers and created great confidence in Danish food products at the export market. In 2001 Bjerregaard introduced the Smiley system. It made occasion for big discussions but today the system is generally recognized. Bjerregaard won the election for Lord Mayor of Copenhagen for the Social Democrats on 16 November 2005, a position she acquired through a high number of personal votes. During her time as Lord Mayor of Copenhagen, Ritt invited mayors of cities around the world to a summit about the climate in the cities. The summit was a prelude to COP15, which took place in Copenhagen. At the summit, Ritt Bjerregaard wished to discuss what the big cities could do to lower CO2-emissions. The meeting was successful and mayors made a promise to take action. Personal life Bjerregaard grew up in Vesterbro in Copenhagen as the daughter of joiner Gudmund Bjerregaard and bookkeeper Rita Bjerregaard. She is the oldest of three siblings. She was hospitalized several times because of narrow and unhealthy conditions, until the family acquired an allotment. She finished her exam from Christianshavn Gymnasium in 1958 and became a modern side student from Statens Kursus til Studentereksamen in 1966. After getting her teachers' certificate in 1964 from Emdrupborg, she worked as a folkeskole (primary school) teacher until 1970. In the same period she was a consultant for publishing house Gyldendal. In 1971, she became assistant professor at Odense College of Education. She has been married to historian S√∏ren M√∏rch since 1966. In her spare time, she is a gardener in her organically-managed manor, mostly growing apples. Ritt Bjerregaard has written several books during her life, latest being the first volume of her memoirs titled 'Ritt' (2015). Controversy During her time as minister of education in 1978, she stayed in a luxury suite at the Ritz Hotel in Paris during a Unesco conference, and this forced her to step down when it became known. Later on The National Audit Office declared that she had not spent more money than other ministers. This later fueled a debate at the Danish Parliament. She returned to politics again soon hereafter in 1979 as social minister. In the early 1990s it was revealed she had used her connections within the Social Democratic organisations to get a large flat in Copenhagen, although she rarely used it, living on Funen. She was then forced to step down as parliamentary group leader of the Social Democrats. After a year, the case was dropped by the municipality. ='5,000 Cheap Flats' promise= Her main campaign promise for the city council elections of 2005 was to erect 5,000 cheap dwellings for 5,000 kroner (US$948) rent a month within 5 years, should she be elected Lord Mayor. This would allow an average-earning couple, such as policemen and nurses, to gain access to the expensive housing market in Copenhagen. Economists and other experts criticised the plan for being impossible to implement. As of the summer of 2007, twelve such flats had been built. On 11 July 2007, Bjerregaard claimed she never promised Copenhageners would get 5,000 cheap dwellings within five years, but merely that she would work for that aim. She claimed many unexpected and legal obstacles had come about, and that the government obstructed the issue. She also expected, however, that the 5,000 flats would be ready within 7‚Äì10 years. =Leadership= Since the November 2005 city elections, three prominent Social Democrats have left their fraction: Winnie Berndtson, Finn Rudaizky and Winnie Larsen-Jensen. In June 2007, long-time city politician Larsen-Jensen claimed: > As a city council member I have experienced four Lord Mayors. Ritt is the > most autocratic, absolutist, centralist and undemocratic of all. In return, Bjerregaard claimed that Larsen-Jensen \\"suffered personal problems\\" which could not be commented in public. The opposition, as well of the left- wing fractions, have accused Ritt of a dictatorial conduct and obstructing their insight into political cases. Ritt Bjerregaard is regarded as one of the four most influential social democrats from the so-called golden generation, the others being Mogens Lykketoft, Svend Auken and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. =Office refurbishment= In August 2007, Bjerregaard ordered custom designed furniture for her Lord Mayor office at a price of 850,000 kroner (US$161,000).

It communicated with a Gandalf PACX crossbar in the machine room. Gandalf Technologies, or simply Gandalf, was a Canadian data communications company based in Ottawa. It was best known for their modems and terminal adaptors that allowed computer terminals to connect to a number of host computers through a single interface. The word Gandalf became synonymous with modem in the Soviet Union and a few other countries. Gandalf also pioneered a radio-based mobile data terminal that was popular for many years in taxi dispatch systems. The rapid rise of TCP/IP relegated many of Gandalf's products to niche status, and the company went bankrupt in 1997. History Gandalf was originally formed by Desmond Cunningham and Colin Patterson in 1971, and started business from the lobby of the Skyline Hotel, which is now the Crowne Plaza Hotel, on Albert Street in Ottawa. The company's first products were industrial-looking half-bridges for remote terminals which were supported by large terminal multiplexers on the \\"computer end\\". Gandalf referred to these systems as a \\"PACX\\", in analogy to the telephony PABX which provided similar services in the voice field. These systems allowed the user to \\"dial up\\" the Gandalf box and then instruct it what computer they wanted to connect to. In this fashion, large computer networks could be built in a single location using shared resources, as opposed to having to dedicate terminals to different machines. These systems were particularly popular in large companies and universities. Gandalf supplanted these systems with \\"true\\" modems, both for host-to-host use and for telecommuters. Unlike most modems, Gandalf's devices were custom systems intended to connect only to another Gandalf modem, and were designed to extract the maximum performance possible. They sold a number of different designs intended to be used with different line lengths and qualities, from 4-wire modems running at 9600 bit/s over \\"short\\" distances (bumped to 19,200 bit/s in later models), to 2400 bit/s models for 2-wire runs over longer distances. On the host-end, modem blocks could be attached to the same PACX multiplexers, making local and remote access largely identical. With the introduction of low-cost high-speed modems in the early 1990s, Gandalf increasingly became irrelevant. Even their highest-speed solutions were soon being outperformed by standardized systems like v.32bis. Low-cost terminal adapters based on RADIUS (and similar) technologies connecting to Ethernet further eroded their core businesses, offering features similar to their PACX switches. Gandalf's solutions were decidedly \\"low tech\\"; users selected what computer they wanted to connect to by selecting a two-digit number on the front of the modem, often requiring a \\"phone book\\" if more than one host computer was being used. In comparison, the more modern terminal adapters generally included a command line interface that allowed the user to select a host from a directory that appeared on their terminal. Introductions of Ethernet concentrators and ISDN-based versions of their earlier host adapters did little to fix the problem, never becoming very popular in comparison to the standardized solutions from other vendors. The company failed and went bankrupt in 1997. Mitel purchased all of the product business of Gandalf, including intellectual properties, the goodwill of the business including the exclusive right to use the name worldwide.(Gandalf Technologies Inc ¬∑ 8-K ¬∑ For 8/8/97, Item 2) Mitel did not actually buy the company because doing so would have meant taking on the company's substantial debts. Mitel used the data technology and personnel to help move its PBX division into the VoIP market. Mitel tried to keep some Gandalf data products in the market for a short time, but poor sales led to them being abandoned. Building legacy The impressive new Gandalf headquarters building at 130 Colonnade Road in Nepean, South of Ottawa was taken over by Nortel. When Nortel's finances took a bad turn, the building came into the hands of the Government of Canada, which used it for Health Canada, and later for the Public Health Agency of Canada, when it was created in 2004.

Frank BaumRaylyn Moore, Wonderful Wizard, Marvelous Land, Bowling Green, OH, Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1974; p. 117. and other authors. The name \\"Lurline\\" is a variant of Loreley, the Rhine nymph; the name has been used for ships, and has other associations. Lurline in L. Frank Baum's books =Descriptions in the Oz books= In the Oz mythos, Lurline is first mentioned in The Tin Woodman of Oz. She is the ethereal Queen and creator of the Fairies and is credited with enchanting the Land of Oz centuries ago so that it became a fairy country. Prior to this, Oz was just an ordinary country shut off from the rest of the world by four impassable deserts. After enchanting the country, Lurline left Princess Ozma to rule the country together with King Pastoria. Lurline is therefore a fundamental ingredient in the backstory or foundation myth of Oz; and as such she recurs in various subsequent Oz books -- as in Edward Einhorn's Paradox in Oz -- and is at least mentioned in others -- from Baum's Glinda of Oz to Dave Hardenbrook's The Unknown Witches of Oz. =Possible references in other series= In Baum's book, The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, the Queen of the Fairies is unnamed, and the Queen of the Wood Nymphs is named Zurline. Some debate exists among fans of the Oz books as to whether the unnamed Fairy Queen and Lurline are the same person. Queen Zixi of Ix depicts another Fairy Queen named Lulea, who is based in the Forest of Burzee, just as The Fairy Queen and Queen Zurline of the Wood Nymphs are. Lurline in Gregory Maguire's books Lurline also appears in Wicked, Gregory Maguire's 1995 revisionist novel set in Oz; she is sometimes called \\"Lurlina\\".

Her flamboyant personality and reputation for tyrannical behavior earned her the nickname Queen of Mean. After allegations of non-payment were made by contractors hired to improve Helmsley's Connecticut home, she was investigated and convicted of federal income tax evasion and other crimes in 1989. Although having initially received a sentence of sixteen years, she was required to serve only nineteen months in prison and two months under house arrest. During the trial, a former housekeeper testified that she had heard Helmsley say: \\"We don't pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes,\\" an aphorism which was identified with her for the rest of her life. Early life Leona Helmsley was born Lena Mindy Rosenthal in Marbletown, New York, to Polish-Jewish immigrants, Ida (n√©e Popkin), a homemaker, and Morris Rosenthal, a hatmaker. Her family moved to Brooklyn while she was still a girl, and moved six more times before settling in Manhattan. After dropping out of Abraham Lincoln High School to seek her fortune, she changed her name several times over a short period ‚Äì from Lee Roberts, Mindy Roberts, and Leni Roberts ‚Äì before finally going by Leona Mindy RobertsThe Queen of Mean from Court TV's Crime Library. and having her surname legally changed to Roberts. Roberts' first husband was attorney Leo Panzirer, whom she divorced in 1952. Their only son was Jay (1940‚Äì1982), who had four children with his wife, Mimi. Jay died of heart failure at age 42. Leona was twice married to and divorced from her second husband, garment industry executive Joseph Lubin. After a brief period at a sewing factory, she joined a New York real estate firm, where she eventually became vice-president. Roberts was a chain smoker, consuming several packs a day. She would later claim that she appeared in billboard ads for Chesterfield cigarettes, but her claim remains unsubstantiated. Career as a hotelier In 1968, while Roberts was working as a condominium broker, she met and began her involvement with the then-married real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. Two years later, she joined one of Harry's brokerage firms‚ÄîBrown Harris Stevens‚Äîas a senior vice- president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Harry divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. The marriage may well have saved her career, as several of her tenants had sued her the year before for forcing them to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Harry's growing hotel empire. Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut Supposedly under her influence, Harry began a program of conversion of apartment buildings into condos. He later concentrated on the hotel industry, building the Helmsley Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue. Together, the Helmsleys built a New York real estate empire that included 230 Park Avenue, the Empire State Building, and the Tudor City apartment complex on the East Side, as well as Helmsley-Spear Inc., their management and leasing business. The couple also developed properties that included the Helmsley Palace Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel, the Park Lane Hotel, and hotels in Florida and other states. By the beginning of 1989, twenty-three hotels in the chain were directly controlled by Leona Helmsley. Helmsley was featured in an advertising campaign portraying her as a demanding \\"queen\\" who wanted nothing but the best for her guests. The slightest mistake was usually grounds for firing, and Helmsley was known to shout insults and obscenities at targeted employees just before they were fired. On March 31, 1982, Helmsley's only child, Jay Panzirer, died of a heart attack resulting from arrhythmia. Her son's widow, who lived in a property that Helmsley owned, received an eviction notice shortly after his funeral. Helmsley successfully sued her son's estate for money and property that she claimed he had borrowed, and she was ultimately awarded $146,092. Tax-evasion conviction Despite the Helmsleys' net worth totalling over $1 billion, they were known for disputing payments to contractors and vendors. In 1983, the Helmsleys bought Dunnellen Hall, a 21-room mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, to use as a weekend retreat. The property cost $11 million, but the Helmsleys wanted to make it even more luxurious. The work included a $1 million dance floor, a silver clock and a mahogany card table. The remodeling bills came to $8 million, which the Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment; the Helmsleys eventually paid off most of the debt owed to the contractors. In 1985, during court proceedings in relation to the lawsuit, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the New York Post to prove that the Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting Post story led to a federal criminal investigation. Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, also alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley-Spear and, when McCarthy declined to do so, exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, \\"You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign what I tell you to sign.\\"New York Times, August 1989. In 1988, then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax- related charges, as well as extortion. The trial was delayed until the summer of 1989 due to numerous motions by the Helmsleys' attorneys, most of them related to Harry's health. He had begun to appear enfeebled shortly after the beginning of his relationship with Leona years before, and had recently suffered a stroke on top of a pre-existing heart condition. Ultimately, he was ruled mentally and physically unfit to stand trial, and Leona would face the charges alone. At trial, a former Helmsley-Spear executive, Paul Ruffino, said that he refused to sign phony invoices billing the company for work done on the Connecticut mansion. Ruffino, originally engaged to assist Harry through the Hospitality Management Services arm, said that Leona fired him on several occasions for refusing to sign the bills, only for Harry to usually tell him to ignore her and come back to work. Another one of the key witnesses was a former housekeeper at the Helmsley home, Elizabeth Baum, who recounted Leona telling her, \\"We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.\\"\\"Maid Testifies Helmsley Denied Paying Taxes: Says She Told Her 'Only the Little People Pay, Associated Press (AP), carried in New York Times, July 12, 1989, p.

By then, however, the trial was already highlighting her abusive and micromanaging behavior towards family members, employees, contractors, and even senior executives.

She was, however, acquitted of extortion‚Äîa charge that could potentially have sent her to prison for the rest of her life. Helmsley was instead sentenced to sixteen years in prison, which was eventually reduced when all but eight of the convictions were dropped. Nonetheless, when it was clear that she was going to prison, Helmsley collapsed outside the courthouse. She was later diagnosed with a heart irregularity and hypertension.

Helmsley was forced to give up control of her hotel empire, since most of her hotels had bars and New York does not allow convicted felons to hold alcohol licenses. She spent her final years at her penthouse atop the Park Lane Hotel. In 2002, Helmsley was sued by Charles Bell, a former employee who alleged that he was discharged solely for being gay. A jury agreed and ordered Mrs. Helmsley to pay Bell $11,200,000 in damages. A judge subsequently reduced this amount to $554,000. Although Helmsley had a reputation as the \\"Queen of Mean\\", some considered her generous in her charitable contributions after her prison term. After the 9/11 attacks, Helmsley donated $5 million to help the families of New York City firefighters and police.

It currently plays in Serie D.  History  = Football in Messina = The origins of the team go back to 1900, when Messina F.C. was founded in the city. The club has spent most of its existence in the lower Italian football leagues. They last competed in Serie B in 2007‚Äì08, which followed three consecutive seasons in Serie A. In July 2008, Messina were excluded from professional football due to financial issues, being later registered into amateur Serie D. The farthest Messina has reached in the Coppa Italia is the last 16. This was achieved in the 2000s decade. In the past, they have also reached the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia Serie C.Messina Story Messina have appeared in the Italy's top league, Serie A, for a total of five seasons. The club's first spell in the league was in the 1960s; the second began in the 2000s decade. The highest ever position they have finished is 7th,RSSSF.com which happened during the 2004‚Äì05 season.  From Messina F.C. to Giostra Messina (1900 to 1939)  The history of Messina Football Club began when Alfredo Marangolo returned to Sicily in August 1900 from studying in London, England. In Great Britain the game of football was fast gathering popularity with The Football League in its early stages. Messina Football Club were officially founded on 1 December 1900Messina Story by Marangolo with the help of Anglican reverend \\"Caulifield\\".Storia F.C. Messina At the college where Marangolo visited he had also made the acquaintance of Ignazio Majo Pagano who formed Anglo Palermitan (Palermo) on his return, only a month before Messina. The first Sicilian derby was held between Messina and Palermo on 18 April 1901; 1,000 fans turned out to Via Notarbartolo for the match. The game ended 3‚Äì2 to the Palermitan side.Messina Story A strong bond and a healthy rivalry had built up between the two Sicilian clubs and a competition named the Whitaker Challenge Cup was arranged to be played between them. The first was held in 1905; Messina won another game (3‚Äì2) and captured their first trophy. Messina repeated the feat the following year at San Ranieri, capturing the trophy in a 2‚Äì1 victory. Messina team photograph from 1910. The earthquake of 1908, which killed 60,000 people in Messina, later affected the club in a large manner; deaths included Charles Bousfield Huleatt, players Frank John Carter, Walter Oates and financial backer George H. Peirce. Football resumed in Messina the following year, thanks largely to Arthur Barret Lascelles who used his own money to ensure football activity in the city would continue. By 1910, the funds of Barret had dried up, and the club was folded, Societ√† Ginnastica Garibaldi Messina (Gymnastic Society Garibaldi Messina) briefly took its place, until it too was dissolved due to the First World War.Messina Calcio After World War I, a club under the name US Messinese was founded and entered the following year's Coppa Federale Siciliana, an all Sicilian championship contested in Messina, Catania and Palermo. Messina finished as runners-up. The club participated in the Italian Football Championship of 1921‚Äì22, organised by the C.C.I., finishing third in the Sicilian group section; this was the first championship in which clubs from the island were entered. The following season the FIGC and CCI were unified. This coincided with mergers in Messina, as another side, Umberto I Messina, was incorporated into US Messinese, and, therefore, the club changed its name to US Messinese Umberto I in October 1922. The following month this new side was fused again, this time with Messina Sporting Club; creating the Messina Football Club. Only two years later, in December 1924, FC Messina was melted, and the players became part of the reformed US Messinese.MessinaCalcio.net Finally, Messinese qualified for the semi-finals of the International League, after beating Palermo, 3‚Äì0, in the Sicilian championship of 1924‚Äì25. Here, Messinese played against Alba Roma, Cavese and Liberty Bari, but failed to win a single match, scoring only two goals in six games. Messina would be promoted to Serie B for the 1932‚Äì33 campaign under the presidency of Francesco Lombardo and Koenig's coaching and remained in the league for six seasons. The spell in Serie B was also notable for the local rivalry between them and Calcio Catania.

The following season, in 1941‚Äì42, a club named US Peloro 1906 changed its name and became US Mario Passamonte (named after a fallen hero of the war in Africa). The idea was to enter the club into Serie C in place of Messina. However this was unsuccessful, until the following season. It would not be long before all activity was halted in Italian football for World War II. After several mergers in 1945, including one between US Passamonte and AP Messina, the club AS Messina subsequently emerged as a post-war representative of Messina. This was not a clean cut merger. Some players and officials formed the rival club Giostra Messina. Both Giostra and AS Messina reached the finals of the Southern League but eventually finished fourth and fifth respectively.  A.C. Riunite Messina  In 1947, the two teams AS Messina and Giostra Messina were united as one merged club Associazioni Calcio Riunite Messina, abbreviated as AC Riunite Messina. The 1950s for Messina began in glorious fashion, they were crowned champions of Serie C under the management of Yugoslav manager Mihalj Balaƒçiƒá. Messina did not falter in Serie B. During their first season in the league they avoided relegation. Giuseppe Melazzo and the Comitato Reggenza owned the club during this new period of relative success. During the following season, Messina finished in third place. Throughout the rest of the 1950s, Messina remained in the division as a whole finishing in a respectable position. Goffredo Muglia took over as president in 1958, to begin a brand new era for the club. For the first time in their history, Messina were crowned champions of Serie B during the 1962‚Äì63 season. The race for the championship was a very close one and went down to the last day of the season, with Messina finishing above Bari and Lazio. For their first ever season in Serie A, the football squad for Messina included; Morelli, Brambilla, Stucchi, Pagani, Dotti, Peruvian Benitez, Ghelfi, Fascetti, Morbello, Canuti and Clerici. Messina's first game in Serie A took place on 15 September 1963. It ended in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Sampdoria at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. As a whole, the first part of the season was not a success. They won only two games, but they managed to turn it around in the second half of the season with 7 wins, beating Juventus (1‚Äì0), Fiorentina (1‚Äì0) and Sampdoria (4‚Äì3). The surge of wins in the latter part of the season helped them stay up, finishing 14th. The next season for the club in Serie A would not be so fortunate. They were relegated in 17th place. Some notable high points of the season included a 1‚Äì0 victory over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. A team from Rome would also be the opposition for Messina's other most impressive result of the season. They stunned Lazio, beating them, 4‚Äì0, on the last day of the season. The Sicilian side were not able to bounce straight back up into Serie A, and, in fact, after their third season back down in Serie B were relegated. After several seasons finishing in and around the top 10 positions of Serie C, Messina were relegated down to Serie D in the 1972‚Äì73 season. The club managed to bounce straight back, winning the Serie D championship and achieving promotion back into C. After a few decent seasons in the upper parts of the table, relegation struck Messina again. In the 1979 season Serie C2 was formed and Messina were placed into it. By 1983, Messina were champions of Serie C2 and had a future star amongst their ranks in Salvatore Schillaci. The club, now back on the right track, came close to promotion to Serie B in 1985 with a third-place finish just behind Palermo, and won Serie C1 and earned themselves promotion back to Serie B the following season. Time in Serie B during the 1980s, was a pleasant one for the Sicilian side. They notched seventh and eighth-place finishes. In 1989, Schillaci was sold to Turin giants Juventus, and, just three seasons after Schillaci's departure, Messina lost their position in Serie B and were relegated down to C1 and then spiraled into further trouble. The club finished 12th in Serie C1 in the 1992‚Äì93 season, but, due to financial difficulties, the FIGC cancelled all professional football activity for Messina. In 1993, it was included to Sicilian Promozione, and in 1994, it was admitted in Sicilian Eccellenza. In this league the club has played until 1998, when following the relegation in Sicilian Promozione, it was dissolved.  A.S. Messina  The decision was thought to be unjust by the club and fans, with Messina been thrown into a footballing abyss never known before. In the summer of 1993, A.S. Messina was founded with the president Pietro La Malfa, beginning in the amateurs national championship (C.N.D.) with the objective to bring back the giallorossi to professional football. They played in the Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti for four seasons, finishing high up for the first three of them, but in the 1996‚Äì97 season, they were ranked last and relegated to the Sicilian Eccellenza league. In the 1998‚Äì99 season, they were relegated to Sicilian Promozione and were dissolved.  From U.S. Peloro to F.C. Messina Peloro  In the summer of 1994, after the merger of Villafranca and Tremestieri, U.S. Peloro was founded. It played two seasons in Eccellenza Sicily, and in 1996, it was promoted to Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti (Serie D). Then, in the 1996 season, the club played in the same league as the town's other team, A.S. Messina, where it was ranked 6th. In July 1997, the club changed its name to Football Club Messina Peloro. In a few short seasons, the club ramped up the Italian league system, from Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti in the 1997‚Äì98 season, Messina were promoted into Serie C2 as champions. Promoted to Serie C1 in 2000, they immediately managed to fight hard for a promotion spot back to Serie B, winning promotion to Calcio Catania after play-offs. In less than a decade, under the presidency of Aliotta, Messina had climbed back up from the abyss and were back in the upper part of the Italian league system. After two seasons in Serie B, local entrepreneur Pietro Franza took over, and in 2003‚Äì04, the Sicilians gained promotion back into Serie A under coach Bortolo Mutti. The club had not appeared in the top Italian league since 1965, a total of forty years. After being tipped as underdogs in Serie A for the 2004‚Äì05 season, Messina surprised doubters by producing several good results including defeating both of the Milanese clubs, beating AC Milan first at San Siro 2‚Äì1,Channel4.com and then later in the season also with Internazionale, this time at home, for the first time in their history; the winning goal was struck by Rafael in the third minute of injury time.Channel4.com Messina managed to stay clear of relegation throughout the whole season, and eventually finished in seventh place in the table, just a single place away from securing a UEFA Cup place. Also during this period, for the first time in the club's history,Forza Azzurri Statistics Messina players were called up to the Italian national football team: first was Alessandro Parisi in 2004, then Carmine Coppola in 2005 who was called up twice by the azzurri. Despite this impressive form, Messina were still in danger of being relegated from Serie A at the end of the season, due to a possibility of not having enough finances available to compete in the league. Eventually, though, they successfully managed to stay in the Serie A league. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Messina were unable to repeat their previous impressive season, leading to the sacking of Mutti, who was replaced by Giampiero Ventura. Despite all, they looked to be mathematically relegated from the top division after Day 36. losing the derby against Reggina, 3‚Äì0. However, due to the Serie A scandal of 2006, Messina avoided relegation to Serie B despite finishing 18th. Messina started the 2006‚Äì07 season with Bruno Giordano as head coach; however, he was replaced on 30 January 2007, by Alberto Cavasin because of poor results. On 2 April, following a 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Cagliari, another team involved in the battle to avoid relegation, Cavasin was sacked, and Giordano was recalled to fill the coaching position. Giordano's record was even worse in his second time at Messina, with four defeats in four matches. With Messina second-last placed in the table five matchdays prior to the end of the season, Giordano was sacked again on 23 April, and replaced by Bruno Bolchi. Messina were relegated at the end of the season. After a quiet Serie B season in 2007‚Äì08, in July 2008 Messina chairman Pietro Franza announced he did not find any investor ready to take over the club and that he was consequently giving up the club's Serie B membership, declaring that he would look forward to enter the club into an amateur league. On 1 August, it was confirmed that Messina was admitted to Serie D. In November 2008, the Court of Messina declared the club to be bankrupt and appointed a trustee to start a search for potential investors.  A.C. Rinascita Messina  In March 2009, Rome-based entrepreneur Alfredo Di Lullo acquired Football Club Messina Peloro in a blind auction held by the Court of Messina in April 2009. The club was renamed A.C. Rinascita Messina (rinascita means \\"revived\\"). On 4 January 2011, the club was transferred to the group Martorano which on 14 August 2011, sold it to Raffaele \\"Lello\\" Manfredi. In June 2012, the club was acquired by a consortium led by prominent football manager Pietro Lo Monaco, former managing director at Serie A club Catania and one of the masterminds behind the club's rise into top flight in the 2000s. Messina finished 4th in Group I and qualified to the promotion playoffs in the 2011‚Äì12 season.

Built from 1808 to 1811, it was the first American immigration station (predating Ellis Island), where more than 8 million people arrived in the United States from 1855 to 1890. Over its active life, it has also functioned as a beer garden, exhibition hall, theater, and public aquarium. Castle Clinton National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Original use Castle Clinton stands slightly west of where Fort Amsterdam was built in 1626, when New York City was known by the Dutch name New Amsterdam. Fort Amsterdam was demolished by 1790 after the American Revolutionary War. Proposals for a new fort were made after two separate war scares involving Britain and France in the 1790s, but neither plan was ultimately carried out. By 1805, there were growing tensions between Britain and the U.S., which would mark the run-up to the War of 1812. Late that year, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams of the United States Army Engineers began planning a series of fortifications in New York Harbor. Williams was part of a group of three commissioners who, in 1807, submitted a report that recommended the construction of fortifications in New York Harbor. Castle Clinton, originally known as West Battery and sometimes as Southwest Battery, was built on a small artificial island just off shore. Construction began in 1808 and the fort was completed in 1811, though modifications continued through the 1820s. Designed by John McComb Jr. and Jonathan Williams, West Battery was roughly circular shaped with a radius of approximately , contained a red brick facade, and had 28 \\"thirty-two pounder\\" cannons. About one-eighth of the circle was left \\"unfinished\\", with a straight wall constructed between the \\"unfinished\\" segments. West Battery was intended to complement the three-tiered Castle Williams, the East Battery, on Governors Island. Though garrisoned in 1812, the fort never saw action in any war. By 1815, West Battery was renamed Castle Clinton, its current official name, in honor of New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton (who eventually became Governor of New York). The castle itself was converted to administrative headquarters for the Army. Simultaneously, at the end of the war, there was a public movement to build a park in the Battery area. A 1816 proposal to construct two small office buildings at Castle Clinton was canceled due to public opposition, and the castle lay dormant for three years. Even in 1820, it was only being used as a paymaster's quarters and storage area. The United States Army stopped using the fort in 1821, and it was ceded to the city by an act of Congress in March 1822. By then, the bridge leading to Castle Clinton was frequently used by fishermen who were catching fish from the bridge. 19th century =Exhibition hall= The Bay and Harbor of New York by Samuel Waugh (1814‚Äì1885), depicting the castle in 1848 First appearance of Jenny Lind in the U.S. at Castle Garden, September 11, 1850 (lithograph by Currier and Ives) The fort was leased to New York City as a place of public entertainment in June 1824. It opened as Castle Garden on July 3, 1824, a name by which it was popularly known for most of its existence. It served in turn as a promenade, beer garden/restaurant, exhibition hall, opera house, and theater. Designed as an open-air structure, it was eventually roofed over to accommodate these uses. In 1850, the castle was the site of two concerts given for charity by Swedish soprano Jenny Lind to initiate her American tour. A year later, European dancing star Lola Montez performed her notorious \\"tarantula dance\\" in Castle Garden. In 1853‚Äì54, Louis-Antoine Jullien, the eccentric French conductor and composer of light music, gave dozens of very successful concerts mixing classical and light music. The Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company notably staged the New York premieres of Gaetano Donizetti's Marino Faliero on June 17, 1851, and Giuseppe Verdi's Luisa Miller on July 20, 1854, at Castle Garden. Landfill was used to expand Battery Park during the 1860s, at which point the island containing the fort was incorporated into the rest of Manhattan Island. =Immigrant landing and registration depot= In the first half of the 19th century, most immigrants arriving in New York City landed at docks on the east side of the tip of Manhattan, around South Street. On August 1, 1855, Castle Clinton became the Emigrant Landing Depot, functioning as the New York State immigrant registration center (the nation's first such entity). It was operated by the state government until April 18, 1890,About.com, \\"Castle Garden ‚Äì America's First Official Immigration Center\\" when the U. S. government assumed control of immigration processing, soon moving the center to the larger, more isolated Ellis Island facility on January 2, 1892. After many unnecessary deaths, and scandals over immigration workers cheating and stealing from immigrants, the immigration control was taken over by the federal government and moved to Ellis Island. Most of Castle Clinton's original immigrant passenger records were destroyed in a fire that consumed the first structures on Ellis Island on June 15, 1897, but it is generally accepted that over 8 million immigrants (and perhaps as many as 10 million) were processed during its operation. Many of these records are still extant. Called ' by German immigrants and also by Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews, a ' became a generic term for any situation that was noisy, confusing or chaotic, or where a \\"babel\\" of languages was spoken (a reference to the multitude of languages heard spoken by the immigrants from many countries at the site). Prominent persons associated with the administration of the immigrant station included Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Friedrich Kapp, and John Alexander Kennedy. 20th century to present Aerial view illustration of Manhattan, showing Castle Garden at its tip, ca. 1880 The New York Aquarium was once housed at Castle Garden (image before 1923) From 1896 to 1941, Castle Garden was the site of the New York City Aquarium. For many years, it was the city's most popular attraction, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The structure was extensively altered and roofed over to a height of several stories, though the original masonry fort remained.History of The Battery, The Battery Conservancy. Retrieved December 1, 2014. In 1941, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Commissioner Robert Moses wanted to tear the structure down completely, claiming that this was necessary to build the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. To expedite construction of the tunnel, the city closed the New York Aquarium and moved its fish to other aquariums in September 1941. Moses advocated for the demolition of Castle Clinton, but preservationists who opposed Moses's proposed action asked a federal judge to grant an injunction to prevent demolition. Even though Moses initially got the injunction dismissed, the public outcry prevented his effort at demolition. However, the aquarium was closed and not replaced until Moses opened a new facility on Coney Island in 1957. Moses subsequently proposed creating a Fort Clinton memorial on the site, but would only keep Castle Clinton if the federal government agreed to pay for its restoration. Albert S. Bard, Walter D. Binger, and other civic reformers advocated to save the castle, which resulted in both houses of the United States Congress passing legislation to make the castle a U.S. historic monument. President Harry S. Truman signed the legislation on August 12, 1946. Although Castle Garden had been designated a national monument, the city still owned the property. In July 1947, the New York City Board of Estimate voted to demolish Castle Garden. However, the Board delayed the demolition for another year to allow the federal government to review the decision. In May 1948, the Board voted to demolish the castle for the sixth time in as many years. After another year of discussion, the New York State Assembly reversed its decision to allow the castle to be demolished. The federal government finally obtained the property on July 18, 1950, after the city deeded the land and castle to the federal government. A project to renovate Castle Clinton was announced in 1956 after funding had been secured. A major rehabilitation took place in the 1970s, and Castle Clinton reopened in 1975. It is currently administered by the National Park Service and is a departure point for visitors to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. In addition, the fort contains a small history exhibit and occasionally hosts concerts. Castle Clinton has largely been restored to its original appearance.

Architecture The PACX was a centralized switch that allowed serial connections from end users to be connected to any one of a number of computers, typically mainframes. Users were equipped with small boxes with two thumbwheels on them, and by rolling the wheels to a given two-digit number they could select among the machines connected to the PACX. In typical setups, the PACX would be connected to computer terminals or modems. The switch box would be queried on connection for the user's selection, and then a direct connection would be made between the user and that machine. The system was not unlike the telephone network, and the name PACX was deliberately chosen to suggest a computer-side analog of the PABX market. Background The PACX, with its mainframe utility, was part of an era in which enterprise data services were seen to the province of an Office Controller. The Office Controller was envisaged as a central switch which would interconnect and create all applications and make them available to users. PABX manufacturers of that era (the 1980s) created suites of data applications for the connection of users to mainframe applications. There were even magazine articles touting the victory of the PABX as an Office Controller over its LAN rivals. The PACX was a data PABX without the voice capability. With the development of LANs and cheap PCs with their attendant client/server applications, the Office Controller vision faded away. However the idea is not without merit. It is being re-established in new guises with the development of SIP with Session Border Controllers and Service Oriented Architectures.

The club was re-incorporated in 2020 after the bankruptcy of the previous legal person Robur Siena, which itself was the reincarnation of the original club Associazione Calcio Siena S.p.A.. A.C. Siena's predecessor was founded in 1904. Siena plays its home games at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. The ground's capacity is 15,373 and is located in the centre of Siena. History Formed in 1904 as Societ√† Studio e Divertimento (Society for Study and Entertainment), as a sports club characterised by a black and white striped jersey which was derived from the city of Siena coat of arms. It founded its football club, named Societ√† Sportiva Robur in 1908. Today, the name \\"Robur\\" is widely used by the local supporters to distinguish itself from the two basketball teams, \\"Mens Sana\\" and \\"\\". The team finally became known as Associazione Calcio Siena (A.C. Siena) in 1933‚Äì34. In 1934‚Äì35, Siena were promoted for the first time to Serie B. In the post-war 1945‚Äì46 season, Siena played in the top division of Italian football for the first time. During that season, a mixed wartime league was composed of both Serie A and Serie B teams. Some of the southern sides that took part in the top division, including Siena, were Serie B teams, while northern Serie B teams played at the second level with the Serie C teams. Therefore, although Siena played in the top division, it was not considered as having officially played in Serie A during that season and not having qualified for the National Round. Siena won the fourth tier league championship in 1955‚Äì56 as the Scudetto IV Serie. After having spent 55 years playing in several lower divisions, Siena were promoted back to Serie B for the start of the 2000‚Äì01 season. Following a good first up season in Serie B, the following season saw Siena in serious trouble and coach Giuseppe Papadopulo was sacked, although he would later be recalled and was able to save the club from relegation on the season's final matchday. The following season, again with Papadopulo as head coach, Siena were promoted to Serie A for the first time officially, led by players such as Rodrigo Taddei and Pinga. Their return marked 58 years since their last appearance in the top division of Italian football. In the 2003‚Äì04 campaign, the first Serie A season in the club's history, Siena finished in a respectable 13th place. In the 2004‚Äì05 Serie A campaign, with Luigi De Canio as head coach, Siena struggled for long periods of the season, languishing in the relegation zone for a great part of the campaign, and with the team drawing far too many games and barely recording any wins, they looked almost certain to be relegated. However, a resurgence of form towards of the end of the season gave them hope, and a 2‚Äì1 win against already relegated Atalanta on the last day saw them secure safety and an acceptable 14th place in the table. The 2005‚Äì06 season also saw Siena fighting hard and it successfully kept its place in Serie A. They ended the season in 17th place. For the 2006‚Äì07 season, Mario Beretta, who led Parma during the previous season, was appointed as new head coach. He kept Siena in Serie A after a 2‚Äì1 home win against Lazio in the final matchday. During the 2006‚Äì07 season, club chairman Paolo De Luca, who took over in 2001 and helped the club to their first historical Serie A promotion, started talks to sell the club to a conglomerate of Tuscan businessmen led by Giovanni Lombardi Stronati, chairman of Valle del Giovenco. The bid was finalised on 30 March 2007, one day before De Luca died after a long illness. The head coach for the 2007‚Äì08 campaign was expected to be Andrea Mandorlini, but he left the club by mutual consent on 12 November. Former coach Mario Beretta once again took charge. The club also explored the possibility of changing its denomination to include the name of their main sponsor, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. On 9 July 2007, the club announced it had changed their denomination to \\"A.C. Siena Montepaschi\\". However, the name change needed to be accepted by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) to become official: After the refusal by FIGC, this idea was abandoned. The club was then acquired by Massimo Mezzaroma, with Valentina Mezzaroma as vice- chairman. On 7 May 2011, Siena were once again promoted to Serie A after finishing second in the 2010‚Äì11 Serie B. The club's stint into the top flight lasted two seasons, as they were relegated after ending the 2012‚Äì13 Serie A in 19th place. Siena failed to register for 2014‚Äì15 Serie B on 15 July 2014, later announcing their bankruptcy. Former A.C. Siena chairman Massimo Mezzaroma was also sued by the prosecutor for false accounting in player swap (Rossi‚ÄìGaluppo) Eventually the club and Mezzaroma were inadmissible from the charge due to expiry of the legal proceeding. Nevertheless, Guardia di Finanza seized ‚Ç¨8.5 million from Mezzaroma for charges related to the bankruptcy. Robur Siena logo (2014-2020) In July 2014, thanks to the article 52 of N.O.I.F., the club was refounded under new legal person societ√† sportiva dilettantistica Robur Siena, restarting from 2014‚Äì15 Serie D. It was promoted to 2015‚Äì16 Lega Pro as champions of Group E in June 2015. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, Robur won the regional derby against Pisa at the Garibaldi Arena after 57 years and qualified for semifinal of Coppa Italia Lega Pro against Foggia, winning the first leg at home, 5‚Äì2. Due to the non-admission of Avellino, Bari and Cesena, Siena became one of the repechage candidates to 2018‚Äì19 Serie B on 1 August 2018. Siena finished as the runner-up in the 2017‚Äì18 Serie C promotion playoffs, as well as runner-up in the group stage, losing to Cosenza and Livorno respectively. However, after a lengthy legal battles, Serie B decided to leave the 3 spots vacate. Siena failed to register to Serie C after the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season, and the club was successively refounded as ACN Siena 1904 under the ownership of an Armenian group owning Armenian Premier League football club FC Noah.

In 2005 it published the HomePlug AV specification, which increased physical layer peak data rates from 14 to 200 Mbit/s. It approved and published the HomePlug Command and Control specification in 2007 and the HomePlug Green PHY specification in June 2010.HomePlug Powerline Alliance Inc. HomePlug AV White Paper.

Some HomePlug specifications target broadband applications such as in-home distribution of low data rate IPTV, gaming, and Internet content, while others focus on low-power, low throughput, and extended operating temperatures for applications such as smart power meters and in-home communications between electric systems and appliances. All of the HomePlug specifications were developed by the HomePlug Powerline Alliance, which also owns the HomePlug trademark. On 18 October 2016, the HomePlug Alliance announced that all of its specifications would be put into the public domain and that other organizations would be taking on future activities relating to deployment of the existing technologies. There was no mention in the announcement of any further technology development within the HomePlug community. History The HomePlug Powerline Alliance was formed to develop standards and technology for enabling devices to communicate with each other, and the Internet, over existing home electrical wiring. One of the greatest technical challenges was finding a way to reduce sensitivity to the electrical noise present on power lines. HomePlug solved this problem by increasing the communication carrier frequencies so that the signal is conveyed by the neutral conductor, which is common to all phases. The first HomePlug specification, HomePlug 1.0, was released in June 2001. The HomePlug AV (for audio-video) specification, released in 2005, increased physical layer (PHY) peak data rates from approximately 13.0 Mbit/s to 200 Mbit/s. The HomePlug Green PHY specification was released in June 2010 and targets Smart Energy and Smart Grid applications as an interoperable \\"sibling\\" to HomePlug AV with lower cost, lower power consumption and decreased throughput.‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions,‚Äù HomePlug Powerline Alliance, http://www.homeplug.org/about/faqs/ (accessed June 22, 2010). In 2010, the IEEE 1901 was approved and HomePlug AV, as baseline technology for the FFT-OFDM PHY within the standard, was now an international standard. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance is a certifying body for IEEE 1901 products. The three major specifications published by HomePlug (HomePlug AV, HomePlug Green PHY and HomePlug AV2) are interoperable and compliant. As of 2017, there are at least six chip vendors shipping HomePlug AV chipsets with IEEE 1901 support: Broadcom, Qualcomm Atheros, Sigma Designs, Intellon, SPiDCOM, and MStar. In 2011, the HomePlug Green PHY specification was adopted by Ford, General Motors, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche, and Volkswagen, as a connectivity standard for Plug-In Electrical Vehicle.Seven Auto Manufacturers Collaborate on Harmonized Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Solution, Newer versions of HomePlug support the use of Ethernet in bus topology via OFDM modulation that enables several distinct data carriers to coexist in the same wire. Also, HomePlug's OFDM technology can turn off (mask) any sub-carriers that overlap previously allocated radio spectrum in a given geographic region, thus preventing interference. In North America, for instance, HomePlug AV only uses 917 of 1155 sub-carriers. Usage Powerline networking in general means a network can be set up using a building's existing electrical wiring. For electric vehicle charging, the SAE J1772 standard plug-in electric vehicle charger also requires HomePlug Green PHY to establish communications over a powerline before the vehicle can begin to draw any charging power. All commercial HomePlug implementations meet the AES-128 encryption standard specified for advanced metering infrastructure by the US FERC. Accordingly, these devices are suitable to deploy as utility grade meters off the shelf with appropriate software. As of late 2012, the most widely deployed HomePlug devices are \\"adapters\\", which are standalone modules that plug into wall outlets (or power strips [but not surge protectors] or extension cords) and provide one or more Ethernet ports. In a simple home network, the Internet gateway router connects via Ethernet cable to a powerline adapter, which in turn plugs into a nearby power outlet. A second adapter, plugged into any other outlet in the home, connects via Ethernet cable to any Ethernet device (e.g., computer, printer, IP phone, gaming station). Communications between the router and Ethernet devices are then conveyed over existing home electrical wiring. More complex networks can be implemented by plugging in additional adapters as needed. A powerline adapter may also be plugged into a hub or switch so that it supports multiple Ethernet devices residing in a common room. Increasingly, the functionality found in standalone adapters is being built into end devices such as power control centers, digital media adapters, and Internet security cameras. It is anticipated that powerline networking functionality will be embedded in TVs, set-top boxes, DVRs, and other consumer electronics, especially with the emergence of global powerline networking standards such as the IEEE 1901 standard, ratified in September 2010. Several manufacturers sell devices that include 802.11n, HomePlug and four ports of gigabit ethernet connectivity for under US$100. Several are announced for early 2013 that also include 802.11ac connectivity, the combination of which with HomePlug is sold by Qualcomm Atheros as its Hy-Fi hybrid networking technology, an implementation of IEEE P1905. This permits a device to use wired ethernet, powerline or wireless communication as available to provide a redundant and reliable failover thought to be particularly important in consumer applications where there is no onsite expertise typically available to debug connections. Versions HomePlug 85 Mbit/s adapter =HomePlug 1.0= The first HomePlug specification, HomePlug 1.0, provides a peak PHY-rate of 14 Mbit/s. It was first introduced in June, 2001 and has since been replaced by HomePlug AV. On May 28, 2008 Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) incorporated HomePlug 1.0 powerline technology into the newly published TIA-1113 international standard. TIA-1113 defines modem operations on user-premises electrical wiring. The new standard is the world's first multi-megabit powerline communications standard approved by an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-accredited organization. The HomePlug 1.0 MAC Layer uses channel access based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to transport data from 46 to 1500 bytes long from encapsulated IEEE 802.3 frames as MAC Service Data Units (MSDUs) (so doesn't support jumbo frames). HomePlug 1.0 Turbo adapters comply with the HomePlug 1.0 specification but employ a faster, proprietary mode that increases the peak PHY-rate to 85 Mbit/s. HomePlug 1.0 Turbo modems were only available from Intellon Corporation. =HomePlug AV= The HomePlug AV specification, which was introduced in August 2005, provides sufficient bandwidth for applications such as HDTV and VoIP. HomePlug AV offers a peak data rate of 200 Mbit/s at the physical layer, and about 80 Mbit/s at the MAC layer. HomePlug AV devices are required to coexist, and optionally to interoperate, with HomePlug 1.0 devices. The physical layer uses OFDM carriers spaced at 24.414 kHz, with carriers from 2 to 30 MHz. Depending on the signal to noise ratio, the system automatically selects from BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM, 256 QAM, and 1024 QAM, on a carrier by carrier basis. Utilizing adaptive modulation on up to 1155 OFDM sub-carriers, turbo convolution codes for error correction, two-level MAC framing with ARQ, and other techniques, HomePlug AV can achieve near the theoretical maximum bandwidth across a given transmission path. For security reasons, the specification includes key distribution techniques and the use of 128 bit AES encryption. Furthermore, the specification's adaptive techniques present inherent obstacles to eavesdropping and cyber attacks. Some Qualcomm Atheros-based adapters comply with the HomePlug AV specification but employ a proprietary extension that increases the PHY-rate to 500 Mbit/s primarily by using a wider spectrum. =HomePlug AV2= The HomePlug AV2 specification was introduced in January 2012. It is interoperable with HomePlug AV and HomePlug GreenPHY devices and is IEEE 1901 standard compliant. It features gigabit- class PHY-rate, support for MIMO PHY, repeating functionalities and power saving modes.HomePlug AV2 Technology , Homeplug.org Can use the bandwidth from 30‚Äì86 MHz as additional bandwidth. The first generation are generally considered to be 20% faster than HomePlug AV 500, it is often sold as HomePlug 600. They do not support MIMO, but only single streams due to the Atheros chipset architecture (QCA7450/AR1540). October 2013 Qualcomm announced the QCA7500 with support for 2x2 MIMO which supposedly will double data transfer rates. In 2014, Qualcomm began production of the QCA7500. This device provided raw PHY rates of 1300 Mbps, with resultant data rates of 550 Mbps UDP and 500 Mbps TCP, full MIMO. Communication takes place on both the line‚Äìneutral and line‚Äìground power line pairs. Devolo from Germany has made proprietary improvements on the standard, and are using the ground wire in addition to phase (also known as hot or live) and null (also known as neutral). This technology is available world wide, though can only be used in territories that use the ground wire in their building wiring regulations. =HomePlug Green PHY= The HomePlug Green PHY specification is a subset of HomePlug AV that is intended for use in the smart grid. It has peak rates of 10 Mbit/s and is designed to go into smart meters and smaller appliances such as HVAC thermostats, home appliances and plug-in electric vehiclesHomePlug GreenPHY Overview Groups.homeplug.com so that data can be shared over a home network and with the power utility. High capacity broadband is not needed for such applications; the most important requirements are low power and cost, reliable communication, and compact size. GreenPHY uses up to 75% less energy than AV. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance worked with utilities and meter manufacturers to develop this 690-page specification.HomePlug GreenPHY Specs Homeplug.org HomePlug Green PHY devices are required to be fully interoperable with devices based on HomePlug AV, HomePlug AV2 and IEEE 1901 specification, which is considered to hamper their power consumption and cost reduction. The HomePlug silicon vendor QualComm announced commercially available Green PHY silicon on December 2011. HomePlug GreenPHY is the communication protocol used in the international electric vehicle charging standard CCS =HomePlug Access BPL= Access Broadband Power Line (BPL) refers to a to-the-home broadband access technology. The HomePlug Alliance formed the HomePlug Access BPL Working Group, whose first charter was to develop the Market Requirements Document (MRD) for a HomePlug Access BPL specification. The Alliance made an open invitation to the BPL industry to participate in the development of or provide input for consideration in the MRD. After several months of collaboration between utilities, ISPs and other BPL industry groups, the MRD was completed in June 2005. HomePlug's work on the Access BPL was subsequently contributed and merged into the IEEE 1901 standard. Security Since signals may travel outside the user's residence or business and be eavesdropped on, HomePlug includes the ability to set an encryption password. The HomePlug specification requires that all devices are set to a default out-of-box password although a common one. Users should change this password. If the password is not changed, an attacker can use their own homeplug device to detect the users signals, and then use the default password to access and change settings such as the encryption key used. On many new powerline adapters that come as a boxed pair, a unique security key has already been established and the user does not need to change the password, except when using these with existing powerline adapters, or adding new adapters to an existing network. Some systems support an authenticate button, allowing adapters to be added to the network with just two button presses (one of each of the devices). To simplify the process of configuring passwords on a HomePlug network, each device has a built-in master password, chosen at random by the manufacturer and hard-wired into the device, which is used only for setting the encryption passwords. A printed label on the device lists its master password. The HomePlug AV standard uses 128-bit AES, while the older versions use the less secure DES protocols. This encryption has no effect on the data the user sends or receives, and therefore higher level protocols and systems like TLS should still be used. Since HomePlug devices typically function as transparent network bridges, computers running any operating system can use them for network access. However, some manufacturers only supply the password-setup software in a Microsoft Windows version; in other words, enabling encryption requires a computer running Windows . Once the encryption password has been configured, any device supporting the ethernet specification will work on the adapter. Interoperability HomePlug AV, GP and AV2 are fully interoperable, and will also interoperate with IEEE 1901 devices. HomePlug 1.0 devices do not interoperate with HomePlug AV devices. Although it is technically possible to achieve such backward compatibility, doing so is not economically feasible because of the high cost of circuitry that would have to support different forward error correction (FEC) techniques and feature sets.EDN , Voices: Intellon‚Äôs Mark Hazen on the HomePlug AV powerline-networking alternative HomePlug devices will not interoperate with devices that employ other powerline technologies, such as Universal Powerline Association (UPA), HD-PLC, or G.hn. In the case of G.hn, it was deemed prohibitively expensive to implement both HomePlug's turbo coding forward error correction and G.hn's low density parity check (LDPC). However, IEEE 1901 allows co-existence within the same deployment of both HomePlug AV and HD-PLC via its Inter-System Protocol (ISP). G.hn also supports the ISP. HomePlug devices are not compatible with certain power strips, surge protectors, and uninterruptible power supplies incorporating filters, which block the high-frequency signal. In such cases, the installer must plug devices directly into building electrical receptacles. If a spare power point is not available, a double adapter can be used in many cases with the incompatible device on one side and the HomePlug device on the other. EMI concerns One of the concerns with all powerline systems, when compared to dedicated data wiring, is that the route of the wiring is not known in advance, and is generally already optimized for power transmission. This means that there will be situations where the system will radiate a significant fraction of the energy, in the form of radio frequency interference, or be vulnerable to the ingress of external signals. Given that the shortwave band is used both by low-power long-range telemetry and high- power broadcast signals, this is a potentially serious drawback. To attempt to minimize the effects of incoming interference and frequency-dependent path losses, the HomePlug standard requires each node to maintain 'tone maps' updates during operation, so the equipment 'learns' to avoid certain troublesome frequencies and to put more data onto those frequencies that exhibit a low loss. However, while this mitigates against ingress, if there is sensitive receiving equipment nearby then there is no easy way to tell the HomePlug apparatus to 'turn down' the radiated interference. In comparison to the received signals in a radio communication equipment, the signal levels in a powerline system are quite high. Typically the power density is ‚àí50dBm per Hz, as each carrier occupies a channel of 24 kHz, each carrier is injected at a level of ‚àí6.6dBm (220 microwatts), making the total full channel power 24dBm, (250 milliwatts). Typical short wave radio receiver sensitivities are at ‚àí100dBm (tenths of a picowatt) level. In the UK there have been suggestions that users of powerline equipment should be prosecuted under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, if they cause interference to official radio systems. Also GCHQ has published concerns that such interference affects its ability to monitor radio activity in the UK.

His eight short novels, partly inspired by the London aesthetes of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, consist largely of dialogue, with references to religion, social-climbing, and sexuality. Biography Arthur Annesley Ronald Firbank was born on 17 January 1886, in Clarges Street, Westminster, the son of a Member of Parliament, Sir Thomas Firbank, and Lady Firbank, n√©e Harriet Jane Garrett. He had an older brother, Joseph Sydney (born 1884), a younger brother, Hubert Somerset (born 1887), and a sister, Heather (born 1888).Benkovitz, M. J. (1969). Ronald Firbank. A Biography. Alfred A.

London: Duckworth. and then on to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1907. In 1909 he left Cambridge without taking a degree. Living off his inheritance, he travelled around Spain, Italy, the Middle East, and North Africa. Openly gayLevant, Oscar (1968). The Unimportance of being Oscar, Putnam, pp. 158-159. and chronically shy, he was an enthusiastic consumer of alcohol and cannabis. He died of lung disease in Rome, aged 40, and is buried in the Campo Verano cemetery.Firbank's grave may be found in Riquadro (Section) 38 of the Reparto Stranieri (Foreigners Section) in Campo Verano. His official record on the cemetery office computer states that this is the 'Rep Stranieri Anglicani' (Anglican Foreigners Section), but Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff is buried (in a communal grave) in the same section, and his official record states that it is the 'Reparto Stranieri Cattolici = Zona Inglese' (Catholic Foreigners Section, English Zone), so it would appear that Section 38 was used for both Anglicans and Catholics. Work Drawing of Ronald Firbank, by Augustus John Firbank published his first story, \\"Odette d'Antrevernes\\", in 1905, before going up to Cambridge. He then produced a series of novels, from The Artificial Princess (written in 1915, published posthumously in 1934) and Vainglory (1915, his longest work) to Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli (1926, also posthumous). Inclinations (1916) is set mainly in Greece, where the fifteen-year-old Mabel Collins is travelling with her chaperone, Miss O'Brookomore. Mabel elopes with an Italian conte, but the plot is of minor importance and the interest, as with all Firbank's work, lies in the dialogue. His next novel Caprice followed in 1917. Valmouth (1919) is based on the lives of various people in a health resort on the West Coast of England; most of the inhabitants are centenarians, and some are older (\\"the last time I went to the play...was with Charles the Second and Louise de Querouaille, to see Betterton play Shylock\\"). The inconsequential plot is concerned with the attempts of two elderly ladies, Mrs Hurstpierpoint and Mrs Thoroughfare, to marry off the heir to Hare-Hatch House, Captain Dick Thoroughfare. Captain Thoroughfare, who is engaged to a black woman, Niri- Esther, is loved frantically by Thetis Tooke, a farmer's daughter, but prefers his 'chum', Jack Whorwood, to both of them. Meanwhile Mrs Yaj√±avalkya, a black masseuse, manages an alliance between the centenarian Lady Parvula de Panzoust and David Tooke, Thetis's brother. A musical comedy of 1958 by Sandy Wilson gave the novel some popularity in the 1960s, and has been revived several times and recorded on CD. This was followed by a story, \\"Santal\\" (1921), that describes an Arab boy's search for God. In his next novel, The Flower Beneath The Foot (1923), the setting is an imaginary country somewhere in the Balkans. The characters include the King and Queen, sundry high-born ladies about the Court, and the usual attendant chorus of priests and nuns. Sorrow in Sunlight (1924), renamed Prancing Nigger at the suggestion of the American publisher but first published in Britain under the author's original title, was especially successful in America. It is set in a Caribbean republic (compounded of Cuba and Haiti). A socially ambitious black family move from their rural home to the capital, and the story is concerned with their attempts, which prove mainly abortive, to 'get into society'. Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli (1926) begins with the Cardinal christening a dog in his cathedral ('And thus being cleansed and purified, I do call thee \\"Crack\\"!') and ends with His Eminence dying of a heart attack while chasing, naked, a choirboy around the aisles. Firbank's play The Princess Zoubaroff (1920) has been compared to William Congreve, but is rarely produced. Dame Edith Evans, perhaps the greatest British actress of her time, played the title part in a radio production in 1964. The dialogue is highly characteristic: for example, Princess Zoubaroff says: \\"I am always disappointed with mountains. There are no mountains in the world as high as I would wish... They irritate me invariably. I should like to shake Switzerland.\\" Firbank's Complete Short Stories were published in a single volume in 1990 edited by Steven Moore, and his Complete Plays in 1991 in a volume containing The Princess Zoubaroff, \\"The Mauve Tower\\" and \\"A Disciple from the Country\\". Ronald Firbank left among his manuscripts the first few characteristic chapters of a novel set in New York, The New Rythum (sic), published in 1962 after a sale of many of his manuscripts and letters. Critical reception His novels have been championed by many English novelists including E. M. Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Alan Hollinghurst and Simon Raven. The poet W. H. Auden praised him highly in a radio broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in June 1961 (the text of the broadcast was published in The Listener of 8 June 1961). Susan Sontag named his novels as part of \\"the canon of camp\\"Kiernan, Robert F. (1990). Frivolity Unbound. Six Masters of the Camp Novel: Thomas Peacock, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Firbank, E. F.

This strategy often led to the deaths of many country-dwelling people, such as its involvement with the Holodomor famine. The term is commonly associated with war communism during the Russian Civil War when it was introduced by the Bolshevik government. However, Bolsheviks borrowed the idea from the grain razvyorstka introduced in the Russian Empire in 1916 during World War I. World War I grain razvyorstka 1916 saw a food crisis in the Russian Empire. While the harvest was good in Lower Volga Region and Western Siberia, its transportation by railroads collapsed. Additionally, the food market was in disarray as fixed prices for government purchases were unattractive. A decree of November 29, 1916 signed by Aleksandr Rittich of the Ministry of Agriculture introduced razvyorstka as the collection of grain for defense purposes. The Russian Provisional Government established after the February Revolution of 1917 could not propose any incentives for peasants, and their state monopoly on grain sales failed to achieve its goal.. , where Rittich reports on the introduction and results of the grain razvyorstka. Soviet prodrazvyorstka A Bolshevik prodotryad in Ukraine, 1919 In 1918 the center of Soviet Russia found itself cut off from the most important agricultural regions of the country - at this stage of the Russian Civil War the White movement controlled many of the traditional food-producing areas. Reserves of grain ran low, causing hunger among the urban population, from which the Bolshevik government received its strongest support. In order to satisfy minimal food needs, the Soviet government introduced strict control over the food surpluses of prosperous rural households. Since many peasants were extremely unhappy with this policy and tried to resist it, they were branded as \\"saboteurs\\" of the bread monopoly of the state and advocates of free \\"predatory\\", \\"speculative\\" trade. Vladimir Lenin believed that prodrazvyorstka was the only possible way - in the circumstances - to procure sufficient amounts of grain and other agricultural products for the population of the cities during the civil war.. Before prodrazvyorstka, Lenin's May 9, 1918 decree (\\"–û –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏–∫—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Ä–µ\\") introduced the concept of \\"produce dictatorship\\". This and other subsequent decrees ordered the forced collection of foodstuffs, without any limitations, and used the Red Army to accomplish this. A decree of the Sovnarkom introduced prodrazvyorstka throughout Soviet Russia on January 11, 1919. The authorities extended the system to Ukraine and Belarus in 1919, and to Turkestan and Siberia in 1920. In accordance with the decree of the People's Commissariat for Provisions on the procedures of prodrazvyorstka (January 13, 1919), the number of different kinds of products designated for collection by the state (some historians call it an outright confiscation) was calculated on the basis of the data on each guberniya's areas under crops, crop capacity and the reserves of past years. Within each guberniya, the collection plan was broken down between uyezds, volosts, villages, and then separate peasant households. The collection procedures were performed by the agencies of the People's Commissariat for Provisions and prodotryads (singular: –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥, food brigades) with the help of kombeds (–∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –±–µ–¥–Ω–æ—Ç—ã, committees of the poor) and of local Soviets. Initially, prodrazvyorstka covered the collection of grain and fodder. During the procurement campaign of 1919‚Äì20, prodrazvyorstka also included potatoes and meat. By the end of 1920, it included almost every kind of agricultural product. According to Soviet statistics, the authorities collected 107.9 million poods (1.77 million metric tons) of grain and fodder in 1918-19, 212.5 million poods (3.48 million metric tons) in 1919-20, and 367 million poods (6.01 million metric tons) in 1920-21\\\\. Prodrazvyorstka allowed the Soviet government to solve the important problem of supplying the Red Army and the urban population, and of providing raw materials for various industries. Prodrazvyorstka left its mark on commodity-money relations, since the authorities had prohibited selling of bread and grain. It also influenced relations between the city and the village and became one of the most important elements of the system of war communism. As the Russian Civil War approached its end in the 1920s, prodrazvyorstka lost its actuality, but it had done much damage to the agricultural sector and had caused growing discontent among peasants. As the government switched to the NEP (New Economic Policy), a decree of the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1921 replaced prodrazvyorstka with prodnalog (food tax).

This configuration was developed in Bermuda in the 17th century; the term Marconi, a reference to the inventor of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi, became associated with this configuration in the early 20th century because the wires that stabilize the mast of a Bermuda rig reminded observers of the wires on early radio masts. Description 17th Century woodcut of a Bermudian vessel with early Bermuda rig (before the addition of a boom) The rig consists of a triangular sail set aft of the mast with its head raised to the top of the mast; its luff runs down the mast and is normally attached to it for its entire length; its tack is attached at the base of the mast; its foot (in modern versions of the rig) controlled by a boom; and its clew attached to the aft end of the boom, which is controlled by its sheet.Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations, by George Drower. The History Press. 1 May 2011. Originally developed for smaller Bermudian vessels, and ultimately adapted to the larger, ocean-going Bermuda sloop, the Bermuda sail is set as the mainsail on the main mast. The Bermuda rigging has largely replaced the older gaff rigged fore-and-aft sails, except notably on schooners. The traditional design as developed in Bermuda features very tall, raked masts, a long bowsprit, and may or may not have a boom. In some configurations such as the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy vast areas of sail are achieved with this rig. Elsewhere, however, the design has omitted the bowsprit, and has otherwise become less extreme. A Bermuda rigged sloop with a single jib is known as a Bermuda sloop, a Marconi sloop, or a Marconi rig. A Bermuda sloop may also be a more specific type of vessel such as a small sailing ships traditional in Bermuda which may or may not be Bermuda rigged. The foot of a Bermuda sail may be attached to the boom along its length, or in some modern rigs the sail is attached to the boom only at its ends. This modern variation of a Bermuda mainsail is known as a loose- footed main. In some early Bermudian vessels, the mainsails were attached only to the mast and deck, lacking booms. This is the case on two of the three masts of the newly built Spirit of Bermuda, a replica of an 1830s British Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Additional sails were also often mounted on traditional Bermudian craft, when running down wind, which included a spinnaker, with a spinnaker boom, and additional jibs. The main controls on a Bermuda sail are: * The cunningham tightens the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. *The halyard used to raise the head, and sometimes to tension the luff. *The outhaul used to tension the foot by hauling the clew towards the end of the boom. *The sheet used to haul the boom down and towards the center of the boat. *The vang or kicking strap which runs between a point partway along the boom and the base of the mast, and is used to provide a downward force on the boom, which helps to prevent excessive twist in the leach, particularly when reaching or running. History tacking in Bermuda's waters. The development of the rig is thought to have begun with fore-and-aft rigged boats built by a Dutch-born Bermudian in the 17th Century. The Dutch were influenced by Moorish lateen rigs introduced during Spain's rule of their country. The Dutch eventually modified the design by omitting the masts, with the yard arms of the lateens being stepped in thwarts. By this process, the yards became raked masts. Lateen sails mounted this way were known as leg-of-mutton sails in English. The Dutch called a vessel rigged in this manner a bezaanjacht (nl). A bezaan jacht is visible in a painting of King Charles II arriving in Rotterdam in 1660. After sailing on such a vessel, Charles was so impressed that his eventual successor, the Prince of Orange presented him with a copy of his own, which Charles named Bezaan. The rig had been introduced to Bermuda some decades before this. Captain John Smith reported that Captain Nathaniel Butler, who was the governor of Bermuda from 1619 to 1622, employed the Dutch boat builder, Jacob Jacobsen, one of the crew of a Dutch frigate which had been wrecked on Bermuda, who quickly established a leading position among Bermuda's boat makers, reportedly building and selling more than a hundred boats within the space of three years (to the resentment of many of his competitors, who were forced to emulate his designs).Sailing in Bermuda: Sail Racing in the Nineteenth Century, by J.C. Arnell, 1982. Published by the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club. Printed by the University of Toronto Press.Ships, slaves and slipways: towards an archaeology of shipbuilding in Bermuda, by Paul Belford. The Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda's boats such: With tripple corner'd Sayls they always float, About the Islands, in the world there are, None in all points that may with them compare. Ships with somewhat similar rigs were in fact recorded in Holland during the 17th century. These early Bermuda rigged boats evidently lacked jibs or booms, and the masts appear not to have been as robust as they were to become (a boat rigged with a Bermuda or gaff mainsail and no jib would today be known as a catboat). In 1675, Samuel Fortrey, of Kew, wrote to the naval administrator and Member of Parliament, Samuel Pepys, a treatise entitled Of Navarchi, suggesting the improvement of the Bermoodn rig with the addition of a boom, but evidently nothing came of this. Bermudian builders did introduce these innovations themselves, though when they first appeared has been lost to record.Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations, by George Drower. The History Press. 1 May 2011. We invented the international 'modern' Rig, by Dr. Edward C. Harris, MBE, Executive Director of the Bermuda Maritime Museum. The Royal Gazette, Hamilton, Bermuda By the 19th century, the design of Bermudian vessels had largely dispensed with square topsails and gaff rig, replacing them with triangular main sails and jibs. The Bermuda rig had traditionally been used on vessels with two or more masts, with the gaff rig favoured for single-masted vessels. The reason for this was the increased height necessary for a single mast, which led to too much canvas. The solid wooden masts at that height were also too heavy, and not sufficiently strong. This changed when the boats began to be raced in the early 19th century. H. G. Hunt, a naval officer (and possibly the Henry G. Hunt who was the Acting Governor of Bermuda in 1835) concluded in the 1820s that a single-masted sloop would be superior to the schooner he had been racing and was proved correct when the yacht he had commissioned won a secret race against a schooner the night before a public race, and the public race itself the following day. Single-masted sloops quickly became the norm in Bermudian racing, with the introduction of hollow masts and other refinements. The colony's lightweight Bermuda cedar vessels were widely prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, raked masts and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels of all sizes to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels it is very much less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas. The term Marconi rig was first applied to the tall Bermuda rig used on larger racing yachts, such as the J class used since 1914 for the America's Cup international yacht races, as - with the many supporting cables required - it reminded observers of Guglielmo Marconi's mast-like wireless antennas (Marconi's first demonstrations in the United States took place in the autumn of 1899, with the reporting of the America's Cup at New York). Although sometimes treated as interchangeable with Bermuda rig generally, some purists insist that Marconi rig refers only to the very tall Bermuda rig used on yachts like the J-class.

The name is also given locally to a wide variety of American fishes. She was later transferred to Turkey where she served as TCG G√ºr (S 334). Operational history =USS Chub= SS-329, originally named Bonaci, was renamed Chub on 24 September 1942 and launched 18 June 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. T. A. Risch; and commissioned 21 October 1944, Commander C. D. Rhymes, Jr., in command.  First war patrol, February ‚Äì April 1945  Chub reached Pearl Harbor from New London 24 January 1945, and after final training, put to sea for action waters 13 February. Her first war patrol, in Tonkin Gulf and the Java and South China Seas, found her skill and determination tried in four hairbreadth escapes from destruction. On 3 March, she was attacked by an enemy submarine whose torpedoes she evaded. On 29 March, she began a long surface chase after an escort group, which she carried through the next day, even though forced six times to go deep by enemy aircraft. On their last pass, they dropped bombs, a clear indication that Chub's chase must be broken off. The next day she was off Yulikan Bay, and while American and Japanese planes fought in the skies above, Chub rescued three downed pilots as they and she were strafed. With two Japanese patrol craft looming out of the harbor, Chub raced away. On 12 April, Chub was bombed by an enemy patrol plane as the submarine dove. Bomb damage caused a temporary loss of power, and with depth control lost, Chub broached. Fortunately, the aircraft had apparently dropped its entire load on the first run.  Second and third war patrols, May ‚Äì August 1945  Chub put into Fremantle, Australia to repair and refit from 18 April 1945 to 14 May, and then sailed for the Java Sea and her second war patrol. During this patrol, she attacked two freighters, and sank the minesweeper W-34 which had come out hunting for her. The damage already done to Japanese shipping made targets few by this time, and Chub put into Subic Bay from 21 June to 15 July to refit. Her third war patrol found her again in the Java Sea, sinking a number of small craft, although again and again attacked by the remnant of Japanese air strength. Returning to Fremantle 17 August, she sailed on to Subic Bay for training through the remainder of 1945, then returned to the West Coast.  1946 ‚Äì 1947  During 1946, Chub operated from Pearl Harbor, her new home port, visiting the west coast for necessary overhaul. Between 12 November 1946 and 14 February 1947, she served in the Far East, making a simulated war patrol, and training with the 7th Fleet. During late 1947, she joined in a training cruise in Alaskan waters, and voyaged from Seattle to San Francisco with reservists on board for training. After overhaul at San Francisco she put to sea 4 March 1948 to call at New London, then crossed the Atlantic and Mediterranean to ƒ∞zmir, Turkey, arriving 11 May. She was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 23 May 1948.  Honors and awards  Chub received three battle stars for World War II service by reason of her three \\"successful\\" war patrols. She is credited with having sunk a total of 4,200 tons of shipping. = TCG G√ºr= The ex-Chub was transferred to Turkey on 25 May 1948, and was commissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG G√ºr (S 334).

Due to various ingredients (including medicine containing extract of nightshade, a live bat, and fresh blood getting into the machine) being combined, the machine itself has become possessed by a demon. The story ends after the detective and his friend underestimate the demon's power, and in seeking to exorcise the machine, instead goad it into ripping free of its moorings and prowling the streets in search of fresh prey.  Adaptations  This story was adapted for the screenplay of a 1995 film (directed by Tobe Hooper) of the same title, though the brevity of the source material required significant additions not present in the original tale. The film, starring Robert Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame), was followed by two sequels, The Mangler 2 and The Mangler Reborn.

By it the Penn family and proprietors claimed an area of 1,200,000 acres (4,860 km2) along the northern reaches of the Delaware River at the northeastern boundary between the Province of Pennsylvania and the West New Jersey area to the east of the Province of New Jersey (later after the American Revolutionary War [1775‚Äì1783], as the State of New Jersey) and forced the Lenape to vacate it. The Lenape appeal to the Iroquois Indian tribe further north for aid on the issue was refused. In the legal suit / court case of Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania (2004), the Delaware nation (one of three later federally recognized Lenape tribes) and its descendants in the 21st century claimed of land included in the original so-called \\"purchase\\" in 1737, but the U.S. District Court granted the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss. It ruled that the case was nonjusticiable, although it acknowledged that Indian title appeared to have been extinguished by fraud. This ruling held through several appealed actions made through several levels of the United States courts of appeals. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear the case which had the effect of upholding the lower appeals courts' decision. History The Founder of the Colony William Penn (1644‚Äì1718) in 1681, enjoyed a reputation for fair-dealing with the Lenape (including the Delaware Indians). However, his heirs, John Penn (\\"the American\\") and Thomas Penn, abandoned many of the elder father Penn's moderate practices. In 1736, they claimed a deed from 1686 by which the Lenape promised to sell a tract beginning at the junction of the upper Delaware River and the tributary Lehigh River (near modern Easton, Pennsylvania) and extending as far west as a man could walk in a day and a half, later to become known as the \\"Walking Purchase\\" or the Walking Treaty of 1737. This document may have been an unsigned, unratified treaty, or even an outright forgery (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica refers to it as a \\"land swindle\\").\\"Walking-Purchase\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Penns' agents began selling land in the Lehigh Valley in the disputed area along the Lehigh River to colonists while the Lenape still inhabited the area. To allay the Lenapes' misgivings and suspicions, Penn Land Office Agent and provincial secretary, James Logan (1674‚Äì1751), produced a map incorrectly misrepresenting the farther Lehigh River as the relatively closer Tohickon Creek, and including a dotted line showing a seemingly reasonable path that the \\"walkers\\" would take. Satisfied that the land in question was not so terrible a price to honor the old deed, the Lenape finally signed. According to the popular account, Lenape leaders assumed that about 40 miles (60 km) was the longest distance that could be covered under these conditions. Provincial Secretary Logan hired the three fastest runners in the colony, Edward Marshall, Solomon Jennings and James Yeates, to run on a prepared trail. They were supervised during the \\"walk\\" by the Sheriff of Bucks County Timothy Smith. The walk occurred on September 19, 1737; only Marshall finished,Gilbert, Daniel. \\"What Ye Indians Call 'Ye Hurry Walk'\\", The Pennsylvania Center for the Book, Pennsylvania State University reaching the modern vicinity of present-day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (113 km) away. At the end of the walk, Sheriff Smith drew a perpendicular line back toward the northeast, and claimed all the land east of these two lines ending at the Delaware River. This resulted in an area of 1,200,932 acres (4,860 km2), roughly equivalent to the size of Rhode Island, located in the modern seven counties of eastern Pennsylvania as: Pike, Monroe, Carbon, Schuylkill, Northampton, Lehigh and Bucks. The Delaware leaders appealed for assistance to the Iroquois confederacy tribe to the north, who claimed hegemony over the Delaware. The Iroquois leaders decided that it was not in their best interest politically to intervene on behalf of their southern neighbors the Delaware. Pennsylvania provincial secretary James Logan had already made a deal with the Iroquois to support the colonial side. As a result, the Lenape had to soon vacate the Walking Purchase lands. Chief Lappawinsoe and other Lenape leaders continued to protest the arrangement, as the Lenape were forced into the Shamokin and Wyoming River valleys, already crowded with other displaced tribes. Some Lenape later moved further west into the Ohio Country and the southern and western claims of the Kingdom of France in their territory of New France (Quebec), west of the French Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt and later still Pittsburgh) at the \\"Forks of the Ohio\\". Because of the Walking Purchase, the Lenape grew to distrust the Pennsylvania government, and its once good reputation with the various tribes begun by the wise and peaceful William Penn was lost forever. Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania =District Court (2004)= Chief Lappawinsoe, c. 1735 In 2004, the Delaware Nation filed suit against Pennsylvania in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking included in the 1737 Walking Purchase and patented in 1741, which was known as \\"Tatamy's Place.\\" The court granted the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss.Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania, 2004 WL 2755545 (E.D. Pa. 2004). According to the District Court: The District Court recounted its understanding of the facts of the Walking Purchase: The Delaware conceded that Thomas Penn had \\"sovereign authority,\\" but challenged the transaction on the ground that it was fraudulent. The court held that the justness of the extinguishment of aboriginal title is nonjusticiable, including in the case of fraud. Because the extinguishment occurred prior to the passage of the first Indian Nonintercourse Act in 1790, that Act did not avail the Delaware. =Circuit Court (2006)= The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court.Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania, 446 F.3d 410 (3d Cir. 2006). The Third Circuit upheld that aboriginal title may validly be extinguished by fraud, and further held that the tribe had waived the issue of whether Penn was actually a sovereign purchaser. Moreover, the Circuit held that any grants to the tribe subsequent to the extinguishment could not re- establish aboriginal title. Therefore, the Circuit did not consider the merits of the tribe's argument that: Specifically, the Circuit found it insufficient that the complaint had alleged that Penn was \\"accountable directly to the King of England.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case on appeal.Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania, 549 U.S. 1071 (2006).

Originally populated by British loyalists fleeing the newly independent United States of America in 1785, it has survived on fishing, boat building, and salvage. Its main village of Hope Town surrounds a protected harbor with a noted red-and-white-striped lighthouse built in 1863. On September 1, 2019, Elbow Cay took a direct hit from Category 5 Hurricane Dorian, with sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). The lighthouse survived. Geography Panorama from the Elbow Cay lighthouse in Abaco, Bahamas Elbow Cay is located about east of Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island. Most visitors fly into Marsh Harbour and take the ferry to either Hope Town at the Northern end of Elbow Cay or White Sound, a mid-island harbour and settlement developed in 1960. At the Southern end of the island is Tahiti Beach near Doros Cove. The Atlantic Ocean runs along the entire Eastern coast of Elbow Cay, while the South Abaco Sound is on the western coast. Elbow Cay is between Man-O-War Cay to the north and Tiloo Cay to the south. Lubbers Quarters Cay is west of the southern End of Elbow Cay. History Although visited by Lucayan Indians earlier, the first known permanent residents arrived in 1785 in what was known as Great Harbour. Wyannie Malone, originally from Charleston, South Carolina and other British Loyalists left the United States for the nearest British territory in the Bahamas. Elbow Cay and the Abacos were very isolated until the Marsh Harbour Airport was built in 1959. Before that, the residents survived by fishing, limited trading, and salvage of ships wrecked on Elbow Reef. Since then, contact with the outside world has brought in additional residents and tourism. Hopetown originally served as the administrative centre of the Abacos, until it switched over to Marsh Harbour in the 1960s.History of the Abacos Today Hopetown is the largest settlement which contains several grocery stores including Vernons Grocery run by a descendant of Wyannie Malone,\\"Happy to be Elbowed Out of the Way\\", James Owen, Telegraph.co.uk, January 21, 2002 rental properties and restaurants.

Further south, there are more residences and rental properties spread out along the roads to the narrow part of the island near White Sound. The Abaco Inn and Seaspray properties offer rooms and restaurants. At the Southern end of the island is Tahiti Beach with a beautiful sand beach and nearby snorkelling in Tiloo Cut, the inlet separating Elbow Cay from Tiloo Cay. There is telephone service, but most residents depend on the VHF radios to communicate.\\"Quiet Perch in a Scattering of Islands\\", Amy Harmon, New York Times, April 22, 2001 Hurricanes Elbow Cay suffered significant damage in 1999 from Hurricane Floyd. It nearly cut a new inlet near White Sound. The road remains damaged to this day. On September 1, 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Elbow Cay at 16:40 UTC with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and wind gusts up to 225 mph (360 km/h), tying Dorian with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane of all time in terms of sustained winds. ABC News reported damage as \\"catastrophic\\" and \\"pure hell\\", throughout the island. In popular culture The episodes \\"My Soul on Fire\\" (Part 1 and 2) of the TV series Scrubs were filmed on the island for the Janitor and Lady's wedding.

In memory management Typical modern software systems allocate memory dynamically from structures known as heaps. Calls are made to heap-management routines to allocate and free memory. Heap management involves some computation time and can be a performance issue. Chunking refers to strategies for improving performance by using special knowledge of a situation to aggregate related memory-allocation requests. For example, if it is known that a certain kind of object will typically be required in groups of eight, instead of allocating and freeing each object individually, making sixteen calls to the heap manager, one could allocate and free an array of eight of the objects, reducing the number of calls to two. In HTTP message transmission Chunking is a specific feature of the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Here, the meaning is the opposite of that used in memory management. It refers to a facility that allows inconveniently large messages to be broken into conveniently-sized smaller \\"chunks\\". In data deduplication, data synchronization and remote data compression In data deduplication, data synchronization and remote data compression, Chunking is a process to split a file into smaller pieces called chunks by the chunking algorithm.

The Aislers Set's music is influenced by C86-style British indie pop. History Their first record, Terrible Things Happen was released in 1998, receiving glowing reviews in CMJ, The Big Takeover, and numerous indie pop zines, earning enough of a following to generate a tour of Japan in April 1999. Terrible Things Happen (as with the rest of the Aislers Set's music) was recorded in Linton's tiny basement studio on an analog 8 track machine. Spin.com placed the band's second album The Last Match on its Top 20 of 2000, saying, \\"Linton has cleared the cobwebs off the Pop conundrum and dolled them up in a perfect dress.\\" On Salon.com, Greil Marcus wrote, \\"They make dream pop feel as easy to make as a can of soup, and as dangerous: Watch that jagged edge.\\" High praise followed in the New York Times, NME, Gear, and Alternative Press, and the band set out on lengthy tours supporting acts such as Sleater Kinney and Bratmobile. In the spring of 2001 the band set off on a three-week tour of Europe which was highlighted by an invitation to record a session for legendary British DJ John Peel. They recorded four tracks for the show which was aired twice by Peel. He said of the band \\"If you were in one of your difficult moods you could argue that there are lots of bands making that kind of noise particularly in the United States of America. And you'd say well, why are Aislers Set better than any of the others and I'd have to say, well I don't know they just sort of are...\\" In 2002 the band was invited by Belle and Sebastian for a week-long tour of the East Coast, culminating in a show at New York City‚Äôs Hammerstein Ballroom in front of over 3,000 people. Stevie Jackson of Belle and Sebastian was later quoted in a 2003 SF Weekly article, observing that \\"[t]hey are one of the best groups in America as far as I'm concerned\\". Late in 2002, The San Francisco Chronicle included The Aislers Set in its list of \\"Young Artists on the Verge,\\" writing, \\"The Aislers Set's reinvention of '60s pop resurrects walls of garage guitars and rich, Spector-esque sound, insouciance combined with insightful lyrics. But this quintet makes the past feel contemporary, borrowing from punk and pop to create a 21st century cool sound\\". The Aislers Set's third album, How I Learned to Write Backwards, came out in spring 2003. NME wrote \\"Sleighbells, Cuban trumpets, half-inched Smiths lyrics and chasms of lovely echo all add to an insomnia-like reverie that clings on long after its mere half-hour is up.\\" \\"When The Aislers Set hit their mark, they unveil a knack for tying together extremes without ever settling for the middle ground\\" said MOJO magazine. Pitchfork Media stated with respect to the 2003 version of The Aislers Set: \\"Here, Linton's indie quintet becomes a pop orchestra. The band's music is denser than ever before, laden with sleigh bells, handclaps and horns piled atop the conventional guitars, drums, bass and keyboards-- and all are drenched in cavernous reverb, providing the ambiance and intimacy of a gigantic, empty concert hall\\". The band toured for most of 2003 including a month-long stint supporting Yo La Tengo and a week supporting The Shins. Since late 2003 the band has been on hiatus with Linton having moved to New York City and Cusick moving to Gothenburg, Sweden. On Christmas Day 2010, the band made a new song, Cold Christmas. In September 2014, the group reunited to play four West Coast shows in celebration of their LP reissues.

Gaillard Island is the piece of land near the center of the bay. Gaillard Island is an artificially created island located in Mobile Bay near Mobile, Alabama. It was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, using sand and mud dredged from the Mobile Bay ship channel and elsewhere. The island is an important site for colonial nesting seabirds and shore birds in coastal Alabama and has been the only nesting site for brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) in Alabama - first discovered in 1983. Geography Shoreline of Gaillard Island The Island is and is configured in a triangular shape. It is located approximately east of Theodore Industrial Park Complex and approximately to southeast of downtown Mobile, AL. Thirty-one million cubic yards of dredged material pulled from the bay and nearby land was used to form the island. The excavated material consisted primarily of hard red clay from the land and silty sand infused with small amounts of shell and gravel from the bottom of the bay. The dredged material was transported by barge and hydraulically pumped to the island site to make the dikes. Tests were performed by the Corps of Engineers to determine how to maintain the island and not allow it to dissipate into the bay. A triangular shape was designed and floating tire breakwaters were used to protect the island from erosion due to wave action. Marsh plants were used to develop an established root system to assist with long term integrity of the island. This was a state-of-the-art technique which has been widely studied, found to be effective and is now used nationwide. History In 1979 Gaillard Island was created as a disposal island for a ship channel made to connect Mobile Bay and Theodore Industrial Park where a navy port was built. The project consisted of dredging a deep draft ship channel about long, wide and deep. The project was controversial from an engineering and environmental standpoint. The engineers thought the island would not hold up in an open body of water and the environmentalists were concerned about the impact on the bay from an ecological standpoint. The island has been a success from the onset and has become an environmental showcase, home to thousands of birds, particularly brown pelicans. The island is named after Dr. M. Wilson Gaillard, a Mobile dentist. He was also an environmentalist who envisioned the island as a nesting haven for both shore and seabirds. The island is also known as Pelican Island by locals. The island is owned by the Alabama State Docks and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Ecosystem Juvenile brown pelicans hatched on Gaillard Island Various birds were noted to be inhabiting the island by the time it was completed in 1981. In 1983 a biologist discovered four brown pelicans nesting on the island. This was the first sighting in Alabama since their decline due to hunting in the early 1900s. Pelican feathers, in that era, were used for women's hats. Further decline came in the 1940s due to the widespread use of the pesticide DDT. At that time, they were placed on both the Alabama and federal endangered species list. Partly due to increased nesting and propagation of the brown pelicans on Gaillard Island, the brown pelican was removed from the state's endangered species list in 1995, and in 2009, the brown pelican was removed from the federal endangered species list. Today Gaillard Island is an important habitat for thousands of birds representing species of skimmers, stilts, terns, pelicans, egrets, herons, and ibis. Gaillard Island is also the only Alabama nesting site for Caspian terns, Sandwich terns, royal terns, and laughing gulls. The first recorded nesting of herring gulls occurred on Gaillard Island in 1986. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has closely monitored the colonial nesting shore and seabirds conducting annual surveys since 1998. During the first survey, they estimated that there were 10,000 nests on the island. Vegetation is diverse on the island and consists of saltmeadow cordgrass, saltmarsh bulrush, salt marsh cattail, and American threesquare that naturally flourished behind the berms. Originally, smooth cordgrass was the only species that was planted. A report by the Mobile Register in mid-2011 showed that pelican populations on the island dramatically increased from 2010. The report also indicated the pelicans on the island showed no effects stemming from the 2010 BP oil spill in terms of finding a reliable food source, a previous concern from environmental officials. Threats to the island The human factor is not a threat to the island as boaters and jet skiers can reach the sand beach but are prohibited from walking on the island which would disturb the nesting grounds and disrupt the ecosystem of the island. Three hurricanes, however, have damaged the island. They were Hurricanes Danny, Georges, and Katrina respectively. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) division approved $8.6 million of financial assistance to restore Gaillard Island after the tidal surge associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 eroded and destroyed the island's levy and berm system. Sporting Bird watching is the primary sport associated with the island. The Mobile Bay Audubon Society conducts tours for local enthusiasts and conservationists. The spring months are the best time for viewing the nesting activities. As a side effect, marine life is abundant around the island making this area a favorite spot for fishermen who catch speckled trout, flounder and mullet. Shrimp are also harvested.

The band was formed by vocalist J.R. Hayes, guitarist Scott Hull, and drummer John Evans. Throughout the band's earlier history, they were a three-piece group until sampler Blake Harrison joined in 2006, notably had no bassist until the inclusion of John Jarvis in 2013, and went through 2 past drummers with the role currently held by Adam Jarvis. Pig Destroyer is one of the most well-known grindcore bands in the genre due to Hayes's poetic lyrics, Hull's incorporation of thrash, punk, and doom influences in songwriting, and technical drum work. Biography The band formed in 1997 after the break-up of a short-lived political hardcore band, Treblinka, with 2 former members of said band, vocalist J. R. Hayes (Enemy Soil), guitarist Scott Hull (Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, ex-Anal Cunt), and drummer John Evans, who left the band for an unspecified school not long after the band's formation. After the departure of Evans, he was soon replaced by Brian Harvey. In an interview, Scott Hull claims that they picked the band name on the criteria that it was insulting, yet somewhat more creative than the name of his last band, Anal Cunt. Deciding that \\"Cop Killer\\" or \\"Cop Destroyer\\" would be tactless, they eventually settled on \\"Pig Destroyer\\" (\\"pig\\" being a pejorative American slang term for the police). Derived from a non-musical source as extreme as the band's sound, Pig Destroyer's easily identifiable logo was created using a graphic from ANSWER Me! magazine as a template. Relapse Records signed the band and issued a split 7\\" with Isis on the label's Singles Series in July 2000. 38 Counts of Battery was a complete discography of Pig Destroyer releases up to the year 2000, which included split records with Gnob and influential screamo act Orchid, as well as their debut album, Explosions In Ward 6, and the demo that secured their record deal. Prowler in the Yard, released in 2001, was the first of the band's records to really break through to what could contextually be considered the \\"mainstream\\". Garnering rave reviews from popular press such as Kerrang! and Terrorizer, the record earned Pig Destroyer headlining slots at the 2002 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and the 2002 Relapse Records CMJ Showcase, as well as a high placing at 2003's Relapse Contamination Fest alongside scene legends High on Fire and The Dillinger Escape Plan (documented on the Relapse Contamination Fest DVD). 2004's Terrifyer boasted a much clearer sound than Prowler in the Yard or 38 Counts of Battery, as well as lyrics and prose from Hayes. The record came with an accompanying DVD soundscape entitled \\"Natasha\\", which was intended to be listened to in surround sound (although a more recent Japanese edition of the album has \\"Natasha\\" as an ordinary CD with four bonus tracks). Session guitarist Matthew Kevin Mills, Hull's former guitar teacher, recorded the lead guitar parts in the song \\"Towering Flesh\\". A compilation of tracks from the split EPs with Gnob and Ben√ºmb is also available, entitled Painter of Dead Girls. The album features alternative versions of older songs from the 38 Counts era (such as \\"Dark Satellites\\"), a series of new songs (such as \\"Rejection Fetish\\" and \\"Forgotten Child\\"), and covers of bands who could be considered an influence (such as The Stooges and Helmet). Pig Destroyer have stated that they would release a series of 9 split 7\\" EPs in 2006. Bands on the flipside include Orthrelm and Blood Duster; however, nothing has yet been released. The 7\\" series was put on hold for the release of Phantom Limb. Sampler Blake Harrison (Hatebeak, Triac) joined prior to recording of the album. 2007 saw the release of album Phantom Limb via Relapse Records, complete with album artwork designed by John Baizley (Baroness, Torche). In 2011, Harvey was replaced by Misery Index drummer Adam Jarvis. On August 8, 2012, the title and artwork for the band's fifth studio album, Book Burner, was announced. It was released on October 22, 2012. Pig Destroyer headlined the Terrorizer stage at the Damnation Festival in Leeds in November 2012, which marked their first United Kingdom show in eight years. On March 4, 2013, Pig Destroyer released an EP titled Mass & Volume via Bandcamp. Recorded at the end of the Phantom Limb sessions, this EP was released as part of a charity effort to benefit the family of recently deceased Relapse Records employee Pat Egen. In September 2013, Adult Swim released the song \\"The Octagonal Stairway\\" as part of the 2013 Adult Swim Singles Series. In October 2013, Adam Jarvis's cousin John Jarvis joined Pig Destroyer as the band's first bass player. In 2014, ‚ÄúThe Diplomat‚Äù (off of Book Burner) featured prominently in the season three finale of Comedy Central‚Äôs TV show Workaholics. In 2015, Relapse announced a deluxe reissue of the band's 2001 album Prowler In The Yard, which featured a remixed & remastered version of the album in various limited formats as well as previously unreleased music, photos, and other content. On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Pig Destroyer had entered the studio to begin recording their 6th album. The album was slated for a Summer 2018 release. On May 14, 2018, the album's title was revealed, Head Cage, with the date being pushed back to September of the same year. At least seven official promotional videos have been made of Pig Destroyer songs: \\"Piss Angel\\", from Prowler in the Yard; \\"Gravedancer\\", from Terrifyer; \\"Loathsome\\", from Phantom Limb; \\"The Diplomat\\", from Book Burner; \\"Army of Cops\\", \\"The Torture Fields\\", and \\"Mt. Skull\\" from Head Cage. The first three have aired on MTV2's Headbangers Ball, with each video seeing more airplay than the one that was released before it. The video for \\"Piss Angel\\" debuted on the show on Aug. 14, 2004, and was directed by Kenneth Thibault and Nathaniel Baruch. The video for \\"Gravedancer\\" was directed by Vladimir Lik and released in 2007. The video for \\"Loathsome\\" was directed by David Brodsky and debuted in late 2007. The video for \\"The Diplomat\\" was directed by Phil Mucci and released on October 26, 2012. The video for \\"Army of Cops\\" was released on YouTube on July 10, 2018. David Brodsky returned to direct the video. It was followed by the releases of \\"The Torture Fields\\" on August 8th, directed by Frank Huang, and \\"Mt. Skull\\", which featured Better Call Saul actor Josh Fadem, on August 29th, announced via Kerrang. In early 2019 John Jarvis was dismissed from the band and replaced with Travis Stone. On August 28 of 2020, Pig Destroyer released their new EP, The Octagonal Stairway. Influences Scott Hull has mentioned artist Matthew Barney, author Dennis Cooper, and noise musicians Whitehouse as influencing his music. Pig Destroyer is inspired by thrash metal, such as Dark Angel and Slayer, the sludge metal of The Melvins, and American grindcore as practiced by Brutal Truth. Members =Current= *J. R.

It helped to pioneer extreme metal by releasing early grindcore and death metal records between 1988 and 1994. The label roster has since diversified into more mainstream guitar music, working with bands such as Rival Sons, the Temperance Movement, Blackberry Smoke and the White Buffalo. The company also hosted the 'Earache Express' stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2017 and 'The Earache Factory' at Boomtown Fair 2018. The logo of Earache Records is a homage to Thrasher magazine, due to Digby Pearson being a skateboard culture enthusiast. History Earache was founded in 1985 by Digby Pearson who prior to launching the label proper had compiled 'Anglican Scrape Attic', a proto-compilation of early hardcore punk and crossover thrash acts which included Hirax, Lipcream and Concrete Sox. Accordingly, the first official Earache release on vinyl in 1987 with catalogue number MOSH 1, was The Acc√ºsed's The Return of Martha Splatterhead. This was followed by a split LP by the crust/crossover band Concrete Sox and the proto-grind band Heresy. The label's first major release of note was MOSH 3, Napalm Death's Scum. Famously, John Peel was a champion of the band and supported them on BBC Radio 1. The record went on to reach number 7 in the UK indie chart. Following this, Earache released music by many bands from the emerging grindcore and death metal scenes, such as Morbid Angel, Carcass, Entombed, Bolt Thrower and Terrorizer. Although intrinsically linked with death metal, the label's catalogue is varied and also includes Welsh ragga-metal act Dub War, Birmingham's industrial metal pioneers Godflesh, Nottingham's Pitchshifter, hardcore techno outfit Ultraviolence, Mick Harris's industrial/experimental group Scorn, John Zorn-led experimental group Naked City and doom and sludge metal bands Sleep and Acid Bath. In the early 1990s Columbia Records, seeking to break into metal, inked a deal with Earache. Columbia would license rights and market and distribute them in The Americas, with rights reverting to Earache upon completion of the deal term. It is widely accepted that Columbia failed to deliver the expected sales that they themselves had projected and thus they sought to prematurely terminate the agreement. Barney Greenway of Napalm Death objected to the deal with Columbia (a subsidiary of Sony Music) on the basis that it was \\"selling out\\", although Napalm Death have since released music also distributed by Columbia parent Sony Music Entertainment. The rights to all Columbia-licensed titles have since reverted to Earache, who thereafter have been wholly independent, working with distributors as opposed to licensees. The label has a number of subsidiary labels, including Wicked World Records, Elitist Records, Sub Bass Records and the short-lived Necrosis Records. Modern era As with many labels, Earache has transitioned over time from its initial \\"extreme\\" output and now focuses primarily on modern, accomplished guitar projects. Rival Sons were the most notable of the modern crop of artists, before signing with Atlantic Records in 2018. Newer signings include Australia's Massive, Nottingham's Haggard Cat and Lancaster's Massive Wagons. More recent grindcore and death metal signings include Wormrot and Deicide. Earache also signed the first independent label direct deal with iTunes shortly after the service launched. Earache currently holds two Guinness World Records. The first is that of the World's Shortest Song, currently held by Napalm Death with \\"You Suffer\\" at 1.316 seconds long. The second record is the world's shortest full music video, a record held by Brutal Truth with their track \\"Collateral Damage\\". In 2015 Digby Pearson received the Association of Independent Music Pioneer award. In 2018 tech sitcom Silicon Valley featured \\"You Suffer\\" repeatedly in one episode. In response the label created a Twitter bot (@NapalmDeathBot) which sends an hourly tweet with the price of bitcoin. They also inserted \\"You suffer\\" into the blockchain, a first for a label. In August 2018 Earache signed trap/rap artist ALIREZA301. Alireza is a metal influenced rapper from Maryland who performs a style of trap/rap which in parts heavily incorporates guitars. To begin the new decade, Earache Records announced a compilation vinyl titled \\"The New wave of Rock N Roll\\" featuring a host of new acts.  Earache Live  In 2017 Earache were invited to host the first ever stage for heavy music at Glastonbury Festival. 'The Earache Express' was a recycled London underground tube carriage located in the 'Shangri La' area of the site. The stage featured performances from Napalm Death, The Dead Kennedys, Ho99o9, Hacktivist, Glen Matlock of The Sex Pistols, Steve Ignorant of Crass and Wormrot amongst others. Having been well received by Glastonbury Festival, Boomtown Fair (who are affiliated to Glastonbury) invited Earache to curate a stage at their 2018 event which took place in Winchester during August 2018. The stage (named The Earache Factory) was designed around the concept of a disused factory within a run-down part of a futuristic town. It featured artists such as Soulfly, Dead Kennedys and Enter Shikari not to mention a headline set by British upstarts Idles. In 2019 Earache will be hosting an evening at Camp Bestival in Dorset bringing along Napalm Death, Lawnmower Deth, Diamond Head, Phil Campbell & The Bastard Sons and Nosebleed. Criticism Over the years, the relationship between the label and some of its former artists have become fraught, and Pearson has made a number of disparaging blog posts about, among others, JS Clayden from Pitchshifter and Barney Greenway of Napalm Death. Greenway responded that Pearson \\"expects everybody to be subservient\\", while Clayden called Pearson \\"petty and vindictive\\" and criticized the label for not allowing fans to stream or purchase Pitchshifter's albums that were released on Earache. In the documentary Slave to the Grind, Scott Carlson from Repulsion accused Earache of not paying the band, adding \\"I'm sure they sold way more records than they told us they did.\\" Former Iron Monkey drummer Justin Greaves accused Earache of refusing to support the band financially in an emergency when during a European tour, singer Johnny Morrow fell sick and needed to return to the UK, which the band couldn't afford to cover.

Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range. A demand exists for them, however, in the aquarium trade. Distribution and habitat This species' native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago. Confusingly, the name Hypostomus plecostomus (or Plecostomus plecostomus) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, Hemiancistrus aspidolepis (also known under another synonym, Hypostomus panamensis).Bussing, W.A. (1998). Freshwater fishes of Costa Rica. Pp. 160-162. . The invasive Pterygoplichthys pardalis has been repeatedly erroneously reported as H. plecostomus, though the latter species is restricted to the rivers of the Guianas. Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as H. plecostomus. It is erroneous, and the concerned species belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys (either P. pardalis,Amazon Sailfin Catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) - FactSheet, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species P. disjunctivus,Vermiculated Sailfin Catfish(Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) - FactSheet, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species P. anisitsiParan√° Sailfin Catfish (Pterygoplichthys anisitsi) - FactSheet, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species or P. multiradiatusOrinoco Sailfin Catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus) - FactSheet, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species). In the United States, a Pterygoplichthys species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston. The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with H. plecostomus being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus (that hybridise extensively). Diet Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food.This omnivorous species feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans. In the aquarium H. plecostomus is one of a number of species commonly referred to as \\"plecostomus\\" or \\"common pleco\\" by aquarists. These fish are sold when they are young and small, but they can grow to be a maximum size of . In the aquarium, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle.  Naming  = Common names = A large variety of common names are used to describe H. plecostomus, where plecostomus and the shortened \\"pleco\\" are interchangeable in all common names. The names include: * algae sucker/eater * pez diablo (devil fish) * pleco * janitor fish * municipal fish ‚Äì 'ikan bandaraya' in Malay * suckermouth catfish * sweeper fish ‚Äì 'ikan sapu sapu' in Indonesian * crocodile fish (not to be confused with Papilloculiceps longiceps, which is originally known as the crocodile fish or tentacled flathead) = Taxonomy = The species' scientific name, Hypostomus plecostomus, is derived from the Latin hypo (meaning \\"under\\"), stoma (meaning \\"mouth\\"), and pleco (meaning \\"pleated\\"). Many of the common names used to identify Hypostomus plecostomus are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding H. plecostomus and other Loricariidae such as H. punctatus, Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus and P. pardalis. In 2012, Weber, Covain and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: H. plecostomus (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and H. watwata.

Autoracks are used to transport new vehicles from factories to automotive distributors, and to transport passengers' vehicles in car shuttles and motorail services, such as Amtrak's Auto Train route. History In the early 20th century, when automobiles were still new technology, their production levels were low enough that they could be shipped in sufficient quantities in boxcars. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one boxcar. But as the automobile industry grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends. These modifications helped, but the demand for new automobiles outpaced the railroads' abilities to build and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad experimented with modifying a group of -long wood-frame flat cars to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile-loading assemblies that would lift one or more automobiles above others within a boxcar. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies that could only be loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars. By this time, in the United States, most circuses still traveled by rail. Circuses were major haulers of wheeled vehicles, carrying all of their vehicles on flat cars, usually behind their own passenger cars or in separate sections of their trains; basically, one train would haul the performers and employees while a second train would haul the vehicles and freight. The circus solution to loading vehicles was to use a string of flatcars. A temporary ramp was placed at the end of the flatcars and temporary bridge plates spanned the gaps between adjacent flatcars; the road vehicles were driven or towed up onto one car and then driven or towed down the train. This type of vehicle loading became known as \\"circus style\\" due to its frequent use by circuses. In the 1950s, most railroads took the cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even up to six automobiles onto one flat car left a large amount of space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added to the ends of the flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height. In the mid-1950s, in Germany, Volkswagen Beetle production was increasing beyond the capacity of highway trucks (autocarriers). Volkswagen engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design they came up with was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level flatcar design effectively became the first autorack, entering service circa 1954. Also in 1954 Evans Products, a manufacturer of loading racks for carrying automobiles in conventional boxcars, developed a bi-level Auto-Loader superstructure with an elevating top deck capable of carrying six cars or light trucks on a typical flatcar. Two prototype units were constructed and mounted on conventional 53 ft flat cars for field testing. NYC 500085 carried a semi-streamlined rack,Railway Age March 8, 1954 while UP 5800 had a more utilitarian rack mounted. Neither design went into commercial production. In late 1957, Canadian National (CN) introduced an innovative group of bi-level auto carriers. These CN cars were similar to conventional boxcars, except they had a second floor and doors at both ends of the car instead of the usual side doors. They were huge by the standards of the time; the cars were long and could carry eight vehicles. These cars were a big success and helped lead to the development of today's enclosed auto racks. In 1959, when flat cars capable of carrying two highway trailers in trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC), or \\"piggyback\\" service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB&Q;, C&NW;, CRIP, D&H;, D&RGW;, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L&N;, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack. Seeking a more efficient method, in February 1959 the Saint Louis-San Francisco Railroad (SL- SF, or Frisco) designed and built a prototype bi-level rack mounted on flat car SL-SF 95844. Satisfied that the basic concept was sound, the railroad contracted with Pullman-Standard to design and construct a full-size tri-level prototype. The result that rolled out of the Pullman plant on January 29, 1960 was SLSF 3000, an tri-level car capable of carrying 12 automobiles.Railway Age February 15, 1960 When testing proved the car satisfactory the Frisco ordered 130 production cars, SL-SF 3001‚Äì3130, delivered by Pullman that August and September. In 1960 the Frisco was not the only railroad experimenting with racks mounted on flat cars to carry automobiles. In January the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) constructed a prototype trilevel rack mounted on flat ATSF 90082.Railway Age February 1, 1960 Santa Fe's first production auto racks were trilevel Auto-Veyor units supplied by Dana-Spicer and Whitehead & Kales later in the year, both mounted on General American- built G85 cars. The Southern Pacific actually took delivery of the first Whitehead & Kales Auto-Pack tri-level racks in April, mounting them on General American-built Clejan and G85 cars.Railway Age May 16, 1960 The slightly longer racks could carry 12 full size or 18 compact autos per car. Several other railroads quickly ordered their own auto racks from Dana and W&K; or from American Car & Foundry, Darby Corporation, Evans Products, Paragon Bridge & Steel, or Thrall Car Manufacturing.Railway Age November 27, 1961 The Santa Fe and Frisco also built some of their autoracks in their own car shops. Curiously, in 1961 a German-built three-unit, articulated bilevel autorack was imported into the United States to demonstrate the German design to U.S. railroads. North American Car Corporation handled promotion of the car, which was marked NIFX 1200. The car rode on four single-axle trucks and was tested by the B&O;,Railway Age Jan 23, 1961 and October 2, 1961 but no sales resulted. Starting in this early period, most autoracks were mounted on flat cars leased from a leasing company, such as Trailer Train (see below), North American Car (NIFX marks), Merchants Despatch (MDAX marks), American Refrigerator Transit (MPFX marks), or Pullman's Transport Leasing Division (TLCX marks), but many roads also operated cars mounted on their own flat cars. Railroads known to have done so include ATSF, CN, CP, CR, CRR, D&RGW;, FEC, GN, GTW, KCS, L&N;, Monon, MP, N&W;, RI, SCL, SLSF, SOO, Southern, SP, SSW, UP, WM, and WP. Transporting new automobiles The open end of a bi- level autorack that is undergoing repairs During the early 1960s, specially built auto carriers rapidly took over rail transportation of newly completed automobiles in North America. They carried more vehicles in the same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars formerly used. Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) and other carriers. Autoracks were built in three-level configurations carrying automobiles, and with two-levels for vans and light trucks. Autorack and flat car length quickly grew to and then to increase their loading capacity even further. This made them about as long as the average railroad passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they would not be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better. A major problem left to solve was that the new autorack cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s,Railway Age March 31, 1969 and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still gain access to the automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N&W; and DT&I; jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car.Railway Age June 25, 1973 A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.Railway Age October 29, 1973 The first production fully enclosed racks were delivered in late 1974 and early 1975. The Whitehead & Kales tri-level design, renamed Safe-Pak, was delivered to ATSF, CP, CRR, FEC, NW, SCL, SSW, UP, and WP, all of them riding on railroad- owned flats. Portec's RailPac design, developed in cooperation with Chrysler, was placed into service by ATSF, C&O;, C&NW;, D&RGW;, GTW, N&W;, RF&P;, SLSF, SP, UP and several other roads, with most riding on leased Trailer Train flats.Railway Age March 25, 1974 These two designs were refined during the late 1970s and by 1980 fully enclosed tri-levels accounted for roughly a third of the in-service fleet, however fully enclosed bi-levels lagged far behind. Roofs were not added to all autoracks until the mid-1980s, as it took time for railroads with low overhead clearance routes to modify their bridge and tunnel clearances to accept them. Consequently, some roofless and even open tri- levels and bi-levels remained in service into the mid-late 1980s. The number of manufacturers offering autoracks declined during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Several firms simply exited the field, including AC&F;, Evans, Dana, and Darby, while others were acquired by other builders. Pullman, after supplying the very first production trilevel autoracks to the Frisco, abandoned the field to concentrate on the flat cars that autoracks were mounted on, only to return briefly in 1976‚Äì1977 to build a few trilevels for the B&O; and Cotton Belt (SSW). Pacific Car & Foundry briefly produced a few racks at about the same time, as did Thrall. Whitehead & Kales, one of two dominant producers since the late 1960s, was acquired by Thrall in 1981. Paragon, the other leading rack-builder, was purchased by Portec in the early 1970s, which was in turn acquired by Thrall in 1985. Paragon's autorack designs were sold to Greenville Steel Car, also in 1985, which was itself acquired by Trinity Industries in 1986. Thrall itself was eventually acquired by Trinity as well in 2001. Currently autoracks are produced by TrinityRail, Greenbrier, Johnstown America, National Steel Car, and the Union Pacific Railroad. =Vert-A-Pac and Stac-Pac= Vegas loaded on Vert-a-pac Both railroads and automakers wanted to eliminate theft and damage from vandalism and weather, thus reducing shipping costs. They also wanted to increase the number of vehicles carried per rail car for the same reason. Toward that end, in 1968 General Motors and the Southern Pacific Railroad jointly began work on development of a radical new rail car designed to carry the Chevrolet Vega, a new compact car being developed by GM. Known as \\"Vert-A-Pac\\", the rail cars would hold 30 Vegas in a vertical, nose-down position, versus 18 in normal tri-level autoracks. Each Vega was fitted with four removable, cast-steel sockets inserted into the undercarriage that locked into the hooks on the bottom-hinged doors that made up the car side.Popular Mechanics, October 1969, page 151 The prototype car, SP 618000 was turned out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969.Railway Locomotives and Cars July, 1969Southern Pacific Bulletin November, 1970 Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas would not shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready to drive to the dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.Collectable Automobile. April 2000 p.37 \\"Riding the rails: Shipping Vegas by Vert-a-pac.\\" The first production Vert-A- Pacs entered service in April, 1970, the last ones in January, 1973. Besides Southern Pacific, the B&O;, BN, D&RGW;, FEC, IC, L&N;, MILW, MP, PC (MDT), RI, SCL, SLSF and Southern Railway operated Vert-A-Pacs. All were withdrawn from service at the end of the 1977 Vega model year and were reracked with conventional tri-level racks. Another joint General Motors-Southern Pacific automobile rail car was the Stac-Pac. It was designed to carry 12 high end Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac models in four removable fully enclosed tri- level containers per 89-foot flat car.Railway Age June 26, 1972 The first production Stac-Pac cars entered service in October, 1971. Beside SP and its Cotton Belt subsidiary (SSW), Stac-Pac flat cars were contributed to the pool by the Santa Fe and Trailer Train, with the containers being supplied by ATSF, BN, D&RGW;, FEC, MILW, PC (MDT), RI, Southern, SP, SSW, UP, and by General Motors itself. All of the cars and containers were withdrawn from service at the end of the 1976 model year. =Trailer Train Company= Although railroads were just beginning to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack. This arrangement worked so well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was owned by a railroad, with only a few exceptions. Trailer Train became TTX Company in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad rolling stock. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well. Trailer Train / TTX reporting marks applied to autorack flats: BTTX (1) - 85 ft to 89 ft bilevel rack with fixed decks; used from 1960 to 1988 BTTX (2) - fully enclosed articulated bilevel with fixed decks, used from 1997 CTTX (2) - 89 ft enclosed but roofless trilevel for use on low overhead clearance routes; used from 1976 onward CTTX (3) - 89-4 fully enclosed convertible bilevel/trilevel with hinged middle deck; used from 2013 onward ETTX (1) - 89 ft trilevel with elevating middle and top decks; used from 1962 to 1973 ETTX (2) - 89-4 fully enclosed trilevel with hinged middle deck; used from 1973 onward KTTX - 87 ft to 89 ft trilevel with hinged middle deck RTTX - 85 ft to 89 ft trilevel rack with fixed decks; used from 1960 to 1985 TTBX - 89-4 bilevel with fixed decks; used from 1968 onward TTGX - 89-4 fully enclosed bilevel with fixed deck; used from 1977 onward TTKX - 89-4 trilevel with hinged middle deck; used from 1968 onward TTNX - 89-4 enclosed but doorless bilevel with fixed decks, used from 1983 forward TTQX - 89-4 20 ft-2\\" high fully enclosed trilevel with hinged middle deck; used from 1990 onward TTRX - 89-4 trilevel with fixed decks; used from 1968 onward TTSX (1) - 89-4 Stac-Pac flats, used 1972‚Äì1976 TTSX (2) - 89-4 enclosed but roofless bilevel with fixed decks, used from 1979 forward TTUX (2) - 81 ft enclosed single deck for large trucks and other vehicles, used from 2007 forward TTVX (1) - 89-4 Vert-A-Pacs, used 1970‚Äì1977 TTVX (2) - 89-4 enclosed but doorless trilevel with hinged middle deck, used from 1982 forward =New designs and current usage= Autoracks wait to be unloaded in a BNSF Railway facility in Los Angeles, California Railroads of today are still grappling with the problem of loading more and larger vehicles onto autoracks. One popular solution is to create a double-length car that is articulated over a single middle truck so that each half of the car is about the same length as a conventional autorack. These cars, which can be seen in operation on many of the railroads of the western US (but also seen occasionally in the Great Lakes and Southern Ontario), are brand named AutoMax cars. These cars, built by Gunderson (a subsidiary of The Greenbrier Companies) measure long and tall; they feature adjustable interior decks to carry up to 22 light trucks and minivans. Thrall produced a competing articulated two-unit design. For greater flexibility and to improve car utilization, currently single-unit autoracks are being built that allow the number of loading levels, or decks, to be easily changed between bilevel (two) and trilevel (three), depending on which is in demand at the time. Greenbrier calls their version of this multilevel concept the Multi-Max, while the Union Pacific Railroad builds their own version, called the AutoFlex. The railroads became the primary long-distance transporter of completed automobiles. Using the enclosed tri-level autoracks, they were able to provide both lower costs and greater protection from in-transit damage (such as that which may occur due to weather and traffic conditions on unenclosed truck semi-trailers). When the railroad companies went from the open autoracks to the enclosed, they were able to reduce freight damage claims. The enclosed rail cars prevented the autos from getting damaged from falling or thrown rocks, bullets and other forms of vandalism. They also stopped the theft of autos and parts from autos and kept hobos from living in the automobiles. =Latest innovations= In 1999, BNSF Railway and Kansas City Southern Railway started using Auto-Max railcars. Most light-weight aluminium autoracks have 2 levels, but Auto-Max has 3 levels and is able to fit 22 cars inside. They are articulated two unit railcars that are about tall, and long. Single unit autoracks are long. In 2004, Canadian National was at the forefront of autorack technology again by using light-weight aluminum. The new cars, built by Johnstown America Corporation beginning in December 2004, are brand named AVC, an acronym for Aluminum Vehicle Carrier. Two hundred new aluminum autoracks promise a softer ride, a wider interior, superior door-edge protection, and a rust-free interior from older steel versions. Canadian Pacific Railway has ordered 375 of these new cars as well. The new cars built for Amtrak Auto Train service differ from those built for CN and CP; the Amtrak cars are lower, or , in height, and use solid side panels instead of the perforated panels operated in freight service. Combining autoracks and passenger cars =Australia= Great Southern Rail provides a Motorail service on its long-distance Indian Pacific, between Adelaide and Perth, The Ghan, between Adelaide and Darwin, and formerly offered Motorail on The Overland services. Traveltrain in Queensland formerly offered a Motorail service on its Sunlander and Spirit of the Outback trains. The Victorian Railways formerly offered Motorail on The Vinelander, and Sunraysia services on the Mildura line. The New South Wales Railways (later the Public Transport Commission) once offered Motorail services on its long-distance lines. =Europe= * Car shuttle train * Eurotunnel Shuttle =United States= A rail transport service where passengers can take their automobile along with them on their journey is known as an \\"Auto Train\\" in North America and as a \\"Motorail\\" in Australia and Europe. Passengers are carried in normal passenger cars or in sleeping cars on longer journeys, while their vehicles are loaded into autoracks, car carriers, or flatcars.  Auto-Train Corporation  On December 6, 1971, Auto-Train Corporation introduced a new and innovative rail transportation service for both passengers and their automobiles in the United States, operating scheduled service between Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.) and Sanford, Florida, near Orlando. The Auto Train offered an alternative to motorists who would otherwise drive their automobiles the distance along the east coast of the United States. For vacationers with destinations at one or more of the many popular tourist attractions of Florida, the Auto Train service offered dual features: # avoid the long automobile ride on busy Interstate 95 in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida # have the convenience of use of their own automobile upon arrival. From the beginning in 1971, the same year Amtrak began service on purely passenger routes in the United States, a key feature of Auto-Train's new service was the use of autoracks, which were former Canadian National transcontinental bi-level, enclosed autorack boxcars. These were augmented by new tri-level auto-racks built by Southern Iron & Equipment in 1976. The privately owned service became very popular, but after 10 years of operation, and some costly attempts to expand the service elsewhere, such as a schedule between Florida and Chicago, Illinois, Auto-Train Corporation entered bankruptcy, and service ended in April 1981. Amtrak's Auto Train Modern autoracks in use on Amtrak's Auto Train Auto Train service between Virginia and Florida was resumed by Amtrak in 1983. Amtrak, a federally chartered corporation which operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States, continued to use Auto-Train's autoracks as an important portion of its service. These were supplemented with new bilevels built by Johnstown America in 2004 and 2005. In current operation of Amtrak's Auto Train, there are two trains in operation simultaneously. The autoracks normally run on the rear of Auto Train consists, which stretch over a three quarters of a mile, and are a familiar sight on CSX Transportation tracks on the east coast. Today, Amtrak's Auto Train carries about 200,000 passengers and generates around $50 million in revenue annually. It is considered Amtrak's best-paying train in terms of income in comparison with operating expenses. Whittier Shuttle In the mid-1960s, the Alaska Railroad began offering a vehicle shuttle service utilizing standard flat cars and passenger cars. Dubbed the \\"Whittier Shuttle,\\" it operated in Alaska through the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel under Maynard Mountain between a stop just off the Seward Highway near the former town of Portage and the small port town of Whittier, Alaska, which was also a port-of-call for the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system. As traffic to Whittier increased, the shuttle became insufficient, leading to a project to convert the existing railroad tunnel into a single-lane combination highway and railway tunnel which was opened to traffic on June 7, 2000. At a length of , it is the second-longest highway tunnel and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in North America.

The term was introduced in the Social Web paper describing how a new layer of Internet infrastructure is possible based on the OASIS XRI and XDI specifications. However the concept of an i-broker is not specific to any one technology or protocol, but rather a business and social function, similar to that of a bank or an ISP. Just as banks offer a wide range of financial services associated with an account, and ISPs a wide range of Internet services, i-brokers will offer a wide range of identity and data sharing applications. As with e-mail and web hosting, some i-brokers will specialize in services for personal account holders, some will concentrate on the business and government market, and some will be full-service brokers handling all types of accounts. In all cases, the sensitivity of the data involved will demand of i-brokers the same high standards of accountability and trust demanded in the global banking system. Unlike the banking system, however, it is unlikely i-brokers will be highly regulated. Instead good behavior is more likely to be enforced by online reputation systems. Just as people use different banking and brokerage accounts for different financial services, they are likely to use multiple i-brokers for sharing different sets of data (personal, financial, medical, vocational, etc.). However, with data sharing technology such as XDI link contracts, an account holder can choose to link all of their i-broker accounts, or selected accounts, or none at all ‚Äî the same way a web site author determines which pages on the site link to each other. As more digital identity protocols and standards come to market, other types of service providers will be in a position offer i-brokering services, including social networks, portals, domain name registrars, internet service providers (ISPs), banks, insurance companies, wired and wireless phone companies and e-commerce sites. XDI.org is the first public trust organization for i-brokers. XDI.org maintains a set of Global Services Specifications (GSS) governing i-broker accreditation and policy management, and a set of I-Services Specifications (ISS) defining interoperable identity services.

He winds up in California and is convinced by an Anti-war activist that he is responsible for the counterculture through his influence on The Beatles. This prompts Elvis to write a letter to President Nixon asking to be made a \\"Federal Agent at Large\\" for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. No such position actually exists, but Nixon, wanting desperately to win over the youth of America, which he views as hating him, decides to meet with Elvis in an attempt to improve his image with the \\"kids\\".

Angered by their confrontation, Presley left Graceland and made his way to the airport, boarding a flight to Washington D.C. After checking in at the Hotel Washington, Presley flew to Los Angeles to meet his friend, Jerry Schilling. Due to an allergic reaction Presley experienced from a medication for an eye infection, aggravated by chocolate that he ate on the plane, a rash had developed on his face and neck. After seeing a doctor and getting some sleep, Presley informed Schilling that he wanted to return to Washington D.C., and arranged for another friend, Sonny West, to meet them. On the flight Presley met California senator George Murphy. Presley showed an interest in acquiring a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, and Murphy suggested that Presley write to President Nixon offering his services to help combat illicit drug use. Presley wrote a letter on the plane and hand delivered it to the White House at 6.30am on December 21. A few hours later Presley visited the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs headquarters in Washington D.C., meeting with Deputy Director John Finlator. He was unsuccessful in persuading Finlator to give him a BNDD badge. Schilling received a call at the hotel from Egil Krogh, President Nixon's deputy counsel, to arrange a meeting between Presley and Nixon. After picking up Schilling and West from the hotel, Presley made his way to the White House. All three met with Nixon and received gifts. Presley persuaded Nixon to give him a BNDD badge, and after an official photograph was taken, the trio left, with Presley returning to Graceland the following day. On December 30, Presley returned to Washington D.C. with a few friends to visit the National Sheriffs Association head office. The next day they were given a tour of FBI headquarters, where Presley offered his services as an undercover agent. Despite never getting to meet FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Presley did receive a letter from him on January 4, 1971, acknowledging his offer of assistance.

Family Entertainment label. The movie stars Kate Maberly, Heydon Prowse, Andrew Knott, John Lynch, and Maggie Smith, was written by Caroline Thompson and based on the 1911 novel of the same name by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The novel was previously adapted into two films: a 1949 drama film and a 1919 silent film, which starred Lila Lee and Spottiswoode Aitken. Set in Yorkshire, England, Yorkshire's Allerton Castle was used for most of the exterior shots of Misselthwaite Manor, as well as interior shots. The film was a critical and commercial success. Maggie Smith was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. Plot In 1901, recently orphaned 10-year-old Mary Lennox is sent from her home in British India to her uncle Lord Archibald Craven's mansion, Misselthwaite Manor, in Yorkshire, England. Unloved and neglected by her late parents, who were killed in a sudden earthquake, she is a cold, unpleasant girl who has repressed her emotions to the point of being unable to cry. Mary is unhappy in her new surroundings. Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered by Mrs. Medlock not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Eventually Mrs. Medlock allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about in the house. In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunt Lillian Craven's walled garden, which has been locked up and neglected since her accidental death 10 years prior. Martha Sowerby, a cheerful housemaid, and her younger brother, Dickon Sowerby, a nature-loving boy who can \\"talk\\" to the animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the \\"secret garden,\\" Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process. When she's finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing he was responsible for locking up the secret garden. Fearful he will do it again, she evasively asks to plant seeds in an \\"unwanted\\" part of the Manor. Lord Craven grants permission and leaves the country for the rest of the year. Confident that the garden will remain a secret, Mary and Dickon continue their work. Hidden away in the gloomy mansion is Mary's cousin, Colin Craven, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This has turned him into a demanding, unpleasant, helpless boy who has never left his room or even learned to walk. Mary eventually discovers Colin and learns the strange noises she has been hearing are the sounds of his crying. She is taken aback by his unpleasant nature, but reaches out to him anyway. She shows him that he's not really sick, and that the outside world is not as dangerous as Mrs. Medlock, who is in charge of caring for him, claims. Encouraged by Mary, Colin decides to go outside for the first time in his life. Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden, and Colin begins his own healing process, both physically and mentally. Mary, Colin, and Dickon spend all of their time having fun in the garden, and Colin learns to stand and walk on his own. Anxious to show Colin's new-found life to his father, they perform a \\"magic\\" ceremony, hoping to bring him back home. It appears to work: Lord Craven awakens suddenly from a dream of Lillian calling him home and immediately returns to Yorkshire. He finds his way into the secret garden, where he discovers Colin walking and playing hide and seek with Mary and Dickon, which leaves him dumbfounded with joy. Upon seeing her uncle, Mary runs off and breaks down in tears for the first time in her life, certain that nobody wants her and afraid that the garden will be locked up again. Lord Craven catches up to her and reassures Mary that she is part of the family now. He promises never to lock the garden up again. Lord Craven thanks Mary for bringing his family back to life. Mary, Colin, Dickon, and Lord Craven embrace, then celebrate with Martha, Mrs. Medlock, Ben, and the Manor staff.

Policy debate on software patents has been active for years. The opponents to software patents have gained more visibility with fewer resources through the years than their pro-patent opponents. Arguments and critiques have been focused mostly on the economic consequences of software patents. One aspect of the debate has focused on the proposed European Union directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, also known as the \\"CII Directive\\" or the \\"Software Patent Directive,\\" which was ultimately rejected by the EU Parliament in July 2005.  Arguments for patentability  There are several arguments commonly given in defense of software patents or defense of the patentability of computer- implemented inventions. =Public disclosure= * Through public disclosure, patents encourage the open sharing of information and additional transparency about legal exposure. * Through public disclosure, patents encourage the transfer of mechanical technology, which may apply more broadly. =Economic benefit= *Software patents resulting from the production of patentable ideas can increase the valuation of small companies. *Software patents increase the return on investment made, which includes government funded research. =Encouragement of innovation= *The ability to patent new software developed as a result of research encourages investment in software-related research by increasing the potential return of investment of said research. =Copyright limitations= Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying, which is not necessary for patent infringement. Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are algorithms; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means. This means that patents incentivize projects that are unique and innovative in functionality rather than simply form. Copyrights, in turn, only incentivize uniqueness in form. = Protection for small companies = Software patents can afford smaller companies market protection by preventing larger companies from stealing work done by a smaller organization, leveraging their greater resources to go to market before the smaller company can. =Hardware patents analogy= Hardware and software are sometimes interchangeable. If people can patent hardware, then ideas describing software implemented by that hardware should also be patentable.  Arguments against patentability  Opponents of software patents argue that: = Software is math = A program is the transcription of an algorithm in a programming language. Since every (Turing- complete) programming language implements Church's lambda calculus by virtue of the Church-Turing thesis, a program is thus the transcription of a mathematical function. Math is not patentable. Therefore, neither is software.Pamela Jones, An Explanation of Computation Theory for Lawyers. =Software encourages patent thickets= A patent thicket is a dense web of patents that companies must decipher to develop new technology. There are various types of patent thickets such as when a single innovation is protected by multiple patent holders or when a product is covered by numerous patents. The consequences of patent thickets are increased difficulty of innovation, complex cross-licensing relations between companies, and discouragement of newcomers from entering the software industry.Gonz√°lez, A. G. (2006). The software patent debate. Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 1(3), 196‚Äì206. doi:10.1093/jiplp/jpi046 =Hinders research and development= * Some scientific studies and expert reviews have concluded that patent systems paradoxically hinder technological progressJaffe, Adam B.; Lerner, Joshua. Innovation and its discontents: how our broken patent system is endangering innovation and progress. and allows monopolies and powerful companies to exclude others from industrial science in a manner that is irreconcilable with anti-trust laws. * Gary Becker, Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, argues, \\"Their exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations, but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more than compensate the economy for that cost.\\" =Hinders innovation= * The Electronic Frontier Foundation published the Defend Innovation whitepaper after doing two and a half years of research on software patents. They concluded that many overbroad software patents are being awarded, which is actually stifling innovation. * Interoperability is thought to promote innovation, and patent systems have the potential to block the development of such technologies. * There has been a lack of empirical evidence to suggest that patents have any positive effect on innovation, and furthermore, the system primarily ‚Äúencourage[s] failing monopolists to inhibit competition by blocking innovation.‚Äù =Cost and loss of R&D; funds= *Should a software developer hire a patent attorney to perform a clearance search and provide a clearance opinion, there is no guarantee that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a clearance search may not prove cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.Mulligan, Christina and Lee, Timothy B., Scaling the Patent System (March 6, 2012).

A study in 2008 found that American public companies‚Äô total profits from patents (excluding pharmaceuticals) in 1999 were about $4 billion, but that the associated litigation costs were $14 billion. * Software developers and hardware manufacturers may be forced to pay license fees for standards that are covered by patents (the so-called essential patents). Some examples are H.264, MP3 and GIF (that uses the patented LZW compression algorithm) and JPEG for graphics. =Copyright= *It is argued that traditional copyright has provided sufficient protection to facilitate massive investment in software development. *Copyright is the right of an author(s) to prevent others from copying their creative work without a license. Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although registration does strengthen protection. Copyrighted material can also be kept secret. =Software is different= * Software programs are different from other electromechanical devices because they are designed solely in terms of their function. The inventor of a typical electromechanical device must design new physical features to qualify for a patent. On the other hand, a software developer need only design new functions to create a working embodiment of the program. * Software is a component of a machine. The computer‚Äôs hardware is generic; it performs functions that are common to all of the software that is capable of being executed on the computer. Each software program that is capable of executing on the computer is a component of the computer. * Computers \\"design\\" and build the structure of executable software. Thus, software developers do not design the executable software's physical structure because they merely provide the functional terms. =Trivial patents= *Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.James Bessen & Michael J. Meurer \\"Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk\\" Princeton University Press, 2008, : \\"(...) many people have focused solely on patent examination quality as the objective of reform, based largely on anecdotal evidence of trivial, obvious, or otherwise invalid patents. Although we support efforts to improve patent examination quality (large numbers of questionable patents create conditions in which poor patent notice is unavoidable), our analysis suggests that this is only part of the problem and the patent system cannot likely be fixed by addressing only this issue. Of course, the notice problems that we find central to the poor performance of the patent system are not the only ones looking for a remedy. We argue, however, that many proposed reforms, including reforms directed toward improving patent examination quality, are unlikely to be effective unless patent notice is improved generally\\". *Patent examiners rarely have a comprehensive knowledge of the specific technologies disclosed in the patent applications they examine. This is in large part due to the enormous number of micro-niches in the software field and the relatively limited number of examiners. So, patents are sometimes allowed on inventions that appear to be trivial extensions of existing technologies.James Bessen & Michael J. Meurer \\"Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk\\" Princeton University Press, 2008, : \\"It is possible, however, that features of software technology make it particularly susceptible to the patenting of obvious ideas, especially given the legal doctrines of non-obviousness developed by the Federal Circuit. For one thing, the general-purpose nature of software technology‚Äîagain, because the technology is abstract, similar techniques can be used in a wide range of applications‚Äî makes it inevitable that techniques known in one realm might be applied in another, yet the documentary evidence that the Federal Circuit requires for a demonstration of obviousness might not be published.\\" =Open source disadvantage= * The free and open source software community, and many companies that use and contribute to open source oppose software patents because they can impede or prohibit the distribution of free software. They contend that patents threaten to undermine FLOSS, regardless of innovations produced by FLOSS collaborations. =Software patents' usefulness as an information source is limited= *Some patent disclosures in the software field are not readable to some programmers; as a result, patents are rarely used as a source of technical information by software developers. =Long patent pendencies= * In the software industry, product lifecycles churn rapidly; a product can run through its entire lifecycle and become outdated during the time it takes a patent filed on the invention underlying it to issue. *According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office‚Äôs official statistics for 2015, the average pendency for patent applications categorized under ‚ÄúComputer Architecture, Software, and Information Security‚Äù was approximately two and a half years, exceeding the pendencies of all other patent categories. *The average total pendency of European technology patents in 2015 was approximately two and a half years. Technology patents in China, Korea, Japan, and Europe had first action pendencies of approximately one year compared to those in the United States, with first action pendencies of under two years. Europe and the United States have the longest total pendencies of around 26 months, while China, Korea, and Japan have shorter total pendencies from 15 to 21 months. =Patent trolls= *Software companies are becoming patent hoarders, spending billions of dollars on accumulating patents and even more on litigations and settlements ‚Äì resources could be better put to use in creating new and innovative software advances. Too many patents are given out, making it difficult for developers to create new software due to possibility of accidental infringement. Engineers say it impedes their creativity. *In 2016 IBM earned 8,088 U.S. patents; thus earning the most grants from the U.S. Patent Office for the 24th year in a row. They bested their closest tech rival by more than 2,500 patents. Behemoths like IBM, Google, and Oracle gather as many patents in the fields considered 'hot' such as Artificial Intelligence to limit the innovation potential of smaller firms. Patent claims were part of the Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc. case, where Oracle claimed that Google's implementation of Java within Android violated Oracle's copyright and patents. Duke Computer Science Professor Owen Astrachan was involved in the case. *Not only large companies are patent hoarders. NPEs (Non-Practising Entities) are businesses that assert patents through litigation to achieve revenues from alleged infringers without practising or commercialising the technology covered by the patents they hold. NPEs are very effective in their litigations. Damages awards for NPEs almost are 3 times greater than practicing entities over the last 5 years. =Disproportionately harms startups= * Patent assertion entities (patent trolls) disproportionately affect startups, which are important for job creation and innovation. Companies with less than $100M annual revenue represent two-thirds of unique defendants in troll suits. A large percentage of startups reported that being sued by trolls resulted in significant operational impact.  U.S. Supreme Court decisions  Several Supreme Court decisions since 2000, as well as the Federal Circuit and district court decisions interpreting and implementing them, have dramatically impacted the status of software patents in the United States. They have particularly affected many thousands of business-method patents that issued as a result of Federal Circuit decisions in the 1990s. The two principal Supreme Court decisions were Bilski v. Kappos and Alice v. CLS Bank, the latter of which confirmed the applicability of the earlier decision Mayo v. Prometheus to computer-related inventions in which a computer was used to implement an abstract principle or preexisting business practice. (These cases are the subject of separate Wikipedia articles, which discuss the background and rulings in these cases in more detail, and supply authorities supporting the generalizations about those cases that follow. Additional detail is found in the Wikipedia article Software patents under United States patent law, along with supporting citations not repeated in this summary of those articles.) = Bilski case = The Bilski case involved a patent application on methods for hedging against commodity price fluctuations, which the PTO had rejected. The Federal Circuit, in In re Bilski, upheld the PTO's rejection on the grounds that the claims failed the machine-or-transformation test, which the court held should be used as the sole test of patent eligibility. The court did not hold that all business methods are patent ineligible, though a minority of the judges would have ruled that business methods are not properly the subject of patents. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of ineligibility, in Bilski v. Kappos, but on more general, and less articulated in detail, grounds of undue abstractness. It rejected the Federal Circuit's elevation of the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of patent eligibility, saying that rather it was simply a \\"useful clue.\\" The 5-4 majority refused to hold that all business methods were incapable of being patented, but four justices would have established such a rule. A concurring opinion pointed out that the Court was unanimous, however, as to many issues in the Bilski case, including a rejection of the Federal Circuit's late 1990s State Street Bank decision, which allowed patents on any advance, technical or nontechnical (and in that case a numerical financial calculation of stock price changes) that produces a \\"useful, concrete and tangible result.\\" The Supreme Court's Bilski decision was criticized because of its lack of detailed guidance on how to determine whether a claim was directed to an abstract idea. Nonetheless, it provided some clarification and affirmed the Federal Circuit's taking a new direction in its software-related patent cases. = Mayo case = In Mayo v. Prometheus, the Supreme Court invalidated a patent on a diagnostic method, because it non-inventively implemented a natural principle; the Court drew on cases involving computer software and other abstract ideas. In this case, the Court was much more detailed in describing how to recognize a patent-ineligible claim to an abstract idea. The Mayo methodology has come to dominate patent-eligibility law. It revived the approach of the Flook and Neilson cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive. This led to the \\"two-step\\" Alice test described next. = Alice case = At the time the Mayo case was decided, there was some uncertainty over whether it applied only to natural principles (laws of nature) or more generally to patent eligibility of all abstract ideas and general principles, including those involved in software patents. The Alice decision confirmed that the test was general. The Alice case involved patents on electronic methods and computer programs for financial-trading systems on which trades between two parties who are to exchange payment are settled by a third party in ways that reduce the risk that one party performs while the other does not. The patents cover what amounts to a computerized escrow arrangement. The Court held that Mayo explained how to address the problem of determining whether a patent claimed an unpatentable abstract idea or instead a potentially patentable practical implementation of an idea. This requires using a \\"two-step\\" analysis. In the first step, the court must determine whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, or other general principle. If not, the claim is potentially patentable, subject to the other requirements of the patent code. If the answer is affirmative, the court must proceed to the next step. In the second step of the analysis, the court must determine whether the patent adds to the idea \\"something extra\\" that embodies an \\"inventive concept.\\" If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court finds the patent invalid under section 101. This means that the implementation of the idea must not be conventional or obvious to qualify for a patent. Ordinary and customary use of a general- purpose digital computer is insufficient; the Court said‚Äî\\"merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\\" The ruling continued with these points: * A mere instruction to implement an abstract idea on a computer \\"cannot impart patent eligibility.\\" * \\"[T]he mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\\" * \\"Stating an abstract idea 'while adding the words \\"apply it\\"' is not enough for patent eligibility.\\" * \\"Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment.\\" The Alice decision met a mixed reception, but profoundly affected U.S. patent law. In its wake, as explained in the Wikipedia article on the case, courts invalidated vast numbers of so- called software and business-method patents (the overwhelming majority of those the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered) and the number of such patents issued has drastically fallen. The Alice decision has been widely criticized for its failure to specify in detail the boundaries of patent eligibility, but it has also been defended because its unanimity tends to stabilize decisional law in the field.Richard H. Stern, Alice v CLS Bank: US Business Method and Software Patents Marching towards Oblivion?, [2014] 619, 629. = Subsequent developments = After Alice, the Federal Circuit and district courts invalidated large numbers of business- method and software patents based on those courts' interpretations of Alice. Federal Circuit Judge William Bryson summed this up in these terms: > In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of > invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that > purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to > perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that > they do not contain an ‚Äúinventive concept‚Äù that solves practical problems > and ensures that the patent is directed to something ‚Äúsignificantly more > than‚Äù the ineligible abstract idea itself. [Citing Alice and Mayo.] As such, > they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, > rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the > claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific > solutions to the problem at issue. [Citing Alice and Mayo.] It is for those > reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming > ‚Äúabstract ideas‚Äù and has held that they are not directed to patentable > subject matter.

Patent law has changed to address new technologies, and decisions of the United States Supreme Court and United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) beginning in the latter part of the 20th century have sought to clarify the boundary between patent-eligible and patent-ineligible subject matter for a number of new technologies including computers and software. The first computer software case in the Supreme Court was Gottschalk v. Benson in 1972. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided about a half dozen cases touching on the patent eligibility of software- related inventions. The eligibility of software, as such, for patent protection has been only scantily addressed in the courtsHowever, a recent nonprecedential decision of the Federal Circuit held that software as such is not patent eligible. or in legislation.There has been legislation addressing business method patents, however, which are almost always based on software. The America Invents Act (AIA), for example, created new procedures for post- grant challenges to patents on \\"Covered Business Methods\\" (CBMs). See generally In fact, in the recent Supreme Court decision in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Court painstakingly avoided the issue, and one Justice in the oral argument repeatedly insisted that it was unnecessary to reach the issue.. During oral argument, Justice Sotomayor repeatedly asked counsel whether Alice was a software case: \\"Why do we need to reach . . . software patents at all in this case?\\"; \\"What's the necessity for us to announce a general rule with respect to software? There is no software being patented in this case.\\"; \\"Do you think we have to reach the patentability of software to answer this case?\\" The Court's opinion in Alice does not discuss the patent eligibility of software as such. The expression \\"software patent\\" itself has not been clearly defined. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has permitted patents to be issued on nothing more than a series of software computer instructions, but the latest Federal Circuit decision on the subject invalidated such a patent. The court held that software instructions as such were too intangible to fit within any of the statutory categories such as machines or articles of manufacture.The Supreme Court had held previously that software in algorithm form without machine implementation could not be patented in process format, see Gottschalk v. Benson and Parker v. Flook, but could be patented when claimed as a machine inventively using software, see Diamond v. Diehr. On June 19, 2014 the United States Supreme Court ruled in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International that \\"merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\\" https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/supreme-court-tosses- software-patent-24210428https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the- switch/wp/2014/06/19/the-supreme-court-has-unanimously-struck-down-a-software- patent-that-everyone-agreed-was- terrible/https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/06/19/patent-lawyers- software-companies-like-alice-corp-ruling-trolls-not-so-much/ The ruling continued: > [...] the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent- > ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.

The Office rejected such claims and declined to patent them, but the CCPA repeatedly reversed the Office's rulings and ordered the issuance of patents. The Office's position was hampered during the 1960s by the uncertainty over whether the Supreme Court could review decisions of the CCPA, because it was unclear whether it was an Article I or Article III court. That question was resolved, however, in Brenner v. Manson, in which the Court held the CCPA an Article III court and that there was certiorari jurisdiction to review CCPA decisions.. The Manson decision also began a string of decisions in which the Supreme Court reversed decisions of the CCPA, and then those of its successor court the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), which had reversed decisions of the Patent Office or PTO denying a patent to an applicant.Almost invariably, the Supreme Court's grant of certiorari in patent cases has resulted in reversal of the decision of the court below and reinstatement of the Patent Office or PTO decision denying a patent. = Benson case = In the first of the Supreme Court's computer software decisions (the \\"patent-eligibility trilogy\\"), Gottschalk v. Benson,. the Court reversed the CCPA's reversal of a Patent Office decision, thus denying a patent on an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers. In so ruling, the Court looked back to 19th century decisions such as O'Reilly v. Morse,. which held that abstract ideas could not be made the subject of patents. = Flook case = The Court's 1978 ruling in Parker v. Flook,. was similar to Benson in principle. The Benson and Flook cases also established that a \\"clue\\" to whether a patent might be granted on a process was whether the process was carried out with a particular apparatus or else effectuated a transformation of an article from one state or thing to another state or thing. In Flook, where the sole departure from the prior art was concededly the formula or algorithm, no transformation was alleged, and it was conceded that the implementing apparatus was old or conventional, the process was simply not the kind of process that could be patented. The principle, stated in Flook, that to be patent eligible the implementation of an abstract idea or law of nature must be inventive, rather than routine or conventional, became of paramount importance in Supreme Court jurisprudence at the beginning of the 21st century. (This occurred in the Mayo and Alice cases.) = Diehr case = In the 1981 case of Diamond v. Diehr, the United States Supreme Court upheld the CCPA's reversal of the Patent Office, and ordered the grant of a patent on a process for curing rubber in a mold, a substantial part of which involved use of a computer program that used a well- known formula (the Arrhenius Equation) for calculating the time when rubber was cured and the mold could therefore be opened. The Supreme Court stated that in this case, the invention was not merely a mathematical algorithm, but a process for molding rubber, which used the mathematical formula for an industrial purpose, and was therefore patent eligible. In the Diehr case, there was no concession (as there was in Flook) that the implementation was conventional, and the process did effectuate a transformation of substances (from uncured rubber to cured rubber). The Supreme Court later explained the meaning of this decision and how it actually harmonized with Benson and Flook in the Court's 2012 Mayo opinion.. In the Mayo case, the Court explained that Diehr had not simply claimed the Arrhenius Equation implemented in a non- inventive machine but had instead implemented it in a way that the Diehr Court had found inventive. Under this interpretation, Diehr satisfied the requirements that the Court had earlier found not to have been met in the Flook case. = Pre-1994 period = After this point, more patents on software began to be granted, albeit with conflicting and confusing results. Patenting grew at a rate of 21% per year for high tech companies during this period. This was due in part to judicial decisions during this period that limited the scope of software copyright protection. After its creation in 1982, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) charted a course that tried to follow the Diehr precedent. Patents were allowed only if the claim included some sort of apparatus, even rather nominal apparatus at times, such as an analog-to-digital converter front end, or in one case a scratch-pad memory for storing intermediate data.See A representative decision from this period is In re Schrader, in which the CAFC set forth probably its best and most detailed formulation of the rule it was attempting to follow. =Alappat case = Dissatisfaction with the perceived artificiality of this rule erupted, however, in rulings beginning with the en banc 1994 decision in In re Alappat, in which the CAFC majority held that a novel algorithm combined with a trivial physical step constitutes a novel physical device. Therefore, a computing device on which is loaded a mathematical algorithm is a \\"new machine,\\" which is patent-eligible.This argument is discussed in the Wikipedia article Piano roll blues. That article suggests that the opinion of the Supreme Court in Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 573 U.S. __ (2014), rejected the argument. This ruling was immediately preceded by In re Lowry, which held that a data structure representing information on a computer's hard drive or memory is similarly to be treated as a patent-eligible physical device, and in which the Solicitor General's Office declined the PTO's request to seek certiorari. As a result, the PTO did not even request that the Solicitor General's Office seek certiorari in the Alappat case. = State Street Bank case and aftermath = Finally, in State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group, the CAFC ruled that a numerical calculation that produces a \\"useful, concrete and tangible result\\", such as a price, is patent-eligible.See also AT&T; Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (similar ruling, upholding patent based on Boolean ANDing). \\"The USPTO gets ready to throw in the towel\\", cartoon published in IEEE Micro in July 1995 The USPTO's reaction to this change was, for the time being at least, to \\"throw in the towel.\\" The Clinton administration appointed Bruce Lehman as Commissioner of the USPTO in 1994. Unlike his predecessors, Lehman was not a patent lawyer but the chief lobbyist for the Software Publishing Industry.See Developments in the Economics of Copyright: Research and Analysis (eds. Lisa Takeyama, Wendy J. Gordon, Ruth Towse) at note 34 and accompanying text, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=ecPJSiHIi2kC&pg;=PA17&lpg;=PA17&dq;=%22Business+Software+Alliance%22+%22bruce+lehman%22&source;=bl&ots;=AB0bhcvwJs&sig;=-P1MAbCTwwXxVwDZcTWSN0-DvcU&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=_EF6U9DrB6vMsQTZvYDYAg&ved;=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q;=%22Business%20Software%20Alliance%22%20%22bruce%20lehman%22&f;=false . In 1995, the USPTO established some broad guidelines for examining and issuing software patents. The USPTO interpreted the decisions of the Federal Circuit as requiring the USPTO to grant software patents in a broad variety of circumstances. Although the U.S. Congress has never legislated specifically that software is patentable, the CAFC interpreted the broad description of patentable subject in section 101 of the Patent Act of 1952 and the failure of Congress to change the law after the CAFC decisions allowing software patents as an indication of Congressional intent. The reaction of the defeated-feeling USPTO was characterized in the cartoon shown at right, which appeared in IEEE Micro in 1995. = Case law after 2000 = The United States Supreme Court remained silent on these decisions and developments for years. The first response appeared in a dissenting opinion in LabCorp v. Metabolite, Inc. (2006).. Although certiorari had been granted, the Court dismissed it as improvidently granted; the minority dissent argued that the question of statutory subject matter in patent law should be addressed. Justice Breyer's dissent stated: > [State Street] does say that a process is patentable if it produces a > 'useful, concrete, and tangible result.' But this Court has never made such > a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances > where this Court has held the contrary. He continues to directly address the claim that software loaded onto a computer is a physical device: > . . . And the Court [in Gottschalk v. Benson] has invalidated a patent > setting forth a process that transforms, for computer-programming purposes, > decimal figures into binary figures‚Äîeven though the result would seem > useful, concrete, and at least arguably (within the computer's wiring > system) tangible. At about the same time, in a concurring opinion in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,. Justice Kennedy (joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer) questioned the wisdom of permitting injunctions in support of \\"the burgeoning number of patents over business methods,\\" because of their \\"potential vagueness and suspect validity\\" in some cases. =Bilski case= This was followed by the decision of the CAFC in In re Bilski, which opened a new chapter in this history. In Bilski, as the article on that case explains[What article?], the CAFC superseded State Street and related decisions with a return to the tests of the patent-eligibility trilogy (Benson-Flook-Diehr), although while those decisions had merely treated the machine-or- transformation test as a clue to past decisions the CAFC attempted to make that test dispositive. However, in 2009 the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment but overturned the CAFC's rationale in Bilski, stating that the machine-or-transformation test is not the exclusive test of patentability. At the same time, the Court (per Justice Kennedy) held, 5-4, that Bilski's software, business-method patent application was patent ineligible because it was directed to an abstract idea, largely preempting hedging as a business expedient. But the majority declined to rule all business-method patents ineligible. Justice Stevens, in one of his last opinions before retiring from the Court, concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the majority's rationale. Joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, he argued that the claimed invention was patent ineligible because it was a business method (advancing much the same analysis as that in Judge Dyk's opinion in the Federal Circuit) and therefore outside the reach of the patent system. Justice Breyer filed a concurring opinion in which he explained the points on which all nine justices agreed. =Mayo case= Bilski was followed by the Court's unanimous opinion in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs, Inc. Although it did not involve a software patent (it concerned a medical assay implementing a natural principle), it stated a methodology for determining patent eligibility that is currently dominant in software cases. It revived the approach of the Flook and Neilson cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive. =Alice case= In May, 2013, the CAFC issued a fragmented en banc decision in CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp. in which the judges were unable to reach a coherent unified decision on the patentability of the business-method software claims at issue. The case went to the Supreme Court, which decided it on June 19, 2014. The Court used the analysis from the Mayo decision and held Alice's patents invalid as directed to an abstract idea. As in Bilski, the Court did not rule all business-method patents ineligible. However, the Court's requirement (as in Mayo and Flook) for an \\"inventive concept\\" for the implementation of the principle underlying the claimed method and its insistence that \\"merely saying [to] apply it with a computer\\" is not enough to confer patent eligibility may doom many or most business-method software patents.See Richard H. Stern, Alice v CLS Bank: US Business Method and Software Patents Marching towards Oblivion?, [2014] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 619, 626, suggesting that \\"most business methods will fail to pass muster under the Flook-Mayo-Alice rationale.\\" See also Richard H. Stern, Alice v. CLS Bank: Are US Business-Method and Software Patents Doomed? Part 1, IEEE Micro, Sept./Oct. 2014, at p. 68 (\\"A majority of the Court refused to address the patent eligibility of business methods as such. Yet, because of their typical abstractness, and because of the legal analysis that the Court prescribed for implementations of abstract ideas, business-method patents now seem like lemmings marching in the thousands toward oblivion. That is not equally so for all software patents, of which business-method patents are a major subset. The Court left some room for non-business-method software patents.\\"). = Post-Alice period= Since the Alice decision, the Federal Circuit and district courts have held a number of business-method patents to be patent ineligible as mere abstract ideas implemented in a conventional way without embodying any inventive concept. Digitech In Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. Electronics for Imaging, Inc., the Federal Circuit invalidated a patent on a \\"device profile\\" and methods for generating \\"device profiles.\\" The device profile was a collection of information about a graphic image, and it was generated by combining data sets containing such information. The court held that the device and method for generating it were abstract ideas and patent ineligible: \\"Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible.\\" buySAFE In buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., the Federal Circuit invalidated under section 101 a patent on a computerized surety system for online transactions. The court said the computer implementation of the underlying surety idea was \\"not even arguably inventive.\\" The court concluded: \\"In short, with the approach to this kind of section 101 issue clarified by Alice, it is a straightforward matter to conclude that the claims in this case are invalid.\\" The court remarked in passing, however, that if \\"enough extra is included in a claim, it passes muster under section 101 even if it amounts to a business method.\\" But the court did not explain or illustrate what would be \\"enough extra.\\" DDR Holdings In DDR Holdings v. Hotels.com, the Federal Circuit upheld one patent and invalidated several others under Alice. This is the only instance since the Alice decision in which the Federal Circuit held a patent to be eligible. The court said that the eligible patent solved an Internet-centric problem in an inventive way. (It essentially framed one website within another, so that it appeared to be a part of the other site.) Versata v. SAP In Versata Development Group, Inc. v. SAP America, Inc., the Federal Circuit summarized its holdings in several other post-Alice cases that are not summarized above. The following summaries are extracted from the Federal Circuit's opinion in the Versata case: * In Ultramercial,Ultramercial, LLC v. Hulu, LLC, 657 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2011), cert. granted, judgment vacated sub nom., . [the Federal Circuit] found that claims directed to the abstract idea of using an advertisement as an exchange or currency were ineligible even though the claims were tied to a general purpose computer and invoked the Internet. * In Content Extraction &Transmission; LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, National Ass'n, [the Federal Circuit] found that claims directed to the abstract idea of collecting data from hardcopy documents, recognizing certain information within the collected data, and storing that information in memory were ineligible. This was true despite noting that, if the claims were construed in the most favorable manner to the appellants, the claims would require scanning and processing technology. The Versata court also summarized two pre-Alice decisions in which the rulings were consistent with Alice: * In Bancorp Services, L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assurance Co., [the Federal Circuit] found ineligible claims directed to the abstract idea of managing a stable value life insurance policy. * In CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc., [the Federal Circuit] found that a broadly worded method claim and a claim reciting a computer readable medium for executing the method claim were ineligible. [The Federal Circuit] concluded the claims were drawn to a method of verifying the validity of credit card transactions over the Internet, and the steps in the method could be performed in the human mind or by a human using a pen and paper. In the 2015 Versata case, itself, the Federal Circuit affirmed the final order of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), the recently created adjudicatory arm of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), invalidating as patent ineligible the claims in issue of Versata's patent on a method of determining what price to charge a customer. It said, \\"Using organizational and product group hierarchies to determine a price is an abstract idea that has no particular concrete or tangible form or application.\\" Moreover, the implementation was a \\"purely conventional\\" use of a computer. Loyalty Conversion and other 2014 district court cases The software cases after Alice adopt its method of legal analysis, based on the decision of the Supreme Court in the Mayo case. This calls for a two-step analysis. First, the court determines whether the claimed invention is based on an abstract idea or principle of some sort, often expressed at a high level of generality, such as a computerized escrow or surety arrangement, as in the Bilski and Alice cases.See, e.g., Loyalty Conversion Sys. Corp. v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 3d 829 (E.D. Tex. 2014) (\\"At their core, the asserted claims of the two patents in suit are directed to the conversion of loyalty award points of one vendor into loyalty award points of another. That core idea plainly would not be patentable without more, as it is indistinguishable in principle from the simple and familiar financial or business operations that were at issue in Bilski and CLS Bank....\\"); Tuxis Techs., LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 1:13-cv-01771 , 2014 WL 4382446 (D. Del. Sept. 3, 2014) (method of \\"upselling\\" or \\"cross-selling\\" -- \\"the basic idea of offering something to a customer based on his or her interest in something else,\\" a concept that \\"has been a cornerstone of commercial activity since time immemorial\\"); Walker Digital, LLC v. Google, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 3d 501 (D. Del. 2014) (\\"The claim limitations essentially recite a generic headhunting or matchmaking request by two parties.\\"). If the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, the court proceeds to the second step of analysis, which is to determine whether the patent adds \\"something extra\\" to the idea that embodies an \\"inventive concept.\\" If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court will find the patent invalid under section 101. Few software patents have survived this analysis since the Alice decision,For a listing of decisions, as of May 2015, see Steven Callahan, Alice: The Death of Software-Related Patents? (May 1, 2015). The author states: \\"[S]ince Alice, of the 76 decisions dealing with Alice challenges, 57 have invalidated patents; only 16 have upheld them on the merits (3 additional decisions rejected Alice challenges for procedural reasons). Excluding the procedural decisions, that is a 78% win rate for defendants challenging patents under Alice in court. (Of course, numerous patents have also fallen victim to Alice challenges before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.)\\" largely because they are written in purely functional language to claim a result rather than describe a structure for accomplishing a result. Thus, Federal Circuit Judge Bryson explained when sitting by designation as a trial judge in the Loyalty v. American Airlines case:Loyalty Conversion Sys. Corp. v. American Airlines, Inc. > In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of > invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that > purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to > perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that > they do not contain an \\"inventive concept\\" that solves practical problems > and ensures that the patent is directed to something \\"significantly more > than\\" the ineligible abstract idea itself. See CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2355, > 2357; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1294. As such, they represent little more than > functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In > addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, > they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. See > CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2354; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1301-02. It is for those > reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming > \\"abstract ideas\\" and has held that they are not directed to patentable > subject matter. What software patents will survive Alice analysis? The question has been raised, therefore, what kinds of software-related patents will survive the analysis prescribed in Alice and Mayo. The question was considered during the oral argument of the Alice case, although not more than cursorily in the opinion. Counsel for CLS Bank suggested that data compression and data encryption were software technologies that are likely to be patent-eligible because they address \\"a business problem, a social problem, or a technological problem.\\" The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, said that it would be difficult to identify a patent-eligible business method unless it involved an improved technology, such as \\"a process for additional security point-of-sale credit card transactions using particular encryption technology\\" ‚Äì \\"that might well be patent eligible.\\"Oral Argument in Alice. At least one commentator has questioned that, however, because encryption largely consists of mathematical operations using modular arithmetic and theorems of Euler.Note on Encryption Software, in Chapter 8-D of Intellectual Property Protection of Digital Information in the New Millennium: Cases and Materials on Intellectual Property Rights in Computer Programs and Related Subject Matter Yet, as the commentator points out, in the Flook case the Supreme Court said: \\"As the CCPA has explained, 'if a claim is directed essentially to a method of calculating, using a mathematical formula, even if the solution is for a specific purpose, the claimed method is nonstatutory [patent ineligible].' \\" Furthermore, in July 2014, just after the Alice decision came down, a Federal Circuit panel held a patent ineligible, quoting Flook and adding: \\"Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible.\\"In Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. Electronics for Imaging, Inc., 758 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Judge Bryson's comments, quoted above, may therefore be more predictive of the likely outcomes of future software- related patent cases, including encryption ones, than counsel's assurances during oral argument in the Alice case. Allvoice In Allvoice Developments US, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., the Federal Circuit in a May 2015 nonprecedential opinion invalidated patent claims to a speech recognition \\"interface\\" without undertaking an Alice analysis. The so-called interface was entirely a set of software instructions, claimed in means-plus-function form. The court found it unnecessary to go through the two-step analysis because a set of instructions is not a machine or article of manufacture or composition of matter, and it did not purport to be a process. Accordingly, the claimed subject matter did not fit within any of the statutory categories of section 101, which defines patentable subject matter.See Moreover, it was intangible, and in the Digitech case, the Federal Circuit had held that except for processes, \\"eligible subject matter must exist in some physical or tangible form.\\"  Landmark decisions  * Gottschalk v.

Typically it refers to the artwork created by whalers, engraved on the byproducts of whales, such as bones or cartilage. It is most commonly made out of the bones and teeth of sperm whales, the baleen of other whales, and the tusks of walruses. It takes the form of elaborate engravings in the form of pictures and lettering on the surface of the bone or tooth, with the engraving highlighted using a pigment, or, less often, small sculptures made from the same material. However, the latter really fall into the categories of ivory carving, for all carved teeth and tusks, or bone carving. The making of scrimshaw probably began on whaling ships in the late 18th century and survived until the ban on commercial whaling. The practice survives as a hobby and as a trade for commercial artisans. A maker of scrimshaw is known as a scrimshander. The word first appeared in print in the early 19th century, but the etymology is uncertain. History and materials Carved whale bone whistle dated 1821. 8 cm long. Belonged to a 'Peeler' in the Metropolitan Police Service in London. Pair of walrus tusks depicting a sailor and a woman. Rhode Island or Connecticut, circa 1900 Closeup of a sailor Closeup of a woman Scrimshaw is derived from the practice of sailors on whaling ships creating common tools, where the byproducts of whales were readily available. The term originally referred to the making of these tools, only later referring to works of art created by whalers in their spare time. Whale bone was ideally suited for the task, as it is easy to work and was plentiful. The widespread carving of scrimshaw became possible after the 1815 publication of the journal of U.S. Navy Captain David Porter exposed both the market and the source of the whale teeth, causing a surplus of whale teeth that greatly diminished their value and made them available as a material for ordinary seamen. Around this time is the earliest authenticated pictorial piece of sperm whale scrimshaw (1817). The tooth was inscribed: \\"This is the tooth of a sperm whale that was caught near the Galapagos islands by the crew of the ship Adam [of London], and made 100 barrels of oil in the year 1817.\\" Other sea animal ivories were also used as alternatives for rarer whale teeth. Walrus tusks, for example, may have been acquired in trade from indigenous walrus hunters. Scrimshaw essentially was a leisure activity for whalers. Because the work of whaling was very dangerous at the best of times, whalers were unable to work at night. This gave them a great deal more free time than other sailors. A lot of scrimshaw was never signed, and a great many of the pieces are anonymous. Early scrimshaw was done with crude sailing needles, and the movement of the ship, as well as the skill of the artist, produced drawings of varying levels of detail and artistry. Originally, candle black, soot or tobacco juice would have been used to bring the etched design into view. Also ink was used that the sailors would bring on before the voyage. Today's artists use finer tools in various sizes, mostly borrowed from the dental industry. Some scrimshanders ink their work with more than one color, and restrained polychromed examples of this art are now popular. Originating in an era when sperm whales were initially plentiful only to be hunted to near collapse, scrimshaw no longer is an artform utilizing an easily renewable animal resource, but one that is susceptible to contraband. Now, the Endangered Species Act and international conventions restrict the harvest and sale of ivory to try to reverse the scarcity of ivory-bearing animals. * Though there are sources of ivory that are sanctioned and legal, poachers in Africa and other continents where elephants are an endangered species still kill for their ivory, Elephant ivory has been regulated since 1976 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and selling African ivory has been prohibited since 1989. * 19th and 20th century scrimshaw, scrimshaw crafted before 1989 (elephant) or before 1973 (sperm whale ivory, walrus ivory etc.) is legal. It is prohibited after that year for commercial import in the U.S. under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. * Additionally, walrus tusks bearing the Alaska State walrus ivory registration tag, and post- law walrus ivory that has been carved or scrimshawed by a native Alaskan Indian (Eskimo), is legally available. * Finally, any ivory considered ancient, such as 10,000- to 40,000-year-old mammoth ivory, is completely unrestricted in its sale or possession. Scrimshanders and collectors acquire legal whale teeth and marine tusks through estate sales, auctions and antique dealers. To avoid illegal ivory, collectors and artists check provenance and deal only with other established and reputable dealers. Scrimshaw that is found to have been illegally sourced may be seized by customs officials worldwide, dramatically loses value and is very hard to re-sell, as the limited channels through which collectible scrimshaw passes serves as a check on unscrupulous persons. As with any other fine art form, it is usually possible for experienced museums, auction houses or other experts to perceive a fake. Scrimshaw can also be three-dimensional artifacts that are hand carved by the scrimshander. They carved useful tools such as a jagging wheel. The jagging wheel is a multi-purpose tool used to pierce and trim a pie crust. Corset busks were carved from bone or ivory. Care and preservation Ivory is a fragile medium; many 19th-century pieces were preserved because they were kept in a barrel of oil on board ship. Gary Kiracofe, a scrimshander in Nantucket, Massachusetts, advises collectors that if a piece looks dry, one should fill the center of the tooth with unscented baby oil and allow it to remain until as much oil as possible is soaked into the microscopic pores of the ivory. Clear paste wax or high-end car wax will seal the surface after oiling. Bone items are even more fragile (more fibrous and porous) and may be treated the same way: with a light clear mineral oil. Organic oils are inadvisable, as they will eventually hasten discoloration, as on old piano keys subjected to the natural oils in one's hands. Professional conservators of art and historic artifacts generally recommend against applying any type of dressing (like oil or wax) to organic objects such as whale ivory. Sensible choices regarding storage and display preserve whale ivory best: keep out of direct sunlight, handle with cotton gloves or freshly washed hands, and avoid keeping in places with shifting humidity and temperature. Coating organic objects can induce eventual cracking. Design Whale teeth and bones were a highly variable medium, used to produce both practical pieces, such as hand tools, toys and kitchen utensils, and highly decorative pieces, which were purely ornamental. The designs on the pieces varied greatly as well, though they often had whaling scenes on them. For example, Herman Melville, in Moby- Dick, refers to \\"lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other skrimshander articles\\". Most engravings were adapted from books and papers. Collections Most of the original scrimshaw created by whalers is currently held by museums. Museums with significant collections include: * The Hull Maritime Museum in Kingston upon Hull, England * The Kendall Whaling Museum, which is part of the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts * The Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England * The Scrimshaw Museum at the Peter Caf√© Sport in Horta on the island of Faial in the Azores * The Nantucket Whaling Museum * The Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia Other images of scrimshaw can be found at: * The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa * Ripley's Museum Niagara Falls ‚Äì Scrimshaw piano key art * Ripley's Museum Baltimore ‚Äì Scrimshaw piano key art * DaVinci exhibit ‚Äì world travelling exhibit ‚Äì Scrimshaw piano key art Modern scrimshaw Example of modern scrimshaw by artist Edmund Davidson While scrimshaw is rarely done on whale bone these days, it is still practiced by a few artists. Common modern materials are micarta, ivory (elephant, fossil, walrus), hippo tusk, warthog ivory, buffalo horn, giraffe bone, mother of pearl, and camel bone. Modern scrimshaw typically retains the nautical themes of historical scrimshaw, but can also go well outside of the traditional. Today's trade and carving techniques have led to more advanced, but not as unique scrimshaw carvings. Collectors are advised to be aware of fakes.Ronald C.

It dates back to at least the 9th century, and has entered the folklore of a number of ethnic groups. The story Wolf, goat and cabbage Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage. The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it? Solution The first step that must be taken is to let the goat go across the river, as any other actions will result in the goat or the cabbage being eaten. When the farmer returns to the original side, he has the choice of taking either the wolf or the cabbage across next. If he takes the wolf across, he would have to return to get the cabbage, resulting in the wolf eating the goat. If he takes the cabbage across second, he will need to return to get the wolf, resulting in the cabbage being eaten by the goat. The dilemma is solved by taking the wolf (or the cabbage) over and bringing the goat back. Now he can take the cabbage (or the wolf) over, and finally return to fetch the goat. An animation of the solution His actions in the solution are summarized in the following steps: #Take the goat over #Return #Take the wolf or cabbage over #Return with the goat #Take the cabbage or wolf over #Return #Take goat over Thus there are seven crossings, four forward and three back. Visualisation of the moves possible in the puzzle. Uppercase letters denote the Fox, Goose and Beans at the destination, and lowercase ones denote them at the origin. Movement of each object is represented by a coordinate axis. All the 8 valid and invalid placements are shown as vertices of a cube, and all 12 movements as its edges. Invalid moves are crossed out, leaving the 2 solutions shown in blue and purple. Occurrence and variations The puzzle is one of a number of river crossing puzzles, where the object is to move a set of items across a river subject to various restrictions. In the earliest known occurrence of this problem, in the medieval manuscript Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes, the three objects are a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage, but other cosmetic variations of the puzzle also exist, such as: wolf, sheep, and cabbage;Alcuin's Transportation Problems and Integer Programming , Ralf Bornd√∂rfer, Martin Gr√∂tschel, and Andreas L√∂bel, preprint SC-95-27 (November 1995), Konrad-Zuse- Zentrum f√ºr Informationstechnik Berlin., p. 26 fox, chicken, and grain;The Classic River Crossing Puzzle fox, goose and corn;Mary Jane Sterling, Math Word Problems for Dummies, P.313 and panther, pig, and porridge. The logic of the puzzle, in which there are three objects, A, B, and C, such that neither A and B nor B and C can be left together, remains the same. The puzzle has been found in the folklore of African-Americans, Cameroon, the Cape Verde Islands, Denmark, Ethiopia, Ghana, Italy, Romania, Russia, Scotland, the Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe., pp. 26-27; It has been given the index number H506.3 in Stith Thompson's motif index of folk literature, and is ATU 1579 in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system.\\"Carrying a Wolf, a Goat, and a Cabbage across the Stream. Metamorphoses of ATU 1579\\", Piret Voolaid, Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore 35 (2007), pp. 111‚Äì130. Tartu: Eesti Kirjandusmuuseum. The puzzle was a favorite of Lewis Carroll,p. 17, Rediscovered Lewis Carroll Puzzles, Lewis Carroll, compiled by Edward Wakeling, Courier Dover Publications, 1996, . and has been reprinted in various collections of recreational mathematics., p. 26. In his 'Arabian Nights' memoir, Meetings with Remarkable Men, the metaphysical Magus, G. I. Gurdjieff cites this riddle as \\"The Wolf, the goat and the cabbage\\". He notes, \\"This popular riddle clearly shows that...not solely by means of the ingenuity which every normal man should have, but that in addition he must not be lazy nor spare his strength, but must cross the river extra times for the attainment of his aim.\\" Variations of the puzzle also appear in the adventure game Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, the Nintendo DS puzzle game Professor Layton and the Curious Village, and in The Simpsons episode \\"Gone Maggie Gone\\", where Homer has to get across a river with Maggie, Santa's Little Helper, and a jar of rat poison that looks like candy. In the Class of 3000 episode \\"Westley Side Story\\", Sunny and his students perform a similar exercise involving a chicken, a coyote and a sack of corn. The Between the Lions episode \\"Farmer Ken's Puzzle\\" portrays it being made into a computer game with a cat, a hen, and a sack of seeds. In the Bull episode \\"Justice for Cable\\", Benny begins a riddle with \\"a man has a fox, a duck, and a bag of beans\\". Bull inexplicably declares \\"There is no answer\\", and everyone believes him.https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv- show=bull-2016&episode;=s03e04 In some parts of Africa, variations on the puzzle have been found in which the boat can carry two objects instead of only one. When the puzzle is weakened in this way it is possible to introduce the extra constraint that no two items, including A and C, can be left together., p. 27.

A short history of the Noon Guns posted at the Lion Battery Video of the Noon Gun being fired in Cape Town, South Africa. The gun is fired at precisely 12:00 every day from Signal Hill. The Noon Gun has been a historic time signal in Cape Town, South Africa since 1806. It consists of a pair of black powder Dutch naval guns, fired alternatingly with one serving as a backup. The guns are situated on Signal Hill, close to the centre of the city.  History  The settlement at the Cape of Good Hope was founded by the Dutch in 1652 and the signal guns were originally part of the regular artillery at the Imhoff Battery at the Castle in Cape Town. The guns, which are still in use today, are 18 Pounder Smooth Bore Muzzle Loading Guns, and were designed by captain Thomas Blomfield in 1786. They were cast by Walker & Co. in early 1794, and proof fired at Woolwich in June 1794. After this type of gun was adopted by the Royal Navy as their standard naval gun, the Noon Guns were brought to Cape Town during the 1795 occupation. In 1795 during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain took the Cape Colony from the Dutch East India Company ((De) Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) in Dutch). The VOC transferred its territories and claims to the Batavian Republic in 1798 and ceased to exist in 1799. The British handed the Cape Colony back to the Batavian Republic in 1803. However, in 1806 the Cape was occupied again by the British after the Battle of Blaauwberg. Thereafter the British controlled the Cape continuously until it became a part of the independent Union of South Africa in 1910. Shortly after the English took over, the two Dutch guns were removed from the Imoff Battery and redeployed in town as signal guns, and the Castle received the latest English 18-pounders. Because the very loud report of the cannons upset residents nearby, the guns were eventually moved to the somewhat more remote Lion Battery on Signal Hill at . The first signal fired from there was on 4 August 1902. Sailing ships were slow by modern standards and could not store fresh food for long periods, so the provisioning of vessels was one of the major commercial functions at Cape Town in those olden days. Indeed, the city was widely renowned as \\"The Tavern of the Seas\\". There were no telephones or telegraphs before the latter half of the 19th century and the sound of the guns travelled much faster than a dispatch rider on a horse. The guns were therefore originally used to announce the arrival of a ship, perhaps requiring provisions for the next leg of its journey, to residents living in the interior. As more modern means of communications and transportation became available, Cape Town discontinued the use of the guns to announce that a ship was in port. The original guns ‚Äì 18-pounder, smoothbore muzzle-loaders ‚Äì are still in use today. The ritual represents one of Cape Town's oldest living traditions. These are the oldest guns in daily use in the world. They fire every day at 12 noon sharp, except Sundays and public holidays, and are maintained by the South African Navy. Time signalling In addition to the aforementioned port hailing duties, the guns have had the task of firing a time signal since 1806. According to local tradition, the initial purpose of the gun was to allow ships in port to check the accuracy of their marine chronometers (a precision instrument used aboard ships to help calculate longitude). The gun report might be too inaccurate for ships several kilometers away if they did not correctly compensate for the relatively slow speed of sound. For this reason, ships marked their time by the puff of smoke rather than the sound, and this is one reason the guns are sited high above Cape Town Harbour. The invention of the more accurate time ball in 1818 soon made time guns redundant for mariners wishing to set their chronometers. The time ball on Signal Hill was used to relay time from the Cape Town Observatory, whose time ball was not visible from all parts of the bay. At precisely 1:30pm Cape Mean Time, the ball would be dropped at the Observatory ‚Äì an observer on Signal Hill would then drop that more prominent ball too. When setting their chronometers, mariners adjusted their observation of the time ball on Signal Hill by a second to allow for the relay from the observatory. After the advent of the galvanic telegraph, it became possible to electrically trigger a gun remotely, and since 1864 the Noon Gun has been fired directly from the master clock of the oldest timekeeper in the country, the South African Astronomical Observatory. A South African Navy duty officer is present to ensure both guns are charged, explain the Noon Gun to any onlookers, and manually fire the backup gun in case of some failure with the active gun. There have been few remarkable incidents involving the guns over the centuries. Perhaps the most notable one occurred many decades ago, in the days when horse-drawn traffic was commonplace. The rammer used to tamp the charge into the muzzle was inadvertently left in the bore of the cannon, and when the gun fired the rammer flew down into the city and killed a horse. One day in June 1895, the gun fired at 10:30 rather than 12:00 when a spider interfered with the relay used to remotely fire the gun. On Friday 7 January 2005, both the main gun and backup gun failed to fire owing to a technical difficulty. This was the first time in 200 years that the noon gun had not fired as scheduled. On the 9th of April 2013, a Twitter account was created for the Noon Gun that sends a single message reading \\"BANG!\\" everyday (except Sundays and public holidays).

The hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1955, and ended on November 15, 1955. It was a hyperactive season in terms of ACE with 199, but slightly above average in terms of tropical storms, with 13 recorded tropical cyclones. The first storm, Alice, had persisted since December 30, 1954. Alice caused relatively minor impact as it tracked through the Lesser Antilles and eastern Caribbean Sea in early January. Tropical Storm Brenda caused two deaths and minor damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in early August. The quick succession of Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused significant flooding in the Northeastern United States, with nearly $1 billion (1955 USD) in losses and at least 232 fatalities. The next three storms - Hurricanes Edith and Flora and Tropical Storm Five - caused very minor or no impact. In early August, Hurricane Gladys caused severe localized flooding in Mexico, primarily in Mexico City. Additionally, an offshoot of Gladys inflicted minor impact in Texas. Hurricane Hilda struck the Greater Antilles and then Mexico. It was attributed to at least 304 deaths and $120 million in losses. In mid-September, Hurricane Ione struck eastern North Carolina and contributed the flooding from Connie and Diane, resulting in seven fatalities and $88 million in damage. Later that month, Hurricane Janet, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane, lashed several countries adjacent to the Caribbean Sea, as well as Mexico and British Honduras. Janet resulted in $53.8 million in damage and at least 716 deaths. An unnamed tropical storm in the month of October did not impact land. Hurricane Katie, the final storm, caused minor damage in a sparsely populated area of Hispaniola, totaling to at least $200,000; 7 fatalities were also reported. Collectively, the storms caused 1518 deaths and $1.2 billion in losses, making it the costliest season at the time. A record number of names - four - were retired following the season, which was later tied by the 1995, 2004, and 2017 seasons, trailing only the 2005 season, when five names were retired.

Dunn was replacing Grady Norton, who died from a stroke while forecasting Hurricane Hazel of the previous season. In early June, the Hurricane Hunters received new reconnaissance aircraft, which contained the latest radar and electronic equipment, at the time. Later that month, shortly before the start of the 1955 season, a bill was proposed in the United States Senate to provide funding for 55 new radar stations along the East Coast of the United States. After the United States House of Representatives passed a bill allotting $5 million, the Senate disputed about possibly increasing the funding two-fold to $10 million. Eventually, the radars were installed, starting in July 1955. After the devastating storms of the season, particularly Connie and Diane, a United States Government organization with the purpose of monitoring tropical cyclones was established in 1956 with $500,000 in funding; it later became the modern-day National Hurricane Center. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1955. It was an above average season in which 13 tropical cyclones formed. In a typical season, about nine tropical storms develop, of which five strengthen to hurricane strength. All thirteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eleven of these attained hurricane status. Six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of a strong, ongoing La Ni√±a. Hurricane Alice developed in late December 1954, but persisted into January 1955, and was operationally analysed to have developed in the latter. Within the official hurricane season bounds, tropical cyclogenesis did not occur until July 31, with the development of Tropical Storm Brenda. However, during the month of August, four tropical cyclones formed - including Connie, Diane, Edith, and an unnamed tropical storm. Five additional tropical cyclones - Flora, Gladys, Hilda, Ione, and Janet - all developed in September. Tropical cyclogenesis briefly halted until an unnamed tropical storm formed on October 10. The final storm of the season, Katie, dissipated on October 19, almost a month before the official end of hurricane season on November 15. Eight hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 1,603 deaths and $1.1 billion in damage. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 199, which was above the 1950-2000 average of 96.1. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm Brenda= Tropical Storm Brenda developed in the north-central Gulf of Mexico at 0600 UTC on July 31\\\\. During the next 24 hours, the storm strengthened and attained its peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on August 1 before making landfall in New Orleans, Louisiana, at the same intensity. The storm steadily weakened inland and by August 21, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Early on August 23, Brenda dissipated while located over eastern Texas. Between Pensacola, Florida, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, rainfall totals were generally about ; flooding, if any, was insignificant. Tropical storm force winds were reported, peaking at at Shell Beach, Louisiana, on the south shore of Lake Borgne. At the same location, tides between above normal were measured. Four people were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after their tugboat sank in Lake Pontchartrain, while three others swam to shore. Additionally, two fatalities occurred in the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama. =Hurricane Connie= A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression east of Cape Verde on August 3. After six hours, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Connie. By August 4, Connie began to rapidly strengthen, becoming the first major hurricane of the season later that day. Initially, it posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, although it passed about 50 miles (80 km) north. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching 8.65 inches (220 mm) in Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. In Puerto Rico, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie turned to the northwest, reaching peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). The hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north, and struck North Carolina on August 12 as a Category 2 hurricane. Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in the state of North Carolina. Connie made a second landfall in Virginia, and it progressed inland until dissipating on August 15 near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Connie is noted for being the only hurricane in recorded history to strike Michigan/the Great Lakes region as a tropical storm. Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident. In the Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14 people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulation. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and eleven deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded homes and subways. At least 225,000 people lost power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86 million, although the rains from Connie was a prelude to flooding by Hurricane Diane. The remnants of Connie destroyed a few houses and boats in Ontario and killed three people in Ontario. =Hurricane Diane= A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 7. It slowly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Diane on August 9\\\\. After a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Connie, Diane curved northward or north-northeastward and quickly deepened. By early on August 8, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. Only several hours later, Diane peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm resumed its west-northwestward motion on August 13\\\\. Colder air in the region caused Diane to weaken while approaching the East Coast of the United States. A recently installed radar in North Carolina noted an eye feature, albeit poorly defined. Early on August 17, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm. The storm then moved in a parabolic motion across North Carolina and the Mid- Atlantic before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on August 19\\\\. Diane headed east-northeastward until becoming extratropical on August 20\\\\. Despite landfall in North Carolina, impact in the state was minor, limited to moderate rainfall, abnormally high tides, and relatively strong winds. Further north, catastrophic flooding occurred in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and New England. Of the 287 stream gauges in the region, 129 reported record levels after the flooding from Tropical Storm Diane. Many streams reported discharge rates that were more than twice of the previous record. Most of the flooding occurred along small river basins that rapidly rose within hours to flood stage, largely occurring in populated areas; the region in which the floods occurred had about 30 million people, and 813 houses overall were destroyed. The floods severely damaged homes, highways, power lines, and railroads, and affected several summer camps. Overall utility damage was estimated at $79 million. Flooding in mountainous areas caused landslides and destroyed crop fields; agriculture losses was estimated at $7 million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82 million in damage. Overall, Diane caused $754.7 million in damage, of which $600 million was in New England. Overall, there were at least 184 deaths. =Hurricane Edith= An easterly tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on August 21 in the tropical Atlantic. Moving towards the west-northwest, the disturbance slowly intensified, reaching tropical storm strength at 1200 UTC on August 23 and as such was named Edith by the Weather Bureau. Afterwards, Edith began to curve towards the northwest as it gradually intensified, attaining hurricane strength on August 25\\\\. The hurricane continued to intensify as it recurved and accelerated to the northeast, reaching its peak intensity on August 28 as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). At the same time, a reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum barometric pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.27 inHg) in the storm's eye as Edith made its closest pass to Bermuda. The hurricane began to gradually weaken after it passed east of the island, before becoming extratropical on August 31\\\\. The cyclone would later make a clockwise loop before dissipating completely late on September 3\\\\. Although Edith remained at sea, it was suspected that the hurricane may have caused the loss of the pleasure yacht Connemara IV, after it separated from its moorings. =Tropical Storm Five= A weak disturbance was first observed near Grand Cayman on August 23, gaining tropical storm strength by 0600 UTC that day. Moving towards the north-northwest, the storm passed over western Cuba on August 24, without much change in intensity. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the tropical storm marginally intensified, reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained wind speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h) by 1200 UTC on August 26\\\\. Nearing the Gulf Coast of the United States, the system curved towards the west. The storm maintained its intensity up until landfall in Louisiana near New Orleans on August 27. Moving inland, it slowly weakened while crossing the Central United States, degenerating to tropical depression strength by August 29 and later dissipating over Missouri the following day. Strong waves generated by the storm caused tides above average, slightly damaging coastal resorts. Weather offices advised small craft offshore to remain in port due to the strong waves. Rough seas battered the schooner Princess Friday, but the ship was able to ride out the storm. The storm produced squalls further inland, causing heavy rains. A weather station reported a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg), the lowest in association with the tropical storm. Despite the strong waves and heavy rains, only minor damage was reported. =Hurricane Flora= A tropical wave moved along the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and passed through Cape Verde between August 30 and August 31\\\\. Although the Panair do Brasil headquarters in Recife, Brazil reported a closed circulation on August 30, Tropical Storm Flora did not develop until 0600 UTC on September 2, while located about of Cape Verde. The storm strengthened at a steady pace for the following 48 hours and reached hurricane status late on September 3\\\\. Flora headed on a parabolic track, initially moving west-northwestward and then northwesterly by September 4\\\\. It continued to intensify and by September 6, the storm curved northward. Around time, a minimum barometric pressure of was reported. However, it may have been lower, as the storm did not attain its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h) until September 7\\\\. Flora maintained this intensity while curving to the northeast, but became extratropical at 0000 UTC on September 9, while located about midway between Flores Island in the Azores and Sable Island, Nova Scotia. =Hurricane Gladys= A tropical depression developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC on September 4\\\\. Six hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gladys. The storm quickly intensified and reached hurricane status on September 5, roughly 24 hours after developing. Around that time, Gladys peaked as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Later on September 5, an offshoot of Gladys with cyclonic turning formed in the northern Gulf of Mexico and struck Texas on September 6; it may have been a separate tropical cyclone. Initially, Gladys headed north-northwestward, but then re-curved south- southwestward while approaching the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Early on September 6, it made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas as a weakening tropical storm. The system rapidly dissipated inland. Gladys dropped up to in Tampico, Tamaulipas. The worst of the flooding from Gladys occurred in Mexico City. Roughly 5,000 residents were isolated and required rescue. Police estimated that 2,300 homes were inundated with of water. About 30,000 families were impacted by the storm. Two children drowned and five additional people were listed as missing. In Texas, the highest sustained wind speed was 45 mph (75 km/h) in the Corpus Christi-Port O'Connor area, with gusts between offshore. Precipitation peaked at in Flour Bluff, a neighborhood of Corpus Christi. Flooding in the area forced \\"scores\\" of people to evacuate their homes. Damage estimates reached $500,000. =Hurricane Ione= A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on September 10, while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. After six hours, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ione. Eventually, it turned to the northwest. At 0000 UTC on September 15, Ione reached hurricane intensity, while situated north of the Leeward Islands. Ione continued to deep while moving northwest. The storm reached Category 4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of early on September 18\\\\. Around midday on the following day, it made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a Category 2 hurricane. Shortly after moving inland over eastern North Carolina, Ione weakened to a tropical storm. Late on September 19, Ione re- emerged into the Atlantic near Norfolk, Virginia. The storm quickly re- strengthened early on September 20, but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 21\\\\. Strong winds, heavy rainfall, and abnormally high tides lashed some areas along the East Coast of the United States, especially North Carolina. In Cherry Point, sustained winds reached 75 mph (121 km/h), with gusts up to 107 mph (172 km/h). Overall, damage was slightly more than $88 million, mostly to crops and agriculture. Rainfall in the state peaked at in Maysville. Storm surge in North Carolina peaked at in Wrightsville Beach. As a result, several coastal roadways were flooded, including a portion of Highway 94 and Route 264. Seven deaths were reported in North Carolina. The remnants of Ione brought gusty winds to Atlantic Canada, which broken poles, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and caused power outages, especially in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. =Hurricane Hilda= A tropical wave located near the Lesser Antilles spawned a tropical depression on September 12\\\\. It is estimated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Hilda early on the following day. Hilda quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane by September 12\\\\. Although the storm passed just north of Hispaniola on September 13, damage is unknown, if any. Later that day, Hilda made landfall near the southeastern tip of Cuba on September 13. There, it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80% of the coffee crop in Oriente Province. In the eastern Cuban city of Baracoa, Hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country. Damage totaled $2 million in Cuba, and there were four deaths. Later, the hurricane moved across the Caribbean Sea, causing light damage in the sparsely-populated region of the eastern Yucat√°n Peninsula. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico, Hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) late on September 18. Before the hurricane moved ashore, there was residual flooding in Tampico from earlier Hurricane Gladys. Hilda struck the city early on September 19, with gusts estimated at 150 mph (240 km/h). The storm dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90% of Tampico, while its strong winds damaged half of the homes, leaving 15,000 homeless. Throughout Mexico, 11,432 people were directly affected by Hilda. Overall, the storm killed 300 people and caused over $120 million. Additionally, the outer bands of Hilda caused minor flooding in southern Texas, particularly in Raymondville. =Hurricane Janet= Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21\\\\. Moving toward the west across the Caribbean Sea, Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The intense hurricane made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal, Mexico on September 28\\\\. Janet's landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucat√°n Peninsula marked the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic basin made on a continental mainland, with all previous storms making landfall as Category 5 hurricanes on islands. After weakening over the Yucat√°n Peninsula, it moved into the Bay of Campeche, where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29\\\\. Janet quickly weakened over Mexico's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30\\\\. In its developmental stages near the Lesser Antilles, Janet caused significant damage to the island chain, resulting in 189 deaths and $7.8 million in damages in the Grenadines and Barbados. While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost, with all eleven crew members believed perished. This was the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas on Quintana Roo and British Honduras. Only five buildings in Chetumal, Mexico remained intact after the storm. An estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. At Janet's second landfall near Veracruz, significant river flooding ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the month. The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in the Tampico area. The flood damage would lead to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States. At least 1,023 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8 million in damages. =Tropical Storm Eleven= A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 18 and continued west-northwestward. It is possible that the system developed into a tropical depression the next day, although lack of data prevented such classification until September 23, when a nearby ship reported winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). An approaching cold front turned the system to the north on September 24\\\\. The structure gradually became better organized, and after turning to the northeast on September 26, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. This was based on a ship report of 45 mph (75 km/h) winds, which was also estimated as the system's peak intensity. On September 27, the system became extratropical and accelerated its forward motion, dissipating within a larger extratropical storm south of Iceland on the next day. =Tropical Storm Twelve= A tropical wave was reported to have passed through Cape Verde on October 4\\\\. The system slowly developed a vertex as it curved in a generally northward direction. By early on October 10, two ships reported that a tropical depression formed almost halfway between the Azores and the Leeward Islands. After six hours, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. While re-curving to the northeast, the storm attained its maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h); the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in relation to the storm was , but the time of measurement is unknown. Although no significant weakening occurred, it eventually merged with an extratropical cyclone on October 14, while still well southwest of the Azores. During its extratropical stage, a ship in the area reported an atmospheric pressure as low as . =Hurricane Katie= A disturbance in the ITCZ developed into a tropical depression north of Panama on October 14\\\\. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katie. The system moved generally northeast due to the presence of a strong low pressure area along the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, Hurricane Hunters observed a rapidly intensifying hurricane, encountering winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a pressure of several hours before the peak intensity. Early on October 17, Katie made landfall in extreme eastern Sud- Est, Haiti as a strong Category 2 hurricane (although it may have been stronger). About half of homes in the town of Anse-√†-Pitres were destroyed. Across the border in Pedernales, Dominican Republic, 68 houses were damaged. Overall losses were at least $200,000 and 7 fatalities were reported. While crossing the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, Katie became very disorganized and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on October 17, within a few hours after moving inland. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean just east of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Katie began accelerating to the northeast on October 18\\\\. During that time, the storm re-intensified and briefly approached hurricane intensity, although it failed to strengthen further due to interaction with a cold front. After passing just east of Bermuda on October 19, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Katie were last observed the following day.  Storm names  The following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in the North Atlantic in 1955. However, two of such storms went unnamed. Storms were named Brenda, Connie, Diane, Edith, Flora, Gladys, Hilda, Ione, Janet and Katie for the first (and only in case of Connie, Diane, Ione and Janet) time. Names not assigned are marked in gray. { width=90%  *Alice *Brenda *Connie *Diane *Edith *Flora *Gladys *Hilda *Ione  *Janet *Katie       } = Retirement = Connie, Diane, Ione, and Janet would later be retired. The 1955 season is tied with the 1995, 2004, and 2017 seasons for the second most storm names retired after a single season in the Atlantic basin, only surpassed by the 2005, which had five names retired. Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season, besides Hurricane Alice. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1955 USD.

In September 2007, TrueMajority and its related organization TrueMajorityACTION merged with USAction.USAction: History and Achievements By 2008, the combined groups had over 700,000 members, making it, together with MoveOn, one of the two largest liberal advocacy groups in the United States. TrueMajority was founded by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's. TrueMajorityACTION was a separate but closely related organization, which had a different status under U.S. law so that it could campaign for specific parties and politicians. TrueMajority merged with USAction in 2007. TrueMajority was mentioned on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, when Ben and Jerry made a guest appearance. In the episode, they offered free frisbees to Colbert viewers who visited the web site, and then they signed up each viewer who visited as a member of the advocacy group. Stances TrueMajority organized protests of the 2008 G-20 Summit. It also opposed the 2008 financial bailout of banks, and helped to organize protests of the bailout. In 2004 TrueMajority ran advertisements calling for a paper trail in electronic voting. =Iraq war opposition= TrueMajority co-sponsored protests and advertisements against the Iraq war in 2003.

Background Sterling attended Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, and worked as a lawyer and engineer before entering public life. He was a partner in the Sterling & Young law firm, and in 1974 became president of the Manotick Home & School Association. Politics =Davis government= Sterling ran unsuccessfully for a Progressive Conservative nomination in 1971, at age 29. He tried again, successfully, in 1977, and was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election in the safe eastern Ontario riding of Grenville‚ÄîCarleton. He served as parliamentary assistant to the Attorney General in 1978, but was not appointed to the cabinet of Bill Davis in his first term as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP). Sterling was returned without difficulty in the 1981 election, and served as a minister without portfolio from April 10, 1981 to February 13, 1982. He was appointed as Provincial Secretary for Justice on February 13, 1982. On July 6, 1983, he was named as Provincial Secretary for Justice. Sterling, who represents a predominantly rural and Protestant region of Ontario, disagreed with the Davis government's decision to fully fund Ontario's Catholic school system and insisted that his protest be entered into the official minutes of the executive council. Sterling initially supported Dennis Timbrell to replace Davis as party leader, but crossed to Frank Miller on the last ballot after Timbrell was eliminated. =In opposition= The Progressive Conservatives lost power following the 1985 election, although Sterling had no difficulty being re-elected in his own riding. There was another Progressive Conservative leadership convention in late 1985. On this occasion, Sterling broke with Timbrell (describing the latter's post-election opposition to Catholic school funding as an opportunistic volte-face), and supported Larry Grossman. In the Liberal landslide of 1987, however, he was only able to defeat Liberal candidate Roly Armitage by about 500 votes in the redistributed riding of Carleton. Sterling was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1990. =Harris government= In the 1995 election he was re-elected by almost 20,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives formed government under Mike Harris in 1995, and Sterling was appointed Minister of Small Business and Consumer Services on June 26 of that year. On August 16, 1996, he was promoted to Minister of Environment and Energy and Deputy House Leader. On October 7, 1997, he was again promoted to full House Leader and was given the re-titled post of Minister of the Environment. In the provincial election of 1999, Sterling was returned for the restructured riding of Lanark-Carleton. He was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Government House Leader on June 17, 1999. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, he became Minister of Consumer and Business Services; he also served as Minister of Correctional Services from December 5, 2000 to March 8, 2001. =Eves government= On April 15, 2002, after Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier, Sterling was appointed Minister of Transportation. After a cabinet shuffle on February 25, 2003, he was promoted to the position of Attorney General, with responsibility for Native Affairs. =In opposition (2nd time)= The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, although Sterling was able to defeat Liberal Marianne Wilkinson by about 6,000 votes. In the 2004 leadership race, Sterling supported Jim Flaherty's unsuccessful bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party. Lanark-Carleton was redistributed prior to the 2007 provincial election, and Sterling ran for re-election in the newly created riding of Carleton- Mississippi Mills, which had been created out of the eastern two-thirds of his old riding. He won by a convincing margin, defeating Liberal Megan Cornell by over 7,000 votes. In the 2009 leadership race, Sterling supported the successful candidacy of Tim Hudak. However, the membership of his riding association supported rural-rights candidate Randy Hillier; Carleton- Mississippi Mills was one of only three ridings in the province where Hillier won a first-ballot victory. In March 2011, Sterling was defeated in the race for his riding‚Äôs PC nomination by Jack MacLaren, the former president of the Ontario Landowners Association.

He held that position from 1944 until his retirement in 1988. Jacobs was considered one of the foremost brass pedagogues of his time as well as an expert on breathing as it related to brasswind, woodwind, and vocal performance. Due to childhood illness and adult onset asthma, his lung capacity was significantly impaired. He is best remembered for his playing philosophy which he referred to as \\"Song and Wind.\\" Life and performing career Jacobs was born in Philadelphia on June 11, 1915 but was raised in California. Jacobs family enjoyed music and he credited his mother, a keyboard artist, for his initial interest in music. He spent his youth progressing from bugle to trumpet to trombone and finally to tuba. When he was fifteen years old, he entered Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music on a scholarship and continued to major in tuba. After his graduation from Curtis in 1936, he played two seasons in the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra under Fabien Sevitzky. From 1939 until 1944, he was the tubist of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. In 1941, Jacobs toured the country with Leopold Stokowski and the All-American Youth Orchestra. He was a member of the Chicago Symphony from 1944 until his retirement in 1988. During his forty-four year tenure with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO), he took temporary leave in the spring of 1949 to tour England and Scotland with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was on the faculty of Western State College‚Äôs Music Camp at Gunnison, Colorado during the early 1960s. In June 1962, he had the honor of being the first tuba player invited to play at the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico. Mr. Jacobs, along with colleagues from the CSO were part of the famous 1968 recording of Gabrieli‚Äôs music with members of the Philadelphia and Cleveland Orchestras. He was also a founding member of the Chicago Symphony Brass Quintet, appeared as a soloist with the CSO on several occasions, and recorded the Vaughan Williams Concerto for Bass Tuba and Orchestra with Daniel Barenboim conducting the Chicago Symphony. In recognition of his outstanding career, in 2001, the Chicago Symphony's tuba chair was dedicated as the Arnold Jacobs Principal Tuba Chair, Endowed by Christine Querfeld. Jacobs was succeeded in the CSO by Gene Pokorny. Teaching Jacobs had the reputation as both the master performer and master teacher. He taught tuba at Northwestern University. He also taught lessons on all wind instruments in his private studio. He was one of the most sought-after teachers in the world, specializing in respiratory and motivational applications for brass and woodwind instruments and voice. His students include many in orchestras and university faculties around the world. Jacobs gave lectures and clinics throughout the world. During the CSO's 1977 and 1985 Japanese tours, Jacobs presented clinics in Tokyo. In January 1978, he lectured at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital about playing wind instruments for the therapeutic treatment of asthma in children. He presented masterclasses at Northwestern University a week each summer from 1980‚Äì1998. The Second International Brass Congress presented its highest award to him in 1984. In 1991, he presented a clinic for the United States Marine Band in Washington D.C. He gave masterclasses as part of the Hearst Scholar program at the University of Northern Iowa and the Housewright Chair at Florida State University. The Midwest Clinic presented Jacobs their highest award, the Medal of Honor, in 1985. In 1994, The Chicago Federation of Musicians awarded him for Lifetime Achievement at the first Living Art of Music awards. During his eightieth birthday celebration in 1995, he presented a lecture to the International Brassfest at Indiana University and the International Tuba- Euphonium Conference at Northwestern University. Northwestern's School of Music presented him the first Legends of Teaching award. Mayor Richard M. Daley proclaimed June 25, 1995 as Arnold Jacobs Day in the City of Chicago.

Written and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, it was first broadcast on December 20, 1968. In the episode, the Enterprise ferries a spoiled princess whose betrothal is hoped will bring peace to a star system at war. Elaan of Troyius was written and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, the only person in Star Trek production history ever to both write and direct a filmed Star Trek television episode. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the planet Elas to pick up Elaan, the Dohlman of Elas. Accompanying them is Ambassador Petri of Troyius, a planet with which Elas has been at war. As Petri explains, the Elasian Council of Nobles and the Troyius Tribunal have agreed to marry Elaan to the Troyian king to secure peace, lest the two planets destroy each other. Elaan is a most reluctant bride, cursing an arrangement that she considers a humiliation. Ambassador Petri's mission is to instruct Elaan in the manners and customs of the Troyians. Not long after the Enterprise begins the return journey to Troyius at low impulse speed, a Klingon warship is detected, which paces the Enterprise and ignores all hails. To complicate matters further, Elaan stabs Petri, who refuses to have any further dealings with the Dohlman and vows that his ruler will never marry her. The job of teaching her falls to Captain Kirk. In Sickbay, Nurse Chapel asks the ambassador why Elasian women are so prized in spite of their savagery. Petri explains that when the tears of an Elasian female touch a man's skin, his heart is \\"enslaved forever\\". Elaan does not take kindly to Kirk's efforts to educate her and attempts to stab him. He overpowers her, disarms her, and insists that she will learn what she has been ordered to learn. Elaan locks herself in a bathroom and begins to cry, saying she is tired of being hated by everyone. Kirk tries to comfort her, and after wiping a tear from her cheek finds himself besotted with Elaan. Meanwhile, one of the ship's engineers is killed by Kryton, Elaan's chief bodyguard, who then tampers with the Enterprises warp engines and tries to contact the Klingon battle cruiser. He is captured, but commits suicide before he can be interrogated. Kirk orders Chief Engineer Scott to check the ship's propulsion systems. Elaan reveals that Kryton was in love with her and had been infuriated by the news of the arranged marriage. The Klingon battlecruiser then begins what appears to be an attack. As Kirk orders the Enterprise to go to warp, Scott reports that, as a result of Kryton's sabotage, any attempt to do so will destroy the ship. As the Klingon passes by without firing, it becomes clear that they were hoping to destroy the Enterprise without an overt act of war. This plan having failed, the Klingons attack in earnest. Mr. Scott reports that Kryton damaged the dilithium crystals in the antimatter reactor control system, making it impossible to go to warp or fire their weapons. In Sickbay, Ambassador Petri again approaches Elaan and begs her to accept the necklace of Troyian royal jewels that was to be worn at her wedding, as a symbol of the hope for peace between their two worlds. Elaan accepts the necklace and subsequently appears on the bridge wearing it with her wedding dress. Spock detects strange energy readings from some of the jewels, which Elaan describes as common stones, valued only as good-luck charms. The stones are in fact dilithium crystals, which explains the Klingons' keen interest in this star system. The crystals are taken to Scott in Engineering, where he and Spock work to replace the damaged dilithium crystals as the battlecruiser moves in for the kill. Power is restored to the Enterprise just before the Klingons‚Äô final attack. After suffering serious damage from the Enterprise's photon torpedoes, the Klingon ship is successfully driven off. A much changed Elaan is delivered safely to Troyius. Before she departs, Elaan gives Kirk her dagger as a memento, explaining she has learned that \\"on Troyius, they do not wear such things.\\" She and Kirk say their farewells in the transporter room, with a heartbroken Elaan crying as she is beamed down. Later, McCoy appears on the bridge to report he has found an antidote to the Elasian tears, but it seems not to be needed after all. As Mr. Spock points out, \\"The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did.\\" Production and reception Cut from the episode was a scene in the ship's recreation room, where Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Spock meet and discuss how to calm Elaan. Uhura suggests using the sound of Spock's Vulcan harp to calm her; the music is later heard piped into Elaan's cabin. This episode features the first appearance of the D-7 class Klingon battle cruiser designed and built by Star Trek art director Walter M. Jefferies. The footage of the Klingon battle cruiser was re-used in subsequent episodes of the third season. France Nuyen is believed to be the first Vietnamese actor to appear on American television. She had previously starred with William Shatner on Broadway for two years in the title role of The World of Suzie Wong. She would later guest-star along with Shatner, as husband and wife, in the Kung Fu season 3 episode \\"A Small Beheading\\". This episode is also the final appearance in the original series (as originally broadcast) of Eddie Paskey as Lt. Leslie. This episode has the distinction of having all seven principal characters in the final shot, on the Enterprise bridge - Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov - along with an unidentified female Ensign. The episode's title character pays tribute to Helen of Troy from Homer's Iliad, and its plot borrows from William Shakespeare's comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Trek Navigator Mark A. Altman gave the episode two stars stating \\"A thinly veiled version of The Taming of the Shrew, the episode is largely carried on the shoulders of William Shatner.\\" The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rates \\"Elaan of Troyius\\" as a B, making note of character development and the unexpected ending: \\"If you'd asked me to predict the rest of the episode after Elaan and Kirk hooked up, I would've guessed it would have something to do with Kirk interfering with the wedding ... [i]nstead, we get a nifty space battle against the Klingons, a traitor in the Elasians, an unexpected source of dilithium crystals, and a curiously muted performance from Shatner that does a good job at conveying his internal struggle between feeling and duty without overselling it.\\" Samuel Walters of [dauntlessmedia.net] rates the episode as a C-, citing a \\"scattershot approach to the plot\\" which \\"leaves too many possibilities unexplored and underdeveloped,\\" and calling the entire episode \\"flat.\\" References External links \\"Elann of Troyius\\" Review of the remastered version at TrekMovie.com Category:Star Trek: The Original Series (season 3) episodes Category:1968 American television episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Helen of Troy ","title":"Elaan of Troyius"},{"id":"1136270","text":"Ladder diagram for Rubenstein's revenge: 52233 In toss juggling, Rubenstein's Revenge is a 3-ball juggling pattern named by George Gillson after its inventor, Rick Rubenstein.Gillson, George. Beyond the Cascade: Step-by-Step Guides to 88 Classic 3-Ball Juggling Tricks. p 68, The Ugly Juggling Co: UK 1993. Along with Mills' Mess and Burke's Barrage, it is one of three well- known named juggling patterns that involve complex carries and crossed arm throws. Rubenstein's Revenge is usually considered the most involved and difficult of the three.Dancey, Charlie. Charlie Dancey's Encyclop√¶dia of Ball Juggling p 128. Butterfingers: Bath, England 1994. Description Rubenstein's Revenge is a shape distortion of the three-ball Siteswap 52233. A shape distortion means that the throws are done from non-standard positions, in this case, using crossed arm movements. The varying heights can be represented in Siteswap notation by the numbers 52233. In this notation, each of the numbers represents one particular throw in a sequence of five throws. * The 5 is thrown under the arm as in a windmill or Mills Mess. * The hand that threw the 5 will now be crossed under the other arm, which now uncrosses, which is a held 2. * The first arm now crosses over the second arm while holding its ball, this is the second 2. * The next toss is a 3, which is thrown under the arm by the second hand on the side opposite to where the 5 was thrown. * The final toss is a 3, which is an uncrossing reverse cascade throw. This is one round of Rubenstein's Revenge. In addition to the varying ball heights, Rubenstein's Revenge incorporates elements of chops, claws and orbits. While the ball thrown as a 5 is in midair, the two other balls are carried in circular orbits around each other. These balls are then thrown and caught with the palm of the hand turned at an odd angle as in claws. One of these balls is caught with a downward diagonal movement as in chops. The overall pattern results in a fluid and natural spiraling motion of the hands and balls. The trick is difficult to understand, especially from a written description.

Life The year of Arnulf's birth is unknown, but it is said that he was the namesake of other Arnulfs born around the time of the reign of the seventh century bishop Arnulf of Metz and the Carolingian king Arnulf of Carinthia.Duggan, Anne J., ed. Nobles and Nobility in Medieval Europe: Concepts, Origins, Transformations. Rochester, N.Y.: Boydell & Brewer, 2000.p.36. Arnulf was the son of Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria and Cunigunde, herself a member of the Ahalolfing dynasty, daughter of Berthold I, the count palatine of Swabia. Her brother Erchanger assumed the Swabian ducal title in 915. Under the weak rule of the East Frankish king Louis the Child, Margrave Luitpold had already achieved a strong position in the Bavarian lands, succeeding the Wilhelminer margraves. He ruled over extended estates along the Danube with Regensburg (Ratisbon), and in the adjacent Nordgau. =Duke of Bavaria= Together with numerous Bavarian nobles, Arnulf's father was killed in the 907 Battle of Pressburg (Bratislava), when the Bavarian Heerbann under his command suffered a crushing defeat in a campaign against the Hungarian forces of Grand Prince √Årp√°d. After the death of his father, Arnulf succeeded him in his Bavarian lands, and soon after he assumed the title of a \\"Duke of Bavaria\\"Hammer, Carl I. From Ducatus to Regnum: Ruling Bavaria under the Merovingians and Early Carolingians. Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols Publishers, 2007.p.272-273 as ruler of the estates around Regensburg. An energetic and combative man, he received broad support by the local nobles, however, already during his ascension in to dukedom, he was faced with constant raids from the Hungarians. These attacks had laid waste the East Frankish lands of Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia.Henderson, Ernest F., A History of Germany in the Middle Age, London: George Bell & Sons. 1894.p.115. Besieged by frequent Hungarian raids and desperate to raise funds to finance a re-organized defense, Arnulf strengthened his power through confiscation of church lands and the secularization of numerous monastery estates, which earned him the nickname \\"the Bad\\" by medieval chroniclers. In several skirmishes he was able to force back the Hungarian invaders and he defeated a small force in 913 with the support by his Swabian relatives. Having re-established the stem duchy of Bavaria, he eventually negotiated a truce with the Hungarian princes, who thereafter largely passed through Bavaria on their raids into other German duchies. =Imperial politics= Duke Arnulf pursued a policy of independence from the East Frankish kings. Though in 911 he participated in the election of King Conrad I of Germany in 911; in Conrad's conflict with Erchanger of Swabia he backed his Swabian uncle and later challenged Conrad's Saxon successor, King Henry the Fowler. The dispute was only temporarily settled when in 913 Arnulf‚Äôs widow mother Cunigunda married King Conrad. In 916 Conrad's forces invaded Bavaria, attacking and pillaging Regensburg. These attacks drove Arnulf into exile with his former enemies in Hungary. In September, the king convoked a church council in Hohenaltheim, attended by the Bavarian episcopate, which summoned Arnulf and his younger brother Berthold on the grounds of excommunication at Regensburg on 1 November. It is more than likely that Arnulf and his family never appeared at the convocation, or that the council meeting was never held. As a result, they remained exiled among the Hungarians. In January 917, King Conrad, angered at the situation, called for the execution of his rebellious Swabian brother-in-law, Erchanger and his brother Berthold, giving Arnulf more pause for concern.Hammer, Carl I. From Ducatus to Regnum: Ruling Bavaria under the Merovingians and Early Carolingians. Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols Publishers, 2007. p.274. In 919, the death of Conrad I allowed Arnulf to return to Bavaria and expel the king‚Äôs forces. Conrad I being childless, the throne was open to Arnulf, again.Stubbs, William. Germany in the Early Middle Ages, 476-1250. ed by Arthur Hassall. New York: Howard Fertig.p.81. On his return, according to the Annales iuvavenses, in 920, Baiuarii sponte se reddiderunt Arnolfo duci et regnare ei fecerunt in regno teutonicorum (\\"the Bavarians freely submitted themselves to Duke Arnulf and asked him to reign within the realm of the Germans\\"). The 919 ascension of Henry the Fowler would bring forth a battle for the throne; however, whether the Bavarians, with some other East Franks, actually elected Arnulf anti-king in opposition to Henry has not been conclusively established. In any case, Arnulf's \\"reign\\" was short-lived; King Henry I turned out to be a strong opponent and defeated him in two campaigns in 921. When Arnulf was besieged by Henry in Regensburg, the duke entered into peace negotiations and recognized the sovereignty of the German king. King Henry confirmed Arnulf's autonomous rule over Bavaria, including the right of investiture and several important regalia, in return for Arnulf's renunciation of his royal claim. =Later years= Gravestone at St. Emmeram's Abbey Arnulf accompanied King Henry I on his 928 campaign against Duke Wenceslaus of Bohemia. In 935 he launched an attack against King Hugh of Provence to obtain the Iron Crown of Lombardy for his eldest son Eberhard, which only resulted in defeat. After King Henry had died in 936, the Duke attended the coronation of his son Otto as King of the Romans at Aachen Cathedral. Duke Arnulf died in his Regensburg residence on 14 July 937; he was succeeded by his son Eberhard, who nevertheless was deposed by King Otto in 938. Arnulf is buried at St. Emmeram's Abbey. A commemorative plaque in tribute to him was attached to the Walhalla memorial in 1842. Marriage and children Historians believed Arnulf was married to Judith of Friuli, a member of the Unruoching dynasty, daughter of Count Eberhard of Friuli (d. 866). The dates, however, do not match up. Judith of Friuli died ca. 881. This would have made a marriage between a boy (or at least young) Arnulf and an elder Judith, who was supposed to have produced several children 23 years or so after her death. More likely, therefore, is that he was married to Judith of S√ºlichgau (born ca. 888), daughter of Margrave Eberhard's grandson Count Eberhard of S√ºlichgau (d. after 889) and Gisela of Verona. They had the following children: *Eberhard (‚Äì), Duke of Bavaria from 937 to 938 *Arnulf II (‚Äì954), Count palatine of Bavaria from 938 *Herman (d. 954) *Henry *Louis (born , died after 974) *Judith (died after 984), married the Ottonian duke Henry I of Bavaria, brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor *Swanila *Berthold I markgraf of Nordgau *Luitpold I markgraf of Ostmark (maybe identical to Leopold I, Margrave of Austria) ** Judith.

Traditional dancing (2016) A barn dance is any kind of dance involving traditional or folk music with traditional dancing, occasionally held in a barn, but, these days, much more likely to be in any suitable building. The term ‚Äúbarn dance‚Äù is usually associated with family- oriented or community-oriented events, usually for people who do not normally dance. The caller will, therefore, generally use easy dances so that everyone can join in. A barn dance can be a ceilidh, with traditional Irish or Scottish dancing, and people unfamiliar with either format often confuse the two terms. However, a barn dance can also feature square dancing, contra dancing, English country dance, dancing to country and western music, or any other kind of dancing, often with a live band and a caller. Modern western square dance is often confused with barn dancing in Britain. Barn dances, as social dances, were popular in Ireland until the 1950s, and were typically danced to tunes with rhythms.Vallely, F. (1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music. New York University Press: New York, p. 25 Radio adaptations Barn dance shows in the United States WLS in Chicago is credited with developing the ‚Äúbarn dance‚Äù radio format, which was in large part responsible for the advent of country music in the United States. The National Barn Dance began as a program of old-time fiddling on April 19, 1924, with George D. Hay as the show's host and announcer. A year-and-a-half later, Hay moved to Nashville, Tennessee and brought in an old-time fiddler to launch the WSM Barn Dance; this show is now known as the Grand Ole Opry and remains on the air to this day. Dozens of similar programs cropped up on AM radio stations all across the United States, from New England to Los Angeles, including the WWVA Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia (1933), the Renfro Valley Barn Dance in Kentucky (1939), the Louisiana Hayride (1948), the Tennessee Jamboree (1953) and Ozark Jubilee (1954). Television adaptations (often under the guise of early variety shows) were popular in the 1950s and early 1960s but eventually faded out of style.

Nevertheless, the season was generally inactive with eight tropical storms ‚Äì two of which went unnamed ‚Äì and three hurricanes, two of which intensified further to attain major hurricane intensity. The season officially began on June 15 and ended on November 15, though the year's first tropical cyclone developed prior to the start of the season on June 8\\\\. The final storm dissipated on October 27, well before the official end of the season. The strongest hurricane of the year was Carrie, which reached the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale on two separate occasions in the open Atlantic; Carrie later caused the sinking of the German ship Pamir southwest of the Azores, resulting in 80 deaths. In total, the season resulted in at least 513 fatalities and $152.5 million in damages. Hurricane Audrey was the season's most destructive and deadly storm, causing 416 deaths and about $150 million in damages. Audrey made landfall just east of Sabine Pass, Texas, in the U.S. state of Louisiana as a strong Category 3 hurricane in late June. Three other tropical storms in the year made landfalls along the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing heavy rains that resulted in widespread flooding across much of the Southeastern United States. The highest rainfall total measured associated with a tropical cyclone was in Quarantine, Louisiana, during Tropical Storm Esther. However, an unofficial reading of was measured in an unknown location in the Florida Panhandle during Tropical Storm One. The year's other tropical systems curved out to sea without causing much impact. After the season, the name Audrey was retired.

It was a below- average season in which eight tropical cyclones formed, of which three became hurricanes. Of these hurricanes, two became major hurricanes. In an average season, ten tropical cyclones form, of which five become hurricanes. Five of the season's eight tropical cyclones developed in the Gulf of Mexico, the most since the 1936 season, in which six formed in the gulf. The first tropical storm of the season formed on June 8, a week before the official start of the hurricane season. However, the first named storm, Audrey, formed afterwards, on June 25; these two storms were the only to form in June during the season. July featured no Atlantic tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Bertha was the only system to form during August, developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic, no storms formed during the month, below the climatological average of one. The low monthly activity was in part due to an unfavorable wind pattern which prevailed across the Atlantic for much of the month. In September, however, conditions for tropical cyclogenesis were more favorable, with concomitant cyclonic activity. Four storms formed, of which two attained hurricane strength, higher than the mean activity of the last 70 Septembers. By contrast, only one tropical storm formed in October, below the average of two in the month. This tropical storm dissipated on October 27, 16 days before the official end of the hurricane season. Five tropical cyclones made landfall during the hurricane season, including one hurricane. All of these storms made landfall on the Gulf Coast of the United States. Property damage that resulted from cyclone-related impacts totaled to $152 million in the United States, with most caused by Hurricane Audrey, which made landfall near the border between Texas and Louisiana. 513 deaths were also caused by tropical storms during the season, with 416 deaths attributable to Hurricane Audrey. The season's activity was reflective with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 84, which is categorized as being \\"near normal.\\" However, this was under the 1950‚Äì2000 average of 96.1. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of hurricanes multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm One= An area of disturbed weather accompanied by low barometric pressure was first identified near the Yucat√°n Peninsula on June 7\\\\. Reports from the following day in the region reported pressures that were indicative of a developing tropical cyclone, and at 06:00 UTC, the disturbance attained tropical depression strength, the first of the season. The depression quickly developed into a tropical storm later that day. Though hurricane reconnaissance flights could not locate a well-defined center, ship observations showed that the tropical storm was moving quickly to the northeast. Due to its fast forward motion, the storm gained little in organization and made landfall near Port Leon, Florida, on June 9 with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). However, the system gradually strengthened as it crossed the Florida peninsula, reentering the North Atlantic later that day. On June 10, the storm reached peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) prior to becoming an extratropical storm. The post-tropical cyclone then strengthened and moved erratically in open seas before entirely dissipating on June 15\\\\. Despite the tropical storm's fast passage over land, heavy rainfall was reported, officially peaking at in Live Oak, Florida. However, unofficial reports of at least of rain were collected. In Perry, Florida, 100‚Äì200 families were evacuated due to the floodwater. Field crops, including tobacco and watermelon, were damaged, with flood damage estimated at $30,000. The storm also spawned ten tornadoes, with nine in northeastern Florida and one on Georgia's Jekyll Island. All of these tornadoes were relatively weak and caused minor damage, totaling to $12,000. At the coast, the tropical storm's strong winds generated waves high, which caused moderate damage. Though located south of where the storm made landfall, buildings and roads along the Tampa Bay Area waterfront were flooded by the waves. The cabin cruiser Kinnebar capsized in the Gulf of Mexico due to the waves, and five of the seven crew on board drowned; these were the only deaths associated with the system. Coastal damages due to storm surge amounted to $10,000, and overall the storm caused $52,000 in damages across the southeastern United States. =Hurricane Audrey= An ill-defined tropical wave was first identified in the Caribbean Sea on June 20, and moved westward into the Bay of Campeche. The disturbance slowly strengthened as it developed a low pressure system. A nearby trough aided the intensification of the system, and it developed into a tropical depression on June 25, while remaining generally stationary in the Bay of Campeche. Situated in an area of favorable upper-air divergence and warm SSTs, the storm quickly organized and strengthened, reaching hurricane strength later that day. Audrey began to accelerate northward due to troughing in the upper-levels in the atmosphere. During this time, the hurricane rapidly intensified, attaining Category 3 hurricane strength. On June 27, Audrey reached peak intensity with winds of , and made landfall at this intensity near the mouth of the Sabine River later that day. The hurricane quickly weakened as it moved inland, becoming an extratropical cyclone by June 28\\\\. The extratropical remnants of Audrey moved northeastward across the United States, before completely dissipating on June 29 over southern Quebec. Hurricane Audrey caused widespread impacts across a wide swath of the United States and Canada. The storm's worst effects were felt in Louisiana, where the storm caused $120 million in damages. The highest storm surge measured with the hurricane was , reported west of Cameron, Louisiana. The strong surge inundated much of the coast, killing much of the local wildlife and causing widespread property damage. Heavy rainfall also caused flooding, peaking at west of Basile, Louisiana. Rainfall was concentrated particularly in the Atchafalaya Basin. In Texas, effects of the storm were much less severe, but the storm still caused $8 million in damages, primarily as a result of strong winds. Further inland, the weakening hurricane spawned tornadoes and caused additional flooding in conjunction with a frontal boundary. The effects of Audrey were felt as far north as Canada, where 15 people died due to the strong winds and heavy rain. In total, the storm caused $152 million in damages and at least 416 deaths. =Tropical Storm Bertha= A weak extratropical low entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 6 and drifted slowly westward. The system slowly organized, developing into a tropical storm on August 8 about south of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving generally northward, Bertha quickly organized; the system attained its peak intensity with and an estimated minimum pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg) on August 9. That same day, Bertha came ashore near Cameron, Louisiana at the same intensity. After landfall, the storm moved northward due to a strong high- pressure system and weakened over land, before degenerating into a remnant low at 1800 UTC on August 11 over Oklahoma. The storm's remnants later moved across the U.S. Interior Highlands before dissipating. In the Gulf of Mexico, 1,350 workers on offshore oil drilling platforms were evacuated in preparation for the storm. The oil drilling tender Murmanill No. 1 sunk due to the strong waves, though the two people on board at the time were evacuated by helicopter. At the coast, the maximum storm surge height measured was at the Schooner Bayou Control Structure. Bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of The Ozarks. Rainfall peaked at near Damascus, Arkansas, which set a 24-hour rainfall record for the city and made August 1957 the wettest month on record. Across Arkansas, the heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage. The flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers. Though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain, four Arkansas counties reported combined losses of $925,000, and two deaths were reported. =Hurricane Carrie= Hurricane Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September 2. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 5\\\\. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northward and fluctuated in intensity before recurving to the west and restrengthening, attaining Category 4 intensity for a second time as it neared Bermuda on September 14\\\\. However, Carrie passed well north of the island and turned to the northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles. Due to its distance away from any major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September 16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft. As it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September 21, resulting in the deaths of 80 crew members on board. On September 23, Carrie completed its extratropical transition. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records. =Tropical Storm Debbie= On September 5, a weak easterly wave moved into the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea due to the influence of an upper-level trough. The wave organized and spawned a weak area of circulation which developed into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC on September 7. Moving steadily towards the northeast at roughly , Debbie only marginally strengthened due to the presence of cooler air entrainment. Early on September 8, Debbie made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida as a minimal tropical storm with winds of . A minimum barometric pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg) was recorded in Pensacola, Florida. The tropical storm weakened as it moved over land, degenerating to a tropical depression on September 9\\\\. The system became increasingly diffuse, and later merged with strong weather systems by 0600 UTC later that day. Offshore, the tropical storm generated high tides above average in Apalachee Bay, located about east of where Debbie made landfall. The strong surf caused some localized flooding. In St. Marks, Florida, a station recorded maximum sustained winds of , the highest measured in association with the storm. However, a station in Tampa, Florida recorded a peak wind gust of in a squall. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, though rainfall was mostly beneficial to crops. Rainfall peaked at in Wewahitchka, Florida, while precipitation was reported as far north as Pennsylvania. The tropical storm only caused minor damage, but was indirectly responsible for four deaths. =Tropical Storm Esther= On September 12, a mid-level circulation area formed over Nicaragua and slowly drifted northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. As it entered the Gulf, the system developed thunderstorm activity and an area of low pressure, and as a result the Weather Bureau began initiating advisories on a newly formed tropical depression by 1800 UTC on September 16. The depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm strength by the next day. At the time, Esther had a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg), as reported by a hurricane reconnaissance flight; this would be the lowest pressure measured associated with Esther. The large tropical storm intensified to peak winds of later that day, and held that intensity before making landfall in southeastern Louisiana on the morning on September 18\\\\. Esther weakened over land and later dissipated over the Mississippi Valley by 1200 UTC on September 19. Like Tropical Storm Debbie, which had made landfall just a week prior in the same area, Esther's wind impacts were minimal. The strongest gust measured associated with the storm was , as recorded at Pensacola International Airport. Other locations reported similar gusts and strong winds in squalls. Heavy rains persisted in the region well after Esther moved inland, resulting in high rainfall amounts. Rainfall peaked at in Quarantine, Louisiana, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The heavy rains breached several levees, resulting in severe flooding, particularly in Buras, Louisiana. Although rainfall was beneficial in many places due to an existing drought, cotton, pecan, and peanut crops were damaged by the floods. While crop damage amounted to $1 million, property damage amounted to $1.5 million. Esther also caused three indirect deaths, all of which were in Louisiana. =Hurricane Frieda= On September 20, a low pressure area developed within the same frontal boundary that had curved Hurricane Carrie towards the Azores. Rapidly developing, the system was classified as a tropical depression at 1200 UTC later that day, southwest of Bermuda. Initially, the depression was ill- defined and was slowly moving to the southwest. The following day, the attached cold front dissipated, allowing for the system to intensify. The system was subsequently upgraded a tropical storm by September 22, following a reconnaissance flight into the system which reported a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar (hPa; 29.56 inHg). At the time, however, Frieda was a small system with minimal shower activity. Gradually strengthening, Frieda reached an initial peak intensity with winds of later that day. Following the split of an upper-level ridge to the north, Frieda recurved towards the northeast the next day. As it sped to the northeast, a westerly shortwave progressed eastward, enhancing environmental conditions. As a result, the tropical storm began to quickly strengthen. By 1200 UTC on September 25, Frieda attained hurricane strength, and reached peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.30 inHg), as reported by the Canadian merchant ship Irvingbrook. However, a cold front associated with the shortwave encountered the hurricane, which caused it to transition into an extratropical cyclone on September 26\\\\. Frieda's extratropical remnants later passed over Newfoundland. Though Frieda remained far from any land masses, a peak rainfall amount of was measured in Bermuda. =Tropical Storm Eight= On October 22, an area of thunderstorm activity developed north of the Lesser Antilles, and barometric pressures fell throughout the region. The following day, a cut-off low developed and strengthened along the edge of a trough extending from Bermuda. This justified the classification of the system as a tropical depression on October 23, northeast of Puerto Rico. Moving towards the west, the depression attained tropical storm strength shortly after formation. A ship reported a minimum pressure of 999 mbar (hPa; 29.50 inHg) in the storm's vicinity. The large system gradually strengthened the following day, reaching its peak intensity by 1800 UTC on October 24\\\\. A ship reported a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (hPa; 29.33 inHg) early the next day, the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical storm. At the same time, the tropical storm also recurved towards the northeast. Heading towards more northerly latitudes, a gradual weakening trend began, due to the presence of an extratropical system. The tropical storm was itself absorbed by the same system on October 27\\\\. This storm may not have been named operationally due to a lack of discernible tropical characteristics. Storm names The following names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in the North Atlantic in 1957. However, two of such storms, the first and last, went unnamed. The name Audrey would later be retired, only the seventh name to do so. Storms were named Audrey, Bertha, Carrie, Debbie, Esther, and Frieda for the first (and only, in the case of Audrey) time in 1957. { width=80%  * Audrey * Bertha * Carrie * Debbie * Esther * Frieda       *    * } See also *1957 Pacific hurricane season *1957 Pacific typhoon season *List of Atlantic hurricanes *Atlantic hurricane season Notes References Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"1957 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"1136293","text":"Presidente Bernardes is a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil.

The title means saviour in Old Saxon (cf. German and Dutch Heiland meaning \\"saviour\\"), and the poem is a Biblical paraphrase that recounts the life of Jesus in the alliterative verse style of a Germanic epic. Heliand is the largest known work of written Old Saxon. The poem must have been relatively popular and widespread because it exists in two manuscript versions and four fragmentary versions. It takes up about 6,000 lines. A praefatio exists, which could have been commissioned by either Louis the Pious (king from 814‚Äì840) or Louis the German (806‚Äì876). This praefatio was first printed by Matthias Flacius in 1562, and while it has no authority in the manuscripts it is generally deemed to be authentic. The first mention of the poem itself in modern times occurred when Franciscus Junius (the younger) transcribed a fragment in 1587.Kees Dekker, 'Francis Junius (1591-1677): Copyist or Editor?', Anglo-Saxon England, 29 (2000), 279-96 (p. 289). It was not printed until 1705, by George Hickes. The first modern edition of the poem was published in 1830 by Johann Andreas Schmeller. Sample passages * Lines 4537-4549 from the Eucharist (√¢ √™ √Æ √¥ √ª are long vowels, ƒë is , ∆Ä is ): Manuscripts The 9th-century poem on the Gospel history, to which its first editor, J. A. Schmeller, gave the appropriate name of Heliand (the word used in the text for Savior, answering to the Old English h«£lend and the modern German and Dutch Heiland), is, with the fragments of a poem based on the Book of Genesis, all that remains of the poetical literature of the old Saxons, i.e. the Saxons who continued in their original home. It contained when entire about 6000 lines, and portions of it are preserved in two nearly complete manuscripts and four fragments. The Cotton MS. in the British Library, written probably in the second half of the 10th century, is one of the nearly complete manuscripts, ending in the middle of the story of the journey to Emmaus. It is believed to have an organization closer to the original version because it is divided into fitts, or songs. The Munich MS., formerly at Bamberg, begins at line 85, and has many lacunae, but continues the history down to the last verse of St. Luke's Gospel, ending, however, in the middle of a sentence with the last two fitts missing. This manuscript is now retained in Munich at the Bavarian State Library. Because it was produced on calf skin of high quality, it has been preserved in good condition. Neumes above the text in this version reveal that the Heliand may have been sung. A fragment discovered at Prague in 1881 contains lines 958‚Äì1006, and another, in the Vatican Library, discovered by K. Zangemeister in 1894, contains lines 1279‚Äì1358. Two additional fragments exist that were discovered most recently. The first was discovered in 1979 at a Jesuit High School in Straubing by B. Bischoff and is currently held in Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. It consists of nearly three leaves and contains 157 poetic lines. The final fragment was found in Leipzig in 2006 by T. Doring and H. U. Schmid. This fragment consists of only one leaf that contains 47 lines of poetry, and it is currently kept at Bibliotheca Albertina. Historical context As mentioned above, the Heliand was probably written at the request of emperor Louis the Pious around AD 830 to combat Saxon ambivalence toward Christianity. The Saxons were forced to convert to Christianity in the late 8th to early 9th century after 33 years of conflict between the Saxons under Widukind and the Franks under Charlemagne. Around the time that the Heliand was written, there was a revolt of the Saxon stelinga, or lower social castes. Murphy depicts the significant influence the Heliand had over the fate of European society; he writes that the author of the Heliand \\"created a unique cultural synthesis between Christianity and Germanic warrior society ‚Äì a synthesis that would plant the seed that would one day blossom in the full- blown culture of knighthood and become the foundation of medieval Europe.\\" Authorship and relation to Old Saxon Genesis The poem is based not directly on the New Testament, but on the pseudo-Tatian's Gospel harmony, and it demonstrates the author's acquaintance with the commentaries of Alcuin, Bede, and Rabanus Maurus. Early scholarship, notably that of Braune, hypothesized that the Heliand was authored by the same hand as the Old Saxon Genesis, but scholarly consensus has shifted away from this view; Sievers had already abandoned the hypothesis when Braune published his study . Large parts of that poem are extant only in an Old English translation, known as Genesis B. The portions that have been preserved in the original language are contained in the same Vatican MS. that includes the fragment of the Heliand referred to above. In the one language or the other, there are in existence the following three fragments: (I) The passage which appears as lines 235‚Äì851 of the Old English verse Genesis in the Caedmon Manuscript (MS Junius 11) (this fragment is known as Genesis B, distinguishing it from the rest of the poem, Genesis A), about the revolt of the angels and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve. Of this a short part corresponding to lines 790‚Äì820 exists also in the original Old Saxon. (2) The story of Cain and Abel, in 124 lines. (3) The account of the destruction of Sodom, in 187 lines. The main source of the Genesis is the Bible, but Sievers showed that considerable use was made of two Latin poems by Alcimus Avitus, De initio mundi and De peccato originali. The two poems give evidence of genius and trained skill, though the poet was no doubt hampered by the necessity of not deviating too widely from the sacred originals. Within the limits imposed by the nature of his task, his treatment of his sources is remarkably free, the details unsuited for poetic handling being passed over, or, in some instances, boldly altered. In many passages his work gives the impression of being not so much an imitation of the ancient Germanic epic, as a genuine example of it, though concerned with the deeds of other heroes than those of Germanic tradition. In the Heliand, the Saviour and His Apostles are presented as a king and his faithful warriors. While some argue that the use of the traditional epic phrases appears to be not, as with Cynewulf or the author of Andreas, a mere following of accepted models but rather the spontaneous mode of expression of one accustomed to sing of heroic themes, others argue that the Heliand was intentionally and methodically composed after careful study of the formula of other German poems. The Genesis fragments have less of the heroic tone, except in the splendid passage describing the rebellion of Satan and his host. It is noteworthy that the poet, like John Milton, sees in Satan no mere personification of evil, but the fallen archangel, whose awful guilt could not obliterate all traces of his native majesty. Somewhat curiously, but very naturally, Enoch the son of Cain is confused with the Enoch who was translated to heaven ‚Äì an error which the author of the Old English Genesis avoids, though (according to the existing text) he confounds the names of Enoch and Enos. Such external evidence as exists bearing on the origin of the Heliand and the companion poem is contained in a Latin document printed by Flacius Illyricus in 1562. This is in two parts; the one in prose, entitled (perhaps only by Flacius himself) Praefatio ad librum antiquum in lingua Saxonica conscriptum ; the other in verse, headed Versus de poeta et Interpreta hujus codicis. The Praefatio begins by stating that the emperor Ludwig the Pious, desirous that his subjects should possess the word of God in their own tongue, commanded a certain Saxon, who was esteemed among his countrymen as an eminent poet, to translate poetically into the German language the Old and New Testaments. The poet willingly obeyed, all the more because he had previously received a divine command to undertake the task. He rendered into verse all the most important parts of the Bible with admirable skill, dividing his work into vitteas, a term which, the writer says, may be rendered by lectiones or sententias. The Praefatio goes on to say that it was reported that the poet, till then knowing nothing of the art of poetry, had been admonished in a dream to turn into verse the precepts of the divine law, which he did with so much skill that his work surpasses in beauty all other German poetry (Ut cuncta Theudisca poemata suo vincat decore). The Versus practically reproduce in outline Bede's account of Caedmon's dream, without mentioning the dream, but describing the poet as a herdsman, and adding that his poems, beginning with the creation, relate the history of the five ages of the world down to the coming of Christ. Controversies =Authorship= The suspicion of some earlier scholars that the Praefatio and the Versus might be a modern forgery is refuted by the occurrence of the word vitteas, which is the Old Saxon fihtea, corresponding to the Old English fitt, which means a canto of a poem. It is impossible that a scholar of the 16th century could have been acquainted with this word, and internal evidence shows clearly that both the prose and the verse are of early origin. The Versus, considered in themselves, might very well be supposed to relate to Caedmon; but the mention of the five ages of the world in the concluding lines is obviously due to recollection of the opening of the Heliand (lines 46‚Äì47). It is therefore certain that the Versus, as well as the Praefatio, attribute to the author of the Heliand a poetic rendering of the Old Testament. Their testimony, if accepted, confirms the ascription to him of the Genesis fragments, which is further supported by the fact that they occur in the same MS. with a portion of the Heliand. As the Praefatio speaks of the emperor Ludwig in the present tense, the former part of it at least was probably written in his reign, i.e. not later than AD 840. The general opinion of scholars is that the latter part, which represents the poet as having received his vocation in a dream, is by a later hand, and that the sentences in the earlier part which refer to the dream are interpolations by this second author. The date of these additions, and of the Versus, is of no importance, as their statements are incredible. That the author of the Heliand was, so to speak, another Caedmon ‚Äì an unlearned man who turned into poetry what was read to him from the sacred writings ‚Äì is impossible according to some scholars, because in many passages the text of the sources is so closely followed that it is clear that the poet wrote with the Latin books before him. Other historians, however, argue that the possibility that the author may have been illiterate should not be dismissed because the translations seem free compared to line-by-line translations that were made from Tatian's Diatessaron in the second quarter of the 9th century into Old High German. Additionally, the poem also shares much of its structure with Old English, Old Norse, and Old High German alliterative poetry which all included forms of heroic poetry that were available only orally and passed from singer to singer. Repetitions of particular words and phrases as well as irregular beginnings of fits (sentences begin at the middle of a line rather than at the beginning of a line to help with alliteration) that occur in the Heliand seem awkward as written text but make sense when considering the Heliand formerly as a song for after-dinner singing in the mead hall or monastery. There is no reason for rejecting the almost contemporary testimony of the first part of the Free folio that the author of the Heliand had won renown as a poet before he undertook his great task at the emperor's command. It is certainly not impossible that a Christian Saxon, sufficiently educated to read Latin easily, may have chosen to follow the calling of a scop or minstrel instead of entering the priesthood or the cloister; and if such a person existed, it would be natural that he should be selected by the emperor to execute his design. As has been said above, the tone of many portions of the Heliand is that of a man who was no mere imitator of the ancient epic, but who had himself been accustomed to sing of heroic themes. =German Christianity= Scholars disagree over whether the overall tone of the Heliand lends to the text being an example of a Germanized Christianity or a Christianized Germany. Some historians believe that the German traditions of fighting and enmity are so well pronounced as well as an underlying message of how it is better to be meek than mighty that the text lends more to a Germanized Christianity. Other scholars argue that the message of meekness is so blatant that it renders the text as a stronger representation of a Christianized Germany. This discussion is important because it reveals what culture was more pervasive to the other. =Use by Luther= Many historians agree that Martin Luther possessed a copy of the Heliand. Luther referenced the Heliand as an example to encourage translation of Gospels into the vernacular. Additionally, Luther also favored wording presented in the Heliand to other versions of the Gospels. For example, many scholars believe that Luther favored the angel's greeting to Mary in the Heliand ‚Äì \\"you are dear to your Lord\\" ‚Äì because he disliked the notion of referring to a human as \\"full of grace.\\" =Extra-canonical origins= Contention exists over whether the Heliand is connected to the Gospel of Thomas. The Gospel of Thomas is a Judiac/Christian version of the Gospels found in 1956 that has been attributed the apostle Thomas. Quispel, a Dutch scholar, argues that the Heliand's author used a primitive Diatessaron, the Gospel harmony written in 160-175 by Tatian and thus has connections to the Gospel of Thomas by this association. Other scholars, such as Krogmann assert that the Heliand shares a poetic style of the Diatessaron but that the author may not actually have relied on this source and therefore the Heliand would have no association to the Gospel of Thomas. Editions and translations The first complete edition of the Heliand was published by J. A. Schmeller in 1830; the second volume, containing the glossary and grammar, appeared in 1840. The standard edition is that of Eduard Sievers (1877), in which the texts of the Cotton and Munich manuscripts are printed side by side. It is not provided with a glossary, but contains an elaborate and most valuable analysis of the diction, synonymy and syntactical features of the poem. Other useful editions are those of Moritz Heyne (3rd ed., 1903), Otto Behaghel (1882) and Paul Piper (1897, containing also the Genesis fragments). The fragments of the Heliand and the Genesis contained in the Vatican MS. were edited in 1894 by Karl Zangemeister and Wilhelm Braune under the title Bruchst√ºcke der alts√§chsischen Bibeldichtung. James E. Cathey wrote Heliand: Text and Commentary (2002) (Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, ), which includes an edited version of the text in the original language, commentaries in English and a very useful grammar of Old Saxon along with an appended glossary defining all of the vocabulary found in this version. Luther's Heliand: Resurrection of the Old Saxon Epic in Leipzig (2011) by Timothy Blaine Price is another book that has been written in English on the subject. This self-published book details the account and results of the author's personal research and travels. Perspectives on the Old Saxon Heliand (2010) edited by Valentine A. Pakis is probably the most recently published book on the subject. This contains critical essays and commentaries. Also by Professor Cathey is a grammar Old Saxon 2000. (Languages of the World/Materials 252, Munich: Lincom Europa, ) G. Ronald Murphy of Georgetown University wrote two books on the subject, The Saxon Saviour: The Germanic Transformation of the Gospel in the Ninth-Century Heliand (1989) (New York: Oxford University Press) and an English translation of the poem The Heliand: The Saxon Gospel (1992) (New York: Oxford University Press). In 2012, four translations of the Heliand were published (Uitgeverij TwentseWelle, now Uitgeverij Twentse Media) in four modern Saxon dialects: Tweants (tr. Anne van der Meiden and drs. Harry Morshuis), Achterhoeks (Henk Krosenbrink en Henk Lettink), Gronings (Sies Woltjer) and M√ºnsterlands (Hannes Demming), along with a critical edition of the Old Saxon text by Timothy Sodmann.

This can include rebab, gend√©r, gend√©r panerus, voice, slenthem, suling, siter, gong, kempul, kenong and kendhang. The instruments and their functions The rebab, a two-stringed fiddle, is the melodic leader of the ensemble. The rebab player signals changes between sections of a piece, and to a new piece. The gend√©r is a tube-resonated metallophone with fourteen keys suspended by string above metal tubes. The gend√©r plays improvisatory patterns called cengkok which link one seleh note to the next. Each pattern can be played in many ways and the musician chooses how to play each one at the time, according to the style of the piece, the pathet, the irama, and other musical considerations. The slenthem is a low-pitched tube-resonated metallophone played with a large padded mallet held in one hand, with the other hand is used for damping the ringing key as a new key is sounded. The melodic framework of a piece, sometimes called the balungan, is played on the slenthem. The kendhang, two-headed drums played with the hands, control the tempo of the music and signal changes in irama. Different drums are used according to the style of the music; some lively and others more restrained. The kendhang player usually begins and ends on the ketipung and kendhang ageng, switching to more elaborate patterns on the medium-sized ciblon drum. The gongs ‚Äî kempul (small hanging gongs) and kenong (large horizontal gongs) ‚Äî act as structural markers and punctuate the form, depending on the type of piece being played. The gong ageng (large gong) marks the end of each of the largest melodic phrases; these are called gongan, and a piece can have one or several of these. Several other instruments can also be included: the gambang (xylophone), suling (end-blown bamboo flute), and siter (plucked stringed instrument). Vocal parts called gerong (for male singers) or sindhen (for female singers) can be added in certain sections of pieces, as can alok, vocal cries that accent certain parts of the form or melody.

There were twelve tropical storms, a third of which became hurricanes. One of the hurricanes strengthened to the equivalent of a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy, which was also the most damaging storm of the season: it destroyed 15,000 houses and left $40 million in damage in Puerto Rico. Betsy was also the deadliest of the season, having killed 18 people in the French West Indies, two from a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea, and 16 in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27 people. The season officially started on June 15, although an unnamed storm developed about a week prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June 12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The lone hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles. It developed in the western Caribbean and moved across much of the southeastern United States, causing $24.8 million in damage and 15 deaths. There were also several tropical depressions, as well as one subtropical cyclone, in the season.

The agency had access to the Hurricane Hunters, a fleet of aircraft that obtain data by flying into storms. The Weather Bureau, in collaboration with other agencies, began a five‚Äìyear project in 1956 to obtain and analyze data on the structure of hurricanes. The season officially ended on November 15. There were a total of twelve tropical storms during the season, five of which were unnamed. Of all the storms, four were hurricanes. Compared to the average activity from the previous two decades, the season's activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves. Instead, the inactivity was the result of the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin. Such a pattern was different from the more active 1954 and 1955 seasons. Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper-level trough. The season's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 54, which is categorized as being \\"below normal\\". ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.  Systems  = Tropical Storm One = A dissipating cold front off the southeastern United States spawned a low pressure area on June 6\\\\. On the next day, the system organized into a tropical storm off the coast of North Carolina. The storm moved southward and reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), based on reports from ships. During its duration, the storm failed to develop an inner core, affected by cool, dry air to the northwest. The structure was likely akin to a subtropical storm, based on its formation beneath an upper-level trough. On June 8, the storm accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, weakening to a tropical depression the next day, and becoming an extratropical cyclone within the front on June 10\\\\. The system dissipated later that day as a larger storm developed within the front. = Tropical Storm Two = In early June, a trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean. On June 12, the interaction between the trough and a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression in the Bay of Campeche. The newly developed tropical cyclone tracked northward, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. It attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on June 13, although it never developed a well-defined circulation. In addition, it had characteristics of both a tropical and extratropical cyclone, with cooler air aloft. Late on June 13, the storm made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, and its lowest pressure of was measured over land, suggesting it did not weaken substantially after landfall. After moving inland, it dissipated on June 15 over Arkansas. As the storm moved ashore, it did not develop rainbands, unlike other tropical cyclones. The heaviest rainfall occurred in a region east of where it moved ashore. Precipitation fell across the entire United States gulf coast, and the highest rainfall total was in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. The rains were beneficial to farmers, due to drought conditions persisting in the region. The storm produced higher than normal tides, peaking at in Biloxi, Mississippi; this was the highest since the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane. The tides left damage to the Freeport Sulphur Company, as well as to boats, beaches, and piers. Three people died after their boat capsized, and there was another death after a driver skidded off the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. A barge in the lake became disabled due to the storm and caused light damage to the causeway. Sustained winds during the storm's passage peaked at near Grand Isle, Louisiana, and a boat reported a gust of near Pilottown, Louisiana. Damage was estimated at $50,000. = June tropical depression = Shortly after the previous storm dissipated, another tropical depression developed on June 17 from a trough, about east of the southern Florida coast. Although it briefly produced wind gusts of , it never intensified beyond tropical depression status, and it dissipated on June 18. = July tropical depression = A weak circulation developed late on July 4 beneath a cold mid-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico. It moved north- northwestward, and hit near Pensacola, Florida, on July 6\\\\. It dissipated on July 9\\\\. Although it never intensified beyond tropical depression status, the system produced wind gusts of in Panama City, Florida. As it moved ashore, the depression dropped heavy amounts of precipitation, with a total of reported in Whatley, Alabama. The rains washed away or eroded several highways and bridges, and also resulted in some agricultural damage. A train line from Mobile to Birmingham, Alabama, was washed out near Suggsville. Overall the damage was estimated at $503,000, and there were no associated deaths. = Hurricane Anna = A westward-moving tropical wave traversed the Lesser Antilles on July 20\\\\. It moved across the Caribbean, and its thunderstorms increased on July 23 while passing south of Cuba and beneath a high pressure area. There is evidence that it could have developed a circulation on July 24 before it struck the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is confirmed to have developed into a tropical depression on July 25 in the Bay of Campeche. As it continued west- northwestward, it rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm Anna, and before moving ashore in Mexico near Ozuluama, Veracruz, on July 26 it attained hurricane status. Peak winds reached 85 mph (140 km/h), although Anna rapidly dissipated on July 27 as it moved further inland. The high winds wrecked several homes in poor regions of Tampico, Tamaulipas, while rainfall of resulted in flooding. The high winds severed telegraph lines from Tampico to San Luis Potos√≠. The same area was affected by several hurricanes in the previous year. Damage totaled around $50,000, and there were no deaths. = Hurricane Betsy = A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 4. It developed into Tropical Storm Betsy developed on August 9 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It rapidly developed into a 105 mph (165 km/h) hurricane before striking Guadeloupe with a minimum central pressure of . There, Betsy heavily damaged 1,000 houses and left severe crop destruction, and led to 18 deaths. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two. On August 12, a slightly weakened Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico near Maunabo with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory's central portion. 15,023 houses were destroyed by Betsy, and multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy, which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy strengthened steadily as it headed generally northwestward, becoming a major hurricane on August 13 while centered north of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It attained peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) the next day to the east of the Bahamas. Betsy later turned northeastward, attaining its lowest central pressure of on August 17\\\\. It later became extratropical early on August 18\\\\. The remnants dissipated two days later to the north of the Azores. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island that was released on television. The hurricane left $40 million in damage and 16 deaths, which prompted the declaration of a federal disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane. = August tropical depression = A vigorous tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 28 near the Cape Verde islands. As it passed through the islands, the depression produced a minimum central pressure of on the island of Sal. Ships in the area reported winds as strong as . The depression maintained a general westward track, eventually dissipating on September 6 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. = Tropical Storm Carla = The origins of Tropical Storm Carla were from a tropical wave that spawned a depression near the Bahamas on September 7\\\\. It moved generally to the north, intensifying to a tropical storm the following day. An upper-level low located to the northeast of Carla produced hostile conditions that prevented significant strengthening, and Carla had a structure which resembled a subtropical storm. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the northeast, and despite the unfavorable atmosphere, Carla intensified, reaching peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) late on September 9\\\\. The interaction between the storm and a high pressure system over the Great Lakes yielded a strong pressure gradient that produced gale-force winds over New England. After Carla passed to the north of Bermuda, it became extratropical on September 10, according to HURDAT‚Äîthe official hurricane database‚Äîand the annual report in the Monthly Weather Review. As a post-tropical cyclone, ex- Carla strengthened to 70 mph (110 km/h) before weakening and dissipating by September 16\\\\. = Tropical Storm Dora = On September 10, a tropical depression developed over the Bay of Campeche. Later that day, Hurricane Hunters observed winds of tropical storm force, indicating that the depression had become Tropical Storm Dora, with winds of about 40 mph (65 km/h). Dora moved generally westward due to a ridge to its north. A reconnaissance flight on September 11 estimated hurricane-force winds, but reanalysis assessed these as being unrepresentative of Dora's true strength. Early on September 12, Dora peaked at 60 mph (95 km/h) shortly before striking land near Tuxpan with a minimum central pressure of . It quickly dissipated early the next day, although the storm produced heavy rains across the region. The deluge caused a landslide as well as flooding, including along a river near San Andr√©s Tuxtla. In Puebla, there were 13 deaths and 20 injuries after a bus crashed into a washed out portion of the highway from Tuxpan to Mexico City. Overall, Dora caused 27 deaths in the country, but minor damage. = Tropical Storm Ethel = On September 11, a tropical depression developed along the southern end of a quasi-stationary cold front over Grand Exuma Island in the Bahamas. It moved to the northeast and encountered cold air from the north. This resulted in significant instability that allowed in quick strengthening. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 12 reported winds of 76 mph (122 km/h) in the storm's northeast quadrant; as a result, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ethel. The flight observed a well-developed eye in diameter, although they only observed hurricane-force winds in one quadrant. Reassessment, however, discounted the observations of hurricane-force winds from the aircraft as being unrepresentative of Ethel's strength, and analyzed that Ethel peaked at 60 mph (95 km/h) late on September 12, with the lowest pressure reported being . Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Ethel began weakening and dissipated on September 14 to the southwest of Bermuda. = September tropical depression = A vigorous tropical depression moved through the Cape Verde islands on September 13, although the complete history of the cyclone is unknown. It dissipated before affecting the Lesser Antilles. = Hurricane Flossy = Hurricane Flossy originated from a tropical wave that moved through the Caribbean. A tropical depression formed on September 20 just east of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and headed northwest across the landmass. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico on September 22, it quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Flossy. Continuing to intensify, the storm turned to the north and attained hurricane status on September 23\\\\. Bearing winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), Flossy struck near Venice, Louisiana, on September 24 after turning to the northeast, crossing the Mississippi River Delta. The hurricane again moved into the Gulf of Mexico, continuing to the northeast and intensifying further until moving ashore near Miramar Beach, Florida, on September 25 as a strong Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Later that day, Flossy became extratropical over Georgia after weakening into a tropical storm. The extratropical remnants moved through the southeast United States and emerged from North Carolina into the western Atlantic on September 27\\\\. The storm was last observed on October 3, near southernmost Newfoundland. Flossy was the only hurricane of the season to strike the United States. Winds in Louisiana reached , although an oil rig offshore Grand Isle reported a gust of . The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. The rainfall and the hurricane's accompanying storm surge caused widespread flooding and beach erosion in southeast Louisiana. The flooding surmounted the eastern seawall in New Orleans, submerging an area of . Across the region, the resulting flooding drowned cattle and caused heavy crop damage. Hurricane Flossy left about $27.8 million in damage (1956 USD), mostly from crop damage, as well as 15 deaths. The rainfall extended through the Mid-Atlantic states, which alleviated drought conditions. = October Central Atlantic depression = On October 9, a tropical depression developed about east of Puerto Rico. Ships in the area reported winds as strong as , although the system dissipated within 24 hours. = Tropical Storm Nine = A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa in early October. By October 9, a tropical storm developed with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), based on ship reports. On October 10, the storm turned to the north and weakened to a tropical depression. It drifted northeast for two days, dissipating on October 12. = October Mid-Atlantic depression = On October 10, another tropical depression formed further to the north of the Central Atlantic depression. It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the aforementioned depression, although they were not the same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October 12. = Tropical Storm Ten = A low pressure area formed along a dissipating cold front to the north of Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October 13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October 15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The storm was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended far away from the center. The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65 mph (100 km/h) early on October 16\\\\. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October 17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm. The storm produced significant rainfall in a region of Florida. The highest total in the state was in Kissimmee. There, the rains caused flash flooding that entered over 200 houses. The flooding flooded three state highways, and also left portions of Okeechobee inaccessible after reporting the heaviest rainfall in eight years. Large tomato fields were inundated, resulting in some crop damage. In portions of the state, the rains were beneficial due to previously dry conditions. The storm spawned a tornado in North Miami that injured one person. Damage throughout Florida was estimated at $3 million, mostly in the Kissimmee area. In addition, two surfers drowned during the storm. Precipitation extended as far north as New Jersey, and coastal areas experienced high tides and gusty winds. = Hurricane Greta = The intertropical convergence zone spawned a tropical depression on October 31 a short distance to south of easternmost Cuba. The system tracked northward and crossed over eastern Cuba, and the system initially had characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. It eventually acquired tropical features and intensified into Tropical Storm Greta on November 1\\\\. A high pressure area east of the Mid-Atlantic states caused the depression to turn to the south on November 2 and loop to the southeast. Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the northeast of the Bahamas. It attained hurricane status on November 4 while maintaining a large size (in fact, becoming one of the largest tropical cyclones known in the Atlantic basin); such strengthening is unusual in storms moving in a southeast trajectory. Greta turned to the east and later northeast, reaching its peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) late on November 4 due to the energy transfer between levels of the atmosphere. Cooler waters caused subsequent weakening and gradual loss of tropical characteristics, and Greta transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 6, dissipating the next day. The extremely large size of Greta, in conjunction with the high pressure system to its north, produced strong winds and high waves across a large area of the western Atlantic. In Puerto Rico, waves of left heavy damage and killed one person who did not heed an evacuation order. Waves reached in the French West Indies, which destroyed 80% of the structures at the port in Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. Further west, high waves left heavy damage in and around the beaches of Jacksonville, Florida. Overall damage was estimated at about $3.58 million. = Tropical Storm Twelve = In the middle of November, a weakening cold front produced a low pressure area, which organized into a tropical depression early on November 19, though it is possible it formed a day earlier. The depression moved slowly west for the next 12 hours, becoming a tropical storm thereafter. Due to its slow movement, and based on ship reports, it is estimated that peak winds were 45 mph (75 km/h), with a minimum pressure recorded was 1002 mbar. The system continued to crawl westward, weakening to a depression on November 21 at 12:00 UTC and degenerating later in the day to a trough of low pressure.

Biography Sawyer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 10, 1887, to Caroline (n√©e Butler) and Edward Milton Sawyer. He served as a member of Cincinnati City Council from 1912 until 1916. Prior to his political career, he worked at the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore & Shohl.Disnmore & Shohl firm history Between World War I and World War II, he was a prominent Ohio Democratic politician. In the 1930s, a faction led by Sawyer vied with a faction led by Martin L. Davey for control of the state Democratic party. He was the 44th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio from 1933‚Äì1935. In 1938, Sawyer was an unsuccessful candidate for governor. Sawyer authored the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.Sawyer, Concerns of a Conservative Democrat, Southern Illinois University Press, pp. 48-51. He was also appointed as United States Ambassador to Belgium by Franklin D. Roosevelt and was Minister to Luxembourg during the difficult period from 1944 to 1946, at the beginning of the Belgian Royal Question concerning King Leopold III of Belgium. Sawyer (in the foreground) as Secretary of Commerce at a meeting of Truman's cabinet (February 1949) While Secretary of Commerce, Sawyer was ordered by Truman to seize and operate the steel mills in 1952. This seizure was executed to prevent a labor strike which Truman believed would hamper the ability of the United States to proceed in the war in Korea. When Sawyer returned to Cincinnati after serving President Truman, he joined the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, which had been founded by another prominent Cincinnati politician, Robert A. Taft, and became its managing partner. In 1968, he authored Concerns of a Conservative Democrat (Southern Illinois University Press). Charles Sawyer served on the following commissions, Hoover Commission on Overseas Task Force, the Commission on Money and Credit, and the World's Fair Site Committee. While Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Sawyer declared the first National Secretaries Week June 1-7, 1952. He designated Wednesday, June 4, as National Secretaries Day for this formerly male- dominated field of work turned female-dominated by sociocultural anamorphisms. He died in April 1979, at age 92, in Palm Beach, Florida. He was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery near his birthplace in Cincinnati, Ohio. Family Sawyer married his first wife, Margaret Sterrett Johnston, on July 15, 1918. He had five children (two daughters and three sons), Anne Johnston, Charles II, Jean Johnston, John William and Edward Milton Sawyer. Margaret S. Sawyer died in 1937. Sawyer married his second wife, the former Elizabeth De Weyrac on June 10, 1942; they had no children. Adm.

The population in 2011 was 4,391,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 60.66 km¬≤.Eurostat It includes four local parishes and one municipal government structure, which administers the entire island. History While the date of its first discovery is uncertain, it is known that its first settlers arrived from the island of Terceira around 1450. One of the first settlers was Vasco Gil Sodre. The early settlement was primarily agrarian, but by 1486 its population had grown sufficiently to warrant the founding of the vila (or town) of Santa Cruz in 1486, while Praia lost this role. Between the 16th-17th century, Graciosa was regularly attacked by pirates and privateers, which obliged the local government to construct fortifications along the island's coast for defense. Over the centuries Santa Cruz was visited by important travellers. The Jesuit Ant√≥nio Vieira, who stopped in the village after a shipwreck while returning to Lisbon from Brazil. Later the French writer Chateaubriand, in 1791, whilst fleeing the horrors of the French Revolution stopped in Graciosa en route to America. In 1814, a young Almeida Garret wrote some of his first verses, already a revelation of his budding talents. Finally, in 1879, Prince Albert of Monaco, notable for his oceanographic and maritime studies, stopped in Graciosa and visited Furna do Enxofre. He was one of the first to descend the volcanic chamber using a rope ladder. The construction of the port in Praia, and the northern aerodrome, were important in breaking the island's isolation and concentration on agriculture. Geography =Physical geography= =Human geography= Santa Cruz da Graciosa, is the largest urbanized settlement on the island of Graciosa, Azores A partial glimpse of the civil parish of Praia on the southern coast of Graciosa The territory of Graciosa Island consists of one municipality, Santa Cruz da Graciosa (4,780 inhabitants in 2001), which is divided into four civil parishes: * Santa Cruz - the seat of the municipality and principal urbanized population on the island, located on eastern coast; * S√£o Mateus da Praia - a historic village and once- municipal seat, until it was unincorporated in the 19th century; * Guadalupe - the principal rural population on the island; * Luz - civil parish better known locally as \\"Sul\\" (South), located along the southern coast of the island. The population centers on the island, apart from appearing dispersed, are concentrated along the road network. This is typical of many of other Azorean islands, usually colonized along important corridors corresponding to river-valleys or open terrains. Consequently, urban development has been conditioned by the islands geomorphology resulting in four principal axes of settlement supporting 80% of the islands population: * along the valley separating the Caldeira Massif from the rest of the island, between the village of Praia and Carapacho, Fonte do Mato, Pedras Brancas and Luz; * around Serra das Fontes, the axis between Santa Cruz and Santo Amaro, including Fontes and Guadelope, as well as two branches to Pontal by way of Pedras Brancas, and southeast to include Almas, Manuel Gaspar, Ribeirinha and Brasileira; * from Santa Cruz to Rebent√£o, around Pico da Hortel√£, and northeast to Vit√≥ria; * from Dores to Bom Jesus and along the coast to Vit√≥ria, this region is a vast landscape of many disperse settlements, different from the rest of the island.

Hoeffding's inequality was proven by Wassily Hoeffding in 1963. Hoeffding's inequality is a generalization of the Chernoff bound, which applies only to Bernoulli random variables; for a more intuitive proof, see this note, and a special case of the Azuma‚ÄìHoeffding inequality and the McDiarmid's inequality. It is similar to, but incomparable with, the Bernstein inequality, proved by Sergei Bernstein in 1923.  Special case of Bernoulli random variables  Hoeffding's inequality can be applied to the important special case of identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, and this is how the inequality is often used in combinatorics and computer science. We consider a coin that shows heads with probability and tails with probability . We toss the coin times. The expected number of times the coin comes up heads is . Furthermore, the probability that the coin comes up heads at most times can be exactly quantified by the following expression: :\\\\operatorname{P}( H(n) \\\\leq k)= \\\\sum_{i=0}^k \\\\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}, where is the number of heads in coin tosses. When for some , Hoeffding's inequality bounds this probability by a term that is exponentially small in : :\\\\operatorname{P}( H(n) \\\\leq (p-\\\\varepsilon) n)\\\\leq\\\\exp\\\\left(-2\\\\varepsilon^2 n\\\\right). Similarly, when for some , Hoeffding's inequality bounds the probability that we see at least more tosses that show heads than we would expect: :\\\\operatorname{P}(H(n) \\\\geq (p+\\\\varepsilon)n)\\\\leq\\\\exp\\\\left(-2\\\\varepsilon^2 n\\\\right). Hence Hoeffding's inequality implies that the number of heads that we see is concentrated around its mean, with exponentially small tail. :\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left((p-\\\\varepsilon)n \\\\leq H(n) \\\\leq (p+\\\\varepsilon)n\\\\right)\\\\geq 1-2\\\\exp\\\\left(-2\\\\varepsilon^2 n\\\\right). For example, taking \\\\varepsilon=\\\\sqrt{\\\\dfrac{\\\\ln{n}}{n}} gives: :\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(H(n)-pn \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n\\\\ln n}\\\\right) \\\\geq 1-2\\\\exp\\\\left(-2\\\\ln n\\\\right) = 1-2/n^2.  General case of bounded random variables  Let be independent random variables bounded by the interval : . We define the empirical mean of these variables by :\\\\overline X = \\\\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + \\\\cdots + X_n). One of the inequalities in Theorem 1 of states :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(\\\\overline X - \\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left[\\\\overline X\\\\right] \\\\geq t\\\\right) \\\\leq e^{-2nt^2} \\\\end{align} where t \\\\geq 0 . Theorem 2 of is a generalization of the above inequality when it is known that are strictly bounded by the intervals : :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{P} \\\\left(\\\\overline X - \\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [\\\\overline X \\\\right] \\\\geq t \\\\right) &\\\\leq \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2n^2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2} \\\\right)  \\\\operatorname{P} \\\\left(\\\\left \\\\overline X - \\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [\\\\overline X \\\\right] \\\\right  \\\\geq t \\\\right) &\\\\leq 2\\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2n^2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i - a_i)^2} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} which are valid for positive values of . Here is the expected value of . The inequalities can be also stated in terms of the sum :S_n = X_1 + \\\\cdots + X_n of the random variables: :\\\\operatorname{P}(S_n - \\\\mathrm{E}[S_n] \\\\geq t) \\\\leq \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2} \\\\right), :\\\\operatorname{P}(S_n - \\\\mathrm{E}[S_n] \\\\geq t) \\\\leq 2\\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)^2} \\\\right). Note that the inequalities also hold when the have been obtained using sampling without replacement; in this case the random variables are not independent anymore. A proof of this statement can be found in Hoeffding's paper. For slightly better bounds in the case of sampling without replacement, see for instance the paper by .  General case of sub-Gaussian random variables  A random variable is called sub-Gaussian, if :\\\\mathrm{P}(X\\\\geq t)\\\\leq 2e^{-ct^2}, for some c>0. For a random variable , the following norm is finite if and only if it is sub- Gaussian: :\\\\Vert X \\\\Vert_{\\\\psi_2} := \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{c\\\\geq 0: \\\\mathrm{E} \\\\left( e^{X^2/c^2} \\\\right) \\\\leq 2\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Then let be zero-mean independent sub- Gaussian random variables, the general version of the Hoeffding's inequality states that: : \\\\mathrm{P}\\\\left( \\\\left \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\\\right \\\\geq t \\\\right) \\\\leq 2\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{ct^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\Vert X_i \\\\Vert^2_{\\\\psi_2}} \\\\right), where c > 0 is an absolute constant. See Theorem 2.6.2 of for details.  Proof  In this section, we give a proof of Hoeffding's inequality.; for a more intuitive proof, see this note The proof uses Hoeffding's Lemma: ::Suppose is a real random variable such that \\\\textstyle\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(X\\\\in\\\\left[a,b\\\\right]\\\\right)=1. Then ::::\\\\mathrm{E} \\\\left [e^{s\\\\left (X-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [X \\\\right ]\\\\right )} \\\\right ]\\\\leq \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{8} s^2 (b-a)^2\\\\right). Using this lemma, we can prove Hoeffding's inequality. Suppose are independent random variables such that :\\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left (X_i\\\\in [a_i,b_i] \\\\right)=1, \\\\qquad 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n. Let :S_n = X_1 + \\\\cdots + X_n. Then for , Markov's inequality and the independence of implies: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{P}\\\\left(S_n-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [S_n \\\\right ]\\\\geq t \\\\right) &= \\\\operatorname{P} \\\\left (e^{s(S_n-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [S_n \\\\right ])} \\\\geq e^{st} \\\\right) &\\\\leq e^{-st} \\\\mathrm{E} \\\\left [e^{s(S_n-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [S_n \\\\right ])} \\\\right ] &= e^{-st} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\mathrm{E} \\\\left [e^{s(X_i-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [X_i\\\\right])} \\\\right ] &\\\\leq e^{-st} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n e^{\\\\frac{s^2 (b_i-a_i)^2}{8} }  &= \\\\exp\\\\left(-st+\\\\tfrac{1}{8} s^2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2\\\\right) \\\\end{align} To get the best possible upper bound, we find the minimum of the right hand side of the last inequality as a function of . Define :\\\\begin{cases} g\\\\colon \\\\mathbf{R_{+}} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}  g(s)=-st+\\\\frac{s^2}{8}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i-a_i)^2 \\\\end{cases} Note that is a quadratic function and achieves its minimum at :s=\\\\frac{4t}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(b_i- a_i)^2}. Thus we get :\\\\operatorname{P} \\\\left(S_n-\\\\mathrm{E}\\\\left [S_n \\\\right ]\\\\geq t \\\\right)\\\\leq \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i-a_i)^2}\\\\right). Usage =Confidence intervals= Hoeffding's inequality is useful to analyse the number of required samples needed to obtain a confidence interval by solving the inequality in Theorem 1: :\\\\operatorname{P}(\\\\overline X - \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X] \\\\geq t) \\\\leq e^{-2nt^2} The inequality states that the probability that the estimated and true values differ by more than is bounded by e‚àí2nt2. Symmetrically, the inequality is also valid for another side of the difference: :\\\\operatorname{P}(-\\\\overline X + \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X] \\\\geq t) \\\\leq e^{-2nt^2} By adding them both up, we can obtain two-sided variant of this inequality: :\\\\operatorname{P}(\\\\overline X - \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X] \\\\geq t) \\\\leq 2e^{-2nt^2} This probability can be interpreted as the level of significance \\\\alpha (probability of making an error) for a confidence interval around \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X] of size 2: :\\\\alpha=\\\\operatorname{P}(\\\\overline X otin [\\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X]-t, \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X]+t]) \\\\leq 2e^{-2nt^2} Solving the above for gives us the following: :n\\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\log(2/\\\\alpha)}{2t^2} Therefore, we require at least \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{\\\\log(2/\\\\alpha)}{2t^2} samples to acquire \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\alpha)-confidence interval \\\\textstyle \\\\mathrm{E}[\\\\overline X]\\\\pm t. Hence, the cost of acquiring the confidence interval is sublinear in terms of confidence level and quadratic in terms of precision. Note that this inequality is the most conservative of the three in Theorem 1, and there are more efficient methods of estimating a confidence interval.

Founded in 1908 in Los Angeles, the university has over 150 programs of study in nine schools.  History  a 1987 earthquake. Biola University was founded in 1908 as the Bible Institute of Los Angeles by Lyman Stewart, president of the Union Oil Company of California (subsequently known as Unocal and later purchased by the Chevron Corporation); Thomas C. Horton, a Presbyterian minister and Christian author; and Augustus B. Prichard, also a Presbyterian minister.William Jeynes and David W. Robinson (2012), International Handbook of Protestant Education, Springer, , p. 127.William Deverell and Greg Hise (2010), A Companion to Los Angeles, Wiley, , p. 196. In 1912, the school appointed R. A. Torrey as dean, and in 1913 began construction on a new building at the corner of Sixth and Hope St. (536 South Hope St.), in downtown Los Angeles, which included a 3,500-seat auditorium, two large neon signs (added later) on top of the building proclaiming \\"Jesus Saves\\", and a carillon of eleven bells on which hymns were played three times each day.Cory Stargel and Sarah Stargel, Early Downtown Los Angeles, Arcadia Publishing, 2009, , p. 36.Randall Herbert Balmer (2002), Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Westminster John Knox Press, , pp. 68-70.David Kipen (2011), Los Angeles in The 1930s: The WPA Guide to the City of Angels, University of California Press, , p. 159. These early leaders wanted the school to focus on the training of students in the Bible and missions, rather than the broad approach to Christian education typical of Christian liberal arts colleges. The Institute offered a diploma after completion of a two-year curriculum. This model was based largely on the Moody Bible Institute. Beginning in the 1920s, attempts were made to broaden the curriculum, but it was not until 1949 that the institution took the name \\"Biola College\\" and in 1981 was renamed \\"Biola University\\". Biola re-located to La Mirada, California in 1959.Hans Joachim Hillerbrand (2004) The Encyclopedia of Protestantism, Volume 1, Routledge, , p. 388. In 1915 Torrey announced plans to organize an independent church that would meet in Biola's auditorium called the Church of the Open Door. This decision proved controversial with local Presbyterian and Baptist clergy. In 1917, the Institute published a four-volume version of The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth (a series of essays affirming conservative Protestant beliefs, and source of the term fundamentalism), edited by Torrey and others, with funds donated by Lyman Stewart and his brother Milton.Mal Couch (2000), The Fundamentals for the Twenty-First Century: Examining the Crucial Issues of the Christian Faith, Kregel Academic, , p. 16.George M. Marsden (1982), Fundamentalism and American Culture: The Shaping of Twentieth Century Evangelicalism, 1870-1925, Oxford University Press, , pp. 118-123. Lyman Stewart died on September 28, 1923, and ten months later, Reuben Torrey resigned as dean. The school appointed Joseph Irvine as president, and on April 3, 1925, appointed John Murdoch MacInnis as the school's second dean. MacInnis was a Presbyterian minister who had been an instructor at the school for only about two years. MacInnis served as dean until his forced resignation on December 31, 1928. His administration had been turbulent and suffered from leadership conflicts and religious controversy. In 1927, Biola published a book by MacInnis entitled \\"Peter the Fisherman Philosopher\\". This book became the focus of an intense national controversy, in which MacInnis was accused by Fundamentalists of advocating liberal theological positions contrary to Biola's standards. Eventually MacInnis was forced to resign, and all remaining copies of the book along with the printing plates were destroyed. In 1929 Charles E. Fuller a businessman, evangelist and graduate of Biola, was drafted as vice president to find a new dean and a president. Elbert McCreery and William P. White, both associated with Moody Bible Institute, were chosen to fill these posts.Tom Sitton and William Francis Deverell (2001), Metropolis in the Making: Los Angeles in the 1920s, University of California Press, , pp. 238-243. During the Great Depression, the Institute suffered serious financial difficulties. In 1932, Louis T. Talbot, pastor of the Church of the Open Door, assumed the presidency and helped raise much-needed funds. During the next two decades, Talbot led a shift away from missions, instead concentrating on academic programs. Talbot Theological Seminary became Biola's first graduate school, and in 1977, Biola acquired the graduate programs of Rosemead Graduate School of Professional Psychology and relocated them to the La Mirada campus. Biola added a School of Intercultural Studies in 1983, a School of Business in 1993, and a School of Education in 2007.  Conferences  \\"The Word\\", mural by Kent Twitchell Biola holds two annual student conferences, the Missions Conference during the spring semester and the Torrey Memorial Bible Conference during the fall semester. The Missions Conference is the largest annual missions conference and the second largest missions conference in the world, second only to the tri-annual Urbana Missions Conference. It is a three-day student-run event that is intended to inspire students towards missionary activity and provide information about missionary work. Classes are canceled Wednesday through Friday in the middle of spring semester to accommodate this. The conference offers ethnic meals, cultural awareness field trips, on-campus cultural experiences, and interaction with missionaries. The Torrey Memorial Bible Conference is also a three-day conference dedicated to students' spiritual growth. Every year a specific topic is chosen that is geared towards the typical college student's spiritual needs. The annual one-day Biola Media Conference seeks to advance the integration of faith and the arts. It brings together Christian media leaders and other Christians for education, inspiration, and networking. On November 16, 1996, the university hosted the first national conference on intelligent design. Later, Intervarsity Press published Mere Creation (), a collection of the papers presented at the conference. Subsequent intelligent design conferences were held at the university in 2002 and 2004. Since 2015, Biola requires students to attend 5 conference sessions and 20 chapel services per semester, or face a financial penalty. Center for Messianic Jewish Studies On October 8, 2007, Biola opened the Charles L. Feinberg Center for Messianic Jewish Studies in Manhattan. The Center offers a Masters in Divinity in Messianic Jewish Studies. The program, which is in cooperation with Chosen People Ministries, focuses on the education and training of leaders in the Messianic Jewish community. The program is approved by the New York State Board of Regents and the Association of Theological Schools. Organization =Schools= Biola offers forty-seven undergraduate majors, eighty concentrations, and more than one hundred fifty professional fields of study. Degrees awarded include B.A., B.S., B.M., B.F.A., M.A., M.B.A., M.Div., Th.M., D.Min., D.Miss., Psy.D., Ed.D., and Ph.D. All are regionally and professionally accredited and integrated with evangelical Christian doctrine. Lecture hall at Biola University in La Mirada, California The schools are: * Crowell School of Business * Rosemead School of Psychology * School of Fine Arts and Communication * School of Humanities and Social Sciences * School of Education * Cook School of Intercultural Studies * Talbot School of Theology * School of Science, Technology and Health * School of Cinema and Media Arts Crowell School of Business is an undergraduate and graduate business school located in La Mirada, California, at Biola University. In 1993, the school was established as the fifth school of Biola University. In 2005, the school was renamed the Crowell School of Business after a generous donation from the Crowell family who has deep ties to the history of Biola University. The late Donald Warren Crowell was the great-nephew of Lula Crowell, wife of Biola co- founder Lyman Stewart. The new building opened in 2007 to host both graduate and undergraduate classes. Crowell offers a Master of Business Administration (MBA) and a Masters in Professional Accountancy (MPAcc), both of which can be obtained through a full-time or part-time schedule. Both programs are accredited through the Western Association of Schools and Colleges; the MBA program is also accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs. The undergraduate program at Crowell offers majors in accounting and in business administration with emphasis in international business, management, marketing, marketing management and business analytics. The school offers a minor in business administration available to all undergraduates at Biola University. The undergraduate program boasts approximately four hundred students, making it the largest undergraduate program at Biola. The School of Education was established in 2007, originally started as the Education Department in 1952. It offers biblically integrated courses and programs that exist to train those who desire to make an impact as educators and administrators in public, private, homeschool, charter and international schools. At the undergraduate level, the School of Education is home to the elementary education, multidisciplinary majors and liberal studies, which consistently rank among the most popular undergraduate majors at Biola. At the graduate level, the School of Education offers Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Arts in Education programs, which can be tailored to meet the individual interests of new and experienced teachers alike. The School of Education also offers a state-accredited teacher preparation program, which offers teaching credentials at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. All undergraduate students are required to take thirty units of Bible classes, regardless of their major, resulting in a minor in theological and biblical studies. The mission of Biola University is \\"biblically centered education, scholarship, and service‚Äîequipping men and women in mind and character to impact the world for the Lord Jesus Christ.\\" In its 2017 college rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Biola in its \\"Best National Universities\\" category, ranking Biola 159 out of 311 national universities. Biola was one of only two national universities in the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) to be included in the first tier. In 2013 Biola was listed as one of nineteen \\"up-and-coming\\" national universities by U.S. News. In 2017 Niche ranked Biola as #33 of 364 best Christian colleges in America and #11 of 90 safest college campuses in California. =Honors program= Torrey Honors College, formerly Torrey Honors Institute, is a classical literature great books program started by Dr. John Mark Reynolds in 1995 and named after Reuben Archer Torrey. Classes in the department are used to meet most of the general education requirements at Biola University in four years; the program does not offer a major or minor. The Torrey Honors College is patterned after the Oxford tutorial system, employing reading, discussion, writing, mentoring, and lectures among other opportunities. The goal of the department is to \\"equip men and women to pursue truth, goodness and beauty in intellectual and spiritual community, enabling them to be strong Christian leaders.\\"  Student organizations  Biola has over 65 student organizations and clubs. The most prominent are the Student Government Association and the Student Missionary Union. Biola's Student Government Association (SGA) equips student leaders to advocate for the student experience by funding student initiatives and representation for the undergraduate student body in order to foster Christ- centered community. SGA also sponsors student-initiated and student-run clubs on campus through which anyone can get involved, create community, and develop teamwork and leadership skills. There are more than 40 active clubs on campus. The Biola Student Missionary Union (SMU) is the largest student-led missions organization in the United States. The ministry focuses in three primary areas: Biola, our city, and the Nations. Students from every background and skill set can live out the Great Commission in their lives through the Missions Conference, Local Missions trips (Jerusalem and Judea project), Short-Term Missions trips and many other opportunities. SMU exists to mobilize students to align their lives towards the completion of the Great Commission. Their desire is to consistently raise up generations of student leaders who passionately and obediently serve Jesus throughout their lives. In May 2012, an underground LGBTQ community, calling themselves the Biola Queer Underground, launched a website in support of promoting dialogue and reconsideration of Biola's expulsion policy regarding homosexual behavior. The covert group requested to be accepted as a facet of diversity within the campus, declaring that, despite traditional church teaching on homosexuality, they held similar Christian beliefs and values to the university. The website was advertised on campus without authorization, and garnered national attention from the mainstream media. The Biola administration released a formal statement on their views on human sexuality shortly afterwards, and gave a chapel message reiterating their view that marriage is strictly between a man and woman. In the Spring of 2013, William Haggerty and Natasha Magness, both former students of the university, were interviewed by Biola's student newspaper, revealing that they were the co-founders of the organization. Since then, The Dwelling, a university-sanctioned LGBTQ organization, has been established. It seeks to support LGBT students without endorsing same-sex marriage and related policies.  Athletics  Biola University teams, nicknamed athletically as the Eagles, is currently transitioning into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Pacific West Conference (PacWest). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball.

The athletics department inducted Todd Worrell (baseball), Becky White (volleyball and women's basketball) and Wade Kirchmeyer (men's basketball). The school has since inducted 14 more alumni, including: Jim Blagg, Dr. Clyde Cook, Musa Dogonyaro, Ronn Johnson, Natasha Miller, Ben Orr, Jessica Pistole, Rianne Schorel and Tim Worrell. Biola University also has a club men's lacrosse team that competed in the Western Collegiate Lacrosse Conference, but since, they compete in a new conference, the Southwestern Lacrosse Conference (SLC). A club women's lacrosse team began competition in 2012 in the Western Women's Lacrosse League. Biola also has a club men's rugby team that began playing in the SCRFU in 2013. In 2005, the university's soccer pitch, Al Barbour Field, was completely rebuilt, incorporating a FieldTurf synthetic grass surface, new lighting, and a parking garage beneath the field. In 2013, Biola's softball field was newly renovated. The new \\"Freedom Field\\" contains an upgraded facility complete with new dugouts, bullpens, a team room and other major improvements. On July 20, 2016 Biola University's application for membership into the NCAA Division II had been approved for the three-year membership process. The Eagles continued as an active member of the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for the 2016‚Äì17 school year while completing Provisional Year One with the NCAA. In Provisional Year Two (2017‚Äì18), Biola joined the Pacific West (PacWest) Conference and competed primarily against NCAA opponents. With successful completion of Provisional Year Three (2018‚Äì19) of the membership process, the Eagles will gain full, active NCAA DII membership and become eligible to compete for NCAA Division II championships beginning as early as 2019‚Äì20.  Centers  Biola has four university centers, each with a unique mission and vision based upon the university's principles. The centers are: * Center for Christian Thought * Center for Christianity, Culture and the Arts * Center for Marriage and Relationships * Center for the Study of the Work and Ministry of the Holy Spirit Today In 2012, the Biola University Center for Christian Thought (CCT) was launched, funded by a $3.03 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation, the largest academic grant ever awarded to Biola University. The CCT (cct.biola.edu) is a forum where leading Christian thinkers from around the world gather to research and discuss issues of significance to the academy, the church, and the broader culture. In 2013, the Biola University Center for Christianity, Culture and the Arts (CCCA) was launched, funded with a grant from philanthropists Howard and Roberta Ahmanson's Fieldstead and Company. The CCCA (ccca.biola.edu) sponsors events and symposia, produces online resources and strives to facilitate thoughtful reflection on the interplay of Christian faith, the larger culture and the world of the arts. In October 2014, Biola launched the Center for Marriage and Relationships (CMR). The center exists to build and sustain healthy relationships and marriages in the church and broader culture. They strive to provide a safe place for individuals, couples and families to share their stories and be heard. CMR also desires to restore and inspire a vision of marriage that reflects the beautiful model of Christ's redeeming love for the church. In Fall of 2017, Biola launched the Center for the Study of the Work and Ministry of the Holy Spirit Today, funded by a $3 million donation. Located within Talbot School of Theology, the center is a 10-year initiative that provides resources for students and scholars who wish to gain a better understanding of the work of the Holy Spirit.  Publications  The university has been involved in the publication of the following magazines and academic journals: *The King's Business was a monthly publication of Biola from 1910 to 1970. In the first decades of its publication, it was the leading journal for conservative Christianity and the early fundamentalist movement. In fact, The Fundamentals and The King's Business shared the same chief editor (R. A. Torrey) and were supported by the same \\"concerned laymen\\" (Lyman and Milton Stewart). *Philosophia Christi is a peer-reviewed journal published twice a year by the Evangelical Philosophical Society with the support of Biola University as a vehicle for the scholarly discussion of philosophy and philosophical issues in the fields of ethics, theology, and religion. The journal is indexed by The Philosopher's Index and Religious & Theological Abstracts. *Journal of Psychology and Theology has as its purpose to communicate recent scholarly thinking on the interrelationships of psychological and theological concepts, and to consider the application of these concepts to a variety of professional settings. The major intent of the editor is to place before the evangelical community articles that have bearing on the nature of humankind from a Biblical perspective. *Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care has as its purpose advancing the discussion of the theory and practice of Christian formation and soul care for the sake of the educational ministries of the church, Christian education, and other para- church organizations through scholarly publications that are rooted in Biblical exegesis, systematic theology, the history of Christian spirituality, philosophical analysis, psychological theory/research, spiritual theology, and Christian experience. *Christian Education Journal has as its purpose to strengthen the conception and practice of Christian education in church and para-church settings. *Great Commission Research Journal is a peer-reviewed journal devoted to research and scholarly thinking on church growth. *Biola Magazine is the official magazine of Biola University. *Talbot Magazine is the official magazine of Talbot School of Theology. *The Chimes is Biola's student newspaper. *The Point is a magazine produced by Biola's journalism program that won the 2008 Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Award, the highest honor for a collegiate magazine. *The Inkslinger is a student creative arts journal. *The Bells is a humorous, fictitious news site created by and for Biola students.

One billion can also be written as b or bn. In scientific notation, it is written as 1 √ó 109. The metric prefix giga indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit. Its symbol is G. One billion years may be called an eon in astronomy or geology. Previously in British English (but not in American English), the word \\"billion\\" referred exclusively to a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). However, this is no longer common, and the word has been used to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000) for several decades. The term milliard can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; whereas \\"milliard\\" is rarely used in English, variations on this name often appear in other languages. In the South Asian numbering system, it is known as 100 crore or 1 arab. Visualization of powers of ten from one to 1 billion Sense of scale The facts below give a sense of how large 1,000,000,000 (109) is in the context of time according to current scientific evidence: =Time= * 109 seconds (1 gigasecond) equal 11,574 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes and 40 seconds (approximately 31.7 years, or 31 years, 8 months, 8 days). * About 109 minutes ago, the Roman Empire was flourishing and Christianity was emerging. (109 minutes is roughly 1,901 years.) * About 109 hours ago, modern human beings and their ancestors were living in the Stone Age (more precisely, the Middle Paleolithic). (109 hours is roughly 114,080 years.) * About 109 days ago, Australopithecus, an ape-like creature related to an ancestor of modern humans, roamed the African savannas. (109 days is roughly years.) * About 109 months ago, dinosaurs walked the Earth during the late Cretaceous. (109 months is roughly years.) * About 109 years--a gigaannus--ago, the first multicellular eukaryotes appeared on Earth. * About 109 decades ago, galaxies began to appear in the early Universe which was then 3.799 billion years old. (109 decades is exactly years.) * The universe is thought to be about 13.8 √ó 109 years old. =Distance= * 109 inches is , more than halfway around the world and thus sufficient to reach any point on the globe from any other point. * 109 metres (called a gigametre) is almost three times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. * 109 kilometres (called a terametre) is over six times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. =Area= * A billion square inches would be a square about one half mile on a side. * A bolt of finely woven 1000-TC bed sheet linen with a billion thread crossings would have an area of , comparable to the floor area of a motel unit. =Volume= * There are a billion cubic millimetres in a cubic metre, and a billion cubic metres in a cubic kilometre. * A billion grains of table salt or granulated sugar would occupy a volume of about . * A billion cubic inches would be a volume comparable to a large commercial building slightly larger than a typical supermarket. =Weight= * Any object that weighs would weigh about as much as 5,525 empty Boeing 747-400s. * A cube of iron that weighs would be on each side. =Products= * As of July 2016, Apple has sold one billion iPhones. This makes the iPhone one of the most successful product lines in history, surpassing the PlayStation and the Rubik's Cube. * As of July 2016, Facebook has 1.71 billion users. =Nature= * A small mountain, slightly larger than Stone Mountain in Georgia, United States, would weigh (have a mass of) a billion tons. * There are billions of worker ants in the largest ant colony in the world, which covers almost of the Mediterranean coast. * In 1804, the world population was one billion. =Count= A is a cube; B consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube A, C consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube B; and D consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube C.

It currently has over 700 member growers (in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, Florida, British Columbia and other parts of Canada, as well as Chile). The cooperative employs about 2,000 people, with sales of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2013 and account for 70% of North American cranberry production. Their products include cranberry sauce, fruit juices, fruit snacks, and dried cranberries. The cooperative has made a number of innovations, including the first juice blend, the first juice boxes, and sweetened dried cranberries (Craisins). Its cranberry juice won the ChefsBest Award for best taste. History Ocean Spray was formed in 1930, in Hanson, Massachusetts, by three cranberry growers who wanted to expand their market for cranberries. Led by growers Marcus L. Urann, Elizabeth F. Lee and John C. Makepeace, who had created a cranberry sauce, the cooperative developed more cranberry-based products. In the same year Ocean Spray became the first producer of cranberry juice drinks with the introduction of Cranberry Juice Cocktail. (A.D. Makepeace Company, one of the original founders of Ocean Spray, has been in continual operation since the late 19th century and is currently the world's largest grower of cranberries.) In 1963, executive Edward Gelsthorpe worked with Sylvia Schur to develop Cranapple juice, a product that brought the cranberry to greater popularity and increased usage to year-round, earning Gelsthorpe the nickname \\"Cranapple Ed\\".Grimes, William. \\"Edward Gelsthorpe, Master Marketer, Dies at 88\\" , The New York Times, September 27, 2009.

Processing plant near Babcock, Wisconsin In September 2004, Ocean Spray agreed to purchase the processing assets of Northland Cranberry. This acquisition included a juice production facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. In June 2004, Ocean Spray members voted down a joint venture of the cooperative's beverage business with PepsiCo. Pepsi had offered the co-op $100 million, an assumption of debt and fixed prices for cranberry harvests. In July 2006, the cooperative signed a 25-year single-serve (machine-dispensed) juice distribution deal with Pepsi. Ocean Spray completed expansion of the Wisconsin Rapids processing plant in September 2008. The addition doubles the facility size to ., making it the world's largest cranberry processing facility. The plant has numerous environmentally friendly features including a wastewater treatment facility, energy-efficient lighting, and the use of methane from the nearby Veolia Cranberry Creek Landfill for boiler fuel. With the addition, the plant will produce Craisins, in addition to currently produced juice concentrates. Ocean Spray product in Israel Throughout 2012, Ocean Spray contributed $387,100 to a $46 million political campaign known as \\"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers\\". This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. Ocean Spray has juice-filling facilities in Henderson, Nevada; Sulphur Springs, Texas; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Before serving as Secretary of Commerce, Peterson was chairman and CEO of Bell & Howell from 1963 to 1971. From 1973 to 1984 he was chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers. In 1985 he co-founded the private equity firm The Blackstone Group, and served as chairman. Peterson was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations until retiring in 2007, after being named chairman emeritus. In 2008, Peterson was ranked 149th on the \\"Forbes 400 Richest Americans\\" with a net worth of $2.8 billion. He was also known as founder and principal funder of The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting fiscal austerity. Early life Peterson was born in Kearney, Nebraska, as the eldest of three children to Venetia \\"Venet\\" Paul and George Peterson, both were immigrants from southern Greece. He had one younger sister, Elaine, who died of croup when she was one year old and a brother, John, who was the youngest. His father arrived in the United States at the age of 17 and worked as a dishwasher for Union Pacific Railroad and roomed on a caboose. In 1923, George opened and then ran a Greek diner named Central Caf√© in Kearney after changing his name from Georgios Petropoulos. Peter began working at the cash register at age 8. Transferring out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his freshman year, Peterson later received an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and The Kellogg School, graduating in 1947 with highest academic honors, summa cum laude. After college, Peterson was first married from 1948 to 1950 to Kris Krengel, a journalism student at Northwestern University. He joined Market Facts upon graduation, a Chicago-based market research firm, in 1948. In 1951, he received an M.B.A. degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, before returning to Market Facts as an executive vice president. Business career Peterson joined advertising agency McCann Erickson in 1953, again in Chicago, where he served as a director. He joined movie- equipment maker Bell and Howell Corporation in 1958 as Executive Vice President. He later succeeded Charles H. Percy as Chairman and CEO, positions he held from 1963 to 1971. In 1969, he was invited by philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III, CFR Chairman John J. McCloy, and former Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon to chair a Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy, which became known as the Peterson Commission. Among its recommendations adopted by the government were that foundations be required annually to disburse a minimum proportion of their funds. United States Secretary of Commerce (1972‚Äì73) In 1971, he was named Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs by U.S. President Richard Nixon. In April 1971, Peterson produced a secret report for Nixon on the volatile world economy and which argued the case that the United States was in economic decline under the existing world order of trade, which the U.S. had helped build immediately after World War II. To stem that decline, according to Peterson, the United States would have to challenge competing nations in the trading sphere by adopting industrial policy. The report impressed Nixon and the idea of American competitive decline soon became \\"an article of popular belief.\\" The report established some of the intellectual underpinnings of Nixon's stunning decision in August 1971 to upend the Bretton Woods agreement. Professional economists derided the thesis as a form of mercantilism that betrayed \\"economic illiteracy.\\" In 1972, he became the Secretary of Commerce, a position he held for one year. At that time he also assumed the Chairmanship of President Nixon's National Commission on Productivity and was appointed U.S. Chairman of the U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Commercial Commission. During his tenure, Peterson was a strong critic of the rising financial debt of the United States. Post-Washington career Peterson was Chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers (1973‚Äì1977) and Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. (1977‚Äì1984).Ken Auletta, Greed and Glory on Wall Street: The Fall of the House of Lehman, search pages, (Random House, December 12, 1985), In 1985, he co-founded with Stephen A. Schwarzman the prominent private equity and investment management firm, the Blackstone Group, and was for many years its chairman.David Carey & John E. Morris, King of Capital: The Remarkable Rise, Fall and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone, (Crown 2010), pp. 45‚Äì56 At Blackstone, he made a fortune including the $1.9 billion he received when it went public in 2007, that funded many of his charitable and political causes.Blackstone IPO ProspectusKing of Capital, p. 5 NOAA Corps (1972). Clinton presidency In 1992, he was one of the co-founders of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan citizens' group that advocates reduction of the federal budget deficit. Following record deficits under President George W. Bush, Peterson commented in 2004, \\"I remain a Republican, but the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence.\\" In February 1994, President Bill Clinton named Peterson as a member of the Bi-Partisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform co-chaired by Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth. He also served as Co-Chair of the Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprises (Co-Chaired by John Snow). Later career Peterson succeeded David Rockefeller as Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1985 and served until his retirement from that position in 2007. He served as Trustee of the Rockefeller family's Japan Society and of the Museum of Modern Art, and was previously on the board of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. He was the founding Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (formerly the \\"Institute for International Economics\\", renamed in his honor in 2006), and a Trustee of the Committee for Economic Development. He was also Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York between 2000 and 2004. In 2008, he founded the Peter G. Peterson Foundation (PGPF), an organization devoted to spreading public awareness on fiscal sustainability issues related to the national debt, federal deficits, Social Security policy, and tax policies. PGPF distributed the 2008 documentary film I.O.U.S.A., and did outreach to the 2008 presidential candidates.Bryan Bender, Movement warns of US bankruptcy, Seeks support for overhaul of federal budget, The Boston Globe, July 10, 2008. Peterson funded The Fiscal Times, a news website that reports on current economic issues, including the federal budget, the deficit, entitlements, health care, personal savings, taxation, and the global economy. Fiscal Times contributors and editors include several veteran economics reporters for The New York Times and The Washington Post. On August 4, 2010, it was announced that he had signed \\"The Giving Pledge.\\" He was one of 40 billionaires, led by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who agreed to give at least half their wealth to charity. Most of his giving was to his own foundation, The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which focuses on raising public awareness about long-term fiscal sustainability issues. Political activities From 2007 through 2011, Peterson was reported to have contributed $458 million to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, to promote the cause of fiscal responsibility. Personal life He was married three times and divorced twice. In 1953, he married former Brown University psychology professor Sally Hornbogen Peterson, a trustee of the Dalton School and a graduate of Northwestern University, with whom he had four sons: John Scott Peterson, James Jim Peterson, David Peterson and Michael Alexander Peterson; and one daughter, the writer Holly Peterson. They divorced in 1979. The following year, Peterson married Joan Ganz Cooney, the co-creator of the popular American educational children's television series Sesame Street. In his autobiography he recalled his business and private life in which he blamed himself for the failure of two of his three marriages but expressed pride for having grown close to his children. Peterson died on March 20, 2018, of natural causes at his Manhattan apartment home at the age of 91. He is survived by his children, his wife Joan, and nine grandchildren. Honors In 1962, Peterson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In recognition of his support, the influential Peterson Institute for International Economics was named in his honor in 2006. In 2006, Peterson was honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution. The same year he was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

John was originally archbishop of Salamis on Cyprus, and hence head of the autocephalous Church of Cyprus. In 688, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II and the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik concluded a treaty that made the island a neutral condominium, not occupied by either of the two, and with revenue shared between them. Sometime after that, but before 691, Emperor Justinian II decided to resettle the Cypriots in the Byzantine Empire: John with his flock were moved to Artake, near Cyzicus on the shores of the Sea of Marmara. The emperor's motive was probably to repopulate the area, which had suffered from the depredations of the Umayyads during the previous decade; Cyzicus had even been the base of the Umayyad fleet during the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 674‚Äì678. The De administrando imperio of the 10th-century Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, on the other hand, attributes this move to the initiative of John himself, whom he has travelling in person to Constantinople for this purpose in 691. According to the 39th canon of the Quinisext Council of 691/92, the town, and John's episcopal see, was renamed to Nea Ioustinianoupolis (, \\"New City of Justinian\\"), and John was allowed to retain the same privileges granted to the Church of Cyprus in the Council of Ephesus in 431, namely his archiepiscopal rank and autocephalous status. John thus became the metropolitan bishop of the ecclesiastical eparchy of Hellespontus, much to the displeasure of the previous incumbent, the metropolitan of Cyzicus, who was demoted to the rank of a simple bishop and subordinated to the see of Nea Ioustinianoupolis. John's prominence is underscored by the fact that he signed the canons of the Quinisext Council, which he attended, in seventh place among all prelates participating. The Cypriots' exile id not last long, only seven years according to Constantine VII. Most modern scholars have thus reconstructed that in 698/99, the Cypriots returned to their island after an agreement between Abd al-Malik and the Emperor Tiberios III. This marked also the end of the see of Nea Ioustinianoupolis, which disappears from the record, while Cyzicus received its previous rights as metropolitan see back. John was possibly succeeded as Archbishop of Cyprus by Anthimos, who probably held office .

Such a delay may be to prevent mistakes or unacceptable content from being broadcast. Longer delays lasting several hours can also be introduced so that the material is aired at a later scheduled time (such as the prime time hours) to maximize viewership. Tape delays lasting several hours can also be edited down to remove filler material or to trim a broadcast to the network's desired run time for a broadcast slot, but this isn't always the case. Usage A short delay is often used to prevent profanity, bloopers, nudity, or other undesirable material from making it to air, including more mundane problems, such as technical malfunctions (an anchor's lapel microphone goes dead). In that instance, it is often referred to as a \\"seven-second delay\\" or \\"profanity delay\\". Longer delays, however, may also be introduced, often to allow a show to air at the same time for the local market as is sometimes done with nationally broadcast programs in countries with multiple time zones. Considered as time shifting, that is often achieved by a \\"tape delay\\", using a video tape recorder, modern digital video recorders, or other similar technology. Tape delay may also refer to the process of broadcasting an event at a later scheduled time because a scheduling conflict prevents a live telecast, or a broadcaster seeks to maximize ratings by airing an event in a certain timeslot. That can also be done because of time constraints of certain portions, usually those that do not affect the outcome of the show, are edited out, or the availability of hosts or other key production staff only at certain times of the day, and it is generally applicable for cable television programs. In countries that span multiple time zones and have influential domestic eastern regions, such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States, television networks usually delay the entirety of their schedule for stations in the west, so prime time programming can be time shifted to air in local primetime hours to improve accessibility and viewership. Although Mexico and Canada have now regularly televised their live programs in real time simultaneously across all of their territories, in the U.S., \\"east\\" feeds usually target the Eastern and Central time zones, while \\"west\\" feeds are usually oriented towards the Pacific time zone. As a result, until today, many live programs, such as music and talent competition shows, are usually tape delayed for the western half of the country and aired as-live (although they may include edits to streamline the broadcast or resolve technical faults). Australian network television schedule is largely patterned from the U.S. format. In countries that span multiple time zones and are the most populous in their western or central regions, like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, all television schedules nationwide are simultaneous with their broadcast sources, enabling full nationwide live telecasts regardless of time zones (although Russia conducts separate live primetime newscast versions for each range of time zones in that country). The continents of Europe and Africa, which both fall in the same range of time zones, are receptive to each other's live telecasts, while most of Asia from India eastwards, which includes China alongside the most populous time zone in the world, also receive simultaneous live telecasts within those cluster of regions. International tape delays of live global events, intended by major television networks, dominated world television until the early 2010s. For example, during the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and the Beijing Olympics in 2008, daytime events were occurring at early morning hours in the Americas, Africa, and Europe but were aired in the afternoon and evening hours live entirely in Asia, Australia, and Oceania. That made some broadcasters show high-profile events twice (live and then rebroadcast during prime time), but others withheld the same event to be broadcast solely during prime time. Often, tape-delaying of those events would mean editing them down for time considerations, highlighting what the broadcaster feels are the most interesting portions of the event, or advertising, resulting to reduced desired TV coverage for the given multiple sporting events. However, since many live events became available via social media in the late 2000s, tape delays have become increasingly irrelevant because of live television's resurgence as a broadcast format. Since the mid-2010s, several high-profile entertainment programs with huge live global audiences like the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards and Grammy Awards, yearly specials like the Miss Universe and Miss World pageants, and major sporting events like the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and the National Football League's Super Bowl, air to totality live on both television and the internet virtually all across the world's time zones in and out of their countries of origin, with mandated prime time rebroadcasts (featuring edits as desired by broadcasters) for regions that previously and solely relied on delayed telecasts on prime time among these otherwise live events. History The radio station WKAP in Allentown, Pennsylvania, introduced a tape delay system consisting of an external playback head, which was spaced far enough away from the record head to produce a six-second delay. A system of rollers guided the tape over the playback head before it wound up on the take up reel. This system was introduced in 1952, when WKAP started a talk show called Open Mic. It is believed that this was the first time a telephone call-in show was broadcast with the telephone conversation \\"live\\" on the air. The FCC rules at the time prohibited the broadcasting of a live telephone conversation. However, there was no rule prohibiting a taped playback of a telephone call, provided that a \\"beep\\" tone was heard by the caller every 15 seconds so that the caller knew he was being recorded. The six-second delay constituted a \\"taped\\" telephone conversation, thus complying with FCC regulations, that being a legal fiction. The broadcast profanity delay was invented by C. Frank Cordaro (July 13, 1919 ‚Äì February 20, 1997), who was Chief Engineer of WKAP during the 1950s and early 1960s. Ogden Davies, then-General Manager of WKAP, assigned Cordaro the task of developing a device whereby profanity during a \\"live\\" conversation could be deleted by the radio talk show host before it was broadcast. This new device was to be used on the Open Mic radio talk show. The device Cordaro developed was the first tape delay system. WKAP was one of several stations owned by the Rahal brothers of West Virginia (later Rahal Communications). First tested and used at WKAP, this tape system for broadcast profanity delay was then installed at the other Rahal-owned radio stations. From the Rahal brothers' stations, the broadcast profanity delay went into common usage throughout the US. John Nebel, who began a pioneering radio talk show in New York City in 1954, was one of the early users of a tape delay system that was invented by his engineer, Russell Tinklepaugh.Tom Tiede. \\"Talk-Jockey Jimmy Hits the Air\\". Portsmouth (NH) Times, March 4, 1977, p. 4. Another announcer who was said to use a tape-delay was talk show pioneer Jerry Williams at WMEX in Boston in the late 1950s. Computerized delay Eventide BD600 Broadcast Delay In 1977, the capacity of RAM (random-access memory) had reached 16 kilobits per chip, enough to think about using computerized digital audio means to create a sufficient delay for content deletion. By storing audio digitally, it was possible to move a \\"virtual tape head\\" along recorded audio. Eventide, Inc. created the first digital broadcast delay for this purpose. The device (known colloquially as a \\"dump box\\") had a large \\"DUMP\\"/\\"DELAY DUMP\\" button that would bring the delay to zero, thus removing unwanted segments. In addition to this convenience, it would also \\"rebuild\\" the delay time by unnoticeably lengthening the normal pauses in spoken material. Thus, a minute or so later, the broadcaster would again have full delay, often leaving the listener unaware that material had been deleted. In modern systems, a profanity delay can be a software module manually operated by a broadcast technician that puts a short delay (usually, 30 seconds) into the broadcast of live content. This gives the broadcaster time to censor the audio (and video) feed. This can be accomplished by cutting directly to a non- delayed feed, essentially jumping past the undesired moment (something that can be quite jarring to a viewer or listener). In other cases, dedicated hardware units similar to the original digital unit but with improved quality and editing capability can be used. These products can even \\"build up\\" delay with difficult program material such as music. Alternatively, a bleep noise or other substitute sound can be inserted. This is more difficult to do with live content, however, and more often appears on recorded material.

The motherboard (MicroATX) is in a horizontal position at the top, and the peripheral connectors go at the panel located at the rear of the case and usb ports at the top. The fans are also at the rear and front. The power supply is on the bottom rear. A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, or cabinet, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse). Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC‚Äîsteel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic. Other materials such as glass, wood, acrylic and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases. Sizes and terminology Full tower cases. Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors). The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard, since it is the largest component of most computers. Cases are also referred to by their size (such as ATX case, Mini ITX case, etc.) Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case. Form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well, since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures. For example, a case designed for an ATX motherboard and power supply may take on several external forms such as a vertical tower (designed to sit on the floor, height > width), a flat desktop (height < width) or pizza box (height ‚â§ designed to sit on the desk under the computer's monitor). Full-size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room for drive bays, expansion slots, and custom or all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. Desktop cases‚Äîand mini-tower cases under about high‚Äîare popular in business environments where space is at a premium. Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX, although microATX and small form factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses. In the high-end segment the unofficial and loosely defined XL-ATX specification appeared around 2009. It extends the length of the mainboard to accommodate four graphics cards with dual-slot coolers. Some XL-ATX mainboards increase the mainboard's width as well, to allow more space for the CPU, Memory PWM, and in some cases, a second CPU socket. While the market share of these exotic high-end mainboards is very low, almost all high-end cases and many mainstream cases support XL-ATX (10 expansion slots). As of 2018, no major motherboard manufacturer has made an XL-ATX board for several years. E-ATX is similar to XL-ATX in that it is larger than ATX and is also loosely defined. Unlike XL-ATX, E-ATX motherboards and cases are still in production (as of 2020), and support quad channel memory across 8 slots of ram, up to 4 PCI-e expansion slots for up to 4 double slot graphics cards and a single CPU such as the AMD 3990X.https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3566-e-atx-is-a-lie-vs-xl-atx-eeb- cebhttps://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/heres-what-you-need-to-run-amds- new-64-core128-thread-ryzen- threadripper-3990x/https://www.anandtech.com/show/15483/amd- threadripper-3990x-reviewhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/15121/the-amd- trx40-motherboard-overview-https://www.anandtech.com/show/15121/the-amd- trx40-motherboard-overview-/14 Companies like In Win Development, Shuttle Inc. and AOpen originally popularized small cases, for which FlexATX was the most common motherboard size. As of 2010 Mini ITX has widely replaced FlexATX as the most common small form factor mainboard standard. The latest mini ITX mainboards from Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock, Zotac and Foxconn offer the same feature set as full size mainboards. High-end mini ITX mainboards support standard desktop CPUs, use standard memory DIMM sockets, and mostly feature a full size PCI-E 16√ó slot with support for the fastest graphics cards, although some instead use a PCI, or PCIe slot of less than 16 lanes. This allows customers to build a fully fledged high-end computer in a significantly smaller case. Apple Inc. has also produced the Mac Mini computer, which is similar in size to a standard CD-ROM drive, and many manufacturers offer mini- ITX cases of similar size for low-wattage CPUs with integrated graphics. Tower cases are often categorized as mini-tower, midi-tower, mid-tower or full- tower. The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers. Full tower cases are typically or more in height and intended to stand on the floor. They can have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays. However as computing technology moves from floppy disks and CD-ROMs to large capacity hard drives, USB flash drives, and network-based solutions, today's full tower cases typically have only no, one, or two external bays for CD drives, with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to improve airflow. The full tower case was developed to house file servers which would typically be tasked with serving data from expensive CD- ROM databases which held more data than the hard drives commonly available. Hence many full tower cases include locking doors and other physical security features to prevent theft of the discs. Today, full tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece display cases with custom water cooling, lighting, and tempered glass (replacing acrylic).https://www.kitguru.net/components/leo-waldock/corsair- obsidian-1000d-watercooled-dual-system- part-2/https://www.anandtech.com/show/12762/corsair-launches- obsidian-1000d-supertower-casehttps://www.guru3d.com/news-story/size-does- matter-meet-the-corsair-obsidian-1000d-super-tower-pc-case.html They may also hold two computers (as is the case with the Corsair 1000D) and dual power supplies (Corsair 900D)https://www.storagereview.com/review/corsair-obsidian- series-900d-case- reviewhttps://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/obsidian-900d-case- review,3482-7.html Mid-tower cases are smaller, about high with two to four external bays. They may also hold two computers.https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3379-phanteks-evolv-x-case- review-dual-system-thermalshttps://www.techpowerup.com/269510/phanteks- launches-eclipse-p500a-with-1mm-mesh-and-sk-pwm-fans?amp A mini-tower case will typically have only one or two external bays. Recently the marketing term midi-tower has come into use, seemingly referring to (based on anecdotal evidence) cases smaller than mid-tower but larger than mini-tower, typically with two to three external bays. Outside of the United States the term is often used interchangeably with mid-tower Layout Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays, as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots. Most cases also have a power button or switch, a reset button, and LEDs to indicate power, hard drive activity, and network activity in some models. Some cases include built-in I/O ports (such as USB and headphone ports) on the front of the case. Such a case will also (normally) include the wires needed to connect these ports, switches and indicators to the motherboard. =Major component locations= * The motherboard is usually screwed to the case along its largest face, which could be the bottom or the side of the case depending on the form factor and orientation. * Form factors such as ATX provide a back panel with cut-out holes to expose I/O ports provided by integrated peripherals, as well as expansion slots which may optionally expose additional ports provided by expansion cards. Many larger ATX cases can also be used with motherboards of other form factors. * The power supply unit mounting point differs from case to case, but the most commonly used locations (both at the rear of the case) and their benefits/disadvantages are: **The top of the case, usually allowing the PSU's built-in fan to act as an auxiliary exhaust fan, but causes the PSU to be fed air heated by the internal components of the case, thus causing PSU efficiency and lifespan degradation. **The bottom of the case, with a (often filtered) vent in the bottom of the case allowing the PSU to draw cool air from the outside. *Regardless of the mounting position, the PSU will usually be attached to the case with four screws to support its weight. * Most cases include drive bays on the front of the case; a typical ATX case includes 5.25\\", 3.5\\" and 2.5\\" bays. In modern computers, the 5.25\\" bays are used for optical drives, the 3.5\\" bays are used for hard drives and card readers, and the 2.5\\" bays are used for solid-state drives. * Buttons and LEDs are typically located on the front of the case; some cases include additional I/O ports, temperature and processor speed monitors in the same area. * Vents are often found on the front, back, top, left side panel, and sometimes on the right side panel of the case. Regardless of their placement, their purpose is either to let cool air into the case, or to let hot air out. Larger vents usually allow cooling fans to be mounted via surrounding threaded screw holes. Newer cases include mountings for larger 120mm or 140mm cooling fans for quieter operation than the 80mm fans formerly common. * An IO template, or IO plate, fits around the motherboard's back panel of external ports. Sometimes provided by the case manufacturer, it is often replaced by the one that comes with the motherboard. =Internal access= Accessing the interior components of a modern ATX tower case is done by removing the side panels. Looking front- to-back, accessing the motherboard, PSU, drive bays and most case fan installation points is done by removing the left side panel. Removing the right side panel is done less often to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate. This space is devoted to cable management, as cables routed in front of the motherboard may disrupt the flow of air within the case causing increased temperatures. BTX, an uncontemporary standard, has the main side panel on the right side as opposed to the left. Some upside-down designed ATX cases are also accessed by removing the right side panel door. Alternatively, the case may have a single large U-shaped cover that saddles the chassis. This was ubiquitous in AT tower cases. To prevent the buildup of performance- degrading dust within the case, many models feature dust filters in front of the air intake fans. While the exact method of accessing the front filters depends on the case model, it usually requires the removal of the entire front panel. Removal of the front panel itself may or may not require the removal of one or both of the side panel. If there is any doubt, consult the user's manual if possible. Traditionally, most computer cases required computer case screws to hold components and panels in place (i.e. motherboard, PSU, drives, and expansion cards). From the 2000s there is a trend towards tool-less cases, in which components are held together with snap-in plastic rails, thumbscrews, and other methods that do not require tools; this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware, and is also cheaper to manufacture. Appearance Through the 1990s, most computer cases had simple rectangular shapes, and were often painted beige or white with little attention given to visual design. Beige box designs are still found on a large number of budget computers assembled from generic components. This class of machines is still known as white box computers. More modern computer cases include a much wider range of variation in shape, form factor and materials, such as brushed aluminium and/or tempered glass which are offered with more expensive cases. Case modding is the artistic styling of computer cases, often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components. Since the early 2000s, some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating. Modded cases may also include colored internal lighting, custom paint, or liquid cooling systems. Some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum, steel, styrofoam, acrylic, or wood. Historically, cases used CCFL lightinghttps://books.google.com.pa/books?id=xwIAAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PT23&lpg;=PT23&dq;=computer+case+ccfl&source;=bl&ots;=_vX03YqPee&sig;=ACfU3U3_tCol- QhJn16S_xHVyBX98qC1dQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiq- IO_m7_qAhUhWN8KHUhlBBs4ChDoATAGegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q;=computer%20case%20ccfl&f;=false and eventually single color LEDs as strips or in fans to illuminate their interior; modern cases use RGB LED lighting instead, often incorporated into case fans. To improve airflow while allowing RGB fans to be visible, many cases as of 2020 use metal meshes, without any external bays.https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3534-gn-awards-show Many include a PSU shroud and vertical gpu mounts. Some used to include holes to support external water cooling radiators.https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3579-phanteks-p300a-case- review-benchmark- vs-p400a#!/ccommenthttps://www.gamersnexus.net/news/1282-nzxt-h440-case-specs- psu-shroudhttps://custompc.raspberrypi.org/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of- vertical-graphics-card-mountshttps://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3324-fact- check-cablemod-vertical-gpu-thermals-vs- stock-h500mhttps://books.google.com.pa/books?id=cgIAAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA38&lpg;=PA38&dq;=pc+case+external+radiator&source;=bl&ots;=RZbR_YvkdJ&sig;=ACfU3U1Kltzv4qoNMCW9F4KVCskDIAXhJA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj6ytLEoL_qAhUJhOAKHXT6Co84HhDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q;=pc%20case%20external%20radiator&f;=falsehttps://books.google.com.pa/books?id=RQIAAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA52&lpg;=PA52&dq;=pc+case+external+radiator&source;=bl&ots;=UsKMXT2wJ9&sig;=ACfU3U0Jfjw6DEqo0w0jlUkIrFst6SD4aw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj6ytLEoL_qAhUJhOAKHXT6Co84HhDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=pc%20case%20external%20radiator&f;=false Cases with side windows may have side fans (on the window) as well, although it is uncommon for cases with glass windows to have side fans.https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/692-how-many-case-fans-should-you-have =Case manufacturers= Prominent after-market case manufacturers include Antec, BitFenix, Cooler Master, Corsair, Fractal Design, In Win Development, Lian Li, NZXT Corp., Phanteks, Rosewill, and Thermaltake, (DIY PC) Intrusion detection Some computer cases include a biased switch (push-button) which connects to the motherboard. When the case is opened, the switch position changes and the system records this change. The system's firmware or BIOS may be configured to report this event the next time it is powered on. This physical intrusion detection system may help computer owners detect tampering with their computer. However, most such systems are quite simple in construction; a knowledgeable intruder can open the case or modify its contents without triggering the switch. In the past, many tower cases intended to house file servers featured a locking door covering the external drive bays. This was a security feature intended to prevent the theft of the CD-ROM discs the drives would be holding. At the time, CD-ROM capacity was larger than the hard disks available, and many business-critical databases were distributed on this media. These databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data, and hence would be likely targets for casual theft.

Not published until 1992, the stories that make up this collection were originally written during the seventies and eighties. Each of the stories touches on the theme of dislocation and the strangeness of life in a foreign land, although quite what \\"foreign\\" means is one of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's central questions. Garc√≠a M√°rquez himself spent some years as a virtual exile from his native Colombia. The 12 Stories The twelve stories are: # Bon Voyage, Mr President (Buen Viaje, Se√±or Presidente) # The Saint (La Santa) # Sleeping Beauty and the Airplane (El Avi√≥n de la Bella Durmiente) # I Sell My Dreams (Me Alquilo para So√±ar) # \\"I Only Came to Use the Phone\\" (Solo Vine a Hablar por Tel√©fono) # The Ghosts of August (Espantos de Agosto) # Mar√≠a dos Prazeres # Seventeen Poisoned Englishmen (Diecisiete Ingleses Envenenados) # Tramontana # Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness (El Verano Feliz de la Se√±ora Forbes) # Light is Like Water (La Luz es como el Agua) # The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow (El Rastro de tu Sangre en la Nieve) Story summaries =Bon Voyage, Mr. President= An overthrown Latin American president, Mr. President, is exiled to Martinique. The 73-year-old man develops a peculiar pain in his ribs, lower abdomen, and groin. He travels to Geneva, Switzerland in search of a diagnosis. After extensive medical testing, he is informed that the problem resides in his spine. A risky operation is recommended to relieve the pain. The President meets a fellow countryman, Homero Rey, who works as an ambulance driver at the hospital. Homero schemes to sell an insurance plan and funeral package to the sick man, but the President is no longer wealthy and lives frugally. He is reduced to selling his dead wife's jewelry and other trinkets to pay the cost of his medical expenses and operation. Homero and his wife, L√°zara, grow fond of Mr. President. They provide financial assistance and care for him after he is discharged from the hospital. The President returns to Martinique. His pain is unimproved but no worse either. He resumes many of his bad habits and considers going back to the country he once ruled, only this time as the head of a reform group. =The Saint= The story is centered on a character named Margarito Duarte and takes place in Rome. Margarito is originally from the small Andean village of Tolima, Colombia but travels to Rome in order to begin the process of having his deceased daughter recognized as a saint. Margarito lost his wife shortly after the birth of their only daughter and she died soon after at the age of seven from an essential fever. Eleven years after her death the villagers are forced to move their loved ones from the cemetery to another location as the space is needed for a new dam. When his daughter is unearthed she is found to be still intact and completely weightless. The villagers decide that she is a saint and pool funds to send Margarito with his daughter's body to Rome. There he meets the narrator at the pensione where they are both staying. Nothing seems to come from his inexhaustible attempts to canonize his daughter and he eventually loses contact with the narrator and other characters of the story. However, twenty- two years later, and after the death of four popes, Margarito and the narrator meet again by chance and the narrator finds that Margarito is still waiting for his daughter's recognition as a saint. It is then that the narrator realizes that the true saint of the story is really Margarito. The narrator states, \\"Without realizing it, by means of his daughter's incorruptible body and while he was still alive, he had spent twenty-two years fighting for the legitimate cause of his own canonization.\\" =The Airplane of the Sleeping Beauty= \\"The Airplane of the Sleeping Beauty\\" recounts Garc√≠a M√°rquez's personal impressions, when he fell in love with a woman in a Parisian airport at the first sight. By coincidence, she happened to be his neighbor on the plane he was taking later. The story expresses a voyeuristic adoration. =I Sell My Dreams= One day, while the narrator was having breakfast in the morning at the Havana Riviera Hotel, a gigantic wave crashed down (\\"like an explosion of dynamite\\") on the shore, picking up and overturning several cars. Under one of smashed cars was found a woman wearing \\"a gold ring shaped like a serpent, with emerald eyes\\". Her eyes and ring reminded the narrator of \\"an unforgettable woman\\", who used to wear \\"a similar ring on her right forefinger\\", whom he met thirty-four years earlier in Vienna, which was an old imperial city back then. When she was asked \\"how had she come to be in a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs of Quindio\\", she answered \\"I sell my dreams.\\" Born third of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeper in old Caldas, selling dreams was her only trade. In her childhood her dreams began to show oracular qualities, and she turned them into a source of earnings. One night, she told the narrator to leave Vienna. Considering her conviction real, the narrator boarded the last train to Rome that same night and \\"considered himself a survivor of some catastrophe\\". Later the narrator happened to meet Pablo Neruda and they found that woman; by then the woman earned affluence by selling dreams. They spent time together for some days. One day Neruda \\"dreamed about that woman who dream(ed)\\"s. Later after Neruda \\"took his leave\\", the narrator met the woman and she said \\"I dreamed he (Neruda) was dreaming about me.\\" After that day, the narrator never met her again. After the Havana Riviera disaster, the narrator met the Portuguese ambassador with whom that woman wearing a snake ring come and he asked him \\"what did she do?\\" He (the ambassador) answered with a certain disenchantment \\"Nothing,\\" \\"she dreamed.\\" =I Only Came To Use The Phone= A woman's car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. She hitches a ride on a bus on its way to a mental institute. Before she knows what's happening, she has been admitted as a patient. Her husband, referring to their trouble-ridden history, believes she has run off with another man. When she finally finds an opportunity to call him, he curses her and hangs up. She is forced to sleep with a guard to pass along the full message to her husband. When he arrives, he takes the doctor's account to heart and leaves the woman at the hospital, where she eventually adopts the role of insanity imposed upon her by the medical staff. =The Ghosts of August= A family vacationing in Tuscany decides to spend the night in a castle owned by a friend. The builder of the castle, Ludovico, a renaissance nobleman, killed his bride in bed, before setting his dogs upon himself. The family, disregarding this as a ghost tale, goes to sleep in a creepy guest room, only to awake in the bedchamber of Ludovico, with fresh blood on the sheets and a scent of fresh strawberries in the air. =Mar√≠a dos Prazeres= Maria dos Prazeres has recently had a vision of death at the age of seventy-six and wants to make all preparations before her death. She has picked out a plot for her burial on the hill cemetery, Montjuich. She meticulously trains her dog Noi to travel to the cemetery and to be able to pick out her grave on the vast hill so that he can visit and shed tears there every Sunday. She also makes sure her grave stone is nameless, like other anarchists chose under in Francoist Spain. She also held a long-standing relationship with the Count of Cardona, a man who worked under Francisco Franco, but the relationship was cut off because it had become stale. One rainy day in November, she gets a ride from the cemetery back home and she finds that she had made an error in interpreting her vision. =Seventeen Poisoned Englishmen= An aging South American lady makes the long boat trip to Europe to see the pope and is disappointed to find herself surrounded by death. =Tramontana= The narrator and his family have to seek shelter from the paranormal Catalan wind known as \\"Tramontana\\" while on vacation. =Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness= While their parents are away two young boys have the serenity of a peaceful summer holiday ruined by the intervention of a strict German nanny. The nanny named Miss Forbes treats the boys terribly making them stay locked in the house and eat the most disgusting of foods, while she is free to roam as she pleases and indulges herself in delicious meals. The boys poison her wine in an attempt to kill her. After they believe she is dead they go off to play. When they come back they find their house surrounded by police and investigators because the body of Miss Forbes was found dead, not by poison, but from multiple stab wounds on her body. =Light is Like Water= Two young boys ask for a boat in return for their good grades. When their parents finally buy them the rowboat, they break the light bulbs in their home and the light comes flowing out like water. They use the light to navigate around their home every Wednesday, and invite their friends to go sailing with them as well. The boys' friends end up drowning in the light. =The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow= Billy Sanchez and Nena Daconte, children of two wealthy Colombian families, fly to Europe to celebrate their honeymoon. Although married only three days, Nena is already two months pregnant. After she scrapes her ring finger on a rose thorn, the nearly imperceptible cut starts bleeding profusely. Nena is admitted to the intensive care unit of a Paris hospital. Visitation is permitted only one day a week so Billy must wait six days before he can see his wife again. He spends most of his time alone in a nearby hotel. Billy tries to visit Nena sooner but is thrown out of the hospital by a security guard. Billy‚Äôs attempt to enlist the aid of the foreign embassy is equally unsuccessful. When Tuesday‚Äôs visiting hours finally arrive, Billy cannot locate his wife.

It later played a major role in the coup that toppled the government of King Constantine in 1916, and also in the World War II Battle of Crete and the Greek Resistance which followed. The police in Crete before autonomy During the second half of the 19th century the Christian Cretans revolted almost every decade against Ottoman rule. In 1878, in an agreement known as the Pact of Halepa, the Sultan Abdul Hamid II, agreed that in future Crete would be policed by native-born Cretans, Christian and Muslim. It was agreed that a new body of Gendarmerie would be formed and recruited only from Cretans. In 1889, however, there was a breakdown of law and order on the island which gave the Sultan the chance to land large numbers of troops on the island and to ignore the undertakings contained in the Pact of Halepa, although he never formally renounced it. The Sultan appointed Colonel Tahsin as chief of police in Crete at the head of a body of two hundred men recruited in Macedonia. In 1896, law and order again broke down in Crete and a final Christian insurrection against Ottoman rule took place. Under pressure from foreign powers, Abdul Hamid agreed to the creation of a body of one hundred Montenegrin constables under the command of the British Major Bor. These men remained on the island until February 1899 and were generally regarded as an effective force, although their numbers were not proportionate to the problems of the island. In 1898, the Muslim population of Heraklion, who had been enduring intolerable conditions for nearly two years, revolted against the British force there and killed eighteen British soldiers and several hundred Cretan Christians. This led directly to the end of Ottoman rule on the island as Britain and other Great Powers tried to force the Turkish authorities to withdraw from the island by the middle of November 1898. Prince George of Greece, the second son of the King of Greece, arrived on 21 December 1898 as High Commissioner appointed by the Great Powers to rule Crete, which was now de facto autonomous, although under Ottoman suzerainty. The Prince replaced one of the earliest examples of international rule in European history. After the collapse of Ottoman rule in much of the island in February 1897, a committee of admirals of four of the Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) had run the coastal sections and immediate hinterland of the island. The British administered the prefecture of Heraklion, the Russians the prefecture of Rethymno, the French the prefecture of Lasithi and Sitia, and the Italians the prefectures of Chania and Sfakia. The public safety situation on the island was far from ideal. Normal law and order had disappeared with the collapse of Ottoman administration and almost all adult males were armed, and apart from the national problems there were also personal feuds and endemic problems, such as cattle stealing and vendettas. Many people abandoned the countryside and flocked to the cities for protection. The foreign governors were forced to organize units of gendarmerie from Cretans to supplement their own police and military forces, and a separate force was formed in each prefecture. Naturally, the organization and system of operation of every one of these units was different and reflected the national origins of the governor. As a result, Crete was policed by four independent units of Gendarmerie, which were organised on completely different models. The foundation and organization of the Cretan Gendarmerie Carabiniere instructor When Prince George of Greece undertook his duties as High Commissioner, one of his fundamental objectives was to restore law and order. He wanted to prove to everyone that Cretans were worthy of autonomy. So it was decided that all residents should be disarmed and a central body of Gendarmerie should be created. The core of the new Cretan Gendarmerie were the small units that the powers had created. In January 1899 the Prince called the commanders of the four Gendarmerie units to Chania to hear their proposals on the way the Cretan Gendarmerie should be organized. At this meeting it was realized that the only commander who was expert and had serious proposals on the subject was the Italian representative. Thus, the Italian proposal was accepted and it was decided on the organization of a unit of gendarmerie similar to the Italian Carabinieri, which was considered one of the best such units in Europe. In the summer of 1899, Carabinieri Captain Federico Craveri was named commander and organizer of the new Cretan Gendarmerie. Craveri, with the help of a team of 140 Carabinieri officers and non-commissioned officers, undertook the organization of the new force, using as a core the personnel of the four forces created by the international governors. In the achievement of this objective he was helped by two particularly favourable factors. First, was the fact that many young Cretans, inspired by love for their country, hurried to enlist in this new paramilitary unit of the independent Cretan State. This meant that Craveri could choose the best. Enlistment in the Gendarmerie, which also had military duties (the foundation of Militia having been postponed permanently due to lack of funds), was considered an honorable service to the nation. Georgios Vouros, for example, abandoned his studies in the Law Faculty of Athens University in order to enlist as a simple constable, and Evangelos Sarris, who had previously abandoned his studies in order to participate in the revolution of 1898, immediately enlisted in the Gendarmerie. Both were later to be among the first Cretans commissioned into the Gendarmerie. The other factor that helped Craveri to enforce law and order in the island was his excellent relationship with the government and Prince George, as well as the fact that the island's authorities had the right to deport all persons who were considered dangerous. This measure was initially applied by the international authorities and the constitution of 1899 and was extended for two years as a privilege of the Prince. None of the people deported by the admirals or the Prince had the right to return to Crete unless the Prince decided so. =Organization and uniform= The Cretan Gendarmerie consisted of a single battalion of five companies. Although the official establishment was 1,600, under Italian command the total was never more than 1,275. One company was assigned to each nomos (prefecture). The company commanders were Carabinieri lieutenants, who in Crete were given the local rank of captain. In June 1900 Craveri was replaced by Luigi Balduini Caprini, who created a sixth headquarters company. The first company commanders were: Ferdinando Mensitieri (HQ Company), Luigi Bassi (Chania Company), Ettore Lodi (Sfakia Company), Arcangelo de Mandate (Heraklion Company), Edigio Garrone (Rethymno Company), and Filiberto Vigliani (Lasithi Company). Each company was divided into three or four ypomoirarchies (subcompanies), each also under the command of an officer. Each ypomoirarchia had six enomoties (stations) commanded by a non-commissioned officer. Initially all officers and non- commissioned officers were Italian Carabinieri, but gradually the non- commissioned officers were replaced by Cretans. The Cretans, many of whom were well educated, were promoted rapidly after three months training at a military school operating at the headquarters, at the end of which they took examinations. Some of the Italian officers slightly changed their signatures to look Greek: Luigi Balduini Caprini, for instance, signed himself \\"Kaprinis\\". The uniform was dark blue in winter and white in summer. The constables wore the traditional Cretan vraka (voluminous breeches) and the officers wore trousers. The constables wore a round hat and the officers wore a kepi similar to that worn by officers of the Greek Army. Both officers and constables wore black boots. The constables were armed with rifle, bayonet, and revolver, while some also carried the traditional Cretan knife on their belts. The Cretan Gendarmerie in an autonomous Crete The Gendarmerie was busy upholding the public order, struggling against brigands and also performing services as saving people from drowning in the harbour of Chania. In a very short period of time, the Cretan Gendarmerie managed to gain the trust of the Cretans and the foreigners, although the latter had initially been prejudiced against the Cretans.. During the Theriso Revolt, the Cretan Gendarmerie remained loyal to Prince George and fought against the rebels, aided by a Russian expeditionary corps. Those members of the Gendarmerie who had defected to the rebels were not included in the amnesty the rebels received later, but were allowed to leave for Greece. From the departure of Prince George until the Balkan Wars On 16 December 1906 Eugenio Monaco, third and last head of the Italian mission, delivered command of the Gendarmerie to Artillery Lieutenant Colonel Andreas Momferratos, head of the Greek mission. The first objective of the Greek mission was the creation of a militia and the equipping of the Gendarmerie with new rifles of the Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer type. They also tried to introduce more intensive military education. The creation of battalions of militia released the Gendarmerie from certain military duties. The Greek mission immediately began to promote of Cretans to commissioned officer rank. The first Cretans to be commissioned as lieutenants on 14 January 1907, in order of seniority, were: Evangelos Sarris, Dimitrios Kokkalas, Andreas Androulakis, Alexandros Hatzioannou, Nikiforos Nikiforakis, Zaharias Brillakis, Ilias Mourginakis, Minos Mylogiannakis, Emannouil Vogiatzakis, Georgios Vouros, and Ioannis Souris. On the eve of the Balkan Wars in 1912 there were 45 officers, 50 senior non-commissioned officers, and 1,371 junior non-commissioned officers and constables serving in the Cretan Gendarmerie. Of the officers, five second lieutenants were physicians and one a pharmacist, while another pharmacist was a senior NCO. Some of the officers were attached from the Greek Army, including the commander, Colonel Andreas Momferratos. Army officers constituted the entire Greek mission that replaced the Italians in December 1906. As a direct result of the Cretan Gendarmerie's success in its duties, the organization of the Greek Gendarmerie was also assigned to Italian officers in July 1911. Some of them, like Arcangelo de Mandate, had also participated in the organization of the Cretan Gendarmerie. The Balkan Wars On 4 October 1912 the Christian countries of the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia) declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The advance of the Greek Army was rapid and on 26 October the Turks surrendered Thessaloniki (Salonika). Eleftherios Venizelos, forecasting the problems of law and order that would be presented after the liberation of the city and knowing that the Bulgarians and other European nations would like to promote a picture of chaos and a Greek state incapable of imposing order, ordered Cretan Gendarmerie units to be transported to the city. Thus, on 24 October 1912 the commander of the Cretan Gendarmerie with four officers, two senior non- commissioned officers and 150 constables left from Chania for Athens and thence to Thessaloniki aboard the steamer Arcadi. This force was strengthened and eventually almost the whole of the Gendarmerie was shipped to Thessaloniki. On the 14 October 1912, the Governor-General of Crete Stefanos Dragoumis mobilised the reservist non-commissioned officers and constables enlisted in the 1880s and 1890s. Thessalonica was then an international city. Apart from the Greeks, it was also inhabited by many Turks and Western Europeans, a very large Jewish community, and a substantial Bulgarian minority. Most of them did not welcome the Greek flag flying over the city. The Western Europeans considered that they would lose their commercial privileges; the Jews for commercial reasons would have preferred an Austrian administration or the internationalization of Thessalonica; whilst the Bulgarians, Turks and Austrians wanted the city for their own countries. The composition of population in the city of Thessalonica, according to Turkish authorities a short time before its liberation, was: * Jews - 61,000 * Turks - 43,000 * Greeks - 40,000 * Bulgarians - 6,000 * Other nationalities - 5,000 The reader should notice that the population of the suburbs and the rural area around Thessaloniki was almost 100% Greek. However, to these numbers of permanent citizens there should also be added others. Because of the war the population of the city almost had been doubled. Also present were the Greek army, the Bulgarian army, gangs of Komitadji (Bulgarian irregulars), the crews of British, Russian, Austrian and French warships that were in Thessalonica in order to protect their nationals, and the Turkish troops, who according to the treaty had freedom of movement. There were also the Turkish Gendarmerie and police, who according to the treaty were not disarmed, and a large number of Turkish deserters, many of them also armed, who were wandering the streets begging for food and money. Finally, there were Muslim refugees who had been gathering in the city as a result of Bulgarian atrocities against the unarmed population. These were assembled in Panes, cemeteries and squares creating unacceptable hygiene conditions and the immediate danger of a spread of epidemics in the city. Cretan Gendarmes patrolling the streets of Thessaloniki in 1912 The British correspondent of The Times, Crawford Price, reported: \\"Eloquent proof of the size and gravity of the Turkish defeat lies in the thousands of the refugees, who come to Salonika like swarms of locusts. Terrified and panicked leave to save their lives from the Servo-Bulgarian advance...ask shelter and protection from the cold behind walls and wear various rags...One can see pregnant women lying in the mud, and the complete absence of all elementary sanitary precaution, and not having a single blanket...one can see women and children starving not having a single piece of bread.\\" The policing of the city was very difficult, with a varied population, with explosive racial and religious prejudices, with the economic problems that were created by the change of rule, with the consequences of the recent battles, but also with the lack of any infrastructure for solving these problems. Initially, the Cretan Gendarmerie took care of the refugees by organizing them in settlements in the suburbs of the city, thus allowing the municipal workers to clean the city. They then tried to create a climate of calm and order in the city, so that all the citizens, regardless of their nationality, could feel safe. The gendarmes immediately gained the confidence and admiration of population, as it appears from the following comments in newspapers and magazines on their actions in Thessalonica: From the French paper L' Illustration, in an article by the military correspondent Jean Len: \\"There is something that occasionally draws the attention of the crowd. The passage of a Cretan Gendarmerie patrol, dressed in their national uniform: boots, vraka, shirt and toca hat on their heads. They are handsome men with dark hair, tall with a steady step...pride lights their faces. What a dream they live, these man who were for so long the captives of the Turks in their poor island, when they realize that they are entrusted to keep order in Thessalonica which they liberated from the Turks and which is still inhabited by so many of the previous conquerors, who now have to obey them! The presence of this Gendarmerie might calm the Bulgarian soldiers a little. Every evening they drink too much, creating problems wherever they pass.\\" From Morning of Thessalonica: \\"The Cretan Gendarmes impose equally the law on civilians, partisans and soldiers, regardless of race or religion, everybody obeys to everything they impose, because everyone respects and fears them.\\" From New Truth of Thessalonica: \\"The Cretan Policeman ‚Äì man of duty, disciplined and decent, managed from the first days to impose order...So in a short period of time Thessalonica had the fortune to see a peace and order that during the last years of Turkish occupation could not even be dreamt of. What men, what great lads. How handsome, decent and strong these Cretan Gendarmes...There is not soil in the world able to give birth to men better and braver than Cretans.\\" From Time of Athens (C. Chairopoulos): \\"Excellent in their carriage, discipline, organization, every man chosen with the serious sight of American or British policemen, they patrol the city inspiring respect in all citizens regardless of nationality. Trained well, military by nature, brave of character, strengthened by exercise, they are a formidable force.\\" From Time of Moscow: \\"Unfortunately not all countries have the brave men of Crete in order to create such a Gendarmerie.\\" The Bulgarians did not cease their efforts to make Thessalonica seem like a city in anarchy or to make it appear that they were also in control. On the night of 31 October, only five days after the liberation, a group of Bulgarian irregulars blew up a big Turkish ammunition dump in the suburb of Zeitelik. As a result, some Turkish prisoners and a few Greek cavalry troopers were killed. Soon afterwards, the Bulgarian irregulars started lighting fires and slaughtering the Turkish non-combatants. The Cretan gendarmes attacked them and forced them to stop their actions and retreat to the Bulgarian army barracks to seek protection. This was the first in a series of incidents involving the Bulgarians. In the following days they started occupying mosques and turning them into Bulgarian churches, insulting the religious feelings of the Muslim citizens, who protested to the Greek authorities. The Cretan Gendarmerie, with the help of the Greek Army, intervened to protect the Muslims. Most of these mosques had been converted from Greek Orthodox churches when the Turks first captured the city five centuries before. In another case, Ipenomotarchis John Petrakis, who with ten other gendarmes was guarding the railway station, discovered a Bulgarian plot to blow up the station. He arrested the Bulgarians and confiscated 100 kilograms of gunpowder and some rifles. Elsewhere, the French post office was closed after a Bulgarian officer shot the clerks because they would not accept Bulgarian banknotes. According to the report of the French military correspondent Jean Len, the whole population of Thessalonica disliked the Bulgarians. The only exception was the Jewish community, which initially, following the orders of the Austrian counsellor, gave to the Bulgarian army buildings that they refused to give to the Greek Army. Later, however, the Jewish community changed their point of view Capture of Bulgarian units in Thessalonica On 17 June 1913 the Bulgarians, without any declaration of war, attacked the Greek Army. The Second Division and the Cretan Gendarmerie were given the task of neutralising the Bulgarian units in Thessalonica. The Cretan Gendarmerie was ordered to capture the various small Bulgarian units scattered around the city, while the Second Division was to capture the larger units of Bulgarian Army. Later the same day General Kallaris sent the following message to the commander of Bulgarian forces in Thessalonica : > Sir, Since Bulgarian troops began hostilities in the countryside against our > Army, I have the honour to request you to leave the city of Thessalonica one > hour after the delivery of this letter. The arms of your men must be > delivered to our officers, while your officers may keep their swords. A > train will transport your men to the front and measures will be taken to > allow them to safely pass the front line. After this deadline expires I > must, to my regret, give orders that your troops will be considered hostile. As expected, the Bulgarians ignored the ultimatum and plans for their disarmament were initiated. The operations began in the afternoon of the same day and lasted until the morning of the next day. Bulgarian units were located in the Rotunda, in the building of the Faculty of Public Employees, in the church of Saint Sofia, in the buildings along the Hamidiye road, in the Turkish school on Kassandrou Street, and inside the Ioannidios School. The Bulgarian headquarters were located in a large house that belonged to the banker Samouel Mouson. Soldiers and Cretan gendarmes encircled the Public Employees building and firing from the houses opposite forced the Bulgarians to surrender. The Bulgarian units that were located in the buildings on Hamidiye road surrendered after a hard battle. Gendarmes and soldiers positioned in the houses opposite continued firing at them until the Bulgarians surrendered. The bullet holes in the facades of the buildings could still be seen until their destruction during the earthquake of 20 June 1978. In the Turkish school Ticaret Mectebi on Kassandrou Road and in the Bulgarian consulate there were about one hundred Bulgarian irregulars (komitadjis), who were used to attack the Greek headquarters. The komitadjis were always causing problems, walking provocatively in the streets, and they often attacked Turkish refugees housed nearby. On the afternoon of 17 June a unit of gendarmes commanded by Ypenomotarchis Emmanuel Tsakonas encircled the building and called on the Bulgarians to surrender. When they refused, heavy firing began that lasted into the next morning. Then Tsakonas resorted to a trick. He entered the courtyard of the school carrying a \\"bomb\\" and threatened to blow up the building unless they surrendered in one hour. The Bulgarians surrendered without realising that the supposed bomb was actually a bottle of mineral water. Lieutenant Hatzioannou with his unit attacked, neutralised and arrested the guard of the Bulgarian post office and bank in the Grant hotel. The fighting was hard in Saint Sofia, where sergeant Avatzos's unit had the task of capturing the Bulgarians who were holed up in the church. At one point in the battle the Bulgarians raised a white flag. As soon as the Cretans advanced in order to arrest them the Bulgarians started firing again, wounding two gendarmes. Then the Cretans assaulted with fixed bayonets and captured all the surviving Bulgarians. At the Roman monument of Rotunda, the Greek soldiers, taking positions in the terraces of the surrounding houses and aided by many citizens, fired at the tents of the Bulgarians located in the courtyard and against the windows of Rotunda until they surrendered. In total, 1,300 Bulgarian soldiers were arrested, including seventeen officers and General Hesapsiev, who was transported aboard the steamer Marietta Rialdi to Piraeus, where he was held until the end of war. After the Balkan Wars In July 1913 the Cretan Gendarmerie was incorporated into the Greek Gendarmerie. However the majority of its personnel remained in Macedonia, and the distinctive uniform was retained. In 1914 a \\"Battalion of Gendarmerie of the Expeditionary Army\\" was created, consisting of four companies, mainly reservist gendarmes of the Cretan Gendarmerie. Unfortunately, peace did not last long. On 22 September 1915, ignoring Greek neutrality, Allied forces occupied Thessaloniki to further their plans for a Macedonian front. In December 1915 Italian and French forces occupied the Greek island of Corfu, where they gathered the remnants of the Serbian Army and Government. King Constantine wanted to keep Greece neutral and did not wish to participate in a war that might end in economic and/or military disaster for Greece. After all, Greece had doubled its territories after the Balkan Wars. The soldiers wanted to return at their homes and there were many economic problems as a result of the Army's mobilisation. Also many Greeks were angry with the Italians and French, who after the Balkan Wars did not support the Greek claims on the liberated lands of Macedonia and Northern Epirus. On the other hand, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos believed that Greece had an obligation to help Serbia and enter the war with the Allies against the Central Powers. The main thrust of his policy was that Greece, as a maritime nation, should always follow Britain's lead. He hoped that Greece again had the chance to liberate the many Greeks still living under Turkish rule. The King was accused of being pro-German due to his relationship to the Kaiser. However, he was also a cousin of the Tsar and the British King. By the end of 1915 it was obvious that neutrality could not be maintained and that Greek sovereignty was being eroded day by day. A group of influential Greek Macedonian citizens and officers, believing that the Allies may give Greek Macedonian grounds to the Serbs, decided on a coup d'etat in order to force King Constantine to abandon neutrality and enter the war in favour of the Allies. This group, the Committee of National Defence, was led by D. Ligas, Periklis Argyropoulos, Alexandros Zannas, K. Aggelakis, N. Manos, Pazis, Grekos, Pamikos Zymvrakakis, Th. Koutoupis and others. The leadership was offered to the now ex-Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who strongly believed that Greece should enter the war in favour of the Allies. Venizelos agreed on condition that military units should be committed on all fronts and not only in Macedonia. In March 1916 the German and Bulgarian forces started occupying Greek territories in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Bulgarian forces, intent on expelling the Greek population from the area, started a campaign of terror, slaughtering civilians, burning villages, raping women and children, and robbing the population. The Germans objected to these atrocities, but did not wish to displease their allies too much. Once again refugees, Greeks this time, began flooding into Thessaloniki. Cretans and other Greek soldiers who could not tolerate the occupation of Greek soil by the Bulgarian army started volunteering for the Allied armies in order to fight against the Central Powers. The Greek high command started transferring units from Thessaloniki to Southern Greece in order to maintain discipline and avoid provocative actions against the Allied forces who were in Thessaloniki. The National Defence coup d'√©tat Cretan Gendarmes in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, November 1918. On 21 May 1916, the day of King Constantine's name-day, the French forces of General Sarrail imposed martial law in Thessaloniki (despite British opposition), occupying the post office, the telegraph office, the telephone office, the railway facilities, the power station, and the gasworks. Simultaneously they imposed censorship in the press, forcibly closed two newspapers and expelled five Greek officers with whom they considered that could not work: Colonel Troupakis, commanding the constabulary, Lieutenant-Colonel Nidriotis, commanding the police, Colonel Messalas, commanding Fortress Thessalonica, his chief of staff Lieutenant- Colonel Gouvelis, and Colonel Bouklakos, commanding the artillery. Any form of Greek sovereignty in the Allied-occupied Greek territories had been eliminated. The French naval attach√© Lieutenant-Commander de Rokfeill reported in September 1916: \\"There is not any question of concern for the sovereign rights of Greece because no-one remains in this country that has not been violated\\". In April 1916 the new Serbian Army of 120,000 men was transported to the Macedonian front. Simultaneously the King of Serbia and his government arrived in Thessalonica. In this situation and with the danger that the Allies would proclaim Thessalonica capital of the Kingdom of Serbia, the Committee of National Defence on 17 August 1916 decided to mount their coup d'√©tat. The representative of the Cretan Gendarmerie on this Committee was Captain D. Kokkalas. The decision was taken after General Sarrail threatened to nominate a Serbian prefect in Thessalonica and despite the possible objections of Venizelos. Afterwards the Committee of National Defence issued two proclamations, to the population and to the army. Lieutenant-Colonel Konstantinos Mazarakis tried without success to convince the 11th Artillery Battalion to take part in the coup. But all army units remained loyal to the legal government and only individual officers and soldiers took part in the coup, mostly men from units of the IV Army Corps who had felt the humiliation of surrendering Greek lands to the Bulgarians without a fight. The Cretan Gendarmerie, however, managed to overcome the loyal forces in Thessaloniki and to initiate the coup. Many of the Gendarmerie officers were already insiders in the conspiracy. After the declaration of the Committee of National Defence, the first Gendarmerie unit to revolt was the Second Company of Gendarmerie that was attached to the army, commanded by Second Lieutenant Emmanuel Tsakonas. This was followed by other companies of Cretan Gendarmerie, including the First Company (First Class Captain Evangelos Sarris), the Second Company (Captain Pavlides), and HQ Company (Major Panousopoulos). All officers and gendarmes of the Cretan Gendarmerie participated voluntarily at the coup. Even the Italian Lieutenant Farughi, still serving with the Gendarmerie, participated at the coup. Cavalry Lieutenant-Colonel Zymvrakakis, who was a member of the National Defence Committee, undertook the leadership of the coup and led the troops to the general headquarters of the Allied forces. There he announced to General Sarraill that they wished to put themselves under his orders. The British officer Price C. Ward in his book The Story Of The Salonica Army wrote: \\"General Sarrail accepted their offer since he already had the habit of accepting Greek volunteers from the moment Bulgarians had entered Greece.\\" The only organised units that participated at the coup were the Cretan Gendarmerie and the volunteer battalion that was already under French orders. Alexandros Zannas, a member of the National Defence committee, wrote that \\"the situation was curious. We (the rebels) had occupied the city of Thessaloniki (17 August 1916) based only on the forces of the Cretan Gendarmerie.\\" Athinogenis, the prefect of Thessaloniki, and the assistant district attorney convinced the officers of the loyal troops not to try to suppress the rebels immediately. Then the rebels tried to surround the loyal units. Fortunately, the occasional firing only resulted in three dead and seven wounded. The next day French troops forced the loyal units to surrender. It was a tragic irony that the French bayonets that had created the conditions for a civil war with the occupation of Greek territories at this moment prevented one. In the following days the coup was established in other Greek Macedonian cities, Crete and other islands, always with the help of Cretan Gendarmerie officers like Captain Vouros in Veria.

The system is assumed to be isolated in the sense that the system cannot exchange energy or particles with its environment, so that (by conservation of energy) the energy of the system remains exactly the same as time goes on. The system's energy, composition, volume, and shape are kept the same in all possible states of the system. The macroscopic variables of the micro-canonical ensemble are quantities that influence the nature of the system's micro-states such as the total number of particles in the system (symbol: ), the system's volume (symbol: ), as well as the total energy in the system (symbol: ). This ensemble is therefore sometimes called the ensemble, as each of these three quantities is a constant of the ensemble. In simple terms, the micro-canonical ensemble is defined by assigning an equal probability to every micro-state whose energy falls within a range centered at . All other micro-states are given a probability of zero. Since the probabilities must add up to 1, the probability is the inverse of the number of micro-states within the range of energy, :P = 1/W, The range of energy is then reduced in width until it is infinitesimally narrow, still centered at . In the limit of this process, the micro-canonical ensemble is obtained. Applicability The micro-canonical ensemble is sometimes considered to be the fundamental distribution of statistical thermodynamics, as its form can be justified on elementary grounds such as the principle of indifference: the micro-canonical ensemble describes the possible states of an isolated mechanical system when the energy is known exactly, but without any more information about the internal state. Also, in some special systems the evolution is ergodic in which case the micro-canonical ensemble is equal to the time-ensemble when starting out with a single state of energy (a time- ensemble is the ensemble formed of all future states evolved from a single initial state). In practice, the micro-canonical ensemble does not correspond to an experimentally realistic situation. With a real physical system there is at least some uncertainty in energy, due to uncontrolled factors in the preparation of the system. Besides the difficulty of finding an experimental analogue, it is difficult to carry out calculations that satisfy exactly the requirement of fixed energy since it prevents logically independent parts of the system from being analyzed separately. Moreover, there are ambiguities regarding the appropriate definitions of quantities such as entropy and temperature in the micro-canonical ensemble. Systems in thermal equilibrium with their environment have uncertainty in energy, and are instead described by the canonical ensemble or the grand canonical ensemble, the latter if the system is also in equilibrium with its environment in respect to particle exchange. Properties Thermodynamic analogies Early work in statistical mechanics by Ludwig Boltzmann led to his eponymous entropy equation for a system of a given total energy, , where is the number of distinct states accessible by the system at that energy. Boltzmann did not elaborate too deeply on what exactly constitutes the set of distinct states of a system, besides the special case of an ideal gas. This topic was investigated to completion by Josiah Willard Gibbs who developed the generalized statistical mechanics for arbitrary mechanical systems, and defined the micro-canonical ensemble described in this article. Gibbs investigated carefully the analogies between the micro-canonical ensemble and thermodynamics, especially how they break down in the case of systems of few degrees of freedom. He introduced two further definitions of micro-canonical entropy that do not depend on - the volume and surface entropy described above. (Note that the surface entropy differs from the Boltzmann entropy only by an -dependent offset.) The volume entropy and associated form a close analogy to thermodynamic entropy and temperature. It is possible to show exactly that :dE = T_{\\\\rm v} dS_{\\\\rm v} - \\\\langle P\\\\rangle dV, ( is the ensemble average pressure) as expected for the first law of thermodynamics. A similar equation can be found for the surface (Boltzmann) entropy and its associated , however the \\"pressure\\" in this equation is a complicated quantity unrelated to the average pressure. The micro-canonical and are not entirely satisfactory in their analogy to temperature. Outside of the thermodynamic limit, a number of artifacts occur. * Nontrivial result of combining two systems: Two systems, each described by an independent micro-canonical ensemble, can be brought into thermal contact and be allowed to equilibriate into a combined system also described by a micro-canonical ensemble. Unfortunately, the energy flow between the two systems cannot be predicted based on the initial 's. Even when the initial 's are equal, there may be energy transferred. Moreover, the of the combination is different from the initial values. This contradicts the intuition that temperature should be an intensive quantity, and that two equal-temperature systems should be unaffected by being brought into thermal contact. * Strange behavior for few-particle systems: Many results such as the micro-canonical Equipartition theorem acquire a one- or two-degree of freedom offset when written in terms of . For a small systems this offset is significant, and so if we make the analogue of entropy, several exceptions need to be made for systems with only one or two degrees of freedom. * Spurious negative temperatures: A negative occurs whenever the density of states is decreasing with energy. In some systems the density of states is not monotonic in energy, and so can change sign multiple times as the energy is increased.See further references at https://sites.google.com/site/entropysurfaceorvolume/ The preferred solution to these problems is avoid use of the micro-canonical ensemble. In many realistic cases a system is thermostatted to a heat bath so that the energy is not precisely known. Then, a more accurate description is the canonical ensemble or grand canonical ensemble, both of which have complete correspondence to thermodynamics. Precise expressions for the ensemble The precise mathematical expression for a statistical ensemble depends on the kind of mechanics under consideration‚Äîquantum or classical‚Äîsince the notion of a \\"micro-state\\" is considerably different in these two cases. In quantum mechanics, diagonalization provides a discrete set of micro-states with specific energies. The classical mechanical case involves instead an integral over canonical phase space, and the size of micro-states in phase space can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily. To construct the micro- canonical ensemble, it is necessary in both types of mechanics to first specify a range of energy. In the expressions below the function f(\\\\tfrac{H - E}{\\\\omega}) (a function of , peaking at with width ) will be used to represent the range of energy in which to include states. An example of this function would be :f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\mathrm{if}~x < \\\\tfrac 12,  0, & \\\\mathrm{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} or, more smoothly, :f(x) = e^{-\\\\pi x^2}. = Quantum mechanical = A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by \\\\hat\\\\rho. The micro-canonical ensemble can be written using bra‚Äìket notation, in terms of the system's energy eigenstates and energy eigenvalues. Given a complete basis of energy eigenstates , indexed by , the micro-canonical ensemble is :\\\\hat\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{W} \\\\sum_i f\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{H_i - E}{\\\\omega}\\\\right) \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_i , where the are the energy eigenvalues determined by \\\\hat H \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle = H_i \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle (here is the system's total energy operator, i. e., Hamiltonian operator). The value of is determined by demanding that \\\\hat\\\\rho is a normalized density matrix, and so :W = \\\\sum_i f\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{H_i - E}{\\\\omega}\\\\right). The state volume function (used to calculate entropy) is given by :v(E) = \\\\sum_{H_i < E} 1. The micro-canonical ensemble is defined by taking the limit of the density matrix as the energy width goes to zero, however a problematic situation occurs once the energy width becomes smaller than the spacing between energy levels. For very small energy width, the ensemble does not exist at all for most values of , since no states fall within the range. When the ensemble does exist, it typically only contains one (or two) states, since in a complex system the energy levels are only ever equal by accident (see random matrix theory for more discussion on this point). Moreover, the state-volume function also increases only in discrete increments, and so its derivative is only ever infinite or zero, making it difficult to define the density of states. This problem can be solved by not taking the energy range completely to zero and smoothing the state-volume function, however this makes the definition of the ensemble more complicated, since it becomes then necessary to specify the energy range in addition to other variables (together, an ensemble). =Classical mechanical= In classical mechanics, an ensemble is represented by a joint probability density function defined over the system's phase space. The phase space has generalized coordinates called , and associated canonical momenta called . The probability density function for the micro-canonical ensemble is: :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} \\\\frac{1}{W} f(\\\\tfrac{H-E}{\\\\omega}), where * is the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system, a function of the phase , * is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one micro-state and providing correct dimensions to .(Historical note) Gibbs' original ensemble effectively set , leading to unit-dependence in the values of some thermodynamic quantities like entropy and chemical potential. Since the advent of quantum mechanics, is often taken to be equal to Planck's constant in order to obtain a semiclassical correspondence with quantum mechanics. * is an overcounting correction factor, often used for particle systems where identical particles are able to change place with each other.In a system of identical particles, (factorial of ). This factor corrects the overcounting in phase space due to identical physical states being found in multiple locations. See the statistical ensemble article for more information on this overcounting. Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function: :W = \\\\int \\\\ldots \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} f(\\\\tfrac{H-E}{\\\\omega}) \\\\, dp_1 \\\\ldots dq_n This integral is taken over the entire phase space. The state volume function (used to calculate entropy) is defined by :v(E) = \\\\int \\\\ldots \\\\int_{H < E} \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} \\\\, dp_1 \\\\ldots dq_n . As the energy width is taken to zero, the value of decreases in proportion to as . Based on the above definition, the micro-canonical ensemble can be visualized as an infinitesimally thin shell in phase space, centered on a constant-energy surface. Although the micro-canonical ensemble is confined to this surface, it is not necessarily uniformly distributed over that surface: if the gradient of energy in phase space varies, then the micro- canonical ensemble is \\"thicker\\" (more concentrated) in some parts of the surface than others. This feature is an unavoidable consequence of requiring that the micro-canonical ensemble is a steady-state ensemble.  Perfect Gas Entropy and thermodynamic limit  Let's use the microcanonical description for characterize a perfect gas composed of N punctual particles in a volume V, of masse m and a void spin. The isolated gas has a total energy E\\\\pm dE . As a reminder, the energy of a particule is quantified : E=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} , k_i=n_i\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{L_i}~n_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} . First of all, we should determine the number of vector having a norm such as \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \\\\leq E \\\\iff k^2 \\\\leq \\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar^2} while respecting the discretization of k . Thus the phase volume function could be considered as the number of elementary mesh that we could put in a sphere of radius \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar}} . For N particles gas, k dimension is equal to 3N, the elementary mesh is then a hypercube of volume (k_x k_y k_z)^N=\\\\frac{V^N}{(2\\\\pi)^{3N}} and the (3N-hyper) sphere of radius \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar}} has a volume of \\\\frac{\\\\pi^{\\\\frac{3N}{2}}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{3N}{2}+1)}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar}}\\\\right)^{3N} , where \\\\Gamma(x) is the gamma function. Hence, v(E)=\\\\frac{ Volume~of~the~hypersphere~ of ~radius \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar}}}{Volume~ of ~the~ elementary~ mesh} In order to determine the entropy we must exprimed \\\\frac{dv}{dE}=\\\\frac{V^N}{(2\\\\pi)^{3N}}(\\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2})^{\\\\frac{3N}{2}}\\\\frac{\\\\pi^{\\\\frac{3N}{2}}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{3N}{2}+1)}\\\\frac{3N}{2}E^{\\\\frac{3N}{2}-1} Particles being indistinguishable we divide the number of possible state by N! as part of Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation. The entropy is then egal to : S=k~log\\\\left(\\\\frac{dv}{dE}\\\\right)=kN\\\\left(log\\\\left(\\\\frac{V}{N}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{3}{2}log\\\\left(\\\\frac{mE}{3\\\\pi\\\\hbar^2N}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{5}{2}\\\\right) ,where we used Stirling's approximation with N\\\\gg1 , finally we find the Sackur‚ÄìTetrode equation. We find easily the microcanonical temperatures \\\\frac{1}{T}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial E}=\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\frac{N}{E}k \\\\iff E=\\\\frac{3}{2}kNT , we find the well known result of Kinetic theory of gases. Moreover we find the famous ideal gas law, indeed we have \\\\frac{p}{T}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial V}=\\\\frac{kN}{V} \\\\iff pV=NkT  Notes   References  Category:Statistical ensembles ","title":"Microcanonical ensemble"},{"id":"1136451","text":"Philip Morris Klutznick (July 9, 1907 ‚Äì August 14, 1999) was a U.S. administrator who served as U.S. Secretary of Commerce from January 9, 1980 to January 19, 1981 under President Jimmy Carter. He was a prominent leader of several Jewish organisations, including as President of the World Jewish Congress from 1977 to 1979. Early life Klutznick was born on July 9, 1907, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Morris and Minnie Klutznick, who had emigrated from Poland two years earlier. In 1924, Klutznick participated in the formation of the second chapter of the Jewish fraternal youth organization Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA). He became the 2nd Grand Aleph Godol (President) of the expanding organization in 1925. After high school, he became the first executive director of AZA. He attended the University of Kansas at Lawrence and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and received a LLB degree in 1930 from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. After school, he worked as an attorney and became involved in housing construction. During World War II, he was responsible for building homes for defense workers in the eastern United States including the construction of the residential town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where parts of the atomic bomb were being developed in the Manhattan Project. After the war, he built suburban shopping malls in the Chicago area in partnership with the Chicago department store chain, Marshall Field & Company. Career Klutznick's career in public service advanced along with his success in business. After World War II, he joined American Community Developers to create Park Forest, a suburb south of Chicago *Cooley, Will, \\"'We Just Can't Afford to Be Democratic': Liberals, Integrationists, and the Postwar Suburb of Park Forest,\\" Journal of Social History, . In 1953, he was elected to the first of two three-year terms as President of B'nai B'rith. His presidency focused on strengthening the century-old organization's internal structure and expanding its constituency. He visited B'nai B'rith districts worldwide and worked to strengthen lodges in post-war Europe and Israel. Domestically, he instituted a membership drive, expanded support for youth programs and travelled in the Southern United States to discuss B'nai B'rith support for school desegregation and the growing civil rights movement. Klutznick was also active in international affairs. In 1957, he served a three-month term as a United Nations delegate. He gained the rank of ambassador as US representative on the UN Economic and Social Council in 1960, working closely with United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson II. Klutznick resigned his UN post two years later, contending that a failure to integrate political goals with economic and social needs undermined the effectiveness of international diplomacy. In later years, he remained active in international affairs, completing a survey of Brazilian housing for the Johnson administration, writing and speaking frequently on international issues and working with the United Nations Association of the United States of America. Klutznick had a special interest in the Middle East and in Israel‚ÄìUnited States relations. As B'nai B'rith President, he travelled to Israel and advocated the use of German reparations funds to support Jewish organizations. He was among the American Jewish leaders to meet with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to discuss Middle Eastern policy and events. In 1977, Klutznick became President of the World Jewish Congress, succeeding Nahum Goldmann who had led the group since 1949. During negotiations that preceded the 1977 Camp David Accords, Klutznick met with Israeli leader Menachem Begin, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Jimmy Carter, as well as other US administration officials. In 1978, Klutznick initiated a commission headed by Guy de Rothschild to examine the economic implications of Arab-Israeli peace for Israel and the international Jewish community. Another focus of his leadership was Jewish culture, demonstrated in efforts to strengthen and reorganize the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and Beit Hatfutsot, the museum of the Jewish diaspora. Klutznick's service as WJC President was brief. He took a leave of absence upon his confirmation vote as Secretary of Commerce in 1979, and chose to leave the position to his replacement, Edgar Bronfman, Sr, after leaving the government. Klutznick's views on Middle Eastern issues were often controversial in the American and international Jewish communities. He considered himself a Zionist, and a strong defender of Israel, but encouraged dialogue with Arab groups and leaders. In 1975, he served on a \\"Middle East Study Group\\", sponsored by the Brookings Institution, which produced a report encouraging both Israeli and Arab concessions and active involvement by the US government. In 1981, he travelled to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and the West Bank as part of a private group to meet with leaders in government, education, military affairs, business and communications, as well as political dissidents. The resulting \\"Seven Springs Report\\" attempted to provide a base of knowledge and understanding for the conduct of future negotiations and peace plans. In June 1982, Klutznick joined with Nahum Goldmann, former President of the World Jewish Congress, and Pierre Mend√®s France, former Prime Minister of France, to issue the \\"Paris Declaration\\", encouraging an end to Israel's siege of Beirut and negotiation with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to ensure regional peace and security. Klutznick's involvement in each of these reports and statements prompted both widespread support and protest from Jewish organizations and individuals. In January 1980, Klutznick began service as U.S. Secretary of Commerce under 39th President Jimmy Carter. He took office at the age of 72, making him the oldest first-time appointee to cabinet in U.S. history. That record was broken in 2017 when Wilbur Ross became Secretary of Commerce at the age of 79. Klutznick had long-standing relationships with Vice-President Walter Mondale and U.S. Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance and his ties to the Carter administration were further strengthened by his significant role in Arab-Israeli peace talks. His appointment was viewed by some critics as an effort to strengthen Carter's status among Jewish voters. Klutznick's tenure was marked by the economic recession and inflation that characterized the later years of the Carter administration, Carter's unsuccessful bid for re-election and the completion of the 1980 census. Personal life Klutznick married Ethel Riekes in 1930. They had six children, Bettylu, Richard, who died in early childhood, Thomas, James, Robert and Samuel. Ethel Klutznick died in 1996. Philip M. Klutznick died of Alzheimer's disease on August 14, 1999. He served as President of the Chicago Bulls franchise in 1973. His daughter, Bettylu Saltzman, is widely credited with helping launch President Barack Obama's political career. She introduced the then-community organizer to David Axelrod in 1992. https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/05/06/mothers-day-chicago- political-power-broker-barack-obama/?arc404=true References External links *Guide to the Philip M.

It is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha and part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is about south-east of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (which includes Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island), north-east from South Georgia Island, west from Cape Town, and over from the nearest point of South America. Gough Island is uninhabited except for the personnel of a weather station (usually six people) which the South African National Antarctic Programme has maintained, with British permission, continually on the island since 1956.

Charles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732, thinking it was a new find.Gough's log is preserved in the East India Collection at the British Library. The entry for 3 March 1732 is printed in Gabriel Wright (pub.), \\"A New Nautical Directory for the East- India and China Navigation\\", 7th edn, London, 1804, p. 394. It had been named Gon√ßalo √Ålvares since 1505 after the captain of Vasco da Gama's flagship on his epic voyage to the east, and under this name it was marked with reasonable accuracy on the charts of the South Atlantic during the following 230 or so years. Then, in 1732, Captain Gough of the British ship Richmond reported the discovery of a new island, which he placed 400 miles to the east of Gon√ßalo √Ålvares. Fifty years later cartographers realised that the two islands were the same, and despite the priority of the Portuguese discovery, and the greater accuracy of the position given by them, \\"Gough's Island\\" was the name adopted.Heaney, J.B., Holdgate, M.W. (1957). The Gough Island Scientific Survey. The Geographical Journal, Vol. 123, No. 1, pp. 20‚Äì31 In the early 19th century, sealers sometimes briefly inhabited the island. The earliest known example is a sealing gang from the U.S. ship Rambler (Captain Joseph Bowditch) which remained on the island in the 1804‚Äì1805 season.R.K. Headland (Ed.) Historical Antarctic Sealing Industry, Scott Polar Research Institute (University of Cambridge), 2018, p.176. The sealing era lasted from 1804 to 1910 during which 34 sealing vessels are known to have visited the island, one of which was lost offshore.Headland, p.167. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition on the Scotia made the first visit to the island by a scientific party on 21 April 1904, when William Speirs Bruce and others collected specimens. The Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition also stopped at the island in 1922. Gough Island was formally claimed in 1938 for Britain, during a visit by HMS Milford of the Royal Navy. In 1995, the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2004, the site was extended to include Inaccessible Island and renamed Gough and Inaccessible Islands. Gough Island is the only place outside South America from which the solar eclipse of 12 September 2034 (excluding partial phases), will be visible; the centre of the path of totality crosses over the island. Geography and geology Gough Island is roughly rectangular with a length of and a width of . It has an area of and rises to heights of over above sea level. Topographic features include the highest peak, Edinburgh Peak, Hags Tooth, Mount Rowett, Sea Elephant Bay, Quest Bay, and Hawkins Bay. It includes small satellite islands and rocks such as Southwest Island, Saddle Island (South), Tristiana Rock, Isolda Rock (West), Round Island, Cone Island, Lot's Wife, Church Rock (North), Penguin Island (Northeast), and The Admirals (East). =Climate= According to the K√∂ppen system, Gough Island features an oceanic climate (Cfb). Gough Island's high temperatures are between and during the day year-round, due to its isolated position far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic is much cooler in the southern hemisphere than the northern, but frosts are still very rare. As a result, summers are not very hot. It features a similar climate to the Fiordland area of New Zealand, the west coast of Scotland, or the Alaskan Panhandle. Precipitation is high during the entire year, and sunshine hours are few. Snow falls in the interior, but is rare at sea level. Fauna and flora The fern Blechnum and tree Phylica on Gough Island Gough and Inaccessible Island are a protected wildlife reserve, which has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It has been described as one of the least disrupted ecosystems of its kind and one of the best shelters for nesting seabirds in the Atlantic. In particular, it is host to almost the entire world population of the Tristan albatross (Diomedea dabbenena) and the Atlantic petrel (Pterodroma incerta).Cuthbert, J. & Sommer, E. Population size and trends of four globally threatened seabirds at Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean. Marine Ornithology 32: 97‚Äì103. The island is also home to the almost flightless Gough moorhen, and the critically endangered Gough bunting. =Birds= A male Gough Bunting on the island The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its endemic landbirds and as a breeding site for seabirds. Birds for which the IBA has conservation significance include northern rockhopper penguins (30,000 breeding pairs), Tristan albatrosses (1500‚Äì2000 pairs), sooty albatrosses (5000 pairs), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (5000 pairs), broad-billed prions (1,750,000 pairs), Kerguelen petrels (20,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrels (400,000 pairs), Atlantic petrels (900,000 pairs), great-winged petrels (5000 pairs), grey petrels (10,000 pairs), great shearwaters (100,000 pairs), little shearwaters (10,000 pairs), grey-backed storm petrels (10,000 pairs), white-faced storm petrels (10,000 pairs), white-bellied storm petrels (10,000 pairs), Antarctic terns (500 pairs), southern skuas (500 pairs), Gough moorhens (2500 pairs) and Gough buntings (3000 individuals). =Mammals= Elephant seal at Gough Island depicted on a 1954 Tristan da Cunha stamp The island has a large breeding population of subantarctic fur seals and some southern right whales still migrate around the island. House mice are currently present on the island. (see Invasive Species) =Invasive species= Pearlwort (Sagina procumbens) In 1998 a number of procumbent pearlwort (Sagina procumbens) plants were found on the island which are capable of dramatically transforming the upland plant ecosystem (as it has on the Prince Edward Islands). Cooper, J. et al., \\"Earth, fire and water: applying novel techniques to eradicate the invasive plant, procumbent pearlwort Sagina procumbens, on Gough Island, a World Heritage Site in the South Atlantic\\", Invasive Species Specialist Group, 2010, Retrieved on 12 February 2014. Eradication efforts are ongoing but are expected to require years of 'concerted effort'. Bisser, P. et al., \\"Strategies to eradicate the invasive plant procumbent pearlwort Sagina procumbens on Gough Island, 2010\\", Retrieved on 12 February 2014. House mice In April 2007 researchers published evidence that predation by introduced house mice on seabird chicks is occurring at levels that might drive the Tristan albatross and the Atlantic petrel to extinction. As of October 2018, it is estimated that as many as 2,000,000 fewer eggs and chicks are being raised due to the impact of mice on the island, threatening the extinction of several species of seabirds that breed exclusively or nearly exclusively on Gough Island. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds awarded ¬£62,000 by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme to fund additional research on the Gough Island mice and a feasibility study of how best to deal with them. The grant also paid for the assessment of a rat problem on Tristan da Cunha island. Trials for a method of eradicating the mice through baiting were commenced,R. J. Cuthbert1 , P. Visser et al., \\"Preparations for the eradication of mice from Gough Island: results of bait acceptance trials above ground and around cave systems\\", 2011, Retrieved on 12 February 2014. and ultimately a ¬£9.2 million eradication programme was planned, and set to begin in 2020, with the island expected to be mouse free by 2022. The inception of this programme in 2020 was confirmed in 2018. The programme will use helicopters to drop cereal pellets containing the rodenticide brodifacoum. Gough has also been identified as the third most important island in the world (out of 107 islands) to be targeted for the removal of non-native invasive mammals to save threatened species from extinction and make major progress towards achieving global conservation targets. The proposed cull has been criticised by some animal rights groups, with the director of Animal Aid stating \\"We don‚Äôt feel we have the right to choose some animals over others ... We don‚Äôt agree with any culling for so-called conservation purposes. The conservation priority should be making sure wild spaces are protected, but allowing nature to do its thing. The species that we prefer to succeed may not, but we should let that happen rather than deciding to micromanage, control and inflict suffering on the species we don‚Äôt like.\\" Weather station A weather station has been operating on Gough Island since 1956. It is operated as part of the network of the South African Weather Service. Because cold fronts approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is particularly important in forecasting winter weather. Initially it was housed in the station at The Glen, but moved in 1963 to the South lowlands of the island, more precisely . The new location improved the validity and reliability of the data acquired for use in modeling. =Human presence= Each year a new overwintering team arrives by ship from Cape Town (beginning in 2012, the S. A. Agulhas II) to staff the weather station and perform scientific research. The team for a particular year may be termed as \\"Gough\\" and an expedition number: for example, the 1956 team were \\"Gough 01\\", and the team for 2013 were \\"Gough 58\\". Each new team directly replaces the departing one, thereby maintaining a continual human presence on the island.\\"South Africa National Antarctic Programme - Gough Island Teams\\" , Retrieved 12 February 2014Chris Bell, \\"Chris Bell's Blog from Gough 58\\", Retrieved 12 February 2014 A team normally consists of: * A senior meteorologist * Two junior meteorologists * A radio technician * A medic * A diesel mechanic * A number of biologists (depending on ongoing research projects) The team is supplied with enough food to last the whole year.

The equivalent popular culture term is body language, a term Ray Birdwhistell, considered the founder of this area of study, neither used nor liked (on the grounds that what can be conveyed with the body does not meet the linguist's definition of language). Birdwhistell's work Kinesics was first used in 1952 by an anthropologist named Ray Birdwhistell. Birdwhistell wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance and movement.Birdwhistell, R. L. (1952). Introduction to Kinesics: An Annotation System for Analysis of Body Motion and Gesture. Washington, DC: Department of State, Foreign Service Institute. His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book Kinesics and Context.Birdwhistell, R. 1970. Kinesics and Context. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia. Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behaviour generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass-market (nonacademic) publications as How to Read a Person Like a Book.Nierenberg, G. I., & Calero, H. H. (1971). How to Read a Person Like a Book. New York: Hawthorn Books. Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was The Natural History of an Interview, a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including Gregory Bateson, Frieda Fromm- Reichmann, Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.Jump up ^ Leeds- Hurwitz, W. (1987). The Social History of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. Research on Language and Social Interaction, 20, 1-51. Drawing heavily on descriptive linguistics, Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behaviour has a grammar that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a \\"kineme\\" is \\"similar to a phoneme because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning.\\"Knapp, M. 1972. Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction. Reinhart and Winston, New York, pp. 94-5. Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.McDermott, R. 1980. Profile: Ray L. Birdwhistell. The Kinesis Report, 2, 3: 1-16. He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by Paul Ekman, who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in facial expression. Modern applications In a current application, kinesic behavior is sometimes used as signs of deception by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally. Relevant concepts include: *Emblems - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase *Illustrators - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages **Batons - Temporally accent or emphasize words or phrases **Ideographs - Trace the paths of mental journeys **Deitic movements - Point to a present object **Kinetographs - Depict a bodily action **Spatial movements - Depict a spatial relationship **Pictographs - Draw a picture of their referent **Rhythmic movements - Depict the rhythm or pacing of an event *Affect Displays - Show emotion *Regulators - Control the flow and pace of communication *Manipulators - Release physical or emotional tension Kinesic behaviors are an important part of nonverbal communication. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

In 1843 an observatory was built here for astronomical and meteorological observations and to provide accurate time for ships' chronometers. In 1866, when the dock was redeveloped, the observatory was relocated to Bidston Hill on the Wirral Peninsula. In 1868, Waterloo Dock was split in two separate basins; East Waterloo Dock and West Waterloo Dock.

Besides cleaning pipes, they can be used for any application that calls for cleaning out small bores or tight places. Special pipe cleaners are manufactured specifically for cleaning out medical apparatus and for engineering applications. They are popular for winding around bottle necks to catch drips, bundling things together, colour- coding, and applying paints, oils, solvents, greases, and similar substances. They can also be used like a twist tie. Description Smoking pipe cleaners normally use some absorbent material, usually cotton or sometimes viscose. Bristles of stiffer material, normally monofilament nylon or polypropylene are sometimes added to better scrub out what is being cleaned. Microfilament polyester is used in some technical pipe cleaners because polyester wicks liquid away rather than absorbing it as cotton does. Some smoking pipe cleaners are made conical or tapered so that one end is thick and one end thin. The thin end is for cleaning the small bore of the pipe stem and then the thick end for the bowl or the wider part of the stem. When used for cleaning purposes, pipe cleaners are normally discarded after one or two uses. Crafts Pipe cleaners are commonly used in arts and crafts projects. \\"Craft\\" pipe cleaners are usually made with polyester or nylon pile and are often longer and thicker than the \\"cleaning\\" type, and available in many different colors. Craft pipe cleaners are not very useful for cleaning purposes, because the polyester does not absorb liquids, and the thicker versions may not even fit down the stem of a normal pipe or into the usual hard-to-access area of applications that call for cleaning small bores or tight places. In Japan, crafting with pipe cleaners is known as Mogol art. Its name derived from the Portuguese word Mughal for a style of weaving.http://www.craftjam.jp/en/index.html Workshops in malls and schools in Japan have been led by Atushi Kitanaka on an effort to support the pipe cleaner industry. Ikuyo FujitaÔºàËó§Áî∞ËÇ≤‰ª£ Fujita IkuyoÔºâis a Japanese artist who works primarily in needle felt painting and mogol (pipe cleaner) art. Use of pipe cleaners as an art format where animals https://www.yahoo.com/news/photos/pipe-cleaner- artist-1384892399-slideshow/?ref=gs are made by twisting pipe cleaners together. They can also be used to create whiskers for an animal mask or nose. Manufacture A pipe cleaner is made of two lengths of wire, called the core, twisted together trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile. Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the inner wires of each pipe cleaner have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts. Chenille yarn is made in much the same way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called \\"chenille stems\\". The word chenille comes from French meaning caterpillar. Some pipe cleaner machines are actually converted chenille machines. Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools. The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use. Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines. Smoking pipe cleaners are usually 15‚Äì17 cm (6‚Äì7 inches) long. Craft ones are often 30 cm (12 inches) and can be up to 50 cm (20 inches).The diameter comes in 4 mm; 6 mm; and 15 mm sizeshttp://kwikcrafts.com/crafts/category/Pipe-Cleaners.html Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30 mm diameter with lengths of 18 inches and 6.5 feet.

It was fought between the allied Christian Lebanese Front militias, under the command of the Kataeb Party's President Bachir Gemayel, and the Syrian troops of the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF). Background In January 1976, the Phalange joined the main Christian parties ‚Äì National Liberal Party (NLP), Lebanese Renewal Party (LRP), Marada Brigade, Al-Tanzim, and others ‚Äì in a loose coalition, the Lebanese Front, designed to act as a political counterweight to the predominantly Muslim Lebanese National Movement (LNM) - Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) alliance. In order to deal with the Syrian military intervention of June 1976 and better coordinate the military operations of their respective militias, Christian militia leaders agreed to form in August that year a joint military command (a.k.a. the \\"Command Council\\") whose new collective name was the \\"Lebanese Forces\\" (LF).Randal, Going All the Way (2012), pp. 109-155.Middle East Report (MER), 31 January 1981, pp. 9-11.Middle East Report (MER), 20 June 1981, pp. 13-17.Lewis W. Snider, \\"The Lebanese Forces: Wartime Origins and Political Significance,\\" Middle East Journal 38, 4 (Winter 1984). From the very beginning, it became clear that the Lebanese Front's Command Council was dominated by the Phalange and its KRF militia under the charismatic leadership of Bachir Gemayel, who sought to unify the various Christian militias. From 1977 onwards, Bachir began implementing the controversial \\"unification of the rifle\\" policy, using the LF to build a new power base for himself, distinct from that of the Phalange or any of the other traditional rightist parties.Rabinovich, The war for Lebanon (1989), p. 71. However, Bachir's actions soon put him on a direct collision course with Syria. Relations between the LF command and Damascus had already become frosty as a consequence of the ADF's growing unwillingness to either suppress the LNM-PLO alliance militias in west Beirut altogether or allow the Christian militias to do so. The hundred days' war =February 1978= After a series of bomb attacks that rocked Beirut on early February 1978, the ADF stepped up its security measures by increasing the number of patrols and checkpoints in the streets. On the 7th, Lebanese soldiers belonging to the Army of Free Lebanon (AFL) ‚Äì a breakaway faction of the Lebanese Army led by the rightist dissident Colonel Antoine Barakat ‚Äì objected to the ADF establishing a checkpoint near their HQ at the main Fayadieh barracks, a fortress-like military facility located in the namesake Christian district. The ADF detachment, which comprised twenty Syrian regular soldiers, refused to move out, causing an argument which ended with a shootout on which 19 people lost their lives. The Syrian soldiers were taken prisoner by the AFL regulars and held hostage at Fayadieh barracks, and the situation grew tenser that dawn when the bodies of two slain Christians were found nearby. The next day, Syrian ADF infantry units backed by artillery surrounded and bombarded the AFL fortified barracks, setting part of the complex on fire. Kataeb Regulatory Forces 'Commando' troops under the command of Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun were drawn into the action against the Syrians. That afternoon the Syrian Army shelled Achrafieh and attacked the Tigers' HQ, located at the Sodeco quarter in Achrafieh. The fighting soon spread to east of Beirut and Mount Lebanon. The Syrians took some high-rise buildings such as the Burj Rizk in Achrafieh and the Burj El-Murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians. The soldiers stayed for 90 days. Another major clash took place near the Sodeco area in Achrafieh where the Christian militias fought ferociously and drove the Syrians out of the Rizk Building. This threatened the 4th Mechanized brigade of encirclement and capture by the Maronite militias. =March 1978= =April 1978= In April, rightist leaders accused the ADF of bias when it intervened to contain the clashes across the Green Line between the Christian-held Ain al-Rammaneh and Muslim-held Chyah districts of Beirut. Consequences However, the LF attack on the pro-Syrian Marada Brigade militia of the Frangieh Clan that summer, which culminated in the infamous Ehden massacre, provoked another round of fighting in June‚ÄìJuly. President Elias Sarkis threatened to resign in protest over the Syrian bombardment of East Beirut, but later withdrew his resignation when the shelling stopped. More fighting erupted in the fall, again followed by a ceasefire. In October 1978, the Foreign Ministers of Lebanon and those Arab League states contributing to the ADF ‚Äì Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Sudan, Qatar and the UAE ‚Äì met at the town of Beiteddine, in the Chouf District south-east of Beirut. The outcome of the meeting was essentially a reaffirmation of the role of the ADF and a strong condemnation of those dealing with Israel.Text of the Beit ed-Dine declaration in Middle East Report (MER), October 21, 1978, pp. 17-18. This meeting, and subsequent discussions between Syria and Saudi Arabia led to the lifting of the siege of Achrafieh by the Syrians and the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from East Beirut, being replaced by Saudi and Sudanese ADF troops, whom the Lebanese Front leaders viewed as more impartial and less hostile towards the Christians than the Syrian forces. The settlement was welcomed by the Lebanese Front parties and marked the end of the clashes.

His wealth, position and personal tastes allowed him to pursue a path unfamiliar to most of his French contemporaries, more similar to that of his contemporary German romantic composers; his music also had a strong following in Germany and in England. His principal output was chamber music, but he also wrote four symphonies and four operas. Esteemed by many of the critics of his time, his reputation declined swiftly after his death and has only been revived in recent years. Life George Onslow was born in Clermont-Ferrand, the son of an English father, Edward Onslow, and a French mother, Marie Rosalie de Bourdeilles de Brant√¥me; his paternal grandfather was George Onslow, 1st Earl of Onslow.Bickley (n.d.) In Onslow's own brief autobiography (written in the third person) he comments that in his childhood, \\"music studies formed but a secondary part of his education\\" but names Jan Ladislav Dussek and Johann Baptist Cramer amongst his piano teachers.Niaux (2004). It has been suggested that he received this tuition in London under the aegis of his grandfather the Earl. However, other research indicates he may not have studied with Dussek until 1797‚Äì1798 in Hamburg, where his family was living in exile after his father had become involved in counter-revolutionary activities in France. This research also indicates there is no evidence to support the suggestions sometimes made that Onslow at any time visited Vienna, or that he met, or studied, there with Ludwig van Beethoven. Ch√¢teau de Chalendrat Onslow states in his autobiography that his attitude to music was transformed by his experience of hearing the overture to √âtienne M√©hul's opera Stratonice in Paris in 1801. In Onslow's own later words: \\"On hearing this piece, I experienced so lively an emotion in the depths of my soul that I sensed myself at once penetrated by feelings previously unknown to me; even today this moment is present in my thought. After this, I saw music with other eyes; the veil which had hidden its beauties from me was rent; it became the source of my most intimate joy, and the faithful companion of my life.\\"F√©tis (1841), p. 90. This led him to compose his first string quintets (Op. 1 nos. 1‚Äì3) and string quartets (Op. 4 nos. 1‚Äì3), although he had not at this stage received any composition tuition. These were published at his own expense; Onslow was always wealthy and did not need critical or financial support. The critic Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis noted that, despite his absence of training, Onslow \\"had all the leisure necessary to overcome these obstacles\\". Onslow learnt to play the cello, and to play the chamber music of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven with other local amateurs. However, aware of the need to develop his technical musical skills, in 1808 he began to study composition with Anton Reicha in Paris. At this time he also married a French heiress, Charlotte Fran√ßoise Delphine de Fontanges, by whom he was to have three children. Ch√¢teau de Bellerives, P√©rignat (demolished 1990), on an old postcard Onslow based himself near Clermont-Ferrand, initially at his father's Ch√¢teau de Chalendrat at Mirefleurs (where at the age of six he had planted many of the trees),d'Ortigue (1833), p. 151. later at Ch√¢teau de Bellerives at Perignat, La Roche-Noire. He typically visited Paris during the winter (concert) season, when his works were often performed by musicians including the violinists Pierre Baillot and Th√©ophile Tilmant, and the brothers Dancla, who gave quartet concerts.Niaux (2013). In 1824 and 1827 his first two operas, L'Alcalde de la vega and Le colporteur, were premiered at the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau in Paris under the auspices of the Op√©ra- Comique. Le colporteur was also produced in Germany, and even (in a very mangled version, in 1831), in London. In 1825 in Paris he met the 16-year-old Felix Mendelssohn, who enjoyed a performance of one of Onslow's quartets but was surprised that he was not aware of Beethoven's opera Fidelio.Todd (2003), pp. 142‚Äì143. Onslow was an early enthusiast of the music of Hector Berlioz, whose Eight scenes from Faust (1829) and overture Les francs-juges (1830) he praised.Cairns (1999), p. 324, 427. In 1829, after Onslow had commenced his quintet op. 38 (his fifteenth), he was very seriously wounded in a hunting accident, which left him partially deaf in one ear; completing the quintet in the aftermath, he named the final movements \\"Fever\\", \\"Convalescence\\" and \\"Recovery\\". The work was subtitled \\"De la Balle\\" (\\"The Bullet\\").Onslow (1835). Throughout the 1820s, Onslow's reputation continued to grow both in France and abroad as a series of trios, quartets and quintets were published. Onslow's publishers in Paris were Ignaz and Camille Pleyel. In 1818 his works began to be published in Germany by Breitkopf und H√§rtel and in Austria by C. F. Peters; the same year saw the first writings about his works by German music critics.Hagels (2009), pp. 3‚Äì5. Other German publishers, including Hoffmeister, Steiner and Simrock, followed in later years.Hagels (2009), pp. 7‚Äì9. In the 1830s, Onslow's quartets were in the repertoire of the M√ºller Quartet, which played them at the Meiningen court of Duke Bernhard II, and of the Prague-based quartet of Friedrich Pixis the younger.Stowell (2003), p. 45, 55. In 1831 Onslow was elected the second Honorary Fellow of the Philharmonic Society of London (Felix Mendelssohn had been the first). He wrote for the Society his Second Symphony, Op. 42, and continued to maintain close relations with leading London musicians including John Ella and George Frederick Anderson. In 1834, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt played Onslow's Grand Sonata for four hands Op. 22 at their debut joint performance in Paris.Hall- Swedley (2011), p. 32. From 1835 to 1838 Onslow was the President of the ' in Paris, an association founded in 1829 \\"to propagate the study and the spirit of music\\", with the intention of bringing together both amateurs and professionals.Niaux (2003), pp. 121‚Äì2. The year 1837 saw the premiere in Paris of Onslow's third (and last) opera Le duc de Guise. In 1839 Onslow founded the \\"\\" in which the √©migr√© Polish violinist Alexandre Tarnowski was very active. Performances were given of Onslow's own chamber music, and also of his opera Guise, including passages which had been cut from the Paris performances. At the instigation of Tarnowski, Onslow also hosted in Clermont-Ferrand the Polish-Jewish xylophonist and rival of Josef Gusikov, Sankson Jakubowski.Jam (2005). In 1842 Onslow's wealth increased on the death of his father-in-law, who owned extensive property. In the same year his French musical prestige was consolidated when he succeeded Luigi Cherubini as a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. Invited to the Aachen music festival in 1846, in the following year, on what may have been his last journey outside France, Onslow conducted his Fourth Symphony in Cologne, at the . During his last years he wrote a number of pieces for large chamber ensemble with piano, including quintets, a sextet (Op. 77b) and a septet (Op. 79); he also wrote a nonet (op. 77a) for strings and woodwind.\\"George Onslow Nonet\\" on Silvertrust Editions website, accessed 15 September 2014. Onslow died unexpectedly (although after a period of declining health) in Clermont-Ferrand in 1853, after taking a morning walk. Onslow was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1837. Music \\"Galerie des compositeurs dramatiques modernes\\" (1844) by Nicolas-Eustache Maurin (d. 1850). The engraving shows (back row left to right): Hector Berlioz, Gaetano Donizetti, Onslow, Daniel Auber, Mendelssohn, Henri-Montan Berton; (front row left to right): Fromental Hal√©vy, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Gaspare Spontini, Gioacchino Rossini Onslow was a prolific composer of chamber music (including 36 string quartets and 34 string quintets). He also wrote 10 piano trios, three performed operas (an early opera, Les deux oncles, remains in manuscript) and four symphonies, apart from various works for solo piano, piano duet, and sonatas for solo strings and piano. Of his string quintets, the first three (Op. 1) were written for two violins, two violas and cello, as with the quintets of Mozart. The remainder were nearly all written for two violins, one viola, and two cellos. After hearing the virtuoso double-bassist Domenico Dragonetti step in to play in a performance of his tenth quintet, Onslow began to provide in his subsequent quintets the option of replacing one of the cellos with a double-bass.\\"String Quintet No.19 in c minor, Op.44\\" on Silvertrust Editions website, accessed 15 September 2014. Onslow's emphasis on instrumental music, and his base in Clermont-Ferrand, set him apart from many French composers of his era, for whom opera was a principal aspiration ‚Äì the period after 1830, in particular, was a time when Paris led the world in grand opera. His interest in chamber ensembles and forms seemed to align him more closely with German musical traditions. Moreover, being possessed of an independent fortune, he could write for himself rather than needing to pander to the desires of audiences or impresarios. F√©tis complained in 1830: \\"Nature worked in vain to have a Haydn or a Beethoven born in France; such talent was better concealed in the capital than are diamonds deep in the earth. It was the same with chamber music such as quartets and quintets. If M. Onslow has been able to establish a fine reputation in this genre, it is because his social position renders him independent...he is still better known abroad than in France. The lack of encouragement for instrumental music, a taste for futilities, and other secondary causes which it would be too tedious to detail, have left us insensible to anything but fantasies, variations and other trivia.\\"Cited in Niaux (2009), pp. 1‚Äì2. Such comments enabled Onslow's publisher Camille Pleyel, in the same year, to promote the composer as \\"\\" (\\"our French Beethoven\\"), an epithet which was to be frequently repeated by critics,Niaux (2009), p. 2. and was also a trigger for rebuttal by those not so convinced of the similarity; as for example Paul Scudo who wrote in 1854 that to compare Onslow with Beethoven was like comparing Casimir Delavigne (a popular librettist of the time) with Shakespeare.Niaux (2009), p. 5. Indeed Onslow himself would have disowned comparison with Beethoven's late style, according to his conversation as recorded by the music journalist Joseph d'Ortigue: \\"The last quartets of Beethoven are mistakes, absurdities, the reveries of a sick genius....I would burn everything I have composed if I someday wrote anything resembling such chaos.\\"d'Ortigue (1833), p. 154. However Onslow's interest in classical forms and counterpoint, and the styles of emotional expressiveness in his music, place his music close to the works of his teacher Reicha, and to Onslow's German and Austrian contemporaries of early Romantic music, such as Moscheles, Hummel, and Schubert. In the opinion of Robert Schumann, only Onslow and Mendelssohn approached Beethoven's mastery of the quartet form.Sowell (2003), pp. 239‚Äì240. In the years after his death, Onslow's reputation progressively declined; conducting the overture to the opera L'Alcalde de la Vega in London for the Philharmonic Society in 1855, Richard Wagner found it \\"trivial\\" and threatened to quit his contract for the rest of the Society's concert series.Davison (1912), p. 170. However, from the late twentieth century onwards, commercial recordings of his music began to appear.\\"Discography\\" on the George Onslow website, accessed 18 September 2014.

It is high, and is well known for the granite quarried from it in the past. Geography and history Carn Marth lies southeast of Redruth and is part of the Carnmenellis granite plateau, the 'Carnmenellis Granite', one of several granite plutons in Cornwall that make up part of the Cornubian batholith (see also Geology of Cornwall). In prehistoric times men settled on the uplands as they had many advantages over the more densely vegetated lowlands. From the late Stone Age they have been natural places of refuge; offering easily defended bases and view points over what was the densely wooded landscape of prehistoric Britain. In early modern times they have been perfect sites to mark victories and celebrations, and to host warning beacons of impending attack such as the feared Spanish invasion of the 1580s. The hill can be seen from the hills of Bodmin Moor on a clear day, over : the reverse is also true. One can look back, up to the East past St Agnes Beacon to the hills of the Moor, Rough Tor and Brown Willy, the highest hill in Cornwall at , Carn Marth being lower at . The Celtic Sea and Bristol Channel to the north and the English Channel to the south are both easily seen. Those with keen sight or binoculars will be able to pick out St Anthony's Light at the entrance to Carrick Roads with Pendennis Castle and Falmouth opposite. Turning further west there is the glint of light on the reservoir at Stithians, then more hills, Carnmenellis and Carn Brea, with views across the Great Flat Lode and its attendant engine houses making such poignant relics of the great age of mining. Ecology The topmost parts of the Carn are clothed in lowland heath, gorse, bracken and a generous mixture of wild flowers. As one would expect this makes for an equally rich population of insects and in turn, as one moves up the food chain, there are small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and then birds being among the most visible. Cuckoos, warblers, swallows drinking on the wing in the flooded quarries, falcons soaring overhead may be seen. Lower down there are fields for grazing, their limits marked by Cornish Hedges. The Carnmarth Trust exists to care for the area. Other things by the same name Carnmarth North and Carnmarth South are deaneries of the Diocese of Truro: Carnmarth Deanery was established in 1875, the division into North and South is 20th-century. There is a song called \\"Carn Marth\\" on Richard D. James Album, by Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin.

The dock is named for one prince; the Prince Regent, only. is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is the most southerly of the docks situated in the northern part of the Liverpool dock system, connected to Prince's Half- Tide Dock to the north. The dock is now in the buffer zone to one of Liverpool's World Heritage Sites. History Initially, William Jessop and John Rennie were consulted about the plans for the dock. The dock was built by John Foster, with construction starting around 1810. During the construction, Foster ordered many times more stone than was needed. Allegedly, Foster diverted it to his family's building company. He resigned when this was discovered. The dock was named for the Prince Regent. Still unfinished, it opened on the day of the Prince Regent's coronation as George IV in 1821. Access to the southern half of the dock system was via George's Basin, George's Dock and into Canning Dock. In 1865, the Mimosa set sail from Liverpool containing 153 Welsh settlers destined for Patagonia. It is currently thought that around 50,000 people in Patagonia today have Welsh heritage from the group of 153 settlers. A monument to the settlers was unveiled at Princes Dock in 2015. In 1874 George's Basin was filled, and in 1899 George's Dock was filled and the site used to create what is now the Pier Head. On 12 June 1895 Liverpool Riverside Station was opened, situated between Prince's Dock and the River Mersey. In 1968 B&I; Line (operator of the Liverpool - Dublin service) commenced a new car ferry service from Carriers' Dock further downriver. A passenger only service continued to use Prince's Dock until 1969. Ferry services from Prince's Dock finally ended in November 1981 when P&O; Ferries closed their Liverpool - Belfast overnight service. The dock subsequently closed to shipping and was partly filled. Redevelopment 1 Princes Dock, one of the tallest buildings on the dockside The footbridge of 2001 over Prince's Dock, Liverpool Office blocks on Princes Parade North end of Prince's Dock, 7 June 2008, cut off from the rest of the dock by a new road embankment and being landfilled Commercial redevelopment began when the dock was passed to the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1988. Much of Prince's Dock's wharfage and warehouse space has been replaced by: *Three blocks of office accommodation along the river front. *The ¬£24 million Malmaison 128-room hotel. It opened in 2007 and is its owning company's first ever 'new build'. It stands alongside the existing Crowne Plaza hotel. *Three blocks of flats. The dock was partially filled in to inland canal boat depths precluding deep water vessels. The dock has been divided into two sections spanned by a pedestrian bridge that was designed by the Liverpool John Moores University Centre for Architectural Research and Consultancy Unit (CARCU). By March 2009 work was completed on a ¬£22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway. A new lock and fixed bridge was built at the northern end of Prince's Dock. At the south end of the dock, a new canal tunnel was constructed which leads to the Pier Head. The tunnel is routed beneath St. Nicholas Place and the access road for the new cruise liner facility. From Prince's Dock, the extension passes the Pier Head and terminates at Canning Dock. In 2007, planning permission was secured for the ¬£130million New World Square. This was to have incorporated an eight- storey, five-star hotel, 385 apartments and space for shops and restaurants. However, planning permission for this development expired in 2010. In 2016, planning permission was granted for the 34-storey Lexington Liverpool. Liverpool Cruise Terminal Liverpool Cruise Terminal opened in 2007. As part of their plans to increase the number of visitors to Liverpool, the city council unveiled plans in September 2017 for a new cruise terminal that would be situated on the banks of the Mersey at Prince's Dock, where the wooden landing currently stage is. The plans would allow ships carrying up to 3,600 passengers to dock in Liverpool with the facilities including dedicated passport control and a cafe. It is hoped that a multi-storey car park and hotel will be built at Prince's Dock as part of the work. Cultural references Prince's Dock is mentioned in the novel Redburn, His First Voyage by Herman Melville (1849): > \\"In magnitude, cost and durability the docks of Liverpool surpass all others > in the world... for miles you may walk along that riverside, passing dock > after dock, like a chain of immense fortresses. Prince's Dock, of > comparatively recent construction, is perhaps the largest of all and is well > known to American sailors from the fact that it is mostly frequented by the > American shipping.\\" It is also mentioned in The English at the North Pole, the first part of Jules Verne novel The Adventures of Captain Hatteras (1864).

White Jr."},{"id":"1136525","text":"Blacksad is a comic album series created by Spanish authors Juan D√≠az Canales (writer) and Juanjo Guarnido (artist), and published by French publisher Dargaud. Though both authors are Spanish, their main target audience for Blacksad is the French market and thus they publish all Blacksad volumes in French first; the Spanish edition usually follows about one month later. The first volume, Quelque part entre les ombres (literally Somewhere between the Shadows, but simply called Blacksad in the US), was published in November 2000. The second volume, Arctic-Nation, was published in 2003 and the third, √Çme Rouge (Red Soul), was published in 2005. An English translation of the third volume was delayed due to the bankruptcy of its North American publisher, iBooks. In 2010, Dark Horse Comics published all three translated volumes as one volume. The publication of this 184-page collection also coincided with the European release of the series' fourth installment, L'Enfer, le silence (literally Hell, Silence), in September 2010. In 2014, a fifth installment of the series, Amarillo, was released in various translations. The series has been translated from the original French and Spanish into Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Swedish, and Turkish. Guarnido and D√≠az Canales have received several prizes for the series, including three Eisner Award nominations in 2004, two Eisner Award wins in 2013, and an Angoul√™me Prize for Artwork. A video game adaptation of Blacksad, under the name Blacksad: Under the Skin, developed by the Spanish company Pendulo Studios, was released in 2019. Synopsis Rendered in a film noir style, the stories are set in late 1950s United States. All of the characters are anthropomorphic animals whose species reflects their personality, character type and role in the story. Animal stereotypes are often used: for example, nearly all of the policemen are canids, such as German Shepherds, Bloodhounds, and foxes, while underworld characters are often reptiles or amphibians. Female characters are often much more human- looking than their male counterparts. The strip attempts to reflect a dirty, realist outlook and a dark cinematic style through fairly clean, realistic lines. Detailed watercolor drawings, including real-life places and cities, also contribute to the realistic feel of the series, despite the fact that characters are animals. The style of drawing has evolved throughout the series, with later issues displaying sharper, higher-quality colour and fewer grainy lines. Cameos The series occasionally features anthropomorphic versions of famous people, most notably in Red Soul. Adolf Hitler is portrayed as a cat (possibly in homage to Art Spiegelman's Maus), Senator Joseph McCarthy as Senator Gallo (a rooster), Mark Rothko as Sergei Litvak (a rat), the president as an eagle, and Allen Ginsberg as Greenberg (a bison), while Otto Liebber (an owl) bears a strong resemblance to many of the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Main characters *John Blacksad ‚Äì hardboiled private investigator. A black cat, Blacksad was raised in a poor neighborhood and spent much of his youth running from the police. This and his service in World War II likely account for his above-average marksmanship and fighting skills. He also spent a year in college as a history major before being expelled. Like other hardboiled detectives, Blacksad narrates his stories, adding cynical commentary on the evils of the world around him. Unlucky in love, he never seems to be able to form a lasting relationship, often due to circumstances beyond his control. He usually wears a dark suit and trench coat, and uses the alias John H. Blackmore on several fake IDs, including debt collector, FBI agent and customs officer. *Weekly ‚Äì Blacksad's occasional sidekick. A brown least weasel who does not like soap and water and has an odor problem, he has a near-constant optimistic attitude, working as a muckraker for a tabloid called the What's News. *Smirnov ‚Äì Police commissioner and friend of Blacksad. A brown German Shepherd, Smirnov sometimes helps Blacksad to reach the rich and powerful which he himself cannot touch due to \\"pressure upstairs\\". Volumes The first three volumes listed here are released by Dark Horse Comics as a single publication titled simply Blacksad. =Somewhere Within the Shadows= Blacksad investigates the murder of the famous actress Natalia Willford, whom he used to be involved with ‚Äì first as a bodyguard, then in a more intimate capacity. His first inquiries lead him to L√©on Kronski, a screenwriter and her last known lover, who has disappeared. He finds Kronski already dead and buried under a pseudonym. After Blacksad is severely beaten by two hired thugs, the police arrest him. Smirnov, a police commissioner, explains to Blacksad that because of \\"pressure upstairs\\" he himself cannot investigate the matter any further. Smirnov offers him a deal, advantageous to both sides. As Blacksad returns home, a goanna hitman and a rat goon attempt to kill him and each other. Blacksad shoots the rat, interrogates the dying goanna and finally uncovers the culprit of the whole affair: Ivo Statoc, a frog, the richest and most powerful businessman of the city, who considers himself above any law. Statoc shot the actress himself because of her infidelity. After brutally infiltrating the office suite at the top of his skyscraper, Blacksad confronts the completely calm and cold-blooded Statoc ‚Äì who first offers him a job, and later a bribe. Blacksad rejects both offers as a matter of principle and shoots Statoc in the head. The police arrange it so it appears to be a suicide. =Arctic Nation= This volume deals with inter-racial violence and racial segregation of the 1950s in a pseudo-American suburb called The Line. The book also obliquely addresses issues of economic depression, sexual repression and perversion, all intended to expose the social malaise and prejudice that exist beneath the apparently harmonious surfaces of communities. Observing the aftermath of a lynching on a city street, Blacksad meets his future sidekick, Weekly (a least weasel). Blacksad initially rejects him due to his unpleasant smell and obnoxious behavior. It is revealed that Blacksad is working for an old elementary school teacher, Miss Grey, who has asked him to search for a young girl named Kaylie. Miss Grey believes that Kaylie was kidnapped by Arctic Nation, a racist political organization. After befriending Weekly, Blacksad is harassed in a bar by three Arctic Nation members. Their leader, Huk (a white Arctic fox), turns out to be a close friend of the local police chief, Karup (a polar bear). Blacksad and Weekly are taken before Karup, who himself is revealed to be with Arctic Nation. Blacksad confronts Kaylie's mother, Dinah, who has mysteriously failed to report her daughter's disappearance. He suggests an affair between herself and the son of Oldsmill (a white tiger), a rich white socialite, but doubts this lead when Dinah takes offense at the insinuation. Blacksad and Weekly cross paths with a violent black power organisation called the Black Claws, which were originally accused of Kaylie's abduction. They force Weekly to publish a statement denying their involvement in the kidnapping. Blacksad decides to meet Oldsmill, but discovers that Oldsmill's son is mentally handicapped and thus unlikely to have had an affair with Dinah. Meanwhile, Weekly investigates the activities of Karup's wife, Jezabel, and discovers that she is having an affair with Huk. She also has an emotional meeting with Dinah, who appears to blackmail Jezabel by threatening to reveal 'what she knows'. This compounds suspicion on Karup, who is already rumoured to be a paedophile. When Blacksad returns to Dinah's apartment, he finds out that she has been murdered. Suspecting Karup of the killing, Blacksad directly confronts him with his suspicions and reveals Jezabel's affair with Huk. In consequence, Karup attacks Huk and argues violently with Jezabel; during their t√™te-√†-t√™te, it comes to light that they have never had sex. At the violent climax, a black magpie called Cotten ‚Äì who has been complicit in Kaylie's abduction against his will ‚Äì leads Blacksad to an Arctic Nation meeting, located in a derelict war factory. There, Kaylie and Weekly ‚Äì himself kidnapped by Arctic Nation ‚Äì are hidden. Blacksad saves Weekly after Huk betrays and hangs Karup, supposedly for kidnapping and child abuse. As the factory burns and Cotten is killed by Huk, Blacksad rescues Kaylie and Weekly. Later, he finds Huk dead in his garage, stabbed in the eye with a screwdriver. Blacksad corners Jezabel after Karup's funeral, proving, through a matching birthmark, that she is Dinah's twin. Jezabel reveals that Karup was her father, and had left her black pregnant mother to die after being turned by Oldsmill's racist doctrines. Fueled by revenge, Jezabel ascended white society under a false identity, eventually marrying Karup. With Dinah hired as their maid, Jezabel seduced and manipulated Huk, using him to carry out the fake kidnapping and implicate Karup. However, Huk killed Dinah to ensure her silence, leading Jezabel to kill him in kind. Blacksad meets with Miss Grey and compliments her on her dedication towards the neighborhood's children. After the two say goodbye, Blacksad finds Kaylie sadly staring at him, and he stares back sadly as well. The book concludes by highlighting Kaylie's innocence and her ultimate abandonment, but her fate is not made clear. There are probably some discrepancies between publications. Cotten is also seen as Hewitt, Kayleigh as Kaylie, and some versions of the book end with Blacksad scattering Cotten's (Hewitt's) ashes to the wind over Las Vegas, fulfilling his last wish. =Red Soul= During the Red Scare, Blacksad is employed as a bodyguard for a rich old tortoise called Hewitt Mandeline, who goes on a gambling trip to Las Vegas. After returning home, Blacksad's last assignment is to accompany him to an art gallery, where he runs into Smirnov and his family. He finds a leaflet for a lecture given by his old school teacher, Otto Liebber, a nuclear physicist and Nobel Prize candidate. Also appearing is the wealthy, dynamic, yet idle communist Samuel Gotfield, who heads a scientific research foundation; Blacksad takes an instant dislike for Gotfield, who makes a mockery of Otto's lecture. He also meets Gotfield's fianc√©e, writer Alma Mayer. Gotfield invites Blacksad to a party at his luxurious coastal mansion along with twelve leftist intellectuals: Greenberg, a beat poet; the photographer Dora; the sculptor Klein; the actor Bill Ratcliff; the scriptwriter Jess Logan; the Russian painter Sergei Litvak; the accomplished chemist Laszlo Herzl; and Alma Mayer. After Blacksad grudgingly saves a drunken Gotfield from drowning, with the help of Otto's close friend Otero, Herzl angrily accuses Otto of promoting nuclear weapons. When Otero gets back home, he is killed by a mysterious assassin (a gavial). It seems he actually meant to kill Otto. Blacksad and Alma ‚Äì who plans to spend her honeymoon with Gotfield at Niagara Falls ‚Äì begin to have feelings for each other. Blacksad decides to follow Otto, saving him from a car bomb planted by the assassin. However, he fails to stop the goon from escaping or a traumatised Otto from leaving the scene. Smirnov informs Blacksad that the assassin is a highly regarded hit man known as Ribs, and that his bomb was chemically complex. Suspecting that Herzl might have hired Ribs, Blacksad confronts him. To his surprise, Herzl is a Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter who shows him photographic proof that Otto used to work for the Third Reich. Stricken with this new information, Blacksad seeks solace from Alma, only to learn that she has been arrested by the FBI after being inexplicably betrayed by Gotfield. When FBI agents visit Litvak in his studio, they accidentally kill him while using truth serum to ask about Otto's whereabouts. Otto, meanwhile, has returned to his old neighborhood ‚Äì the same neighborhood where Blacksad grew up ‚Äì only to find it overcome by poverty and his father's church a ruin. Suffering a personal crisis, Otto hides at the city aquarium, where Blacksad himself once hid as a child. Blacksad rescues Alma from the FBI, taking shelter in Weekly's apartment. Falling in love with Alma, Blacksad promises to take her to Niagara Falls, which to her is an important act of commitment. Blacksad then finds a fatalistic Otto, who admits that his efforts to reduce the world's suffering have only left it worse than before. He also admits to conspiring with Litvak to hand over American nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Blacksad soon realizes that Litvak had copied Otto's information onto a canvas and then painted over it as a disguise. When Blacksad goes to the shipyards, he finds out that the painting is bound for an art exhibition in East Berlin. Blacksad manages to re-route the painting to Australia. As Blacksad prepares to travel to Niagara Falls, the FBI arrests him and plant fake evidence in Litvak's death. He is interrogated by the demagogue Senator Gallo about Otto's current location. After he is released, Blacksad confronts Gotfield and learns that he betrayed Alma in order to win Senator Gallo's patronage and become part of a selected group of people who will be evacuated to a special government shelter in the event of a nuclear war. Finding proof in Gotfield's safe, Blacksad uses it to blackmail Senator Gallo into dropping his frame-up. The government fakes Otto's death and allows him to leave the country. Blacksad gives the proof to Weekly in a sealed envelope, with instructions to publish the contents if anything happens to him. Otto writes Blacksad a letter, explaining that he has returned to Germany and is helping rebuild a post-war community. Alma, however, abandons Blacksad after she reads the (fake) story in the newspaper that Liebber committed suicide after Blacksad turned him in. In her mind, Blacksad is now as much a traitor as Gotfield. Blacksad tries to find her again, but she has vanished. =A Silent Hell= The fourth Blacksad album is a murder mystery set in the jazz scene of New Orleans. It has been translated into several European languages and released in the United States by Dark Horse Comics as Blacksad: A Silent Hell. Notably, the story of the album unfolds in non-chronological order. The story alternates between day scenes and night scenes: the night scenes take place during a single night and are the culmination of the story, and the day scenes depict events that took place over several weeks before that night. Blacksad and Weekly travel to New Orleans to meet Faust LaChapelle (a goat), a failed musician who found success signing more talented yet less fortunate musicians to record labels. They learn that LaChapelle has terminal cancer, and is being treated by Ms. Gibraltar, a vodou priestess. LaChapelle begs Blacksad to find Sebastian \\"Little Hand\\" Fletcher (a Boxer), who ‚Äì despite having one arm smaller than the other ‚Äì was the most successful musician he ever signed. Fletcher has gone missing, and LaChapelle is concerned that his addiction to heroin has something to do with it. Blacksad and Weekly accept the case. The pair soon meet Leeman (a hippopotamus), the last detective who was hired to find Fletcher. He proposes they all work together, but Blacksad is put off by his reckless driving and alcoholism. Blacksad tracks down and roughs up Fletcher's drug dealer, who admits that a masked individual paid him to sell poisoned heroin to Fletcher. Later, Blacksad meets LaChapelle's son, Thomas, who has formed a friendship with Fletcher's pregnant wife, Hannah. The two get on well until Thomas asks Blacksad to give up the case for his father's sake; he believes Fletcher is a bad influence, and his father is wasting his money trying to find him when he could be saving it for his cancer treatment. Disappointed, Blacksad walks out. The conversation does lead him to ponder if Thomas cares for Hannah more than a friend and may be jealous of Fletcher's attentions. Later, Blacksad finds Thomas and Hannah as she gives birth to Fletcher's son. Despite Thomas' insistence that he leave her alone, he questions her as to her husband's whereabouts. Hannah states that Fletcher was supposed to perform his newest song that night, but that LaChapelle had been enraged when he found out. Meanwhile, Weekly discovers that some of Fletcher's friends seem to have been mysteriously murdered in staged suicides, causing Blacksad to fear that someone might be after Sebastian's life as well. At a nightclub, Fletcher performs his new song, detailing how he had become congenitally deformed and many others had died due to a carcinogenic flu balm that was being sold in his hometown by the mysterious \\"Dr. Dupre\\", and how bureaucratic payoffs kept Dupre from prison once he was found out. LaChapelle saved them from poverty by signing them all to a successful band. However, the afflictions eventually caught up with them, leading them to lives full of addiction and death; now, only Fletcher is left to tell the tale. Blacksad discovers that Leeman is responsible for killing Fletcher's friends, planning to blackmail LaChapelle with the truth of what happened in Fletcher's hometown. When Blacksad confronts LaChapelle in his house, he confesses to being Dupre and admits that he is suffering from a rare genetic disorder rather than cancer. He has been investing money in medical research to find a cure, so that his son might one day have healthy children to carry on his legacy. It is also implied that he had the drug dealer poison Fletcher to prevent him from performing the new song that would ruin LaChapelle. Weekly appears and urgently informs Blacksad of Fletcher's whereabouts. Blacksad arrives to find that Fletcher has died of the strychnine-laden heroin. It also appears that LaChapelle's plans may go in vain as Fletcher was able to perform (though its unknown if any will connect the story to LaChapelle or not). As for Thomas has no interest in his father's money or interest in having children, thus most likely meaning his bloodline will end with him. Afterwards, Blacksad sees Thomas and Hannah at Fletcher's funeral, and they nod to each other in respect. At the end its revealed in his conversation with Weekly, that Blacksad gave Thomas their payment for the case. To which Blacksad replies \\"he'll need it\\". Its unknown if he meant by his apparent genetic disorder or that LaChapelle's deeds will come full surface. =Amarillo= In this fifth Blacksad album, it takes place near the ending of the 1950s. Chad (a lion), a writer, travels the road as a vagrant with his on- again-off-again friend Abraham (a bison), a poet, who appears earlier in the Blacksad story, then referred to simply as Greenberg. Abe is extremely volatile towards Chad and his interactions with him lean from harassing to almost sociopathic bullying. Abe views his vocation more romantically than Chad, who sees writing as his career and a means to money, and Abe accuses Chad of not having a true passion like he does. Abe takes his collection of poems he was about to publish and burns them, and encourages the appalled Chad to do the same with his next novel's manuscript, to give it a \\"proper ending\\". Blacksad is happy to be taking a well-earned vacation, staying behind in New Orleans for a while, while Weekly returns home to New York. He lands a side- job when a rich Texan asks him to drive his prized car to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he is flying. Blacksad accepts, enjoying the free road trip. At a pit- stop, two hitch-hikers (who we see are Chad and Abe) steal the prized car and Blacksad, with the help of a street gang, motorcycles after them, hoping to catch them on their way to Amarillo. Meanwhile, Chad and Abe party with Abe's friend, Billy (a flamingo)‚Äîa mobster. In front of all of Billy's friends, Abe humiliates Chad by saying he is afraid of the cops and has no guts, forcing him to prove it by shooting a shotglass off of Abe's head. Chad cannot do it, however, and the entire bar laughs at him. Later on, into the wee hours, Chad, Abe and Billy sit smoking, drinking and talking. Abe drops into the discussion that he has mailed Chad's manuscript off to some place in Tibet, and Chad is instantly infuriated‚Äîthat novel was his ticket out of the vagrant life, and out of relying on Abe to live. Billy and Abe laugh, until Chad finally takes the gun from earlier and shoots Abe out of vengeance. Horrified, Chad flees in Blacksad's prized car. He crashes it into a post box, and retrieves his manuscript. Blacksad parts ways with the bike gang in Amarillo and runs into Neal Beato (a hyena), a litigious, suspicious lawyer while he woos a potential client into suing his boss, a circus owner, for replacing him unlawfully. Overhearing their conversation, Blacksad suggests they are after the same person, and they travel to catch up with the circus where Chad is indeed working. Meanwhile, Chad struggles to fit in, and makes friends with one of the performers, a beautiful and mysterious psychic named Luanne (a Siamese cat), but is warned about becoming close to her by one of the clowns, the massive and imposing Polyphemus (a bear). Later that night during a performance, before Luanne is to go out and perform her act, Chad catches Polyphemus attempting to rape Luanne and while Chad and him fight, she stabs him in the neck. It is an uproar as the circus members apprehend the fleeing Chad and after the show finishes, decide the best way to deal with the tragedy is to abandon Chad and Polyphemus' body in the wilderness. Luanne however has tagged along unbeknownst to them and she and Chad escape on the road, to repay Chad for not ratting her out and with mutual thanks they catch a train to start a new life‚Äîbut Elmore (a koala), the circus leader, finds out they have escaped. Blacksad and Neal make a stop at Blacksad's sister's (Donna) church, and borrow a car from her and her enthusiastic little son (Ray). Eventually the both of them catch up with the circus. Blacksad questions Elmore about Chad, but Elmore lies and betrays Blacksad to the police. After escaping, Blacksad follows and eavesdrops on Elmore as he tries to kill Chad by throwing him off the moving train, however Elmore misses and plummets to his death. Blacksad sees Chad and Luanne embrace, and realizes what has happened. At a Greyhound Bus depot in Chicago, Blacksad and Neal arrange for Luanne to stay with Blacksad's sister for a while. Neal promises to represent Chad and get him off with less than a year for the manslaughter of Abe, and help him publish his manuscript‚Äîthe fabulous payout from Chad's manuscript will make both of them rich. However, out of guilt, Chad has thrown the manuscript away, comparing it to toilet paper. Neal is outraged, and their loud arguing attracts a crowd. Chad tries to stop Neal from walking away, but in grabbing his coat, accidentally imbalances Neal into the road and he is violently hit by one of the buses. Blacksad runs to the ensuing commotion and sees Chad, distraught, holding the bleeding and broken body of Neal in his arms. While the crowd murmurs that Chad pushed him, Neal's last words mention how he fell in love with Blacksad's sister from the moment he saw her. Blacksad and Chad flee. He finds Luanne as she is about to leave and insists Chad go with her, and lie low for a while, while he deals with the police. Blacksad approaches, and is about to be handcuffed... when Chad stops them, and confesses everything, hoping to atone for what he has done. Blacksad returns to New York, eager to get back to work, and water his plants. Meanwhile, in a bathroom stall back in the Chicago Greyhound Bus depot, a well-to-do man finds an abandoned manuscript in the bathroom, and is engrossed in reading it. The American version features an introduction by Neal Adams, who co-translated the book into English. =Future volumes= The sixth and seventh volumes were supposed to have been released in French in 2016. In 2019, both volumes 6 and 7 were ready to be published in France. English translations will follow but no release date has been confirmed. Commentary A 'behind the scenes' book has already been compiled, with author commentary, called Blacksad: The Sketch Files. Film version In 2006 Variety reported that a movie adaptation of Blacksad was in development. To be produced by Thomas Langmann and directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk), it was originally scheduled for a 2009 release. Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha 3D) had also expressed interest in directing the film, which was reportedly budgeted around $100 million. Video game adaptation Blacksad: Under the Skin is an adventure video game developed by Pendulo Studios and published by Micro√Øds. It was released on November 5, 2019 on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, with a Switch release scheduled for December 10, 2019. The idea of adapting Blacksad into a game was proposed by Micro√Øds to Pendulo, as the publisher is owned by the same media conglomerate as Blacksad publisher Dargaud. The developer opted to create an original story not based on any particular Blacksad installment, but still took influence and inspiration from the existing series. The game was announced in July 2017, and its first teaser trailer was revealed in August 2018. By February 2019, the game had been in production for roughly two years. It was released on November 14, 2019, and a Nintendo Switch port of the game was released on December 10, 2019 to mostly positive critical reviews regarding its faithful atmosphere, though it suffers from some bugs.

They have released six full-length studio albums and have toured internationally, including performances on the Warped Tour. They are notable for their singles \\"Seein' Red\\" and \\"Save Me (Wake Up Call),\\" both of which entered the top 5 in the US Modern Rock charts. Their latest studio album, Swan, was released in 2011. History =Formation and early years (1990‚Äì1996)= Unwritten Law was formed in Poway, California in 1990. Original drummer Wade Youman generally takes credit for starting the band. The band was founded by Youman, vocalist Chris Mussey, guitarist Matt Rathje, and bassist Craig Winters. A number of players came and went before the lineup coalesced to include Scott Russo on vocals, Steve Morris and Rob Brewer on guitar, and Jeff Brehm on bass. They released their first cassette demo on September 9, 1992, known as Six Song Demo. The lineup changed once again, and they released the 7\\" vinyl single Blurr in 1993. The band quickly established themselves in the prolific San Diego music scene of the early 1990s that also included groups such as Blink-182, Agent 51, Buck-O-Nine, Sprung Monkey, One by One, Drive Like Jehu, and Rocket from the Crypt. In 1994 the band recorded their first album, Blue Room, which was released by local label Red Eye Records. It established their early sound of fast-paced punk rock and gave them the opportunity to build their reputation by playing local shows in and around the San Diego area. Songs such as \\"CPK,\\" \\"Shallow,\\" and \\"Suzanne\\" would become favorites with local fans and would remain in their live set for years to come. =Major label signing (1996‚Äì1999)= Blue Room attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band to a recording contract. Their second album, Oz Factor, was released in 1996. The songs \\"Denied\\" and \\"Superman\\" received airplay on several southern California rock radio stations and were released as singles. Over the next year the band toured the United States with bands such as Blink-182 and Pennywise. By 1997 Unwritten Law had signed to Interscope Records and bassist John Bell had left the band. Pivit bassist Micah Albao joined them in Seattle for the recording of their self-titled album Unwritten Law which was released in 1998. The singles \\"Lonesome,\\" \\"Cailin,\\" and \\"Teenage Suicide\\" became minor hits on rock radio stations. Pat \\"PK\\" Kim, formerly of Sprung Monkey, joined as their new permanent bass player and the band embarked on the Vans Warped Tour, which took them across North America, Europe, and Australia. In Australia the band developed an enthusiastic and dedicated following, and they would return there over the next few years and release several singles and live recordings exclusive to the country. =Elva, Here's to the Mourning (2000‚Äì2005)= The band spent a considerable amount of time recording and preparing their next release, 2002's Elva. also kown as the best album they have released yet. The album was a stylistic change of pace, deliberately moving away from their established punk rock formula and towards a more accessible hard rock sound. The lead single \\"Up All Night\\" became somewhat popular, but it was \\"Seein' Red\\" and its accompanying music video which brought the band their greatest success, reaching No. 1 on US modern rock charts. They toured extensively in support of the album alongside bands such as Sum 41 and The Used. In 2003 the band was invited by VH1 to film an episode of the live acoustic series Music in High Places. The invitation happened somewhat by accident, as the station was hoping to attract Jimmy Eat World but contacted Unwritten Law's management by mistake. The band recorded a set of acoustic performances in various locales at Yellowstone National Park. They prepared the recordings for release as an album, but Interscope declined to release it. The band ended their contract with Interscope and signed to Lava Records, who released Music in High Places as an album. The performance was also released as a DVD entitled Live in Yellowstone. The song \\"Rest of My Life\\" from this performance received airplay on modern rock radio stations nationwide. The band's song Celebration Song was featured in the soundtracks of Need For Speed: Underground 2 and MX vs ATV Unleashed. Shortly after the release of Music in High Places founding drummer Wade Youman was ejected from the band due to personal and professional issues. Wade later went on to Join The Rattlesnake Aces. For the recording of their next album Here's to the Mourning drummers Adrian Young of No Doubt and Tony Palermo of Pulley joined the band in the studio. The band got along so well with Palermo that by the time of the album's release in 2005 he had joined as their permanent drummer. Much of the lyrics on the album were co-written by singer Scott Russo's girlfriend Aimee Allen, with whom he formed the side project Scott & Aimee. Allen and Linda Perry contributed to the writing of the album's lead single \\"Save Me (Wake Up Call),\\" which reached No. 5 on US modern rock charts. This was followed by the single \\"She Says.\\" In March 2005 guitarist Rob Brewer was fired from Unwritten Law after a physical altercation on stage with Russo. Russo and other band members collectively decided to remove Brewer from the band. The band chose not to replace him and continued on as a 4-piece. They continued to tour in support of Here's to the Mourning across the United States as well as internationally. = Best of Compilation, Live and Lawless and Swan (2006‚Äì2012) = Unwritten Law spent much of 2006 recording a \\"best of\\" album entitled The Hit List, which was released on January 2, 2007 by Abydos Records. It includes 17 of the band's most popular songs, most of which were re-recorded by the current lineup, as well as 2 new songs including lead single \\"Shoulda Known Better.\\" Interscope also released a \\"best of\\" compilation entitled 20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection which includes songs from the albums Unwritten Law and Elva. On January 3, 2007 the band performed \\"Shoulda Known Better\\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That July the band embarked on a North American tour in support of The Hit List, with Scott & Aimee drummer Dylan Howard filling in for roughly half the tour while Palermo stayed home with his wife, who was due to give birth. Also during 2007, Palermo acted as fill-in touring drummer for Papa Roach. In March 2008 it was announced that Palermo had joined Papa Roach permanently. Meanwhile, Unwritten Law, with new drummer Dylan Howard, filmed a live DVD at the Key Club in Hollywood, California in March 2008. The album, titled Live and Lawless, was released September 30, 2008 through Suburban Noize Records. Unwritten Law's sixth studio album, Swan, was also released through Suburban Noize on March 29, 2011. On January 24, 2011, Unwritten Law posted on their Myspace page the first single from their new album called \\"Starships and Apocalypse.\\" They have also been confirmed to play the 2011 Warped Tour. Guitarist Steve Morris and bassist Pat Kim left Unwritten Law at the end of their Swan Tour in 2011 due to a physical altercation between Scott Russo and Morris. This was kept silent for a few months until after the band finished touring with Warped Tour, although Morris and Kim did not tour with them. Derik Envy, formerly of Red Light Sky, and Kevin Besignano, formerly of Bullets and Octane, had become the permanent replacements for Kim and Morris, respectively. =Lineup changes and Acoustic (2013‚Äìpresent)= In 2013, founding drummer, Wade Youman, returned to Unwritten Law, after a reconciliation with Scott Russo. Following Youman's return, Derik Envy and Kevin Besignano both left the band, being replaced with Johnny Grill (Russo's younger brother) and Chris Lewis (Fenix TX), respectively. While performing at Capitol in Perth, Western Australia on 18 May 2014, the band ignored requests to stop playing after the venue's midnight curfew had passed, forcing the venue to cut the power on stage. Frontman Scott Russo and drummer Wade Youman subsequently destroyed a hired DW Collector's Series drum kit. Unwritten Law released a new compilation album called Acoustic on Cyber Track Records on April 1, 2016 on June 19, 2019 drummer Wade Youman posted on Facebook that he left the band again and was replaced on drums for four shows by RJ Shankle and then on January 27, 2020 Behind Crimson Eyes drummer Dan Kerby posted on Instagram that he would be filling in on drums for shows in Australia.

Low, wife of Rear Admiral Low, and commissioned 26 October 1944, Commander H. B. Dodge in command. Brill departed New London 7 December 1944 and arrived at Pearl Harbor 8 January 1945. Her war operations extended from 28 January to 9 August 1945 during which time she completed three war patrols in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. Brill made few contacts worthy of torpedo fire during her three patrols and consequently had to settle with the damaging of an unidentified ship of approximately 1000 tons as her only score.

The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25 days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September 6 to October 3\\\\. Twenty of those days (September 11 ‚Äì September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). On September 14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September 23\\\\. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage. While over the western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September 30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10 million (1971 US dollars, $ USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside North Carolina. Ginger has the highest accumulated cyclone energy for a hurricane below major hurricane strength in the Atlantic basin, at 44.2. Meteorological history Path of Hurricane Ginger, beginning near the Bahamas, extending out to the middle Atlantic Ocean, and curving back to hit the United States Hurricane Ginger originated in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted for several days in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also led to the formation of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas. After forming, the depression moved slowly southeastward for about 24 hours before turning to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, the depression turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm of the year in the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status. This ESSA 9 weather satellite image of Hurricane Ginger was taken on September 27, 1971 at 1904 UTC For about six days, Ginger maintained minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained an unusually large eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned to the south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast. For three days, beginning on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane as part of Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane to be a part of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. See p. 507. By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1\\\\. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5. Preparations The threat of the hurricane in Bermuda prompted the British Royal Navy to evacuate a ship, and also resulted in two cruise ships leaving early. The United States military also evacuated some planes and secured the units that remained. Officials closed all of the island's schools during Ginger's passage. Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the American Red Cross set up 28 emergency shelters in six counties, where about 5,500 people stayed during the storm. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Virginia Beach, Virginia, with gale warnings extending northward to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. United States military officials evacuated planes and ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, in addition to flying planes down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm. Ferry services around the Outer Banks were canceled during the storm's passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses. Impact Rainfall from Ginger As the hurricane passed south of Bermuda on September 23, it produced heavy waves, as well as gale force winds for 17 hours. Naval Air Station Bermuda reported peak gusts of 75 mph (120 km/h). There was no reported damage, and the hurricane's passage failed to alleviate persistent drought conditions. While Ginger was still in the vicinity of Bermuda, it produced high swells and riptides along the East Coast of the United States, prompting the issuing of small craft warnings from Florida to North Carolina. Wave heights reached in Sebastian, Florida, and one person was killed in St. Augustine from drowning. There were also initial reports of two missing people in Neptune Beach, Florida, but they were not listed as casualties in the year-end hurricane summary. As it moved ashore in North Carolina, Ginger produced a storm tide of around along the Outer Banks and up to in Pamlico Sound. The storm dropped heavy rainfall peaking at in Bodie Island along the Outer Banks, making Ginger among the wettest tropical cyclones in the state. Rainfall from the storm extended southwestward into South Carolina, where precipitation reached in Cheraw. In Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, wind gusts reached , the highest associated with Ginger in the United States. The hurricane had a large wind field upon moving ashore, affecting a large portion of North Carolina; one county official considered Ginger the largest storm in the region since 1936. Aerial view of a beach in North Carolina after Ginger Strong winds from Ginger damaged store fronts and windows, and also downed power lines and trees. Morehead City, where the hurricane moved ashore, lost power and had debris strewn across the streets. The nearby cities of New Bern, Beaufort, and Atlantic Beach also lost power, and one company had 6,000 customers without power. Heavy rainfall caused the Neuse and Trent rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding. Several oil tanks along the rivers broke open, creating dangerous boating conditions. Up to of water from the Pungo River flooded most of the city of Belhaven, and similar flooding occurred in Washington, entering dozens of buildings and houses. Across the region, the combination of high winds, tides, and flooding closed several bridges and roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 70. The winds also destroyed several mobile homes, although coastal damage was less than expected. During Ginger's passage, the Salvation Army and Red Cross provided more than 3,000 people with food assistance. Further inland, the combination of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3 million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to about half of the crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24 counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10 million (1971 USD, $ USD), of which about $1 million (1971 USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger. As the storm crossed into Virginia, it continued to produce heavy rainfall, including a total of in Norfolk. Near the border between Virginia and North Carolina, the storm produced tides of up to above normal. Gusty winds of over downed a few trees, causing scattered power outages. Above-normal tides and waves caused moderate to heavy beach erosion in Virginia Beach. Further north, Ginger produced above-normal tides, light winds, and scattered rainfall along the Delmarva Peninsula and northward through New York. Record longevity Hurricane Ginger formed on September 6 and lasted until October 3, for a total of 27.25 days. Its duration surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days. In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin. Ginger spent 20 days as a hurricane from September 11 to September 30, one of the longest durations on record at that intensity. In addition, Ginger co-existed with several other tropical cyclones, including on September 11 when there were four named storms at the same time, a rare occurrence; the others were Hurricane Edith, Hurricane Fern, and Tropical Storm Heidi.

Origin Cats with dark blue eyes were discovered in New Mexico among feral cat populations. The first cat, discovered in 1984, was a tortoiseshell named Cornflower. She was bred to males without the trait, which proved to be dominant, as all her kittens showed it. The breed was founded and named Ojos Azules, Spanish for 'Blue Eyes'. =Genes= Ojos Azules are remarkable for their deep blue eyes. Unlike the blue eyes seen linked to the genes in bicolor cats, and cats with point coloration, both of which suppress pigmentation, this gene is not linked to any certain fur color or pattern, giving the opportunity to have cats with dark coats and blue eyes. The depth of color in the eyes is greater even than that seen in a Siamese (cat) and does not cause squinting, deafness or cross- eye. One indicator of the Ojos gene is a flattened tail-tip. Following a genetic investigation by Solveig Pflueger, breeding resumed in a small way with attempts to breed Ojos Azules without the lethal genetic defects. It was discovered that when the gene is homozygous it causes cranial deformities, white fur, a small curled tail, and stillbirth. However, when the gene is heterozygous, those lethal genetic mutations do not manifest. The result is that breeders must cross the blue-eyed cats with non-blue-eyed cats, assuring a litter of about 50/50 blue/non-blue-eyed kittens. Although the eye color is described as having depth \\"even greater even than that seen in a Siamese (cat)\\" it, in fact, does not. The blue color seen in cats is due to the same physical phenomenon, the absence of melanin in the iris.THIBOS L, N; LEVICK W, R; MORSTYN R. ‚ÄúOCULAR PIGMENTATION IN WHITE AND SIAMESE CATS.‚Äù Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, v. 19 issue 5, 1980, p. 475-486. The cause of the absence of pigment differs between Siamese, white cats, and Ojos but the end result is pigment loss and blue eyes. The depth of color of the blue eyes is due to currently unknown polygenetic variations. The depth of eye color can be selected for in breeding programs and current show Siamese have extremely deep eye color. =Registration and popularity= Ojos Azules are a very rare breed. The first cat of that type was found in 1980. In 1992, only ten were known. The breed, in both short and long hair variety, was accepted for registration by TICA in 1991. The TICA Ojos Azules Breed Group Standard is dated 5 January 2004. Only cats expressing the deep blue eye gene have been called Ojos Azules. It was recently discovered that cranial defects may be linked to the gene, and breeding was temporarily suspended. Description =Physical characteristics= The medium-sized Ojos Azules is known for its bluish eyes, which are large and round. The neck is arched. The tail is proportionate to the cat's body. The head is somewhat triangular in inscribe. It has a slightly rounded forehead and an angular muzzle. The nose has a slight break. The coat is short, fine, soft, silky, and shiny. The undercoat is not particularly developed, but most are dense in color. All colors are allowed. White markings are common on most extremities (tip of the tail, muzzle, and paws). However, belly spots or chest spots are not acceptable and are considered faults. In particular, they have a white tail tip. Solid white coats are not desirable, as they cannot be distinguished from common white blue-eyed cats. Note that white blue-eyed Ojos Azules are not deaf like most common white blue-eyed cats. In addition, other than cats of the Ojos Azules breed, only white or colorpoint cats can have blue eyes. =Personality= Little is known about this breed, due to its rarity, but some have been known to be active, friendly, and affectionate. They are also easy to groom and do not require much brushing.

Similar in size, shape and design to the paper currency of the United States, most bills bear the image of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Dumbo and/or a drawing of one of the landmarks of the Disneyland Resort or Walt Disney World Resort. The currency is accepted at the company's United States theme parks, the Disney cruise ships, the Disney Store and at certain parts of Castaway Cay, Disney's private island in the Caribbean. Disney Dollars come in series of A and D, the former created for the Disneyland Resort in southern California and the latter for the Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida. In 2005, both resorts released a $50 bill designed by Disney artist Charles Boyer to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. After 2004, they also issued T series for the Disney Stores. Special editions were sometimes sold to Disney cast members as a form of incentive. The currency was discontinued by Disney on May 14, 2016. History  Disney Dollars were first used in Disneyland May 5, 1987,Canadian Coin News, July 21, 1987, Volume 25, Number 6. Page 2. while Walt Disney World started with the currency being used at Epcot on October 2.Canadian Coin News, October 27, 1987, Volume 25, Number 13. Page 1. The bills originally came in $1 and $5 denominations. In 1990, Disney added a $10 bill, issued to commemorate the 35th Anniversary of the opening of Disneyland. In 1992, Disney Stores started using the scrip. For Mickey Mouse's 65th birthday in 1993, a special $1 Disney dollar was issued. Every Disney Dollar was signed by \\"treasurer\\" Scrooge McDuck, and had an image of Tinker Bell on the front. Use The bills are redeemable for goods or services at the Disney theme parks, the Disney cruise ships, Disney's Castaway Cay port of call and the Disney Stores, unless indications to the contrary are printed on the individual bills. However, they are not compatible with coin machines, and must be exchanged for U.S. currency if machines are to be used. In addition, if Disney Dollars are used for purchases and change is given, the change is provided in U.S. currency. They are often kept as souvenirs or collected by Disney memorabilia fans, but at Disney resorts, they can also be exchanged back to U.S. currency. Disney stopped distributing and printing the currency on May 14, 2016; however, they will still accept them in the future. Security features Disney Dollars are created with anti-counterfeiting features such as microprinting, and hard to scan/copy reflective ink and imprinting on the front and back of the bill. In addition, the bills are printed with serial numbers and letters which are unique to each bill. The Dollars have small bits of glitter scattered on them.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Nebraska from 1943 until his death in 1951; he was the minority leader for the last two years. Early life Wherry was born in Liberty, Nebraska, to David Emery and Jessie (n√©e Comstock) Wherry. He received his early education at public schools in Pawnee City, and graduated from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln (where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity) in 1914. From 1915 to 1916, he studied business administration at Harvard Business School. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy Flying Corps (1917‚Äì18). Following his military service, Wherry began a business career selling automobiles, furniture, and livestock; he was also a licensed undertaker with offices in Nebraska and Kansas. He also studied law and, after being admitted to the bar, entered private practice in Pawnee City. Political career Wherry entered politics as a member of Pawnee City's city council, serving in 1927 and 1929. He was the mayor from 1929 to 1931, simultaneously serving as a member of the state senate from 1929 to 1932. Wherry was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for governor in 1932 and for U.S. Senator in 1934. In 1938, Wherry was again elected mayor of Pawnee City, serving until he left for Washington and the U.S. Senate. He was chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party from 1939 to 1942, and Western Director for the Republican National Committee from 1941 to 1942. =U.S. Senator= In 1942, Wherry was elected to the U.S. Senate, unseating incumbent George W. Norris. He was reelected in 1948 and served until his death. He served as Republican whip from 1944 to 1949 and minority leader from 1949 to 1951. He was also one of the few postwar politicos to see the plight of the defeated Germans. \\"The American people should know once and for all that as a result of this government‚Äôs official policy they are being made...accomplices in the crime of mass starvation...Germany is the only nation subjected to a deliberate starvation policy...\\" In 1945, Wherry was among the seven senators who opposed full U.S. entry into the United Nations. Wherry also backed, with Senator Homer Capehart of Indiana, legislation for building military family housing in the post-World War II era, when there were critical shortages of such housing. Wherry represented the isolationist views of his large German-American constituency. He intensely opposed international activities by the federal government, including entry into World War II, the Cold War, and Korea. He vigorously opposed any loans or aid to Europe, including the Marshall Plan. He did not believe that the Soviet Union threatened Nebraska's interests, and he strongly opposed the Truman Doctrine, and NATO. Whatever the issue, he could be counted on as a strong opponent of the presidency of Harry Truman. Bernard Lemelin, \\"Isolationist Voices in the Truman Era: Nebraska Senators Hugh Butler and Kenneth Wherry.\\" Great Plains Quarterly 37.2 (2017): 83-109. Wherry was the unsuccessful leader in the fight to block the Marshall Plan in Congress in early 1948. Congress, under the control of conservative Republicans, agreed to the program itself and the funding for multiple reasons. The 20-member conservative isolationist wing of the party was led by Wherry. He was outmaneuvered by the internationalist wing, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. Wherry and his men argued that it would be \\"a wasteful \\"operation rat-hole\\"; that it made no sense to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential. Vandenberg admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator Robert A. Taft, the most prominent conservative, hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however it was \\"absolutely necessary\\" in \\"the world battle against communism.\\" In the end only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948.John C. Campbell, The United States in World affairs: 1947-1948 (1948) pp 500-505; quotes on pages 504, 505. Wherry was openly opposed to homosexuals, telling Max Lerner in a 1950 interview that \\"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives\\" and \\"But look Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\\"Lerner, Max, The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313‚Äì316 He also publicized the fear that Adolf Hitler had given Joseph Stalin a list of closeted homosexuals which he believed Stalin would use to blackmail them into becoming Soviet spies.Von Hoffman, Nicholas, Citizen Cohn Doubleday, 1988, pp 130 In the spring of 1950, Wherry joined Senator Lister Hill, a Democrat from Alabama, in a Congressional investigation of homosexuals in government, particularly the Department of State. He was particularly concerned with communist influence, saying \\"Only the most na√Øve could believe that the Communists' fifth column in the United States would neglect to propagate and use homosexuals to gain their treacherous ends.\\" = Buchenwald concentration camp = On April 11, 1945, US forces liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp, which was established in 1937 and caused the deaths of at least 56,545 people. General Eisenhower left rotting corpses unburied so a visiting group of U.S. legislators could truly understand the horror of the atrocities. This group was visiting Buchenwald to inspect the camp and learn firsthand about the enormity of the Nazi Final Solution and treatment of other prisoners. Wherry visited the camp along with Alben W. Barkley, Ed Izac, John M. Vorys, Dewey Short, C. Wayland Brooks, General Omar N. Bradley, and journalists Joseph Pulitzer, Norman Chandler, William I. Nichols and Julius Ochs Adler.. Death Wherry died in Washington in 1951 at age 59, while serving as Republican Floor Leader. Recovering from abdominal surgery a few weeks earlier, he felt ill and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and died of pneumonia several hours later. Incidentally, the fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska's Class 2 seat, which lasted from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1955, was unusual in that it saw six Senators serve; Wherry was the first of these.

It gave rise to the terms Brum (a shortened version of Brummagem) and Brummie (applied to inhabitants of the city, their accent and dialect). \\"Brummagem\\" and \\"Brummagem ware\\" are also terms for cheap and shoddy imitations, in particular when referring to mass-produced goods. This use is archaic in the UK, but persists in some specialist areas in the US and Australia. History The word appeared in the Middle Ages as a variant on the older and coexisting form of Birmingham (spelled Bermingeham in Domesday Book), and was in widespread use by the time of the Civil War. =17th century= The term's pejorative use appears to have originated with the city's brief 17th-century reputation for counterfeited groats. Birmingham's expanding metal industries included the manufacture of weapons. In 1636, one Benjamin Stone petitioned that a large number of swords, which he claimed to have made, should be purchased for the use in the King's service; but in 1637, the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, in London, countered this by stating that these were actually \\"bromedgham blades\\" and foreign blades, and that the former \\"are no way serviceable or fit for his Majesty's store\\".Calendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I, page 105, paragraph 47 at archive.orgWelch, Charles History of the Cutlers' Company of London and of Minor Cutlery Crafts: From 1500 to modern times, 1923Hayward, John F. English Swords 1600‚Äì1650 at myArmoury.com John F. Hayward,Contributing Authors at myArmoury.com an experienced historian on swords, suggests that London's snobbery towards these blades at that time \\"may have been due to\\" commercial rivalry; at that time London was the largest provider of weapons in Britain, and Birmingham was fast becoming a viable commercial threat to their trade.Hayward, John F. English Swords 1600‚Äì1650 at myArmoury.com The word passed into political slang in the 1680s. The Protestant supporters of the Exclusion Bill were called by their opponents Birminghams or Brummagems (a slur, in allusion to counterfeiting, implying hypocrisy). Their Tory opponents were known as anti-Birminghams or anti- Brummagems. Around 1690 Alexander Missen, visiting Bromichan in his travels, said that \\"swords, heads of canes, snuff-boxes, and other fine works of steel,\\" could be had, \\"cheaper and better here than even in famed Milan.\\" Guy Miege, in The New State of England (1691), wrote: \\"Bromicham is a large and well-built Town, very populous, and much resorted unto; particularly noted, few years ago, for the counterfeit Groats made here, and from hence dispersed all over the Kingdom.\\" =18th century= During the 18th century Birmingham was known by several variations of the name \\"Brummagem\\". In 1731, an old \\"road-book\\" said that \\"Birmingham, Bromicham, or Bremicham, is a large town, well built and populous. The inhabitants, being mostly smiths, are very ingenious in their way, and vend vast quantities of all sorts of iron wares.\\" Around 1750, England's Gazetteer described Birmingham or Bromichan as \\"a large, well-built, and populous town, noted for the most ingenious artificers in boxes, buckles, buttons, and other iron and steel wares; wherein such multitudes of people are employed that they are sent all over Europe; and here is a continual noise of hammers, anvils, and files\\". The town was renowned for its miscellany of metal and silver industries, some of whose manufacturers used cheap materials, exhibiting poor quality and design. The poorer-quality \\"Brummagem ware\\" was beginning to give the better more skilled metal workers of the town a bad name; Matthew Boulton of the Lunar Society and several toy makers and silversmiths realized this and campaigned to have the town's first assay office constructed. Great opposition came from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London but royal assent was given for assay offices in both Birmingham and Sheffield on the same day. Eventually this filtered out much of the poor workmanship of silver and jewellery in Birmingham, keeping mainly the higher-quality jewellery produced, which ultimately enabled the town to become one of the most important silver manufacturing centres in the 19th century. It is thought by some, including historian Carl Chinn, that around this time Matthew Boulton favoured \\"Birmingham\\" over \\"Brummagem\\" to avoid negative connotations. =19th century= By the 19th century Birmingham had become one of the most important players in the Industrial Revolution. Matthew Boulton had taken part in the first British trade missions to China and the city was one of the most advanced, diverse and productive manufacturing centres in the modern world. Birmingham was sometimes referred to as the \\"toyshop of Europe\\", \\"workshop of the world\\", or \\"city of a thousand trades\\". The Birmingham pen trade prospered and areas such as the Gun Quarter and Jewellery Quarter existed with high standards of production set out by institutions such as the Birmingham Proof House and Birmingham Assay Office. The Birmingham Mint also became internationally renowned for its high-quality coins, as did Cadburys for its chocolate and workers' welfare and rights. With such a vast array of items being produced it was inevitable that not all would have been of high quality; and the advances of the industrial revolution enabled machines to mass-produce cheaper items such as buttons, toys, trinkets and costume jewellery. The poor quality of a proportion of these gave rise to a pejorative use of the word, \\"Brummagem ware\\", although such items were not exclusive to the city. The significant button industry gave rise to the term \\"Brummagem button\\". Charles Dickens's novel The Pickwick Papers (1836) mentions it as a term for counterfeit silver coins; but Samuel Sidney's Rides on Railways (1851) refers to it as \\"an old-fashioned nickname for a Birmingham workman\\". Cartoon from satirical journal The Dart of local politician Francis Schnadhorst leaving Birmingham for London following the 1886 split in the Liberal party over Irish Home Rule: the caption bids him \\"Bye, bye, Schnaddy! and so you are the first to leave Brummagem.\\" By the late 19th century, \\"Brummagem\\" was still used as a term for Birmingham. Some people still used it as a general term for anything cheap and shoddy disguised as something better. It was used figuratively in this context to refer to moral fakery: for instance, the Times leader, 29 January 1838, reported Sir Robert Peel's slur on an opponent: \\"[who] knew the sort of Brummagem stuff he had to deal with, treated the pledge and him who made it with utter indifference\\". One particularly negative use of the word is \\"brummagem screwdriver\\", a term for a hammer, a jibe which suggested that Brummie workers were unskilled and unsophisticated, though it was similarly applied to the French and Irish.Slang Down the Ages: the historical development of slang, Jonathon Green, Kyle Cathie, 1993. The negative use of the word was included in several dictionaries around the world. > Carts were passing to and fro; groups of Indians squatting on their haunches > were chattering together, and displaying to one another the flaring red and > yellow handkerchiefs, the scarlet blankets, and muskets of the most > worthless Brummagem make, for which they had been exchanging their bits of > gold, while their squaws looked on with the most perfect indifference.J. > Tyrwhitt Brooks, California, 1849 The term was not always used with negative meaning. A character in Jeffery Farnol's novel The Broad Highway (1910) comments: and the Rev. Richard H. Barham: However, as shown by James Dobbs's song \\"I can't find Brummagem\\" (see below), it remained in use as a geographical name for the city. In the Henry James story \\"The Lesson of the Master\\" (1888), the novelist Henry St. George refers to his \\"beautiful fortunate home\\" as \\"brummagem\\" to indicate that it is worth little in comparison to what he has given up to have it; he has sacrificed his pursuit of great writing in order to live the life of a comfortable, well-off man. He expresses his regret to the story's protagonist, an aspiring young writer named Paul Overt.James, Henry. The Lesson of the Master. Hoboken: Melville House Publishing, 2004: 90. The Birmingham politician Joseph Chamberlain was nicknamed \\"Brummagem Joe\\" (affectionately or satirically, depending on the speaker). See, for instance, The Times, 6 August 1895: \\"'Chamberlain and his crew' dominated the city ... Mr Geard thought it was advisable to have a candidate against 'Brummagem Joe'\\". There were many contradictory comments and accounts to the idea that Birmingham or Brummagem was associated with poor-quality manufacture around the 19th century, Robert Southey once wrote in 1807: \\"Probably in no other age or country was there ever such an astonishing display of human ingenuity as may be found in Birmingham.\\" Modern usage \\"Brummagem\\" remained a staple of British political and critical discourse into the early 20th century: The Times, 13 August 1901 quoted a House of Commons speech by a Mr MacNeill, \\"The initiative of the Bill ... had the 'Brummagem' brand from top to bottom. It was a mean attempt, inspired by the absurd and vulgar spirit of Imperialism, to subsidize the Crown with a parvenu title, and a tawdry gewgaw reputation\\". A Punch book review for December 1917 said: \\"But, to be honest, the others (with the exception of one quaint little comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, too full of snakes and hidden treasure and general tawdriness ‚Äì the kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one used to associate chiefly with the Earl's Court Exhibition. Mrs. PERRIN must not mingle her genuine native goods with such Brummagem ware\\". In John Galsworthy's In Chancery (1920), the second volume of his Forsyte Saga trilogy (Book II, Part II, Chapter I: The Third Generation), when responding to the question, \\"Do you know Crum?\\", Jolly Forsyte replies, \\"Of Merton? Only by sight. He's in that fast set too, isn't he? Rather La-di-da and Brummagem.\\" Around this time, Birmingham's foremost criminal gang referred to themselves as the Brummagem boys. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British usage had shifted toward a purely geographical and even positive sense. The Housing Design Awards 1998 said of one Birmingham project, City Heights, \\"this gutsy Brummagem bruiser of a building handles its landmark status with ease and assurance\\". In The Guardian \\"Notes from the touchline\\" sport report, 21 March 2003, journalist Frank Keating used the headline \\"World Cup shines with dinkum Brummagem\\" to praise the performance of Birmingham-born Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds. A particular activist in reclaiming the term as a traditional name reflecting positive aspects of the city's heritage is historian Carl Chinn MBE, Professor of Community History at the University of Birmingham, who produces Brummagem Magazine. The British poet Roy Fisher (b. 1930) uses the term in his poetry sequence, \\"Six Texts For a Film\\", in Birmingham River (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994). \\"Birmingham's what I think with. / It's not made for that sort of job,/ but it's what they gave me. / As a means of thinking, it's a Brummagem/ screwdriver\\" (lines 1‚Äì4). US usage In the US, the negative usage appears to have continued into the 1930s. F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 novel The Beautiful and Damned uses the word twice: \\"It was one of the type known as 'tourist' cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman ... a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive\\". Gilbert Seldes, in his 1924 book The Seven Lively Arts, wrote in praise of Krazy Kat: \\"everything paste and brummagem has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed\\". It appears in two essays by H.L. Mencken from 1926: \\"Valentino\\" (\\"Consider the sordid comedy of his two marriages ‚Äì the brummagem, star-spangled passion that invaded his very deathbed!\\") and \\"A Glance Ahead\\" (\\"It would be hard to find a country in which such brummagem serene highnesses are revered with more passionate devotion than they get in the United States.\\"). Mencken's influence is apparent when the term appears in John Fante's 1939 novel Ask the Dust: \\"The church must go, it is the haven of the booboisie, of boobs and bounders and all brummagem mountebanks.\\" Currently US collectors of political memorabilia use \\"brummagem\\" to refer to imitations. The Dictionary of Sexual Terms and Expressions by Farlex Inc., maintainers of TheFreeDictionary.com, lists several related terms such as \\"Brummagem buttons\\", tufts sewn to brassiere cups to give the appearance of larger nipples. Lemony Snicket, in his 1999 young adult novel The Reptile Room, introduces brummagem as a \\"rare word for 'fake'\\". Brummagem in song A song, \\"I Can't Find Brummagem\\", was written by James Dobbs (1781‚Äì1837), a Midland music hall entertainer. \\"The Birmingham School of Business School\\", a song by The Fall on the 1992 album Code: Selfish, about the \\"creative accounting techniques\\" of Trevor Long, a manager of the band, includes the lyric \\"Brummagem School of Business School\\".

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1949 as an Independent, and was known for promoting left-wing and socially progressive causes such as Georgism.Mills, Allen. \\"Single Tax, Socialism and the Independent Labour Party of Manitoba: The Political Ideas of F.J. Dixon and S.J. Farmer.\\" Labour / Le Travail 5 (1980): 33-56. JSTOR. Web. 04 Dec. 2014.  Early life  The son of Alfred Stubbs and Mary P. Durham, Stubbs was born on the island of Cockburn Harbour in the Turks and Caicos Islands, in the British West Indies. His family were wealthy colonial settlers whose ancestors had abandoned Georgia during the American Revolution; Stubbs later described them as \\"real Tories, the old-fashioned kind\\". Stubbs was educated at York Castle in Jamaica and St. Chad's College in Staffordshire, England. In 1898, he enrolled to study medicine at Christ's College, Cambridge University, and intended to become a medical missionary in Africa. In 1899, Stubbs enlisted as a private in the British Army to fight in the Second Boer War. He quickly became disillusioned with both military life and the cause for which he was fighting, and never spoke of his participation with any enthusiasm in later life. He abandoned his medical research on returning to England, and sought a new calling.  Life in Manitoba  In 1902, Stubbs moved to Deleau (near Brandon) Manitoba to work as a farmhand. He moved to Winnipeg later in the year; although initially planning to move to British Columbia, he chose to remain in the city after meeting Mary Wilcox, later his wife. He became a law student, and struck up a friendship with Fred Dixon, later a prominent labourist politician in the city. Stubbs himself had by this point converted to philosophical liberalism. Stubbs was called to the Manitoba bar in 1906. In 1908, he opened a legal practice in Birtle, where he also worked as a farmer. During the federal election of 1917, Stubbs was one of the few public figures in the community to oppose conscription and the government of Robert Borden.  Political career  In the 1921 federal election, Stubbs was chosen to run as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Marquette against Thomas Crerar, leader of the Progressive Party. He held no illusions of winning, and indeed finished a distant third with only 553 votes (against 9873 for Crerar). He was rewarded for his services by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on May 20, 1922, being appointed a County Court Judge in the Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba. On July 4, 1924, he became a Senior County Court Judge. As a judge, Stubbs often provoked controversy with Manitoba and Canada's political leadership. A strict temperance man himself, Stubbs insisted that the province's prohibition laws be followed to the letter. He also rendered several judgments which excoriated the capitalist system of his age, lamenting the punishment of petty criminals while corrupt plutocrats operated above the law. Stubbs was also criticized by some in government for granting unduly lenient sentences, and in 1932 was the subject of a Royal Commission of inquiry into his judicial conduct. Many regarded the inquiry as a politically motivated farce. Stubbs was ultimately found guilty of judicial misbehaviour, and the final report indicated that he was temperamentally unfit to hold office. Though removed from the bench, his cause was supported by many ordinary Manitobans‚Äîparticularly by those on the political left. In late 1933, Stubbs ran for the House of Commons of Canada a second time, this time for the newly formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in the Saskatchewan riding of Mackenzie (he was the first CCF candidate to run for federal office). His candidacy was opposed by others on the left, and the United Farmers's Unity League ran a candidate against him. Stubbs was also criticized for bringing his personal controversies into the campaign, and his religious beliefs were questioned by some (originally an Anglican, Stubbs became a secular humanist in later years). His former ally William Lyon MacKenzie King now campaigned against him, and when the election was held on October 23, Stubbs was defeated by Liberal John Angus MacMillan by 1614 votes. Notwithstanding his setback, Stubbs chose to run as an Independent candidate in Manitoba's 1936 provincial election. He ran in the riding of Winnipeg, which at the time elected ten members by preferential balloting. His popular support was nothing short of incredible‚Äîhe received a record 24,815 votes on the first count, almost 20,000 more than his nearest opponent, Communist James Litterick. Stubbs was a member of the left-opposition in parliament, opposing the Liberal-Progressive government of John Bracken. Although frequently a political ally of Litterick, he was unwilling to follow political directives from the U.S.S.R. and never entertained the possibility of joining the Communist Party. He did, however, support the Mackenzie- Papineau Battalion in the Spanish Civil War, and often dismissed the CCF as an ineffective opposition. There were rumours that Stubbs would run a third time for the House of Commons in 1940 against CCF incumbent Abraham Albert Heaps, but he declined in the interests of unity among \\"progressive\\" politicians. He was a strong supporter of the full mobilization for Canadian forces in World War II, and condemned the Communist Party's volte-face on the issue following the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of October 7, 1939. After Litterick was expelled from the legislature, the other political parties (Liberal- Progressive, Conservative, CCF and Social Credit) formed a united coalition ministry. Stubbs regarded the coalition as a monstrosity, and was for a time the only opposition MLA in the assembly (two other coalition MLAs subsequently left the government side). Stubbs was re-elected in the 1941 election, although without the massive majority of the previous cycle (he finished second on the first ballot, behind Liberal-Progressive candidate John McDiarmid). During this parliament, Stubbs made frequent calls for electoral reform in Manitoba, noting that the riding's urban centres were grossly under- represented in comparison to the rural areas. He was again called upon to run federal against Stanley Knowles in Winnipeg North Centre in 1945, but again declined. He was re-elected in the 1945 election, but once again with diminished support. In this parliament, he supported CCF MLA Morris Gray's efforts to increase old-age pensions, and again spoke in favour of electoral reform. Stubbs did not run for re-election in 1949. He sought re-election for the redistributed riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 1953 provincial election, but was unsuccessful, placing fifth in a four-seat riding.  Later life  He returned to his law practice after leaving political life. Stubbs died on May 12, 1958.

It was created as a gift for Queen Victoria for the purposes of home care and social services. It is registered as a charity with the Canada Revenue Agency, under charity number 129482493RR0001.Canada Revenue Agency registered charity information database Since 2014, the President and CEO is Jo-Anne Poirier. History Lady Aberdeen was the first woman to receive an honorary degree in Canada. She is shown here in Queen's University robes, photographed by William James Topley, in May 1897. Lady Aberdeen, wife of Canadian Governor General Lord Aberdeen, visited Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1896. While there, she heard many stories of women and children alone in remote areas of Canada as their husbands had to travel great distances for medical help. At a meeting of the National Council for Women in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she was asked to create an order of visiting nurses in Canada. It was to be a memorial for the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria's ascent to the throne of the British Empire. At Rideau Hall on February 10, 1897, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier hosted an inauguration to create the Victorian Order of Nurses \\"as a mode of commemoration by the Dominion of Canada (Canada) of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee\\". In 1898, the first nurse training program was established for the Victorian Order of Nurses in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1898, one of the first high-profile projects for the VON was a call to women to join the Victorian Order of Nurses' Klondike contingent. Candidates had to be unmarried, at least twenty-eight years old, and be a graduate of a recognized nursing school. They were warned they would have to dress very plainly and not curl or crimp their hair. Four nurses were selected, three Canadians and one recent immigrant from England. They reached Dawson one month after the Sisters of Saint Anne and found their skills desperately needed to care for the many victims of the typhoid epidemic that was raging through the Klondike. The VON has helped Canada through many incidents including World War I, the Halifax Explosion and World War II. More importantly, VON has been an important element of building community, creating opportunities for people to work together to meet their needs and those of their friends and neighbours. , the VON, as it is almost universally known in Canada, was still the largest single, national homecare organization. With a staff of more than 7,000 supported by more than 14,000 volunteers, they touch the lives of many Canadians daily. VON Canada is structured into a national service provider and local charities. Both are governed by volunteer Board members. The National Board is composed of dedicated volunteers from across Canada elected by the representatives of the local branches. The local branches operate in each of their communities, raising funds and lobbying to meet specific needs. On November 25, 2015, VON suddenly shut down all their operations outside of Ontario and Nova Scotia. The order was lacking in funding, and could no longer support operating offices in other areas. It will restructure to determine what services will continue to be offered while being financially viable.

John formed during the 1994 Pacific hurricane season, which had above-average activity due to the El Ni√±o of 1994‚Äì95, and peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, the highest categorization for hurricanes. Over the course of its existence, John followed a 7,165-mile (13,280-km) path from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific and back to the central Pacific, lasting 31 days in total. Because it existed in both the eastern and western Pacific, John was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing only minimal effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane John were thought by the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) to be from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 25, 1994. The wave subsequently moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean without distinction, before it crossed Central America and moved into the Eastern Pacific Ocean on or around August 8. Upon entering the Eastern Pacific the wave gradually developed, before the NHC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E during August 11. The system was at this time moving westwards and located around to the south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Quickly developing banding features and well-defined outflow, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named John later that day. A strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away most of the clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 17:00 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a Category 3 major hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, John crossed into the central Pacific, the first of three basin crosses John would make. After entering the central Pacific, John left the area monitored by the NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As the storm moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on August 22, John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of . Also, on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands. With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow turn to the north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a small group of islands populated only by a United States military base. The storm slowly weakened from its peak as a Category 5 hurricane in the face of increasing shear, dropping down to a Category 1 hurricane with 90 miles per hour (145 km/h) maximum winds. On August 25 local time, John made its closest approach to the Johnston Atoll only 15 miles (24 km) to the north. On Johnston Atoll, sustained winds were reported up to 60 miles per hour (95 km/h), the equivalent of a strong tropical storm, and gusts up to 75 miles per hour (120 km/h) were recorded. (Note that this report does not reflect changes made in post-season analysis.) Hurricane John at its tertiary peak strength in the far north-central Pacific Ocean. There is also an extratropical cyclone north of John. Clearing Johnston Atoll, John turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22¬∞ N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and was referred to as Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific. After reentering the central Pacific, John briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90 miles per hour (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well to the north of Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1,000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island. Records John's 31-day existence made the hurricane the longest-lasting tropical cyclone recorded in both the Pacific Ocean and worldwide, surpassing both Hurricane Tina's previous record in the Pacific of 24 days in the 1992 season and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane's previous world record of 28 days in the 1899 Atlantic season. In addition, despite its slow movement throughout much of its path, John was the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone in both Pacific Ocean and worldwide, with a distance traveled of 7,165 miles (13,280 km), out- distancing previous record holders Hurricane Fico in the Pacific of 4,700 miles (8,700 km) in the 1978 season and Hurricane Faith worldwide of 6,850 miles (12,700 km) in the 1966 Atlantic season. Pressure readings from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both hurricanes Emilia and Gilma of 1994, as well as hurricanes Ioke of 2006 and Lane and Walaka of 2018 all recorded lower pressures in the central Pacific. However, all five had lower wind speeds than John. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds.) John was also only the fourth Category 5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994). John also possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175 mph (280 km/h), a record shared with the aforementioned Patsy of 1959. Since 1994, only three Category 5 hurricanes, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 have formed in or entered into the Central Pacific. Despite this however, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929 mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160 mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175 mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma, Ioke, Lane, or Walaka. In addition, John was the first tropical cyclone to form in the east Pacific, east of 140¬∞W, and also exist as a typhoon once it crossed 180¬∞W; a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014. Impact Satellite image of Hurricane John as a Category 5 storm with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) John affected both the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Atoll, but only lightly. While John passed over 345 miles (550 km) to the south of Hawaii, the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast- and south-facing shores, and, while moving westward, on west-facing shores as well. The waves, ranging from in height, flooded beach parks in Kailua-Kona. Additionally, heavy rains on the Big Island of Hawaii caused minor, localized flooding and some short-term road closures. No deaths, injuries or significant damages were reported in Hawaii. Although John passed within of Johnston Atoll, it had weakened greatly to a Category 1 system by closest approach. Prior to the storm's arrival, waves between were reported on the island. Additionally, in the Northern Hemisphere, the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone, so the atoll, which lay to the south of the storm's path, was spared the brunt of the storm. Nonetheless, the 1,100-man personnel for the United States military base on Johnston Atoll had been evacuated to Honolulu as a precaution while John approached. Damage to structures was considerable, but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage; monetary losses were estimated at close to $15 million (1994 US$). The remnants of John moved through the Aleutian Islands, producing a wind gust of in Unalaska. The storm brought a plume of warm air, and two stations recorded a high temperature of .

However, when her friends are threatened Chiaki herself displays a horrifying power. The powers her angelic father sealed within her level an entire city during a battle with several bounty hunters, and Chiaki spends the rest of the series in agony over her hatred of what she and Ororon must do to survive. Characters =Main= *Chiaki Saionji is the heroine, a shy and pacifistic girl who is the daughter of the Archangel Michael and a human woman. She is a boyish-looking, extensively cheery 15-year-old girl. Her parents disappeared when she was a baby, and she was raised by her grandfather, who has recently died. Her mixed heritage gives her incredible powers and makes her a target for both angels and demons. When she unlocks her powers she unleashes a devastating explosion that levels the city. *Ororon Gem Farrell is the King of Hell, but he has abandoned his post and fled to Earth. He is a mysterious figure and is usually seen wearing all black with a smug look plastered on his face. The seventh and youngest son of the previous king, he has no wish to rule Hell and prefers to remain with Chiaki. For her sake he tries to temper his bloodthirsty nature, a constant source of stress on their relationship. =Secondary= *Lika is Chiaki's best (and only) friend who moves in with her. Shiro asks her if she is in love with Othello, she neither admits it or denies it, and it is also hinted that she has feelings toward Shiro. *Shiro and Kuro are two demon-cat brothers who are killed by Ororon after they attack Chiaki. At Chiaki's pleading, Ororon restores them to life and they are \\"adopted\\" by Chiaki. *Othello is the fifth son of the previous King of Hell, General of the Army of Hell, and one of the most powerful creatures in the multi-verse (at one point he is referred to as one of the top three who can \\"kill anything and anyone\\"). He makes a vow to protect Ororon after Ororon tries to convince their father, Ozu, not to have Othello's wife (Futaba) executed. Of all Ororon's siblings, he is the only one who cares for Ororon. Othello comes to Earth in search of Ororon, and while at first he attempts to convince Ororon to return to Hell, he seems content to remain on Earth with Ororon and Chiaki. He becomes infatuated with the bounty-hunter Mitsume, in whom he sees much of himself. Othello is constantly joking and laughing, but his smile hides a deep inner pain. *Mitsume is a bounty hunter. Because he was born with a third eye, an \\"evil eye\\", he was mutilated (losing an arm and two fingers) and driven from his village. Since then, he's been wandering around as a professional Bounty Hunter. Othello wants him as a plaything, but he remains defiant. Othello repeatedly beats and goads him in an attempt to give him a purpose for living. From then on, Mitsume makes his life's goal to train so that he can kill Othello. *Oscar Farrel is Ororon and Othello's half-brother, the third prince, and Ororon's chief rival for the throne of Hell. He has a bittersweet disdain/hatred for the king and is very merciless in his actions. He tries to take over the world, starting with hell, and confronts Ororon in the final battle of the series. *Yotsuba Farrel is Othello's son by his late wife, Futaba. He refuses to call Othello \\"father\\", even though Othello asks him to. His relationship with his father seems strained, but relatively normal. He is commander of the 1st battalion of Hell's army. *Miss Lucy is Ororon's maid. She is shown to have abnormal strength. It is unknown whether she is human or demon or some other manner of creature. *Minister Charles Crodel is one of Ororon's advisers, and the most important political figure in Hell, tasked with the daily operations of running the kingdom. *Minister Shinichiro Tachibana is another adviser to Ororon. Tachibana, Charles, and Yotsuba lead the group that follows Othello to Earth in an attempt to convince Ororon to return to Hell. *Sheila is Ororon's mother, who lost her sanity due to an attempted poisoning. She hates Ororon, because he reminds her of his father; King Ozu had Sheila's lover, Gem, killed so that she would become his mistress. She tries to kill Ororon, though because he loves her, he visits her regardless. *Ozu is Ororon's father and King of Hell. He chose Ororon as his heir, though Ororon was the youngest son and mistress-born, because of his obsessive love for Sheila. *Olga is one of the seven princes of Hell, though his age is unknown. He leads an attack on Hell's capital city while Oscar attacks Ororon on Earth. Shinichiro Tachibana states that he does so on Oscar's command, though it's unclear if they are working together. Due to their rivalry, it is unlikely that any of the seven brothers could ever get along well enough to work together.

WUT is one of the leading Chinese universities accredited by the Ministry of Education and one of the universities constructed in priority by the \\"State Project 211\\" for Chinese higher education institutions. It is also a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.  History  East Campus Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) was founded on May 27, 2000 from the former Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan Transportation University and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. Each of these three universities has its own uniquely important history. The former Wuhan University of Technology dated back from three colleges, namely, Zhongnan Construction Engineering College in 1952, Shenyang Building Materials Industry College in 1958 and Beijing Institute of Building Engineering in 1958. Then in 1971, Beijing Institute of Building Engineering merged with Wuhan Construction Engineering School and thus formed Hubei Construction Industry College. Later in 1978, the college was awarded the title as national key university and then changed its name to Wuhan Institute of Building Materials. In 1985, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Technology, which later passed the evaluation of \\"State 211 Project\\" in 1996 and entered into the direct administration of the Ministry of Education in 1998 before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000. The former Wuhan Transportation University mainly originated from National Maritime Vocational School in 1946. Then in 1949, the college changed its name to Wuhan Transportation College. in 1952, the college changed its name to Wuhan River Transportation College. Later in 1957, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Water Transportation Engineering which then received the discipline adjustment by the Ministry of Transportation in 1963. More importantly, the college merged with Wuhan River Transportation School and thus got its name as Wuhan University of Water Transportation Engineering. Later in 1993, the college was officially named as Wuhan Transportation University by the Ministry of Transportation before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000. The former Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University came from the original Wuhan Institute of Technology which was founded in 1958. In 1959, it was merged into Hubei Chemical Engineering College. Then in 1961, the college merged with the other two colleges, respectively, Wuhan Institute of Technology and Hubei Industry College and thus named itself Wuhan Institute of Technology. During the next fifteen years, the Institute underwent great changes and was forced to change its name due to China's Cultural Revolution. Then in 1979, the Institute regained its name as Wuhan Institute of Technology. Later from 1983 to 1994, the Institute showed its rapid development in many aspects. Then in 1995, the Institute changed its name to Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. What was more, in 1999, Hubei No.1 Mechanical Industry School and Hubei Energy Economy School were merged into the university. Later in May 2000, it merged with the other two universities mentioned in the beginning and thus formed Wuhan University of Technology. WUT History (English Ver)  Academic  Currently, the university owns 23 academic schools, 9 state key disciplines, 74 Doctoral programs, 135 Master's programs as well as 82 Bachelor's programs. WUT has about 5,570 staff members, including 650 professors, 3 academicians of China Academy of Engineering and 3 academicians of China Academy of Science. Besides, over 36,000 undergraduates, 16000 postgraduates (including Master and PhD students), and 327 international students are studying at WUT. The university has extensively established academic links with more than sixty external universities and institutions. The university has engaged more than one hundred famous foreign scholars as Concurrent or Honorary Professors for the university, and often receives experts, scholars and professors from other countries or regions to teach or do research. The university also sends abroad a number of teachers, professors, and scholars to study and to attend international academic conferences each year. Some of them have been engaged as Guest Professor, Special Professor or Lecturer by foreign host institutions. In 1950 the university began to admit foreign students and has awarded more than ten different countries‚Äô students ever since with a bachelor, master's degree or a certificate for further study. = Schools = East Campus No.4 Teaching Building *School of Materials Science and Engineering *School of Automotive Engineering *School of Transportation *School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering *School of Energy and Power Engineering *School of Resources and Environmental Engineering *School of Information Engineering *School of Computer Science and Technology *School of Automation *School of Civil Engineering and Architecture *School of Navigation *School of Logistics Engineering *School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Science *School of Sciences *School of Management *School of Economics *School of Law, Humanities and Sociology *School of Art and Design *School of Foreign Languages *Institute of Higher Education *School of Vocational Technology *School of International Education *School of On-line and Continuing Education *Department of Physical Education = Research = WUT-Harvard Joint Nano Key Laboratory, West Campus WUT possesses 27 innovative research centers with international leading level including two State Key Laboratories, a State Engineering Laboratory and provincial or ministerial level laboratories in the areas of new materials, new energy, transportation and logistics, mechatronics and automobile, information technology as well as resources and environmental technology.

As the wife of John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, she was viceregal consort of Canada from 1893 to 1898 and of Ireland from 1906 to 1915. Early life Born in London, Marjoribanks was the third daughter of the 1st Baron Tweedmouth and Isabella Weir-Hogg (daughter of Sir James Weir Hogg). She received a well-rounded education in English, French, mathematics, history, and geography, and was such a good student that her teacher recommended she attend college. However, Lady Aberdeen's father shared the widely held opinion that university was no place for a woman.Doris French Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire: A Biography of Lady Aberdeen (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1988), 19, 27. Instead, her education continued at home at her parents‚Äô social events, where she met the famous politicians of the day.Merna Forster, \\"Lady Aberdeen: A Lady of the Empire,\\" 100 Canadian Heroines: Famous and Forgotten Faces, 23-25 (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2004), 23. This experience helped prepare her for a lifetime of political involvement. Isabel became an evangelical at an early age, believing like many Victorians in a life dedicated to good works, as well as social and moral reform. After a six-year acquaintance, she married John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, the 7th Earl of Aberdeen (later the 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair), on 7 November 1877 in St. George's Church, St. George Street, Hanover Square, London. The couple had four surviving children: George (1879), Marjorie (1880), Dudley (1883), and Archibald (1884).Anne-Michelle Slater, \\"The Noble Patroness Lady Aberdeen,\\" in Learning from the Lasses: Women of the Patrick Geddes Circle, Walter Stephen (Edinburgh: Luath Press Limited, 2014), 166. Lady Aberdeen's daughter has written that \\"Ishbel interpreted the duty of wife as one who not only provided for her husband a serene background in private life, but as one who also thought and fought for him in all his affairs.\\" Social activism in England and Scotland Lord Aberdeen was a Liberal and a member of the House of Lords, and Lady Aberdeen supported him by hosting social events. An intelligent and determined woman, she soon established her own political life as an activist. Because of political obligations, the family divided their time between London and their Scottish estate in Aberdeenshire. They called their home Haddo House, and it was here that Lady Aberdeen began her involvement with social reforms. She organized a Household Club that held classes for servants to learn singing, carving, reading, and other activities. The Aberdeens often attended their servants‚Äô evening socials and meetings, and in London society it was rumoured that they had even dined together. They also funded a local school and hospital‚Äîhealthcare was a cause that Lady Aberdeen supported throughout her life.Slater, \\"The Noble Patroness Lady Aberdeen,\\" 166. Lady Aberdeen's influence also extended beyond her country estate. She established the Onwards and Upward Association, which provided servant girls with postal courses on topics ranging from geography to literature to domestic science. This program spread from Aberdeenshire to include thousands of servants.Slater, \\"The Noble Patroness Lady Aberdeen,\\" 167. In 1883 she became the first president of the Ladies‚Äô Union of Aberdeen, an organization that focused on the well-being of young women living in cities. An Emigration Committee chose suitable women and sponsored them to move to the colonies, especially Canada.Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire, 99. Lady Aberdeen was also the head of the Women's Liberal Federation, which advocated for women's suffrage.Val McLeish, \\"Sunshine and sorrows: Canada, Ireland and Lady Aberdeen,\\" in Colonial Lives Across the British Empire: Imperial careering in the long nineteenth century, David Lambert and Alan Lester (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 261. Time in Canada Lady Aberdeen by William James Topley, c. 1900. In 1893, Lord Aberdeen was appointed the Governor General of Canada, a post he would occupy until 1898. The Aberdeens were no strangers to the country, as they had visited several times before; during their cross-Canada tour of 1890 they had even purchased a homestead in British Columbia.Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire, 103-4. On that same visit they crossed the prairies, and Lady Aberdeen was struck by the difficult and isolated lifestyle of pioneers. She subsequently founded the Aberdeen Association for Distribution of Good Literature to Settlers in the West, which sent settlers packages of books and magazines.Forster, \\"Lady Aberdeen,\\" 24. Lady Aberdeen was dedicated to her role as Governor General's wife (Viceregal consort of Canada). She hosted many popular social events, such as winter festivals and costume balls, and was more politically involved than her predecessors. She travelled extensively, attending events and collecting information for her husband. She regularly offered him advice, and in fact newspapers commented (sometimes critically) that it appeared she held the power in their relationship.Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire, 136. In 1893, the year she arrived in Canada, Lady Aberdeen was named the first president of the International Council of Women, an organization that campaigns for women's rights. Consequently, she organized the National Council of Women of Canada and travelled the country establishing local branches.Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire, 152. One of the activists she worked with was Adelaide Hoodless, who went on to found the Women's Institute. Lady Aberdeen was the first sponsor of the Women's Art Association of Canada, founded in 1892. Yet another of her endeavours was the May Court Club, an association that enabled well-off young women to do charitable work.Shackleton, Ishbel and the Empire, 252. A key organization that she helped establish is the Victorian Order of Nurses, which aimed to give women better training and a higher salary so they could provide services to rural and disadvantaged populations. Lady Aberdeen and the group's supporters had to overcome resistance from the medical community before receiving the organization's royal charter in 1898. That same year, Lord and Lady Aberdeen returned to England. Time in Ireland Lord Aberdeen belonged to the Liberal Party, and when it regained power in parliament in 1906 he was named the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for the second time. He had previously been Lord Lieutenant, or viceroy, for approximately six months in 1886. True to her nature, Lady Aberdeen identified herself with the cause of the Irish people and contributed to Lord Aberdeen's success over the course of his six months in office. During that time, Lady Aberdeen had promoted Irish crafts and became chairman of the Association of Irish Industries. Their second term in Ireland lasted from 1906 to 1915, and this time she focused on healthcare and social well-being. Lady Aberdeen was involved with medical organizations like the Women's National Health Association of Ireland that were dedicated to treating and preventing tuberculosis and improving children's health. Her name lives on in Lady Ishbel Avenue, part of the former Purdysburn Fever Hospital site in south Belfast. In 1911 she served as the first president of the Housing and Town Planning Association of Ireland, advocating for better housing and public spaces to address the prevalent poverty.Slater, \\"The Noble Patroness Lady Aberdeen,\\" 168, 170, 171, 176, 179. Lady Aberdeen's Cottages in Mullingar are named after her. Although she had been quite popular during her first stint in Ireland, she faced a different reception upon her return. By 1906 nationalist sentiment had increased significantly in Ireland, and her ties to Britain were held against her. Furthermore, her determination to have her way meant that she was not always sensitive to the Irish perspective.McLeish, \\"Sunshine and sorrows,\\" 277, 283. Later life Lord and Lady Aberdeen retired to their home in Scotland, but continued to be involved in social causes. Together they wrote a memoir, We Twa, that was published in 1925 to a positive reception and was followed by several expanded editions.Marjorie Pentland, A Bonnie Fechter: The life of Ishbel Marjoribanks (London: B.T. Batsford Ltd, 1952), 201, 202. The Canadian Journal of Lady Aberdeen, 1893‚Äì1898, was edited by John Saywell and published by the Champlain Society in 1960, after her death.The Man From Halifax: Sir John Thompson, Prime Minister, by Peter Busby Waite, Toronto 1985, University of Toronto Press, p. 527. In 1931, Lady Aberdeen presented to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland a petition of 336 women calling for women to be ordained to the ministry, diaconate and eldership of the Kirk.Pentland, A Bonnie Fechter, 207. This resulted in a special commission, which recommended only that women should be ordained to the diaconate. It was not until 1968 that the Church of Scotland passed acts allowing women to become elders or enter the ministry. She continued to serve as the president of the International Council of Women until 1936. She died of a heart attack on 18 April 1939 at Gordon House in Rubislaw, Aberdeen.Pentland, A Bonnie Fechter, 235. Recognition Lady Aberdeen was the first woman to receive an honorary degree in Canada. She is shown here in Queen's University robes, photographed by William James Topley. In 1894, she received the Freedom of Limerick; she received the Freedom of Edinburgh in 1928 and was invested Dame Grand Cross in the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1931.(2013) Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon Undiscovered Scotland, Retrieved 10 April 2013 The Lady-Aberdeen Bridge, which is the first bridge upstream to cross the Gatineau River, in Gatineau, Quebec, was renamed in her honour. After falling through the ice at the confluence of the Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers, Lady Aberdeen was rescued by locals. Lady Aberdeen is credited with introducing the Golden Retriever to Canada; her father, Sir Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, a Scottish aristocrat, is best known as the originator of the breed.Baldwin, Lorna (7 August 2013) Golden Retrievers Go ‚ÄòHome‚Äô for Gathering in Scottish Highlands Public Broadcasting System, Newshour; retrieved 4 July 2014. Aberdeen Avenue in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, was named after Lord and Lady Aberdeen who lived on Bay Street South between 1890 and 1898. They presided over the opening of the Hamilton Public Library on 16 September 1890. Aberdeen Avenue in Toronto is also named after them. Aberdeen Street in Kingston, Ontario is named for the couple; it is located near the Queen's University campus. Her popularity in Canada led to her being given 18 elaborate tea sets by the Canadian government. This gift was nothing to do with her title or marriage and was purely because of her own work and impact. She was the first woman to be made an honorary member of the British Medical Association. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a plaque for Lady Aberdeen 1857‚Äì1939 on the grounds of Rideau Hall, 1 Sussex Drive, Ottawa. \\"Widely respected for her organizational skills and strong commitment to public service, Lady Aberdeen served as president of the International Council of Women from 1893 to 1939. During the Earl of Aberdeen's term as governor-general, she helped to form the National Council of Women of Canada.\\"(2015) Plaque information - Lady Aberdeen 1857-1938 Ontario Heritage Trust, an agency of the Canadian Ministry of Tourism, Culture & Sport, Retrieved 4 September 2015 Lady Aberdeen was also named a National Historic Person with a plaque on Sussex Drive in Ottawa.

It was first published in 1950 then revised and amplified in 1961. It describes the esoteric teachings of alchemy, tantra, kabbalah, the mysteries of the Maya, Aztecs, ancient Egyptians, Tibetans, and Essenes, among others. The sexual aspect of religion is stressed in every religion it covers, stating bluntly that ‚Äúthe topic of this book is exclusively Sexual Magic.‚Äù Sexual magic is explained as the synthesis of all religion. From the introduction of the 1960 edition: :Sexual magic is practiced in esoteric Christianity. Sexual magic is practiced in Zen Buddhism. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Initiated Yogis. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Muslim Sufis. Sexual magic was practiced in the Initiatic Colleges of Troy, Egypt, Rome, Carthage, Eleusis. Sexual magic was practiced by the mysterious Maya, Aztec, Inca, Druids, etc. The author presents a wide selection of religion and mystery schools from esoteric viewpoints, highlighting data traditionally thought to be unimportant, or otherwise understood in an unrelated manner. The primary message is that upright sexuality, exemplified through sexual magic, is the cornerstone upon which all authentic religion, yoga and occultism is based. The Perfect Matrimony is a discourse on how to transform the sexual energy into its superior aspects via sexual transmutation. It states that there are three types of Sexual Magic, or Tantra: Black, Grey, and White. Black Tantra involves the ejaculation of semen, and Grey Tantra sometimes concludes with orgasm or ejaculation, while White Tantra always opposes any loss of sexual energy whatsoever, in other words, without orgasm or ejaculation. It exclusively advocates White Tantra as the path to achieve ‚Äúself-realization‚Äù and to ‚Äúachieve cosmic consciousness.‚Äù This system of classification is not found in any of the traditional Tantric texts, however it is also true that tantra yoga has been historically gupta vidya, or esoteric knowledge not contained in books. Sexual magic is explained to be the same as maithuna, sexual yoga, urdhvareta yoga. The Perfect Matrimony also states that Jesus was married and practiced sexual yoga with his wife.

In 1874, the United States' Harvard University hosted Canada's McGill University to play the new game derived from rugby football in a home-and-home series. When the Canadians arrived several days early, to take advantage of the trip to see Boston and the surrounding areas, they held daily practices. During this time, the Americans were surprised to see the Canadians kick, chase, and then run with the ball. Picking up and running with the ball violated a basic rule of the American game of the day; when the U.S. captain (Henry Grant) pointed this out to the captain of the Canadian team (David Roger), the reply was simple: Running with the ball is a core part of the Canadian game. When the American asked which game the Canadians played, David replied \\"rugby\\". After some negotiation, they decided to play a game with half and half Canadian/U.S. rules. Thus, many of the similarities and differences between the Canadian and American games indeed came out of this original series where each home team set the rules. For instance, Harvard, because of a lack of campus space, did not have a full- sized rugby pitch. Their pitch was only long by wide with undersized end zones (slightly less than the 53‚Öì-yard width of the current regulation-sized field for American football). Because of the reduced field, the Harvard team opted for 11 players per side, four fewer than the regulation 15 of rugby union. To generate more offense, Harvard also increased the number of downs from three, as set by McGill, to four. Furthermore, the Harvard players so enjoyed running with the ball, this rule was wholly adopted into all Harvard play following the two games with McGill. While the American team bested the Canadian (3‚Äì0 and a following tie game), both countries' flavours of football were forever changed and linked to one another. Both the Canadian and American games still have some things in common with the two varieties of rugby, especially rugby league, and because of the similarities, the National Football League (NFL) had a formal relationship with the Canadian Football League (CFL) between 1997 and 2008. Many, if perhaps not most, of the rules differences have arisen because of rules changes in American football in the early 20th century, which have not been copied by Canadian football. The major Canadian codes never abolished the onside scrimmage kick (see Kicker advancing the ball below) or restricted backfield motion, while the American college football (from whose code all American codes derive) did. Canadian football was later in adopting the hand snap and the forward pass, although one would not suspect the latter from play today. Additionally, Canadian football was slower in removing restrictions on blocking, but caught up by the 1970s so that no significant differences remain today. Similarly, differences in scoring (the Canadian game valuing touchdowns less) opened up from the late 19th century, but were erased by the 1950s. An area in which American football has been more conservative is the retention of the fair catch (see below). The American game's modern rules were developed by Walter Camp in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whereas the modern Canadian game was devised by John Thrift Meldrum Burnside, whose Burnside rules, invented around the same time, were developed independently from Camp's rules. In 1944, Canadian and American teams played an exhibition game at White City Stadium in London. The Canadian Mustangs defeated the U.S. Pirates 16‚Äì6. Here, captains Frank Dombrowski (left) of the United States and W. Drinkwater of Canada shake hands. In some regions along the Canada-U.S. border, especially western areas, some high schools from opposite sides of the border regularly play games against one another (typically one or two per team per season). By agreement between the governing bodies involved, the field of the home team is considered a legal field, although it is a different size from one school's normal field. In all but a few cases, the rules of the home team are followed throughout the game. Many CFL players are Americans who grew up playing American football and cannot find a place in the NFL, or who prefer to play in the CFL; strict import quotas restrict the number of non-Canadian players. Furthermore, the classifications of import (non-Canadian) and non-import (Canadian) were highly restrictive and required a player to have been in Canada since childhood to qualify as a nonimport (i.e. a player cannot simply become a Canadian citizen and become a nonimport, nor can he arrive in Canada during high school or college; both scenarios would still have the player in question classified as an import and counted against the team's maximum); these restrictions were loosened beginning in 2014 so that anyone who had become a Canadian citizen at any time before signing with the league for the first time could qualify as a nonimport player. For individuals who played both American and Canadian football professionally, their career statistic totals are considered to be their combined totals from their careers in both the CFL and NFL. Warren Moon, for example, was the all-time professional football leader in passing yards after an illustrious career in both leagues. He was surpassed in 2006 by Damon Allen, who in turn was surpassed by Anthony Calvillo in 2011, both of whose careers were exclusively in the CFL. Differences Several important specific differences exist between the Canadian and American versions of the game of football: =Playing area= The official playing field in Canadian football is larger than the American, and similar to American fields prior to 1912. The Canadian field of play is , rather than as in American football. Since 1986, Canadian end zones are 10 yards deeper than American football, measuring . The end zones were previously 25 yards, with Vancouver's BC Place the first to use the 20-yard-long end zone in 1983, and since 2016, the home of the CFL's Toronto Argonauts, BMO Field, uses an 18-yard-long end zone. Including the end zones, the American field is about 34% smaller than the Canadian field ( for the Canadian field vs for the American field), but the Canadian field occasionally will have its end zone truncated at the corners so that the field fits in the infield of a running track. The only example in the CFL is the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes. The goalposts for kicking are placed at the goal line in Canadian football, but at the end line in the American game since 1974. In Canadian rules, the distance between the sideline and hash marks is ; in American amateur rules, at the high school level, the distance is , virtually sectioning the field into three equal columns. The hash marks are closer together at the American college level, where they are from the sideline, and in the NFL, where they are from the sideline and the distance between them is the same as that between the goalposts. Because of the larger field, many American football venues are generally unfit for the Canadian game. While several American stadia could accommodate the extra feet ( per side in width (multipurpose stadia, baseball parks converted for football, and some soccer-specific stadiums are particularly good fits), most American stadia would lose between 15 and 18 rows of seating in each end zone because the field is longer on each end. In many smaller venues, this would be the entire end zone section, losing seating for at least 3,000 spectators. During the CFL's failed expansion to U.S. cities in the early 1990s, Canadian football was either played on fields designed to accommodate both American football and baseball (such as the Baltimore Stallions playing at Memorial Stadium), or in some cases, on a field designed for American football (for instance, the Memphis Mad Dogs and the Birmingham Barracudas of the CFL, playing in the Liberty Bowl and at Legion Field, respectively, played the Canadian game on modified American-sized fields because of the inability of the stadia to adapt to the larger field). The Alamodome, originally built as a multipurpose dome, proved to best accommodate both Canadian football (the CFL's San Antonio Texans) and American football (Alamo Bowl, Dallas Cowboys training camp, the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina, the NFLPA Game, the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, and the UTSA Roadrunners), although Canadian football is no longer played there. Similarly, Hornet Stadium fairly easily adapted to both the Canadian and American games, as it was built with a running track in which the Canadian field fits with only some cuts to the corners. Hornet Stadium hosts California State University, Sacramento (more often known as Sacramento State), hosted the Sacramento Surge and Sacramento Mountain Lions in American football and the Sacramento Gold Miners in Canadian football. =Team size= American teams use 11 players, while Canadian teams have 12 players on the field per side. Both games have the same number of offensive players required at the line of scrimmage, so the 12th player in the Canadian game plays a backfield position on offence, whereas this is usually a defensive back on defence. Because of this, position designations of the various offensive and defensive lines vary. For example, most formations in Canadian football have no tight ends, these having been phased out in 1980. The typical offensive arrangement in Canadian football is two slotbacks instead of the American tight end, while on the defensive end of the ball, two defensive halfbacks are used instead of one strong safety in the American game. This is the standard layout used at the line of scrimmage. The lower part of the diagram would be closer to the endzone. This is the standard layout used at the line of scrimmage. The lower part of the diagram would be closer to the endzone. These are the player positions for both offensive and defensive. Note that eleven players per side are used, as opposed to twelve. =The ball= The sizes of individual American and Canadian footballs can vary within specified size limitations. Despite the CFL and NFL having different specifications until 2018, they overlapped to a sufficient degree that from at least 1985 forward, the same ball could fall within the requirements of both leagues. Historically the CFL ball was slightly larger, both because of slightly bigger specifications, but also because CFL manufacturers tended to make balls at the larger end of the allowed tolerances as opposed to NFL manufacturers, which built balls to the smaller end. However, the CFL has updated its specifications twice‚Äîfirst in 1985, and most recently in 2018. The latter change saw the league adopt the NFL's specifications. Before it adopted NFL standards, the CFL's regulation football size was specified as short circumference from ; long circumference from . The regulation size for an NFL football is specified as short circumference from ; long circumference from .http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/2012%20-%20Rule%20Book.pdf Despite the fact that before 2018, the CFL rules allowed for a smaller legal ball and the NFL rules allowed for a larger legal ball, a common misconception existed among media, fans, and even players that the then-current CFL ball was bigger. Some professional quarterbacks stated that they noticed a difference in size. Another difference between NFL and CFL balls is that Canadian balls have two complete white stripes around the football from the largest diameter of the ball and NFL balls have no stripes at all. The CFL retained its striping scheme when it adopted NFL measurement specifications in 2018. College football and high school football both specify the use of stripes, but only on two of the football's four panels (the ones adjacent to the laces). =Number of downs= In American football, a team has four downs to advance the ball 10 yards, while in Canadian football the limit is three downs.http://cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf (p 37) =Scrimmage= In both games, the ball is placed at a line of scrimmage, in which a player known as the \\"centre\\" or \\"center\\" performs a \\"snap\\" to start a football play. In Canadian football, the snap is required to go between the centre's legs; no such move is required in American football, but it is invariably done this way anyway, so the center is in position to block following the snap. The defensive team must stay a set distance away from the line of scrimmage on their side of the line. In Canadian football, the distance between the line of scrimmage and the defensive team, formally called the \\"scrimmage zone\\", is one full yard. Because of this one-yard distance, teams tend to gamble on \\"third and one\\" or \\"third and inches\\". If a team's offense is within one yard of either goal line, the line of scrimmage is moved to the one-yard line.Rule 4: Scrimmage. In American football, the set distance between the offensive and defensive teams, known in that code as the \\"neutral zone\\", is 11 inches ‚Äì the length of the ball, creating the illusion of the teams being \\"nose-to-nose\\" against each other. While large, relatively immobile offensive line players used to form a line that cannot be easily penetrated by the defense are valued in American football, the extra distance from the defensive team means Canadian football finds value in more nimble players on the offensive line. =Fair catches and punt returns= In American football, if a punt returner sees that, in his judgment, he will be unable to advance the ball after catching it, he may signal for a fair catch by waving his hand in the air, and forgo the attempt to advance. If he makes this signal, the opposing team must allow him to attempt to catch the ball cleanly; if he is interfered with, the team covering the kick will be penalized 15 yards. In contrast, Canadian football has no such rule; instead, no player from the kicking team, except the kicker or any player who was behind him when he kicked the ball, may approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by an opponent. If they do, a \\"no yards\\" penalty is called against the kicking team. Penalties for \\"no yards\\" calls vary on whether the ball made contact with the ground or not. The penalty is 5 yards if the ball has bounced and 15 if the ball is caught in the air.Section 4, Article 1 Furthermore, in American football, the receiving team may elect not to play the ball if the prospects for a return are not good and the returner is not certain he can successfully catch the ball on the fly; American players are generally taught not to attempt to touch a bouncing football. If any member of the kicking team touches the ball after the kick is made, without an intervening touch by the member of the receiving team, the receiving team may elect to scrimmage the ball from that spot of first touching, regardless of anything else (other than a penalty) that happens during the rest of the play. If the kicking team gains possession of the ball during the kick before it is touched by the receiving team, the ball is then dead. Often, the ball hits the ground and is surrounded by players from the kicking team, who allow it to roll as far as possible downfield ‚Äì without going into the end zone ‚Äì before grasping or holding the ball against the ground. (If a punt bounces into the receiving team's end zone, it is dead, and a touchback is awarded.) However, if the ball touches a member of the receiving team without his gaining possession (a \\"muff\\"), then the ball can be recovered by either team (but cannot be advanced by the kicking team). If the kicking team recovers the ball, they regain possession and are awarded a first down at the spot of the recovery. Following a fair catch in American football, the receiving team can elect a free kick (called a fair catch kick) from the spot the ball is received ‚Äì and if the kick goes through the opposite goal posts, a field goal is scored. Fair catch kicks are rarely attempted in the NFL and are usually unsuccessful (The last successful fair catch kick was in 1976). The fair catch kick is not allowed in college football. In Canadian football, if the receiving team does not play the ball, the kicker, and any teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick, can attempt to retrieve and advance the ball. This is further explained in the kicker advancing the ball section. =Motion at the snap= In American football, after all players are set, only one offensive player is allowed to be in motion, and he cannot be moving toward the line of scrimmage while the ball is snapped. The motion player must start from behind the line of scrimmage; players on the line cannot be in motion. In Canadian football, all offensive backfield players, except the quarterback, may be in motion at the snap; players in motion may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. In addition, the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage (generally wide receivers) may also be in motion along the line. Many teams encourage this unlimited motion, as it can confuse the defence. It also provides receivers the advantage of a running start, as they can time their runs so that they cross the line of scrimmage at speed when the ball is snapped, allowing them to get downfield faster than receivers in American football, allowing for comparatively longer throws in the same amount of time after the snap or quicker throws for a given distance. =Time rules= In American football, the offensive team must run a play within 25 seconds of the referee whistling the play in ‚Äì except in the NCAA (college) and the NFL where teams have 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, or 25 seconds following a penalty or timeout. In Canadian football (at all levels of play), teams have 20 seconds regardless of the preceding situation. American football rules allow each team to have three timeouts in each half, and the NFL stops play for a \\"two-minute warning\\". However, NCAA football has no two-minute warning, but the clock stops on a first down until the ball is ready for play if the play ended in the field of play. In the CFL, each team has two time-outs a game, but cannot use both in the last three minutes of the game, while at lower levels of Canadian football, each team has two. Canadian football has a three- minute rather than a two-minute warning. Also, at all levels of Canadian football, the clock is stopped after every play during the last three minutes of each half. Once the referee has set the ball, the clock restarts if the last play ended with a runner tackled in the field of play. Timing rules change drastically after the minutes warning in both leagues: * In American football, the clock continues to run after any tackle in bounds, but stops after an incomplete pass or a tackle out of bounds. If the clock stops, it is restarted at the snap of the ball or when the ball is ready to be played. In Canadian football, the clock stops after every play, but the starting time differs depending on the result of the previous play: After a tackle in bounds, the clock restarts when the referee whistles the ball in; after an incomplete pass or a tackle out of bounds, the clock restarts when the ball is snapped. In the NCAA, the clock stops after every first down to move and set the down markers, after which the clock restarts. * The penalty for allowing the play clock to run out, which is 5 yards with no loss of down before the minutes warning in both codes, dramatically diverges after that point. In American football, the penalty for \\"delay of game\\" remains 5 yards with the down repeated. In Canadian football, the penalty for a \\"time count\\" violation (\\"delay of game\\" is a different violation in Canada) is loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards with the down repeated on third down. Also, if the referee deems a time count violation on third down after the three-minute warning to be deliberate, he has the right to require the offensive team to legally put the ball into play within the 20-second count, with a violation resulting in loss of possession. (Note that the enforcement of time count during convert attempts does not change at the warning; it is 5 yards with the down repeated throughout the game.) * In American football, a period generally ends when time expires (though any play which is in progress when the clock reaches 0:00 is allowed to finish); in Canadian football, the period must end with a final play. Consequently, a play is often started in Canadian football with no time (0:00) showing on the game clock. American football typically only has a play start with no time on the clock when a defensive penalty occurs during the last play of the period and the penalty is not declined (or, in the NFL, in the very rare circumstance when a team takes a fair catch as time expires and elects a free kick). Additionally, any period in Canadian football cannot end on a penalty (this is not the case in American football), so any penalty that occurs with 0:00 left in Canada extends the period by at least one more play. These timing differences, combined with the fewer downs available for the Canadian offence to earn a first down, lead to spectacularly different end games if the team leading the game has the ball. In American football, if the other team is out of timeouts, running slightly more than 120 seconds (two minutes) off the clock without gaining a first down is possible. In Canadian football, just over 40 seconds can be run off. =Kicker advancing the ball= Canadian football retains much more liberal rules regarding recovery of the ball by members of the kicking team. On any kick, the kicker and any member of the kicker's team behind the kicker at the time of the kick may recover and advance the ball. On a kickoff, since every member of the kicking team must be behind the ball when it is kicked, this effectively makes all 12 players \\"onside\\" and eligible to recover the kick, once it has gone 10 yards downfield. On a punt or missed field goal, usually only the kicker is onside, as no one is behind the kicker. All of the players offside at the time of the kick may neither touch the ball nor be within 5 yards of the member of the receiving team who fields the kick; violation of this rule is a penalty for \\"no yards\\". The penalty for no yards is 15 yards if the kick is in flight and 5 yards if it has been grounded. The American rules are similar for the recovery of kickoffs. Any member of the kicking team may recover the ball once it has touched an opponent or once it has gone 10 yards downfield and touched the ground. The ball is dead when recovered, though the kicking team is awarded possession at the spot of recovery. The American rules differ from the Canadian ones for scrimmage kicks. In American rules, to recover a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal) and retain possession, the ball must be touched beyond the line of scrimmage by a member of the receiving team (defense). If the ball is touched by the receiving team and then recovered by the kicking team, the kicking team retains possession and is awarded a first down. If the receiving team has not touched the ball before the kicking team touches it, it is \\"first touching\\" as described above in fair catches and punt returns. Additionally, members of the kicking team must allow the receiving team the opportunity to catch a scrimmage kick in flight. No distance is required; the NCAA revoked its rule of a 2-yard halo. Once the scrimmage kick has touched the ground, the kicking team is free to recover, subject to the first touching rules. In both codes, a scrimmage kick that is blocked and recovered by the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage is in play. The kicking team may then choose to either attempt another kick or try to advance the ball, but no turnover has taken place on the play (unless a member of the receiving team has control of the ball), and therefore, the kicking team either has to advance the ball to the first-down marker, or loses the down, which often results in a turnover on downs. =Blocking receivers= Under Canadian rules, the defensive line can only hold up or block a receiver within one yard of the scrimmage lines. In the NFL, contact up to 5 yards from the line is allowed. This allows for more open plays in Canadian football. =Fumbles out of bounds= In Canadian play, if the ball is fumbled out of bounds, the play ends with possession going to the team to last contact the ball in bounds (after the ball has completely left the possession of the fumbling ball carrier). A loose ball may be kicked forward (dribbled) provided it is then recovered by a player who is onside at the time of said kick. The ball may not, however, be intentionally kicked out of bounds to gain possession, this is then treated as a scrimmage kick out of bounds and possession goes to the opposing team. Incidental contact with the foot does not count as kicking the ball out of bounds. In American play, when a ball is fumbled out of bounds, the last team to have clear possession of the football is awarded possession, unless the ball goes out of the back or side of the end zone. A team may still lose possession after a fumble out of bounds if the fumble occurred on fourth down (third down in Canadian play) and the ball becomes dead short of the line to gain. Because of plays like the Holy Roller, the NFL changed its rule regarding advancing a fumbled ball on offense. If the offensive team fumbles in the last two minutes of either half, or on fourth down at any time, only the player who fumbled is allowed to advance the ball past the point of the fumble. If any other offensive player advances the ball toward the opponent's goal line, the ball is moved back to the spot of the fumble. If the fumble occurred on fourth down, the defensive team gains possession on downs unless the original fumble occurred after the line to gain had been reached. =Field goals, singles, and touchbacks= In Canadian football, any kick that goes into the end zone is a live ball, except for a successful field goal or if the goalposts are hit while the ball is in flight. If the player receiving the kick fails to return it out of the end zone, or (except on a kickoff) if the ball was kicked through the end zone, then the kicking team scores a single point (rouge), and the returning team scrimmages from its 35-yard line or, if the rouge is scored as a result of a missed field goal attempt, the receiving team may choose the last point of scrimmage. If a kickoff goes through the end zone without a player touching it or a kicked ball in flight hits a post without scoring a field goal, there is no score, and the receiving team scrimmages from its 25-yard line. If the kick is returned out of the end zone, the receiving team next scrimmages from the place that was reached (or if they reach the opponents' goal line, they score a touchdown); in the amateur levels of the game, they are given the ball at their 20-yard line if the kick was not returned that far. Singles do not exist in American football; however, only one point is counted when a safety is scored during a conversion attempt, in contrast to the two points scored on other safeties. American football also allows a defending team to advance a missed field goal; however, because of the absence of singles and the goalpost position at the back of the end zone, the return is rarely exercised, except on a blocked kick, or as time expires in the half or in the game (with the most famous recent example being Chris Davis' game-ending return of a missed field goal for the winning touchdown in the 2013 Alabama‚ÄìAuburn game). Most teams instead elect not to attempt a return and assume possession ‚Äì at the previous line of scrimmage in the NCAA and at the spot of the kick in the NFL. Since the goalpost is out of bounds, any nonscoring kick that strikes the goalpost is dead, and the receiving team takes over possession from the spot of the kick or their own 20-yard line, whichever is further from the receiving team's goal. Likewise, any kickoff or punt that either is kicked through the end zone, is kicked into the end zone and rolls out of bounds (without being touched by a player), is touched in the end zone by a member of the kicking team (with no member of the receiving team having touched it), or is downed in the end zone by a member of the receiving team, results in a touchback. The placement of the ball after a touchback varies by rule set and game situation. Under high school rules, the receiving team is awarded possession on its own 20-yard line in all situations. In the NCAA and NFL, the ball is moved to the 20-yard line following a punt, and to the 25-yard line following a kickoff, or free kick after a safety. Under NCAA rules (but not those of the NFL), a kickoff or free kick after a safety that ends in a fair catch by the receiving team inside its own 25-yard line is treated as a touchback, with the ball moved to the 25. If a player of the receiving team fields a kickoff or punt in the end zone, he has the option to down it in the end zone (resulting in a touchback) or to try to advance the ball. Following a successful field goal, in Canadian rules, the team scored upon has the option of receiving a kickoff, kicking off from its 35-yard line, or scrimmaging at its own 35-yard line (the CFL first instituted this rule in 1975, but eliminated this last option for the 2009 season, but it was reinstated for 2010). In American football, a kickoff is performed by the scoring team after every score, with the exception of safeties. The option for the scored-upon team to kick off after a touchdown exists in American amateur football, but it is very rarely exercised. Open-field kick Canadian football retains the open-field kick as a legal play, allowing a kick to be taken from anywhere on the field. The open- field kick may be used as a desperation last play by the offense; realizing they are unable to go the length of the field, they advance part of the way and attempt a drop kick, trying to score a field goal, or recover the ball in the end zone for a touchdown.The Stampeders attempted this on the final play against the Argonauts, Sept 21, 2013. Stampeders Come Short. Like a punt or missed field goal, the team receiving the kick is allowed a 5-yard buffer to recover the kick. Conversely, the defence, facing a last-second field goal attempt in a tie game or game they lead by one point, often positions its punter and place-kicker in the end zone. If the field goal is missed, they can punt the ball back into the field of play and not concede a single. Multiple such kicks may be attempted on the same play. During the October 29, 2010, Toronto Argonauts game against the Montreal Alouettes, four kicks occurred in one play; after a Montreal missed field goal, the Argonauts punted from the end zone to about the 20-yard line. The ball was caught and immediately punted back to the end zone by Montreal to attempt a single, and finally the Argos punted, but failed to kick it out of the end zone, where the Alouettes recovered it for a touchdown. American football only allows free kicks and scrimmage kicks made from behind the line of scrimmage; any kick beyond the line of scrimmage or after change of possession would result in a penalty. (Some levels of American football allow the rare fair catch kick, which according to the NFL rules is neither a free kick nor scrimmage kick, but sui generis.) =Safeties= In both American and Canadian football, a safety (or safety touch) awards two points to the defending team if the offensive team is brought down in their end zone. In American football, the team giving up the safety must take a \\"free kick\\" from their own 20-yard line. In Canadian football, the team being awarded the two points has the option of scrimmaging from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their own 35-yard line, or having the opposing team kick off the ball from their own 35-yard line. In 2009, the CFL changed the last option to be a kick-off from their own 25-yard line. =Points after touchdown= In both games, after a touchdown is scored, the scoring team may then attempt one play for additional points. In Canadian football, this play is called a \\"convert\\", and in American football, it is formally called a try or attempt, although it is more commonly referred to as either a conversion, extra point, or point after touchdown (PAT). The additional points may be earned through a kick or a play from scrimmage. If done via kick, the scoring team gains one point, and if done from a scrimmage, the scoring team gains two. However, the position of the ball for attempts is different in the two games. Point-after-touchdown attempts are snapped from the following points (as of the 2015 season):. * NFL: 15-yard line for placekick attempts (for a 33-yard attempt), 2-yard line for two-point conversion attempts * Amateur American football (all levels): 3-yard line for all attempts * CFL: 25-yard line for placekick attempts (for a 32-yard attempt), 3-yard line for two-point conversion attempts * Amateur Canadian football (all levels): 5-yard line for all attempts Because the goalposts are on the goal line in Canada and the end line in the United States, a CFL kicker is at the same distance from the goalposts as an NFL kicker. Before the 2015 CFL season, that league used the 5-yard line for all attempts (for a 12-yard attempt), which meant that the Canadian kicker was closer to the goalposts than an American kicker at any level. Amateur Canadian kickers remain closer to their goalposts than their American counterparts. Also prior to 2015, the NFL's line of scrimmage for extra points was the 2-yard line (for a 20-yard attempt). According to the rules of both the NFL and NCAA, on conversion attempts, the ball is automatically spotted in the middle of the field at the appropriate scrimmage line unless a member of the kicking team expressly asks a referee for an alternative placement. Per the rules, the ball can be placed at another spot between the hash marks (especially for strategic positioning on a two-point conversion attempt) or at another spot further back from the 2-, 3-, or 15-yard line (not uncommon at lower levels of football, since as the season progresses, conditions may worsen toward the center of the field, especially at the spot from which the PAT is usually kicked; the kicker may thus request a spot where the footing is surer). During conversions, the ball is considered live in the CFL, American collegiate football, Texas high schools, the now-defunct NFL Europa, and starting with the 2015 season the NFL itself. As such, this allows the defensive team to gain two points on an interception or fumble return should they reach the kicking team's end zone, or (in the CFL) one point should the defensive team make an open-field drop kick through the kicking team's goalposts. Conversely, in other levels of American football and amateur Canadian football, defensive teams cannot score during a try. The use of small, rubberized \\"tees\\" for field goal/extra point converts (not the same as the kickoff tee; such \\"tees\\" use 1\\" or 2\\" varieties) varies depending on the level of play. Unlike in the lower ranks of football up to the college level (in both the American and Canadian game), the NFL has never allowed the use of the \\"tees\\" for field goal attempts, having always required kickers to kick off the ground for such attempts; In 1948, the NCAA authorized the use of a small rubberized kicking tee for field goals and extra points, but banned them by 1989, requiring all such kicks from off the ground. The Canadian Football League, despite its status as a professional league, does allow for the use of such a tee for field goals and convert kicks, but it is optional, as kickers can also kick off the ground if they so desire. =Runner down= In Canadian amateur football, the ball is not dead if a player kneels momentarily to, and does, recover a rolling snap, onside/lateral pass, or opponent's kick, while in American amateur football, such a situation produces a dead ball, unless the player is the holder for a place kick. The holder is allowed to catch the snap or recover a rolling snap while on a knee to hold the kick and may also rise to catch a high snap and immediately return to a knee. At professional levels in both games, unless it is a clearly willful kneel or slide by a ball carrier to go down, a player must be touched while on the ground, otherwise, the player may stand up and continue to advance the ball. Hitting a player who is kneeling, sliding, or clearly intends to run the ball out of bounds (especially quarterbacks) is generally viewed as unsportsmanlike and is often penalized, and in the most blatant of cases (especially if it happens in the dying seconds of a game), the player may be subject to off-field disciplinary action by their respective league governing body, usually in the form of fines or suspensions. =Overtime= The procedures to settle games that are tied at the end of regulation vary considerably among football leagues. Most leagues other than the NFL, including the CFL, use a procedure frequently called the \\"Kansas Playoff\\", so named because it was first developed for high school-football in that state. The rules are summarized here: * A coin toss at the start of overtime determines the team that first receives possession in overtime, and which end zone will be used. * Each team in turn receives one possession starting with first-and-10 at a fixed point on the field, which varies according to league: ** US college: Opponent's 25-yard line for the first four overtime procedures. *** Each procedure after the fourth consists of a single scrimmage play from the opponent's 3-yard line, with kicks banned. Successful plays in this situation are scored as two-point conversions. ** US high school (also British Columbia, where high schools play under American rules): Standard rules call for the opponent's 10-yard line, but state/provincial associations are free to use different yardage. The short-lived Alliance of American Football also used the opponent's 10-yard line. ** CFL: Opponent's 35-yard line * The game clock does not run, but the play clock is enforced. * At all levels, possessions end when the offensive team scores, misses a field goal, or turns the ball over. Touchdowns are followed by a conversion attempt, with the following additional caveats: ** US college: Teams must attempt a two-point conversion starting with the third overtime procedure. Starting with the fifth overtime procedure, all plays are two-point conversion attempts, and scored as such. ** CFL and AAF: A convert kick is not allowed in overtime‚Äîall conversion attempts must be scrimmage plays (i.e., two-point attempts). ** US and BC high school: Standard rules call for no restrictions on the type of conversion attempt, but some state/provincial associations may limit the use of kick tries. * Ability of defensive team to score after gaining possession on a turnover: ** US college, CFL, AAF, Texas high school: Can advance the ball upon gaining possession; if it scores a touchdown, it will satisfy the condition of each team having a chance to score and thus end the game. ** US and BC high school (except Texas): Possession ends immediately. * Each team receives one charged timeout per overtime procedure except in the CFL and AAF, which allow(ed) no timeouts in overtime. * If the score remains tied at the end of an overtime procedure, another procedure follows (except as noted below), with the team that had the second possession in the previous procedure having the first possession of the next procedure. * Limit on number of overtime procedures: ** US college and high school: No limit; procedures continue until a winner is decided. ** CFL: In regular season games, maximum of two procedures, with the game declared a tie if it remains level. In postseason games, procedures continue until a winner is decided. ** AAF: Same as CFL, except that only one procedure was allowed in regular-season games. The league folded without holding any playoff games. One aspect of the AAF overtime rules was unique to that league‚Äîfield goals were prohibited during overtime. The NFL overtime is a modified sudden- death period of 15 minutes, for playoff games only; since the 2017 season, overtime periods in the preseason and regular season are 10 minutes, as part of an overall effort by the NFL to speed up games and reduce their length. If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, or the defensive team scores a safety, the game ends at that point. If the receiving team scores a field goal, the game continues with the scoring team kicking off, and the scored-upon team having a chance at possession. If that team scores a touchdown, or loses possession, the game ends; if it scores a field goal, overtime continues, with the next score by either team ending the game. In the regular season, if a game remains tied after the 10-minute period, it is declared a tie. In postseason games, there are multiple 15-minute periods until a winner is decided. The overtime protocol of the second XFL, now also defunct, was significantly different from that of other leagues, being most similar to that used in US college football after that rule set's fourth overtime procedure: * Overtime consisted of a five-round \\"shootout\\" of two- point conversion attempts. * No coin toss was used to determine the first possession‚Äîthe visiting team started all rounds on offense. * The defense could not score on a conversion attempt. * The first defensive penalty against a team during a round resulted in the ball being moved to the 1-yard line. A second defensive penalty in that round resulted in a score being awarded to the offensive team. * Pre-snap offensive penalties were enforced according to regular rules. Post-snap offensive penalties ended that side's offensive round, with no score. * All five rounds were played unless one team attained an insurmountable lead. If the game was still tied after five rounds, extra rounds were played until the tie was broken. =Other differences= In American high school and college football, as well as at all levels of Canadian football, receivers need only have one foot in bounds (provided the player's other foot does not come down out of bounds until the catch is made) for a catch to count as a reception. NFL play requires receivers to get both feet on the ground and in bounds after making the catch for a reception to count. Up through the 2007 season, an NFL official could award a catch if it was judged that the receiver would have come down in bounds if he had not been pushed by a defender. This rule was based on a judgment call by the official, and was criticized for being inconsistent. The rule was dropped prior to the 2008 season by the NFL. * In Canadian football, defensive pass interference may be called on any legal forward pass, even when the receiver is behind the line of scrimmage. Pass interference rules in all levels of American football do not apply until the thrown ball crosses the neutral zone. * Until 2010, when a forward pass was deemed to be \\"uncatchable\\", defensive interference with the intended receiver was penalized in Canadian football. This rule was dropped for 2010, bringing it in line with long-standing practice in American college and professional football. CFL roster sizes are 46 players (rather than 53 as in the NFL, though only 45 will dress for a game). A CFL team may dress up to 44 players, composed of 21 \\"nationals\\" (essentially, Canadians), 20 \\"internationals\\" (almost exclusively Americans), and 3 quarterbacks. The traditional NFL football season runs from the 2nd week of September until late December or the start of January, with the NFL playoffs occurring in January and February. In contrast, the CFL regular season runs from late June to late October. This is in order to ensure the Grey Cup playoffs can be completed in mid-November, before the harsh Canadian winters set in. This is an important consideration for a sport played in outdoor venues in locations such as Regina, Edmonton and Winnipeg. Officials' penalty flags used in the CFL are orange in color. In American football, officials typically use yellow penalty flags. Conversely, coaches' challenge flags for replays are yellow in the CFL as opposed to red in the NFL. In American leagues, the referee wears a solid white cap, and the other officials wear black with white piping. Until 2018 in the CFL, the referee wore a black cap with white piping, and the other officials wore white caps with black piping; starting with the 2019 season, the referee now wears a white cap with black piping, and the other officials wear black ones with white piping, almost mirroring the American convention (and matching the standard for the lower levels of the game in Canada). Additionally, when announcing penalties, in American football, the penalized team is announced using generic terms (\\"offense\\"/\\"defense\\", for example), but in Canadian football (especially the CFL) the penalized team is announced by their respective city or province. The CFL regular season comprises 18 games since 1986, while the NFL regular season has consisted of 16 games since 1978. There are several radical differences concerning how the leagues calculate regular season records and how ties in the standings are broken: * The CFL awards two points for a win, one point for a tie and zero points for a loss (from 2000 to 2002 inclusive, the CFL also awarded one point for an overtime loss). The CFL ranking system is in keeping with the traditional system in most other football codes of British origin, and is also the basis for the system used in hockey. The NFL by contrast officially ranks its teams strictly by winning percentage, with ties counting as a \\"half-win\\" for the purposes of calculating winning percentage. Prior to 1972, ties were ignored altogether for the purposes of calculating NFL winning percentages, which actually made them more valuable than a \\"half-win\\": teams with a winning record including ties had an advantage in terms of earning a better winning percentage for the purposes of playoff qualification and teams with a losing record including ties had an advantage in terms of earning better draft position. In all competitions in both countries, it is popular for team records to be expressed in a simple \\"W-L\\" format, or in a \\"W-L-T\\" format if (and only if) there are ties in the team's record. * The CFL nominally awards three playoff berths per division while the NFL awards a playoff berth to each of its division winners (four per conference) and two wild card berths per conference. The CFL allows the possibility of a fourth place team in one division to \\"cross over\\" in place of the third place team of the other division, but only if it has a better record than the third place team. Also, even though the CFL has an unequal number of teams per division there is no possibility of the fifth place team in the West Division qualifying, even if it finishes outright fifth or sixth overall. By contrast, an NFL team finishing second in its division receives no special advantage should it finish tied with a third place team in another division for the final wild card berth. Beyond that, the tie-breaking criteria are radically different (although they both culminate in an as-yet- unused coin toss should all criteria be exhausted). For example, the CFL's first tie-breaker is number of wins, whereas number of wins is not an NFL tie- breaking criterium in itself, meaning an NFL team with no ties would have neither an advantage nor a disadvantage over another team with one less win and two ties, assuming they played the same number of games. Strategic and tactical differences Although the rules of Canadian and American football have similarities, the differences have a great effect on how teams play and are managed. =Red-zone management= The red zone is an unofficial term designating the portion of the field between the 20-yard line and the goal line. Due to the goalposts' being on the goal line in Canadian football, teams must avoid hitting the goalposts. Thus most touchdown throws are aimed away from the centre portion of the end zone. In the CFL, the goalposts have the same construction as the NFL posts, with the centre post being about 2 yards deep in the end zone. It is extremely rare for CFL passes to hit any part of the posts. When this occurs, a dead ball results. Occasionally, receivers can use the post to good effect in a 'rub' play to shed a defender. End zone passing becomes even more complicated when the corners of the end zone are truncated, as is the case at stadia where the field is bounded by a running track. However, the offensive team enjoys a counteracting advantage of end zones more than twice the size of those in American football (20 yards with a wider field), significantly expanding the area that must be covered by the defensive team and also allowing the freedom to run some pass patterns not available in American football's red zone. Moreover, the rule requiring only a single foot to be in bounds upon pass reception in Canadian football further stretches the amount of area that the offenses have to work with. NFL offenses generally try a run between tackles when on the one-yard line. CFL offenses make similar attempts on first down on the one-yard line, but second and third down attempts, if required, can be much more varied than their NFL counterparts. =Special teams= The frequency of punts is highly dependent upon the success, or lack thereof, of the offense. Punt returns are ubiquitous in Canadian football because the \\"no-yards\\" rule permits virtually every punt to be fielded and returned. Moreover, if the kicking team punts the ball out of bounds in an attempt to forestall a return and the ball goes out of bounds between the two 20-yard lines without touching the ground first, a 10-yard penalty is assessed and the ball advanced from where it left play, or the kicking team is backed up 10 yards and must replay the down. \\"Shanked\\" punts are therefore extremely costly to the kicking team. Though missed field goals may be returned in both national rule sets, the deeper end zone and goal post positioning make this much more common in Canadian rules. TSN on-air analysts state that they are the single play-from-scrimmage most likely to result in a touchdown. This set of special teams play (field goal return units) are rare in the American game to the point where a returner is not a standard part of a defensive field goal unit and will only be seen in unusual circumstances, with one especially notable example being the famous \\"Kick Six\\" college football game in 2013. Canadian kickoffs rarely result in a touchback, so special teams are more prominent in that area of the game as well. The difference in the games' final minutes procedures make comebacks‚Äîand the need for an onside kick 'hands' team‚Äîmore prominent as well. The rule regarding last touch of the ball before leaving the play of field, rather than American football's last possession rule, makes the onside kick more likely to be successful as well. The most complex coaching job in Canadian football is said to be that of special teams co-ordinator. As many as 40 of a CFL roster of players may have a special teams role because of the wide variety of possible situations. In 2014 and 2015, the Edmonton Eskimos even used their third-string quarterbacks (Pat White in 2014 and Jordan Lynch in 2015) as part of their kick and kick- coverage teams. This is highly unusual, as quarterbacks are generally discouraged from making contact plays. Kick returning was a duty generally handled by a player with another role, such as receiver or defensive back. Henry \\"The Gizmo\\" Williams was the first player designated by telecasts as \\"KR\\" for a kicker returner position as his duties were almost entirely for that role, and referring to him as \\"WR\\" for wide receiver was increasingly seen as anachronistic. By far the greatest kick returner in professional football history, Gizmo Williams had more returns for touchdowns called back for infractions than any other player has ever scored (28: 26 punts, 2 kick- offs). No NFL player has enjoyed similar success and the careers of such specialists (like Devin Hester) come nowhere near to matching the impact on the game that such players have in the CFL. =Management of offensive drives= Canadian teams have only three downs to advance the ball ten yards compared to four downs in the American game. With one fewer down, Canadian teams must try for the big gain. For this reason, Canadian teams usually prefer passing over rushing to a greater extent than American, since pass attempts generally tend to gain more yards than rushing. This makes the action in Canadian football more open than is the case in the American game. Offensive drives (continuous possession of the ball) tend to be shorter. Having three downs on a much longer and wider field with unlimited backfield motion results in Canadian teams requiring faster, more nimble athletes (comparatively) than their American counterparts. Paradoxically, this makes Canadian defense better at defending rushing plays. Rushing plays tend to be unlikely to produce a full ten-yard gain, and if correctly anticipated by the defense, much gain at all. The fewer downs means that an unsuccessful rushing play leaves an offense to have a single play to make comparatively longer first down yardage, so rushing plays are less favored unless the team on offense is actively managing the clock while maintaining the lead. Pundits often like to claim that a Canadian team that rushes for 100 yards or more per game is likely to win, but the reality is winning teams rush the ball in defense of their leads, and not as a tactic to produce drives that lead to points unless they are markedly superior to their opponents. The larger field generally permits greater YAC (yards after catch) on each individual catch, where the NFL produces passing plays that either result in immediate tackles for relatively few YAC, or huge gains resulting from missed tackles or broken coverage. In theory, an NFL team taking possession on their own one-yard line, using three downs for each first-down conversion and the full 40 second clock could run 27 plays and consume a full 18 minutes of clock time covering the 99 yards. A CFL team doing something similar (two plays per conversion, 20 second clock, average 10 seconds of clock time while the officials reset the ball between plays, 109 yards) would run 24 plays and consume 12 minutes of clock at the most. One other notable difference is the propensity of CFL quarterbacks to rush the ball, both by design and as a result of reacting to the defense. Damon Allen (the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen) had 11,920 rushing yards to go along with 72,381 passing yards in his 23-year career and actually sits third overall in career rushing yards. Contrast that with Randall Cunningham's 4928 yards over 16 seasons. 1000-yard rushing seasons for CFL quarterbacks have occurred, and 400-yard seasons for playoff-bound teams' starting quarterbacks, if they remain healthy for the entire schedule, are not unusual. =Backfield motion= Perhaps the greatest difference arises due to the virtually unlimited movement allowed in the defensive and offensive backfields on a play from scrimmage in the Canadian game vs. very restricted offensive movement in the American game. Combined with the much larger field size, this difference changes the skillsets required of the athletes. Canadian wide receivers, safeties and cornerbacks are far enough from the point where the ball is snapped that they rarely participate in rush offense or defense. Linebackers can be called upon to successfully defend running backs sent to receive passes. There is therefore a much greater premium placed on athletic speed, with former Edmonton Eskimos GM and former wide receiver Ed Hervey (, , All- American at USC in the 200 meter) and Malcolm Frank ( ) being prototypical for the CFL. The offence has many more formation options and starting positions, forcing the defence to anticipate more possibilities. Seven of the 12 men on a CFL offense (typically the five linemen and the wide receivers) must be at the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, and the other five must be at least one yard behind the line. Only the quarterback and linemen must be motionless at the time of the snap, allowing up to six players to be moving toward or along the line at varying speeds (typically the wide receivers are still or at a walking pace at the snap to ensure they are at the line of scrimmage.) =Late comebacks= In both the college and pro games, an offensive team with the lead has more difficulty in running out the clock in the Canadian game. In the Canadian Football League, the clock is stopped while the officials place the ball, and then they whistle the game clock and play clock to begin in the last minutes of a half; whereas in the National Football League the clock remains running while the officials set the ball (dependent upon the result of the previous play‚Äîpenalty, incomplete pass, out-of-bounds, or tackle inbounds in both leagues) while the play clock of 40 seconds runs down. The game clock only begins again when the play is whistled in, for an inbounds tackle, or at the snap of the ball for the other outcomes in the CFL. A team that is ahead has one fewer opportunity to kill clock time in the Canadian game with three downs, and can only take the play clock time (20 seconds) and the length of the play itself off the clock with each down. On the other hand, Canadian teams only receive one timeout per half, as opposed to three in American football. After the three-minute warning, a penalty of a loss of down (on first and second down, 10 yards on third down) results for failing to start the new play in time (time count violation). Additionally, if a Canadian team commits a time count violation on third down, the referee has the right to require that it legally start a new play before the play clock expires, and can award possession to the defending team if another time count is committed. Moreover, in any quarter, when the game clock expires while the ball is dead in Canadian football, a final play must be run with \\"zeros on the clock\\" before the quarter ends, whereas in American football the expiration of time while the ball is dead immediately ends the quarter (including overtime periods in such cases where those periods are timed). In American football, it is common (or even, arguably, expected) for teams including coaching staffs and other such personnel to come on the field in order to shake hands, etc. before the game clock officially expires, especially in cases where the trailing team does not have possession of the ball, has no timeouts left and the result of the final play of the game left the clock running with less than forty seconds left. The main caveats are that in all gridiron codes, a half cannot end on any penalty accepted by the non-penalized team even if there is no time remaining on the clock, and a team may always elect to attempt a conversion after a touchdown even if time is expired, so it is always possible for a final play to run with \\"zeros on the clock\\" under such circumstances. If a team that is trailing in the CFL can begin to produce two-and-outs on defense and efficient scoring drives on offense, 14 and even 17 points can be successfully scored in the final three minutes. This comeback proclivity is so pronounced that the CFL uses it for marketing purposes: No Lead Is Safe.http://cfl.ca/noleadissafe See also * American football * American football rules * National Football League (NFL) * Canadian football * Canadian football rules * Canadian Football League (CFL) * Comparison of American football and rugby league * Comparison of American football and rugby union * Glossary of American football * Glossary of Canadian football * Rugby football References * Wilson Sporting Goods * Arena Football League 101 External links * CFL Official Playing Rules * NFL.com Rulebook * Comparison of CFL and NFL rules Category:History of American football Category:History of Canadian football American and Canadian football ","title":"Comparison of American and Canadian football"},{"id":"1136590","text":"Jamsheed Marker, Hilal-e-Imtiaz Award (Crescent of Excellence) Award (24 November 1922 - 21 June 2018), was a Pakistani diplomat with a 42-year diplomatic career.Jamsheed Marker Leading Pakistani Diplomat dies at 95 (New York Times).

He was appointed Ambassador to the United States in 1986 and helped negotiate the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr. Marker, in his 2010 memoir \\"Quiet Diplomacy,\\" described contacts with official and unofficial representatives from both the United States and the Soviet Union, where he had also been ambassador. Pakistan was playing a key role in the negotiations. He also worked closely with the Pakistani military dictator General Zia Ul-Haq as the general developed the country‚Äôs clandestine nuclear weapons program. In 1999, he served as United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Representative to East Timor.. Annan is reported to have hailed Marker's \\"empathy for both sides in the talks\\"., p. 1A. The Portuguese foreign minister praised Marker's \\"sophisticated and calm approach\\" while the Indonesian foreign minister said Marker's \\"diplomatic skills smoothed the way whenever there was a 'snag in the negotiations'\\". Mr. Marker chronicled his experiences in his 2003 book \\"East Timor: A Memoir of the Negotiations for Independence.\\" The British journalist Richard Lloyd Parry, in his book In the Time of Madness,Lloyd Parry, Richard, In the Time of Madness, Cape, 2005, p. 254. recalls Marker's words of praise for the Indonesian police and the \\"superb leadership\\" of their commander Timbul Silaien after the referendum on independence for East Timor and its bloody preamble. Within days, these same Indonesian security forces were engaged in the deportation and, in some cases, the killing of East Timorese. Mr. Marker also served as ambassador in France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, West Germany and East Germany ‚Äî where he opened the Pakistani Embassy. Despite being a non-Muslim in conservative Muslim Pakistan, he was broadly respected at home and had close relationships with several leaders of the country.

During that time, he also founded the Ethnology Cinema Project in New York, which is dedicated to preserving films that document disappearing traditional cultures. After moving to Europe in 1995, in addition to creating exhibitions, Palestine performed regularly, re-releasing older material and developing new videos and sonic projects.

She led a community of formerly enslaved Africans called the Windward Maroons. In the early 18th century, under the leadership of Nanny, the Windward Maroons fought a guerrilla war over many years against British authorities in the Colony of Jamaica in what became known as the First Maroon War. Much of what is known about her comes from oral history, as little textual evidence exists. According to Maroon legend, Queen Nanny was born in what is today Ghana of the Akan or Fanti people. According to the oral tradition and at least one documentary source, she was never enslaved. Although widely assumed that she arrived in Jamaica as a slave, how she arrived in Jamaica is not certain. During the years of warfare, the British suffered significant losses in their encounters with the Windward Maroons of eastern Jamaica. Maroons attributed their mastery over the British to the successful use of supernatural powers by Nanny. Having failed to defeat them on the battle field, the British sued for peace signing a treaty with them on April 20, 1740. The treaty stopped the hostilities, provided for state sanctioned freedom for the Maroons, and granted 500 acres of land to Nanny and her followers. The village built on the land grant still stands and today is called Moore Town. It is also known as the New Nanny Town. Modern members of the Moore Town celebrate April 20, 1740 as a holiday. In 1975, the government of Jamaica declared Nanny as their only female national hero celebrating her success as a leader, military tactician and strategist. Her image is also on the Jamaican $500 bill which is called a Nanny.  The origins of Nanny  According to Maroon legend, Nanny was born into the Fanti/Fante nation about 1686 in what is now Ghana, West Africa. There are several versions of her early story. It is not clear from objective sources which is accurate. In one story, she came as a free woman who may have even had her own slaves. In another, she came to Jamaica as a slave but then escaped, perhaps even jumping off of the ship while it was off shore. However, the oral traditions about her arrival in Jamaica maintain that she was always free. Another version of her life tells that she was of royal African blood and came to Jamaica as a free woman. She may have been married to a Maroon man named Adou, but had no known children who survived.  The Jamaican Maroons  The Maroons are descendants of West Africans, mainly people from the Akan Fante people. They were known as Coromantie or Koromantee, and were considered ferocious fighters. A number of slaves originated from other regions of Africa, including Nigeria, the Congo and Madagascar. However, the origin of at least half of slaves in Jamaica during the early English colonisation of the island is uncertain. After being brought to Jamaica in the course of the Transatlantic slave trade, many slaves fled from the oppressive conditions of plantations and formed their own communities in the rugged, hilly interior of the island. People who escaped from slavery joined these Maroons communities in the mountains of eastern Jamaica, or the Cockpit Country in the west of the island. Up to the 1650s under Spanish rule, slaves escaped and intermarried with the native islanders, the Taino or Arawak people, in their communities in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica), located in Portland Parish and Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica, in the eastern end of the island.Agorsah, E. Kofi, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180‚Äì1.  Windward Maroons  In 1655, following the Invasion of Jamaica, the English captured Jamaica from the Spaniards, but many Spanish slaves became free under Spanish Maroon leaders such as Juan de Bolas and Juan de Serras. The Spanish left, freeing their slaves in the process, and they joined the Windward Maroon communities. These formerly enslaved people, with their ranks enhanced with escaped and liberated slaves, became the core of the Windward Maroons. They staged a prolonged fight against English subjugation and enslavement. Later in the 17th century, more slaves escaped joining the two main bands of Windward and Leeward Maroons. By the early 18th century, these Maroon towns were headed respectively by Nanny, who shared the leadership of the eastern Maroons with Quao, and Captain Cudjoe and Accompong in the west.Campbell, 1990. The Windward Maroons fought the British on the east side of the island from their villages in the Blue Mountains of Portland. The community raised animals, hunted, and grew crops. Maroons at Nanny Town and similar communities survived by sending traders to the nearby market towns to exchange food for weapons and cloth. It was organized very much like a typical Asante society in Africa. From 1655 until they signed peace treaties in 1739 and 1740, these Maroons led most of the slave rebellions in Jamaica, helping to free slaves from the plantations. They raided and then damaged lands and buildings held by plantation owners.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), pp. 117‚Äì257. The Maroons were also known for raiding plantations for weapons and food, burning the plantations, and leading freed slaves to join their mountain communities. Nanny was highly successful at organizing plans to free slaves. During a period of 30 years, she was credited with freeing more than 1000 slaves, and helping them to resettle in the Maroon community.  The First Maroon War  By 1720, Nanny and Quao, sometimes called her brother, settled and controlled an area in the Blue Mountains. It was later given the name Nanny Town, and it had a strategic location overlooking Stony River via a 900-foot (270 m) ridge, making a surprise attack by the British very difficult. Nanny became a folk hero among the Maroons and the slaves. While the British captured Nanny Town on more than one occasion, they were unable to hold on to it, in the wake of numerous guerrilla attacks from the Maroons. The Maroons waged a successful war against the British colonial forces over the course of a decade.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), pp. 117‚Äì257. When Nanny Town was abandoned, the Windward Maroons under the command of Nanny moved to New Nanny Town. Between 1728 and 1734, during the First Maroon War, Nanny Town and other Maroon settlements were frequently attacked by British forces. They wanted to stop the raids and believed that the Maroons prevented settlement of the interior. According to some accounts, in 1733 many Maroons of Nanny Town travelled across the island to unite with the Leeward Maroons. In 1734, a Captain Stoddart attacked the remnants of Nanny Town, \\"situated on one of the highest mountains in the island\\", via \\"the only path\\" available: \\"He found it steep, rocky, and difficult, and not wide enough to admit the passage of two persons abreast.\\"Edwards, vol. 1, p. 525. In addition to the use of the ravine, resembling what Jamaicans call a \\"cockpit\\", the Maroons also used decoys to trick the British into ambushes. A few Maroons would run out into view of the British and then run in the direction of fellow Maroons who were hidden and would attack. After falling into these ambushes several times, the British retaliated. According to planter Bryan Edwards (politician), who wrote his narrative half a century later, Captain Stoddart \\"found the huts in which the negroes were asleep\\", and \\"fired upon them so briskly, that many were slain in their habitations\\". However, recent evidence shows that the number of Windward Maroons killed by Stoddart in his attack on Nanny Town was in single digits.  Military Tactics  The Windward Maroons' success against a much superior and better armed enemy was a testament to the great skill their leader, Nanny, possessed. One of their advantages over the British was their long-range communications capability. They pioneered the use of a cow horn called an abeng. This horn with a hole drilled in one end was used for long range communications. Its signals allowed Maroon lookouts to communicate over great distances, and they were not understood by the British who had no similar communications capability. Nanny's troops were masters of camouflage. The soldiers were so proficient at disguising their location that the British soldiers circulated tales of trees in the forest becoming alive and cutting one's head off. Besides the physical aspects of camouflage the Maroons became experts in slowing their breathing so as not to reveal their presence to someone in their vicinity. The maroons also developed ways of creating stealthy fires that were not readily visible. The Windward Maroons were innovators in guerrilla warfare. They used surprise, the knowledge of the terrain, and cleverly chosen positions in their fight against the British. Their village was located in rugged territory with only one way in. That one way in was a narrow path that was only wide enough for one person. Soldiers trying to attack arrayed in a single file were easily ambushed. To heighten the enemy's fear, Nanny's forces never killed all of the attacking force. She would always allow a remnant to live to return to base to relay the story and horror of the encounter.  Treaty  When the British signed a treaty with Cudjoe in 1739, this success allowed them to offer a less favourable treaty to the Windward Maroons. Representatives of the British governor in Jamaica signed a treaty with the Windward Maroons in 1740, between the colonial authorities and Quao, who later became one of the leaders of Crawford's Town. This treaty between the colonial authorities and Quao's Maroons made no mention of how much land would be allocated to Crawford's Town. As a result, a number of disputes occurred between planters and the Maroons of Crawford's Town, and later the succeeding towns of Charles Town and Scott's Hall. In response, the Assembly of Jamaica often tried to resolve the land disputes in favour of the Maroons in order to keep the peace.Siva, After the Treaties (2018), pp. 80-2. In addition, later that year, there was a separate land grant signed with Nanny and the Maroons of Nanny Town, which granted \\"Nanny and the people now residing with her and their heirs ... a certain parcel of Land containing five hundred acres in the parish of Portland ...\\". This land patent consisted of 500 acres (2.4 km¬≤) of land granted by the government to the Maroons of New Nanny Town under a separate 1740 document ending the First Maroon War.Brathwaite, Edward Kamau, Wars of Respect: Nanny, Sam Sharpe and the Struggle for People‚Äôs Liberation (Kingston: API, 1977), p. 10. The rebuilt Nanny Town, later called Moore Town was built on that location. In 1781, the Assembly agreed to purchase another additional 500 acres from neighbouring planter Charles Douglas to increase Moore Town's communal land to 1,000 acres.Siva, After the Treaties (2018), pp. 81-2. The New Nanny Town Maroons, like those of Cudjoe and Quao, agreed not to harbour new runaway slaves, but to help catch them for bounties. The Maroons were also expected to fight for the British in the case of an attack from the French or Spanish. In signing treaties with the Maroons, the British not only made a truce with a troublesome foe but also enlisted that foe in capturing runaway slaves. The colonial authorities initially recognised two Maroon towns: Crawford's Town and Cudjoe's Town, later to be renamed Trelawny Town. Eventually, there were five Maroon towns in the 18th century ‚Äì Accompong Town, Trelawny Town, Charles Town, Jamaica, Scott's Hall (Jamaica), and Nanny Town (later Moore Town) ‚Äì living under their own chiefs with a British supervisor in each town. In exchange, they agreed not to harbour new runaway slaves, but to help catch them for bounties. The Maroons were also expected to fight for the British in the case of an attack from the French or Spanish.Siva, After the Treaties (2018), pp. 40-59.  Moore Town and Tacky's War  New Nanny Town was renamed Moore Town, possibly in 1760 after the governor Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet, during Tacky's War, which the Maroons helped to suppress. The first official reference to Moore Town in the colonial records was in 1760.Journals of the Assembly of Jamaica, Vol. 5, 3 December 1760, p. 227. By 1760, New Nanny Town, now known as Moore Town, was under the command of a white superintendent named Charles Swigle, and the Maroon leaders of that town, Clash and Sambo, reported to Swigle, when the superintendent commanded their forces against slave rebels in Tacky's War.Siva, After the Treaties pp. 70‚Äì71. It is possible that Nanny had already died by this time.  A Spiritual Woman  Many in her community attributed Nanny's leadership skills to her Obeah powers.Campbell, 1990. Obeah is an African-derived religion that is still practised in Suriname, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, Belize and other Caribbean countries. It is associated with both good and bad magic, charms, luck, and with mysticism in general. In some Caribbean nations, aspects of Obeah have survived through synthesis with Christian symbolism and practice introduced by European colonials and slave owners. According to Maroon oral history, Nanny's success in defending her people against overwhelming British forces was often attributed to her mysterious supernatural powers. According to legend, Nanny had magical powers, and could catch bullets and then redirect them back at the people who shot at her. Another Maroon legend claims that if any straight haired, white man, goes to the original Nanny Town, he is immediately struck dead.  Death  In the Journal of the Assembly of Jamaica, 29‚Äì30 March 1733, is a citation for \\"resolution, bravery and fidelity\\" awarded to \\"loyal slaves ... under the command of Captain Sambo\\", namely William Cuffee, who was rewarded for having fought the Maroons in the First Maroon War and who is called \\"a very good party Negro, having killed Nanny, the rebels old obeah woman\\".Campbell, p. 177. These hired soldiers were known as \\"Black Shots\\".Campbell, p. 37. However, it is unlikely that Cuffee killed the Nanny who ran Nanny Town, since there is evidence Moore Town was granted to her people under her leadership in 1740.Gottlieb, 2000.Brathwaite, p. 10. Some claim that Queen Nanny lived to be an old woman, dying of natural causes in the 1760s. The exact date of her death remains a mystery. Part of the confusion is that \\"Nanny\\" is an honorific title, and many high-ranking women were called that in Maroon Town. However, the Maroons are adamant that there was only one \\"Queen Nanny.\\"Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 65‚Äì8. According to Maroon oral history, Nanny's remains are buried at \\"Bump Grave\\" in Moore Town.\\"Nanny: hero or appeasement?\\", Daily Gleaner, 16 October 2012 http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121016/cleisure/cleisure4.html Retrieved 22 September 2020.

In other words, Laguerre's method can be used to numerically solve the equation for a given polynomial . One of the most useful properties of this method is that it is, from extensive empirical study, very close to being a \\"sure-fire\\" method, meaning that it is almost guaranteed to always converge to some root of the polynomial, no matter what initial guess is chosen. However, for computer computation, more efficient methods are known, with which it is guaranteed to find all roots (see ) or all real roots (see Real-root isolation). This method is named in honour of Edmond Laguerre, a French mathematician. Definition The algorithm of the Laguerre method to find one root of a polynomial of degree is: * Choose an initial guess * For ** If p(x_k) is very small, exit the loop ** Calculate G = \\\\frac{p'(x_k)}{p(x_k)} ** Calculate H = G^2 - \\\\frac{p(x_k)}{p(x_k)} ** Calculate a = \\\\frac{n}{G \\\\plusmn \\\\sqrt{(n-1)(nH - G^2)}} , where the sign is chosen to give the denominator with the larger absolute value, to avoid loss of significance as iteration proceeds. ** Set x_{k+1} = x_k - a * Repeat until a is small enough or if the maximum number of iterations has been reached. If a root has been found, the corresponding linear factor can be removed from p. This deflation step reduces the degree of the polynomial by one, so that eventually, approximations for all roots of p can be found. Note however that deflation can lead to approximate factors that differ significantly from the corresponding exact factors. This error is least if the roots are found in the order of increasing magnitude. Derivation The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every nth degree polynomial p can be written in the form :p(x) = C(x - x_1)(x - x_2)\\\\cdots(x - x_n), such that x_k where (k=1, 2,..., n) are the roots of the polynomial. If we take the natural logarithm of both sides, we find that :\\\\ln p(x) = \\\\ln C + \\\\ln x - x_1 + \\\\ln x - x_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\ln x - x_n. Denote the derivative by :G = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\ln p(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x - x_1} + \\\\frac{1}{x - x_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{x - x_n}, and the negated second derivative by : H = -\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\\\ln p(x)= \\\\frac{1}{(x - x_1)^2} + \\\\frac{1}{(x - x_2)^2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{(x - x_n)^2}. We then make what Acton calls a 'drastic set of assumptions', that the root we are looking for, say, x_1 is a certain distance away from our guess x, and all the other roots are clustered together some distance away. If we denote these distances by : a = x - x_1 \\\\, and : b = x - x_i,\\\\quad i = 2, 3,\\\\ldots, n then our equation for G may be written as : G = \\\\frac{1}{a} + \\\\frac{n - 1}{b} and the expression for H becomes : H = \\\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\\\frac{n-1}{b^2}. Solving these equations for a, we find that : a = \\\\frac{n}{G \\\\plusmn \\\\sqrt{(n-1)(nH - G^2)}} , where the square root of a complex number is chosen to produce larger absolute value of the denominator, or equivalently, to satisfy: :\\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\,(\\\\overline{G} \\\\sqrt{(n-1)(nH - G^2)}\\\\,)>0, where denotes real part of a complex number, and is the complex conjugate of ; or : a = \\\\frac{p(x)}{p'(x)}\\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac1n+\\\\frac{n-1}n\\\\,\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\,\\\\frac{p(x)p(x)}{p'(x)^2}} \\\\right)^{-1} , where the square root of a complex number is chosen to have a non-negative real part. For small values of this formula differs from the offset of the third order Halley's method by an error of , so convergence close to a root will be cubic as well. Note that, even if the 'drastic set of assumptions' does not work for some particular polynomial , can be transformed into a related polynomial for which the assumptions are correct, e.g. by shifting the origin towards a suitable complex number , giving , to give distinct roots distinct magnitudes if necessary (which it will be if some roots are complex conjugates), and then getting from by repeatedly applying the root squaring transformation used in Graeffe's method enough times to make the smaller roots significantly smaller than the largest root (and so, clustered in comparison); the approximate root from Graeffe's method can then be used to start the new iteration for Laguerre's method on . An approximate root for may then be obtained straightforwardly from that for . If we make the stronger assumption that the terms in corresponding to the roots are negligibly small in comparison to the term corresponding to the root , this leads to Newton's method. Properties Attraction zones of Laguerre's method for polynomial x^4 + 2*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 4*x + 1 If is a simple root of the polynomial , then Laguerre's method converges cubically whenever the initial guess is close enough to the root . On the other hand, if is a multiple root then the convergence is only linear. This is obtained with the penalty of calculating values for the polynomial and its first and second derivatives at each stage of the iteration. A major advantage of Laguerre's method is that it is almost guaranteed to converge to some root of the polynomial no matter where the initial approximation is chosen. This is in contrast to other methods such as the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method which may fail to converge for poorly chosen initial guesses. It may even converge to a complex root of the polynomial, because of the square root being taken in the calculation of above may be of a negative number. This may be considered an advantage or a liability depending on the application to which the method is being used. Empirical evidence has shown that convergence failure is extremely rare, making this a good candidate for a general purpose polynomial root finding algorithm. However, given the fairly limited theoretical understanding of the algorithm, many numerical analysts are hesitant to use it as such, and prefer better understood methods such as the Jenkins‚ÄìTraub algorithm, for which more solid theory has been developed. Nevertheless, the algorithm is fairly simple to use compared to these other \\"sure-fire\\" methods, easy enough to be used by hand or with the aid of a pocket calculator when an automatic computer is unavailable. The speed at which the method converges means that one is only very rarely required to compute more than a few iterations to get high accuracy.

It was discovered as a new species in 1988, and is classified as a guenon, which is a member of the genus Cercopithecus, but was subsequently moved to the genus Allochrocebus. It is closely related to A. preussi and A. Ihoesti, which has been determined by chromosomal analysis. Sun-tailed monkeys prefer shady areas with dense vegetation. However, even after small amounts of logging activity, populations can be unaffected. Much of their diet remains unknown and is still being studied, but they are known to prefer fruit. Their social groups are made up of one male and multiple females. Generally, the sun-tailed monkey is less aggressive towards related individuals, which is noteworthy because it has been found that, in other primate species, aggression rates towards related individuals are generally as high or higher than aggression rates towards non-related individuals. Within their social groups, individual monkeys show preference for their mothers over their fathers, and are overall less aggressive to other monkeys that they are associated with spatially.  Conservation status  The Sun-tailed monkey is a Class B protected species under the African Convention and Appendix II of CITES. The Gabonese government gave it protected status in 1994 and some animals are kept there in captivity. Around 10% of the monkey's habitat is in the Lop√© National Park, but the highest density is at the Foret des Abeilles, which is still unprotected. It is recommended that there should be more monitoring of hunting and logging activity in its habitat, as well as more research into the distribution and biology of the species in general. Occasionally, there have been reports of monkeys raiding crops in local villages. However, there is not much study into how these interactions with humans affect the populations as a whole.  Biochemistry  As one of the most poorly known nonhuman primate species with only one semi-captive population in the world, not much is known about its genome or biochemistry. However, there has been some research conducted into the blood biochemistry of the animal. Blood analysis of the sun-tailed monkey reveals that males show higher levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit than females. Females, however, showed higher levels of cholesterol and had higher neutrophil counts. In general, as the monkey ages, levels of blood urea increase and albumin protein levels decrease, which suggest declining liver, kidney and muscle function through life.

Onscreen, Barger was identified but did not speak in Hells Angels on Wheels (1967) and was one of several members of the Angels who had speaking parts playing themselves in Hell's Angels '69 (1969); he has appeared in several additional films. He also appeared in the Sons of Anarchy television show as Lenny \\"The Pimp\\" Janowitz. Biography =1960s= Barger features prominently in Hunter S. Thompson's book, Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966). Barger and the Hells Angels are also depicted in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), during Ken Kesey's La Honda encampment. Barger was one of the Hells Angels present at the Rolling Stones' Altamont Free Concert in 1969, and appears in the documentary film about the concert: Gimme Shelter (1970). =1980s= In 1983, Barger was diagnosed with throat cancer, after years of heavy smoking. His diagnosis and treatment was at Ft. Miley VA Hospital in San Francisco. Having Stage III Laryngeal Cancer, a Total Laryngectomy with Bilateral Functional Neck Dissections was performed by Michael Tralla MD FACS. Consequently since his vocal cords were removed, he learned to vocalize using the muscles in his esophagus. In 1988, Barger was found guilty of conspiring to blow up the clubhouse of a rival motorcycle club, The Outlaws in Louisville, Kentucky, and spent four years in federal prison in Arizona. =2000s= Sonny Barger remains an active member of the Hells Angels in the Cave Creek, Arizona Chapter, having moved there from Oakland in 1998.Barger (2001) In recent years, Barger has worked to promote motorcycle safety; he co-authored a book on the subject with Darwin Holmstrom (the author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Motorcycles (1998)) titled Let's Ride: Sonny Barger's Guide to Motorcycling (2010). On November 30, 2010, Barger made a guest appearance as Lenny \\"The Pimp\\" Janowitz on the Season 3 finale of the FX television series Sons of Anarchy, about a fictional outlaw motorcycle club, allegedly based on the Hells Angels. Show creator Kurt Sutter spent time with Barger and other members of Hells Angels researching for the show, and acted opposite Barger in his scene.

First published in 1899, the current print edition of the book, the 20th Edition, was published in 2018. In 2014, Merck decided to move The Merck Manual to digital-only, online publication, available in both professional and consumer versions; this decision was reversed in 2017, with the publication of the 20th edition the following year. The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy is one of several medical textbooks, collectively known as The Merck Manuals, which are published by Merck Publishing, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company Merck Co., Inc. in the United States and Canada, and MSD (as The MSD Manuals) in other countries in the world. Merck also formerly published The Merck Index, An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. History and editions The first edition of The Merck Manual was published in 1899 by Merck & Co., Inc. for physicians and pharmacists and was titled Merck‚Äôs Manual of the Materia Medica. Merck's manual of the materia medica, together with a summary of therapeutic indications and a classification of medicaments. New York, Chicago: Merck & Co., 1899 The 192 page book which sold for US $1.00, was divided into three sections, Part I (‚ÄúMateria Medica‚Äù) was an alphabetical listing of all known compounds thought to be of therapeutic value with uses and doses; Part II (‚ÄúTherapeutic Indications‚Äù) was an alphabetical compendium of symptoms, signs, and diseases with a list of all known treatments; and Part III (‚ÄúClassification of Medicaments (sic) According to their Physiologic Actions‚Äù) was a listing of therapeutic agents according to their method of action or drug classification. Many of the terms used are now considered archaic, such as abasia, astasia, errhines and rubefacients - sternutatories, and many of the agents listed are now not considered to be standard therapeutic agents but were considered useful at the time, including poisonous compounds such as mercury, lead, strychnine and arsenic. There were 108 remedies listed for indigestion (dyspepsia), including alcohol, arsenic, cocaine, gold chloride, mercury, morphine, nux vomica, opium, silver nitrate, strychnine, and ‚ÄúTurkish baths (for malaise after dining out)‚Äù. Bismuth, calcium, magnesium salts were also on the list, which are ingredients found in many modern gastrointestinal treatments available today. Arsenic was recommended for over 100 illnesses including anemia, diarrhea, hydrophobia, elephantiasis, and impotence. The formulas include ‚Äúaletris cordial‚Äù, a ‚Äúuterine tonic and restorative‚Äù, which contained ‚Äúaletris farinosa or True Unicorn combined with aromatics‚Äù. The manufacturer, Rio Chemicals of St. Louis was clear to differentiate the inclusion of true unicorn rather than false unicorn in its preparation. The earliest versions did contain drugs that are still in use today for the same purposes, for example digitalis for heart failure;, salicylates for headache rheumatism and fever, nitroglycerin for cardiac angina pectoris;, and bismuth salicylate for diarrhea Merck also began publishing Merck‚Äôs Archives of the Materia Medica, a monthly journal consisting of papers related to drugs and uses, which was available for an annual subscription of US $1.00. Ad for the January 1906 edition of the Merck's Archives The second edition of The Merck Manual was published in 1901, was expanded to 282 pages and included new sections on poisons and antidotes, tables and conversion charts, and a detailed explanation of the metric system.Merck's 1901 Manual of the Materia Medica - A Ready-Reference Pocket Book for the Practicing Physician and Surgeon. New York, Chicago: Merck & Co., 1901 The 5th edition, published in 1923 was delayed due to paper shortages caused by World War I, and the release of the 6th edition was delayed until 1934 due to the Stock Market Crash. The editor of that edition, Dr. M. R. Dinkelspiel had overseen the growth and reorganization of the Manual to discuss specific diseases, diagnosis and treatment options, and external specialists reviewed each section. The 8th edition of the Manual was delayed by World War II until 1950. The 13th edition, released in 1977 was the first time the textbook was produced using magnetic tape and IBM punch cards, the previous version having been typed on a manual typewriter. The Centennial (17th) Edition published in 1999 included a separate facsimile version of the 1899 1st edition. It is reported that both Admiral Richard E. Byrd took the book with him on his expedition to the South Pole in 1929 and Albert Schweitzer had a copy of The Merck Manual with him at his hospital mission in Africa in 1913. The recommended doses given in Part 1 of 1901 edition of The Manual were for adults when given by mouth. It included the following dose adjustment recommendations: =Print editions of The Merck Manual= # 1899 # 1901 # 1905 # 1911 # 1923 # 1934 # 1940 # 1950 # 1956 # 1961 (There were two printings in 1961, June and Nov; a third in Aug 1962 and a fourth in June 1963) # 1966 # 1972 # 1977 # 1982 # 1984 # 1992 (2 million copies sold) # 1999 (Centennial Edition) # 2006 # 2011 # 2018 (current print edition) Content The Merck Manual is organized, like many internal medicine textbooks, into organ systems (see List of Medical Topics below) which discuss each major diseases of that system, covering diagnosis (signs, symptoms, tests), prognosis and treatment. It provides a comprehensive yet concise compendium of medical knowledge into about 3500 pages, by emphasizing practical information of use to a practicing physician. In addition to 24 sections covering medical topics, it includes a pharmacology section listing drugs by generic and brand name, a list of drug interactions and a pill identifier, a News and Commentary section, videos on procedures and examination techniques, quizzes and case histories, clinical calculators, conversion tables and other resources. The text is characterized by the combination of conciseness, completeness, and being up-to-date. It is updated continuously by an independent editorial board and over 300 peer reviewers that contribute to the textbook, which goes through an average of 10 revisions by both internal and external reviewers before publication. The internal editorial staff consists of 4 physician reviews, one executive editor and four non-medical lay editors. The latest version has been translated into 17 languages. In addition to the online version, The Merck Manual Professional Edition is also available as a mobile app in both iOS and Android platforms, produced by Unbound Medicine, Inc. =Medical topic sections (online edition)= K1.

The Merck Manuals were awarded five 2015 eHealthcare Leadership Awards including a Gold Award for Best Healthcare Content for Professionals, and a Distinction Award: Best Overall Healthcare Site, Consumer at the nineteenth annual Healthcare Internet Conference held in November 2015 in Orlando, Florida. Merck Publishing offers resources for ‚ÄúThe Merck Manual Award‚Äù provided annually to outstanding medical students. The qualifications for the award are determined by each medical school. Medical schools that give this award include University of North Carolina School of Medicine, University of Central Florida School of Medicine and the University of Illinois School of Medicine. Other Merck manuals  =The Merck Manual of Geriatrics= First published in 1990, sections of The Merck Manual were made into a separate volume dealing with diseases and management of illnesses in the elderly. It has gone through three print editions, the last version published in 2000. Since the transition of The Merck Manual in 2015 to a web only based version, the Manual of Geriatrics is accessible through the Professional and Consumer portals of the online text. A search engine on the Merck Manual site allows searches limited to the contents of The Merck Manual of Geriatrics. =The Merck Manual of Patient Symptoms= The Merck Manual of Patient Symptoms is a concise, pocket size reference guide intended for medical students and allied health care professionals in training. It covers symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Consumer editions =The Merck Manual of Medical Information ‚Äì Home Edition= The Merck Manual of Medical Information ‚Äì Home Edition was published in 1997 and was a re-edited version of the Professional version using less technical language intended for patients, caregivers and people interested in medical topics without training in health fields. This edition sold over 2 million copies. The Second Home Edition was released in 2003, and the third edition was published in 2009 as The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook, and sold over 4 million copies. Since 2015 the Consumer version content is available only via the online Merck Manual website. A condensed consumer-oriented version was published at The Merck Manual Go-To Home Guide for Symptoms in 2013. =The Merck Manual of Women's and Men's Health= In 2014, The Second Home Edition was extracted from the Professional version of The Manual and published as The Merck Manual of Women's and Men's Health =The Merck Manual of Health & Aging= A consumer version of The Merck Manual of Geriatrics was released in print in 2004 as The Merck Manual of Health & Aging, which included information on aging and the care of older people in non-technical language for the public.

Point coloration refers to animal coat coloration with a pale body and relatively darker extremities, i.e. the face, ears, feet, tail, and (in males) scrotum. It is most recognized as the coloration of Siamese and related breeds of cat, but can be found in dogs, rabbits, rats, sheep, guinea pigs and horses as well. In cats A left A lynx point cat Point coloration in cats originated in the Siamese and closely related Asian breeds, and is found in many Western-developed modern breeds. It is a form of partial albinism resulting from a mutation that affects tyrosinase, an enzyme involved with melanin production. The mutated enzyme is thermolabile; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin. As a result, dark pigment is limited to the coldest areas of the body, that is, the extremities. Pointed kittens are born white, since the womb is uniformly warm. As the kitten ages, the cooler areas darken while warmer areas remain cream to white in color. Points are not limited to solid colors or dark colors. It is possible to have a red (orange color) or fawn (pale warm gray) point. It is also possible to have a tortoiseshell or tabby point. A cat (of any breed) with this coloration is often called a colorpoint cat to distinguish it from others. As the expression of the gene responsible for the pointed pattern is regulated by temperature, pointed cats who live in cooler environments often show increased darkening of their fur relative to cats who live in warmer climates, sometimes even developing large dark areas along their sides. Because of the pigment restriction caused by the temperature sensitive tyrosinase, pointed cat's eyes are always shades of blue because the blue layer in the eye common to all cats is not covered by another color. The back of the eye also lacks pigment, giving colorpoint cats' pupils an eerie red and silver reflection in the dark, unlike a normally pigmented cat's shining silver-green or -blue. The point gene allele is at the C locus, where pure albinism is also carried, and is written as cs. Point is recessive, so two copies of cs, one from each parent, are needed for points to be expressed. Also carried on the C locus is the gene for the sepia pattern. This is the darkest of all of the pigment restricting patterns‚Äîpigment is only paled at the warmest point in the body: the abdomen. The sepia allele is represented by cb. When a cat carries the genes cs and cb, the mink pattern is formed, in which the pigment distribution is between sepia and point. The lynx point pattern is formed by mating a colorpoint cat with a tabby cat (or breeding cats that already possess the lynx point pattern). It is characterized by a mixture of the darkening (reduced) of point coloration with distinct tabby striping on the head, tail, and legs, and an otherwise uniform and comparatively pale body. It is an accepted pattern in some cat registries, but not others, for particular breeds (mostly Siamese- related).Which registries accept lynx-point coloration or other point colorations changes fairly frequently and can be checked with registries‚Äô awards searches, e.g. search for \\"lynx point\\" at the TICA website. Point coloration is inherent to the Siamese breed and some other closely related breeds but with most other breeds the colorpoints (including lynx) were brought into some breed lines long after their establishment, but there are exceptions. For example, lynx point was a feature of some of the foundation stock of the Siberian. =Cat breeds= * Balinese * Birman * British Shorthair * Colorpoint Shorthair * Highlander * Himalayan * Javanese * Napoleon * Peterbald * Ragamuffin * Ragdoll * Siamese * Neva Masquerade * Snowshoe * Thai * Tonkinese In dogs Pointed dogs include pugs, chocolate, Rottweilers, tan, and rare dog colors. In horses A bay horse, showing black points. White markings or other genetic factors may partially or completely mask point coloration in horses. In horses, point coloration is produced by the action of the agouti gene. It acts on the extension gene, when present, to suppress black color to all but the extremities of the horse; the legs, mane, tail and tips of the ears. If the extension gene is not present, the effect of agouti is not visible, as there is no black color present to suppress. Points are most typically seen on a bay-colored horse, which has a black mane, tail, legs, and ear tips while the body and head will show the underlying chestnut or \\"red\\" base color. Point coloration may also be visible on horses with dilution genes that act upon a bay base coat, such as the dun gene and a single copy of the cream gene. Other genes or white markings may affect a horse's coat color in addition to agouti, and if present, can further alter or suppress black hair color and may mask any point coloration. Any horse breed may have point coloration with the exception of a very small number of horse breeds where humans have specifically used selective breeding to eliminate the agouti gene. =Horse coat colors with visible points= * Bay * Bay or \\"Zebra\\" Dun * Buckskin * Bay pinto * Amber Champagne  In rabbits and rodents  Rabbits of the Californian breed showing coats with point coloration. All pointed white rabbits of true breeding have red eyes. The pointed white rabbit is created with the ch gene. Its presentation is typified in the Himalayan rabbit breed (the first rabbit breed with a pointed white coat) and in the Californian breed. =Rabbit coat colors= Some rabbits that appear to be pointed white lack the red eyes, which indicates they are of different breeding.

While the first two patrols of Bugara proved uneventful, her third war patrol might be classified as one of the most colorful to be made during the war. This patrol in the Gulf of Siam was highlighted by a series of excellently conducted gun attacks which disposed of 57 small ships totaling 5284 tons. All except two of these vessels were boarded and their native crews put safely ashore with their personal belongings. One of the many interesting incidents of this patrol was an encounter with a Japanese ship manned by a Chinese crew being attacked by Malay pirates. Bugara rescued the Chinese, sank the Japanese ship, and then disposed of the pirates. On 17 August 1945 Bugara arrived at Fremantle, Australia, from her last war patrol. After a few days, Bugara sailed to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, and joined the other units of her squadron. For the remainder of 1945, she operated out of Subic Bay. In January 1946, she returned to San Diego via Pearl Harbor. After a rehabilitation period on the west coast, she returned to Pearl Harbor in May 1946. Post WW2 She was overhauled at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in 1946 and during the fall of that year made a training cruise in the Bering Sea and then returned to Pearl Harbor via Seattle and Portland. In late October 1947 Bugara departed Pearl Harbor for California. She underwent a yard period between 20 November 1947 and 19 March 1948, returning to Pearl Harbor 27 March. In July she proceeded to Yokosuka, Japan, via Guam, Melbourne, Buckner Bay, and Qingdao. She returned to Pearl Harbor 24 August 1948. On 13 August 1949 she departed Pearl Harbor for overhaul at San Francisco, returning 3 January 1950. Bugara received three battle stars for her World War II service. Korean War In Sep. of 1950 she departed for Far East to support United Nations Forces in the Korean Campaign. In 1952 she collided with the destroyer escort while on antisubmarine warfare exercises south of Barbers Point, Oahu, Hawaii.http://www.de634.org/Bugara.htm After repairs to her conning tower, she then continued operations out of Pearl Harbor until 7 December 1954. Jan. of 1951 she returned to the Far East for active duty. Twice during this period she served in the Far East supporting operations during the Korean War.bugara.net history Post Korean War In 1953, the Bugara near Pearl Harbor, was training with the USS Whitehurst, a destroyer escort. Bugara came to periscope depth and saw a bow with painted \\"634\\" on it closing fast at 15 knots. The two had a collision that damaged the Bugara's upper sail and periscopes. On 7 December 1954 she departed Pearl Harbor for San Diego, where she arrived 15 December. Vietnam War She serviced in the Vietnam war as part of the WestPac that deployed for service in the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam joining in Oct. of 1967. On 30 June 1969 she was reclassified as a training sub and no longer was a combat sub. Post Vietnam War Bugara then operated along the Pacific coast, participating in type training and fleet exercises until decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register on 1 October 1970. While under tow near Cape Flattery, Washington, after an aborted attempt to use her as a target for , the Bugara was swamped and sank accidentally. The tug was at risk of being taken down with her, so she cut the steel hawser tow cable. No crew was aboard the sub when she sank. Bugara lies under about 800 feet of water in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. A Remotely operated underwater vehicle (The EV Naultilus ROV Hercules) with an under water camera system showed photos of her in 2017 during an archaeological survey.Fox News, Stunning pictures reveal the wreck of US World War II-era sub, By James Rogers, August 28, 2017  References  *  External links  * * Kill Record: USS Bugara *Collision with USS Whitehurst Category:Balao- class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Cold War submarines of the United States Category:Korean War submarines of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the Washington coast Category:Ships built in Groton, Connecticut Category:1944 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1952 Category:Maritime incidents in 1971 ","title":"USS Bugara (SS-331)"},{"id":"1136715","text":"Four images of the same subject, removed from their original backgrounds and composited onto a new background Compositing is the process or technique of combining of visual elements from separate sources into single images, often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Live-action shooting for compositing is variously called \\"chroma key\\", \\"blue screen\\", \\"green screen\\" and other names. Today, most, though not all, compositing is achieved through digital image manipulation. Pre-digital compositing techniques, however, go back as far as the trick films of Georges M√©li√®s in the late 19th century, and some are still in use.  Basic procedure  All compositing involves the replacement of selected parts of an image with other material, usually, but not always, from another image. In the digital method of compositing, software commands designate a narrowly defined color as the part of an image to be replaced. Then the software replaces every pixel within the designated color range with a pixel from another image, aligned to appear as part of the original. For example, one could record a television weather presenter positioned in front of a plain blue or green background, while compositing software replaces only the designated blue or green color with weather maps. Composite of photos of one place, made more than a century apart  Typical applications  In television studios, blue or green screens may back news-readers to allow the compositing of stories behind them, before being switched to full-screen display. In other cases, presenters may be completely within compositing backgrounds that are replaced with entire \\"virtual sets\\" executed in computer graphics programs. In sophisticated installations, subjects, cameras, or both can move about freely while the computer-generated imagery (CGI) environment changes in real time to maintain correct relationships between the camera angles, subjects, and virtual \\"backgrounds\\". Virtual sets are also used in motion picture filmmaking, usually photographed in blue or green screen environments (other colors are possible but less common), as for example in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. More commonly, composited backgrounds are combined with sets ‚Äì both full-size and models ‚Äì and vehicles, furniture, and other physical objects that enhance the realism of the composited visuals. \\"Sets\\" of almost unlimited size can be created digitally because compositing software can take the blue or green color at the edges of a backing screen and extend it to fill the rest of the frame outside it. That way, subjects recorded in modest areas can be placed in large virtual vistas. Most common, perhaps, are set extensions: digital additions to actual performing environments. In the film Gladiator, for example, the arena and first tier seats of the Roman Colosseum were actually built, while the upper galleries (complete with moving spectators) were computer graphics, composited onto the image above the physical set. For motion pictures originally recorded on film, high-quality video conversions called \\"digital intermediates\\" enable compositing and other operations of computerized post production. Digital compositing is a type of matting, and one of four basic compositing methods. The others are physical compositing, multiple exposure, and background projection, a method which utilizes both front projection and rear projection.  Physical compositing  In physical compositing the separate parts of the image are placed together in the photographic frame and recorded in a single exposure. The components are aligned so that they give the appearance of a single image. The most common physical compositing elements are partial models and glass paintings. Partial models are typically used as set extensions such as ceilings or the upper stories of buildings. The model, built to match the actual set but on a much smaller scale, is hung in front of the camera, aligned so that it appears to be part of the set. Models are often quite large because they must be placed far enough from the camera so that both they and the set far beyond them are in sharp focus.Professional Cinematography, Clarke, Charles G., A.S.C., Los Angeles, 1964, p 152 ff. Glass shots are made by positioning a large pane of glass so that it fills the camera frame, and is far enough away to be held in focus along with the background visible through it. The entire scene is painted on the glass, except for the area revealing the background where action is to take place. This area is left clear. Photographed through the glass, the live action is composited with the painted area. A classic example of a glass shot is the approach to Ashley Wilkes' plantation in Gone with the Wind. The plantation and fields are all painted, while the road and the moving figures on it are photographed through the glass area left clear. A variant uses the opposite technique: most of the area is clear, except for individual elements (photo cutouts or paintings) affixed to the glass. For example, a ranch house could be added to an empty valley by placing an appropriately scaled and positioned picture of it between the valley and the camera. Multiple exposure The Playhouse composited using multiple exposures to show nine copies of Buster Keaton on screen at once. An in-camera multiple exposure is made by recording on only one part of each film frame, rewinding the film to exactly the same start point, exposing a second part, and repeating the process as needed. The resulting negative is a composite of all the individual exposures. (By contrast, a \\"double exposure\\" records multiple images on the entire frame area, so that all are partially visible through one another.) Exposing one section at a time is made possible by enclosing the camera lens (or the whole camera) in a light-tight box fitted with maskable openings, each one corresponding to one of the action areas. Only one opening is revealed per exposure, to record just the action positioned in front of it. Multiple exposure is difficult because the action in each recording must match that of the others; thus, multiple-exposure composites typically contain only two or three elements. However, as early as 1900 Georges M√©li√®s used seven- fold exposure in L'homme-orchestre/The One-man Band; and in the 1921 film The Playhouse, Buster Keaton used multiple exposures to appear simultaneously as nine different actors on a stage, perfectly synchronizing all nine performances.  Background projection  Background projection throws the background image on a screen behind the subjects in the foreground while the camera makes a composite by photographing both at once. The foreground elements conceal the parts of the background image behind them. Sometimes, the background is projected from the front, reflecting off the screen but not the foreground subjects because the screen is made of highly directional, exceptionally reflective material. (The prehistoric opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey uses front projection.) However, rear projection has been a far more common technique. In rear projection, (often called process shooting) background images (called \\"plates\\", whether they are still pictures or moving) are photographed first. For example, a camera car may drive along streets or roads while photographing the changing scene behind it. In the studio, the resulting \\"background plate\\" is loaded into a projector with the film \\"flipped\\" (reversed), because it will be projected onto (and through) the back of a translucent screen. A car containing the performers is aligned in front of the screen so that the scenery appears through its rear and/or side windows. A camera in front of the car records both the foreground action and the projected scenery, as the performers pretend to drive. Like multiple exposure, rear projection is technically difficult. The projector and camera motors must be synchronized to avoid flicker and perfectly aligned behind and before the screen. The foreground must be lit to prevent light spill onto the screen behind it. (For night driving scenes, the foreground lights are usually varied as the car \\"moves\\" along.) The projector must use a very strong light source so that the projected background is as bright as the foreground. Color filming presents additional difficulties, but can be quite convincing, as in several shots in the famous crop duster sequence in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest. (Much of the sequence, however, was shot on location.) Because of its complexity, rear projection has been largely replaced by digital compositing with, for example, the car positioned in front of a blue or green screen.  Matting  Traditional matting is the process of compositing two different film elements by printing them, one at a time, onto a duplicate strip of film. After one component is printed on the duplicate, the film is re-wound and the other component is added. Since the film cannot be exposed twice without creating a double exposure, the blank second area must be masked while the first is printed; then the freshly exposed first area must be masked while the second area is printed. Each masking is performed by a \\"traveling matte\\": a specially altered duplicate shot which lies on top of the copy film stock. Like its digital successor, traditional matte photography uses a uniformly colored backing ‚Äì usually (but not always) a special blue or green. Because a matching filter on the camera lens screens out only the backing color, the background area records as black, which, on the camera's negative film, will develop clear. First, a print from the original negative is made on high-contrast film, which records the backing as opaque and the foreground subject as clear. A second high-contrast copy is then made from the first, rendering the backing clear and the foreground opaque. Next, a three-layer sandwich of film is run through an optical printer. On the bottom is the unexposed copy film. Above it is the first matte, whose opaque backing color masks the background. On top is the negative of the foreground action. On this pass, the foreground is copied while the background is shielded from exposure by the matte. Then the process is repeated; but this time, the copy film is masked by the reverse matte, which excludes light from the foreground area already exposed. The top layer contains the background scene, which is now exposed only in the areas protected during the previous pass. The result is a positive print of the combined background and foreground. A copy of this composite print yields a \\"dupe negative\\" that will replace the original foreground shot in the film's edited negative.  Advantages of digital mattes  Digital matting has replaced the traditional approach for two reasons. In the old system, the five separate strips of film (foreground and background originals, positive and negative mattes, and copy stock) could drift slightly out of registration, resulting in halos and other edge artifacts in the result. Done correctly, digital matting is perfect, down to the single-pixel level. Also, the final dupe negative was a \\"third generation\\" copy, and film loses quality each time it is copied. Digital images can be copied without quality loss. This means that multi-layer digital composites can easily be made. For example, models of a space station, a space ship, and a second space ship could be shot separately against blue screen, each \\"moving\\" differently. The individual shots could then be composited with one another, and finally with a star background. With pre-digital matting, the several extra passes through the optical printer would degrade the film quality and increase the probability of edge artifacts. Elements crossing behind or before one another would pose additional problems.

It is made with potatoes (often, but not always), flour, butter, and milk or cream. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves. Flavoring A lefse topped with rakfisk, served with onion and sour cream There are many ways of flavoring lefse. The most common is adding butter to the lefse and rolling it up. In Norway, this is known as \\"lefse-klenning\\". Other options include adding cinnamon and/or sugar, or spreading jelly, lingonberries, or gomme on it. Scandinavian-American variations include rolling it with a thin layer of peanut butter and sugar, with butter and white or brown sugar, with butter and corn syrup, or with butter and salt, or with ham and eggs. Also eaten with beef and other savory items like Ribberull and mustard, it is comparable to a tortilla. Lefse is a traditional accompaniment to lutefisk, and the fish is often rolled up in the lefse. Variations Norwegian tykklefse There are significant regional variations in Norway in the way lefse is made and eaten, but it generally resembles a flatbread, although in many parts of Norway, especially Valdres, it is far thinner. Tynnlefse (thin lefse) is a variation made in central Norway. Tynnlefse is rolled up with butter, sugar, and cinnamon (or with butter and brown sugar). Tjukklefse or tykklefse is thicker and often served with coffee as a cake. Potetlefse (potato lefse) is similar to and used as tynnlefse, but made with potatoes. Lompe or potetkake being the \\"smaller-cousin\\" of the potato lefse, is often used in place of a hot-dog bun and can be used to roll up sausages. This is also known as p√∏lse med lompe in Norway. M√∏sbr√∏mlefse is a variation common to Salten district in Nordland in North Norway. M√∏sbr√∏mmen consists of half water and half the cheese smooth with flour or corn flour to a half thick sauce that greased the cooled lefse. Lefse is ready when m√∏sbr√∏mmen is warm and the butter is melted.M√∏sbr√∏mlefse fra Saltadal (Oppskrift) Nordlandslefse is a chunky small lefse. Made of butter, syrup, sugar, eggs, and flour. Originally created in western Norway as a treat to fishermen who were on the Lofoten Fishery. Anislefse is made on the coast of Hordaland. It resembles thin lefse but is slightly thicker, and it is stained by large amounts of whole aniseed. Hardangerlefse Hardanger lefse Another variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is made from yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). It is often made with egg yolks and buttermilk instead of potatoes. The dough is rolled with a conventional rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 ¬∞F or 205 ¬∞C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze-dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing. Dried Hardangerlefse can be stored without refrigeration for six months or more, so long as it is kept dry. It is customarily thought that the bread (along with solefisk) was a staple on the seagoing voyages as far back as Viking times. The wet lefse is dipped in water, and then placed within a towel which has also been dipped in water and wrung out. Many people maintain that dipping in salted or seawater enhances the flavor. The dry lefse regains its bread-like texture in about 60 minutes. Often that time is used to prepare such ingredients as eggs or herring, which are wrapped in the lefse once it has softened. Lefse in the United States =Holidays= Lefse is a Scandinavian treat that is especially popular around the Christmas holidays. Many Scandinavian-Americans eat lefse primarily around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Dessert lefse, butter and sugar =History= General Potato lefse sold at the syttende mai festival in Spring Grove, Minnesota While the Midwest generally always makes its lefse with potatoes, this is not necessarily the case in Norway. When one uses the term ‚Äúlefse‚Äù in the United States, it typically refers to what Norwegians call potato lefse. Norwegians, however, also make Hardanger lefse with egg yolks and buttermilk. The tradition of making lefse was brought over by Norwegian Americans, and potato lefse itself was made when their potato crop was successful. Due to this, it became more prevalent than other types in the United States. When lefse was able to be made, it was stored in small storage buildings called bryggehaus. When Norwegian immigrants first arrived in America, they did not have the usual foods they were used to back home, including milk and porridge, dried meat, and lefse, but early Norwegian-American immigrants brought folded lefse to eat for the beginning stages of their journey via ship. After these were eaten, the lack of food they were used to is likely why they turned back to tradition so quickly. During World War I, Americans were encouraged to eat potatoes to be patriotic, as wheat was needed to feed the troops on the front lines. Lefse, a staple for Norwegian Americans, was eaten with gusto during this time. While lefse is generally not eaten with day-to-day meals in Norway today, Norwegian Americans traditionally give prominence to having lefse with dinner. Keeping the tradition alive *Family members often gather to cook lefse as a group effort because the process is more enjoyable as a traditional holiday activity. This gathering also provides training to younger generations keeping the tradition alive. *The Sons of Norway have lodges to teach making lefse to younger generations. A lodge in Vancouver, Washington uses up to 60 pounds of potatoes to make lefse every month. While lefse used to be eaten as a snack food, it is now more often made in large quantities for such lutefisk dinners. *Some professional lefse makers can roll 85 to 100 lefse per hour, or even up to 140. =Where lefse is found= In Norway today, most families tend to purchase their lefse rather than making it. While today‚Äôs Norwegian Americans consider making lefse at Christmas a tradition, more families are turning to purchase it from the store instead. For example, around $80,000 worth of lefse is generally sold around Christmas from Ingebretsen‚Äôs Scandinavian Gifts in Minneapolis, Minnesota, yearly. Lefse can also be found in many grocery stores around Midwestern states, including Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon, Alaska, and Washington. Norsland Lefse, a factory in Rushford, Minnesota, produces about a half million rounds of lefse each year.Lefse Dagen (Starbuck Chamber of Commerce)Labor of lefse keeps tradition rolling (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)Minnesota: Norsland Lefse Factory (WCCO. Rushford, Minn) The foodway of Scandinavian lefse stretches from the Midwest all the way through northeastern Montana. Small lefse factories dot the landscape throughout this area, mostly in Norwegian communities. In the larger of these communities, Lefse can be found in grocery stores year round. In the Red River Valley specifically, ‚Äúrestaurants, supermarkets, and clubs all serve fish, lefse, and other specialties.‚Äù Many United States Scandinavian festivals have booths to sell lefse, and it can also be ordered online. =World's largest lefse= The town of Starbuck, Minnesota, is the home of the world's largest lefse. It was made in July 1983. =Celebrations and festivals= Lefse is celebrated in cities and towns with large Scandinavian populations. Fargo, North Dakota hosts the popular Lutefisk and Lefse Festival in August each year. Fosston, Minnesota invites area lefse makers to compete for the title of Champion Lefse Maker at its Lefse Fest in November. In Mankato, Minnesota, Minnesotans of Scandinavian descent celebrate lefse day, a day for cooking lefse, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.Lakeland News at Ten (PBS) clip of Lefse Fest The Potato Days festival has been taking place in Barnesville, Minnesota since the early 1930s; this festival also takes part in the National Lefse Cookoff. =Rumors and jokes= Rumors surrounding the initial use of lefse are claims by Norwegian Americans that it was made by and used to sustain the Vikings, but potatoes were not introduced into Norway until long after the Vikings‚Äô time. Although many Scandinavian-Americans do enjoy and eat the foods of their ethnic traditions, there is no shortage of tall-tales and jokes surrounding certain food, as well. Lefse was not excluded from these rumors. Lefse has been said to be ‚Äúso tasteless that many mistakenly eat the paper doily under the stack and do not know the difference.‚Äù =Integrating lefse into other foodways= Sometimes Norwegian foods are integrated into other ethnic foodways. One may use lefse in order to make enchiladas, rather than tortillas. American lefse is sometimes served with butter, cinnamon sugar, brown sugar, or lingonberry jelly before being rolled, to be eaten like a cr√™pe. One may add eggs, sausage, and cheese to make it into a breakfast burrito. One may also roll Sm√∏rrebr√∏d into their lefse.

In 1851, at the end of his freshman year, Yung wrote to Albert Booth, a fellow alumnus of Munson Academy and \\"old Yale, where you have the satisfaction + honor to have gone through.\\" Yung asked for Booth's help in acquiring study materials and stated, \\"Now you know probably the many disadvantages in which I labor aside from these additional studies.\\"Ravi D. Goel Collection on Yale (RU 1081). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library. (Accession 2008-A-176. Yale letters and memorabilia, Box 1, Folder 10) He was a member of the Phi chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. After finishing his studies, Yung returned to Qing Dynasty China and worked with western missionaries as an interpreter. He was thought perhaps the first Chinese person to almost entirely master the English language. Republican activism In 1859, he accepted an invitation to the court of the Taiping rebels in Nanjing, but his proposals aimed at increasing the efficiency of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were all eventually refused. In 1863, Yung was dispatched to the United States by Zeng Guofan to buy machinery necessary for opening an arsenal in China capable of producing heavy weapons comparable with those of the western powers. The arsenal later became Jiangnan Shipyard. He persuaded the Qing Dynasty government to send young Chinese to the United States to study Western science and engineering. With the government's eventual approval, he organized what came to be known as the Chinese Educational Mission, which included 120 young Chinese students, to study in the New England region of the United States beginning in 1872. The Educational Mission was disbanded in 1881, but many of the students later returned to China and made significant contributions to China's civil services, engineering, and the sciences. In 1874, he and the writer Joseph Twichell traveled to Peru to investigate the living conditions of Chinese citizens working there. Yung was a lifelong supporter of reform in China. He had followed the lead of the Guangxu Emperor, whom Yung described as the great pioneer of reform in China.Yung Wing, My Life in China and America, p.83, Henry Holt Co., New York, 1909 The coup d'√©tat of 1898 by the Empress Dowager Cixi aborted the reforms, and many of the reformers were decapitated. A price of $70,000 was placed on Yung's head and he fled Shanghai to Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong, he applied to the US Consul to return to the US. In a 1902 letter from the US Secretary of State John Sherman, Yung was informed that his US citizenship, which he had held for 50 years, had been revoked and he would not be allowed to return to the United States. Through the help of friends, he was able to sneak into the United States in time to see his youngest son, Bartlett, graduate from Yale. In 1908, Yung joined \\"General\\" Homer Lea, the former American military advisor to Kang Youwei, in a bold and audacious military venture in China called the \\"Red Dragon Plan\\" that called for organizing a revolutionary conspiracy to conquer Liangguang. Through Yung, Lea planned to solicit a united front of various southern Chinese factions and secret societies to organize an army that he would command for the revolution. If successful, Yung was slated to head a coalition government of revolutionary forces while Lea and his fellow conspirators hoped to receive wide-ranging economic concessions from the new government. The Red Dragon conspiracy subsequently collapsed.Chu, T.K., 150, Years of Chinese Students in America, p.9, Harvard China Review, Spring 2004; Lawrence M. Kaplan, Homer Lea: American Soldier of Fortune (University Press of Kentucky, 2010), 145-157. After the Wuchang Uprising in the late fall of 1911, Sun Yat Sen wrote to Yung Wing requesting help to build the newly-founded Republic of China, however Yung was unable to go due to old age and illness. He requested his two sons to go in his place. Family and legacy Yung was naturalized as an American citizen on October 30, 1852, and in 1876, he married Mary Kellogg, an American. They had two children: Morrison Brown Yung and Bartlett Golden Yung. At Yale's centennial commencement in 1876, Yung received an honorary Doctor of Laws.Schiff, Judith Ann, \\"When East Met West,\\" old Yale, November/December 2004 Yung lived his twilight years after the failed 1908 uprising in poverty in Hartford, Connecticut, and died in 1912. His grave is located at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Yung Wing's family plot at Cedar Hill Cemetery. P.S. 124, a public elementary school at 40 Division St. in Chinatown in New York City, NY, is named after Yung. Yung had been considered as a possible namesake for one of Yale University's new colleges to be completed in 2017. In the prefecture city of Zhuhai, Guangdong, Yung Wing's hometown, there is a private school named in honor of Yung Wing, the Yung Wing School -- one of the most elite schools in the city. There is also a Yung Wing International Kindergarten there.  Notes  References *Edward J.M.

The club currently plays in Serie C. Re-founded in 2012, Piacenza Calcio 1919 acquired the rights to use the brand of the original club Piacenza Calcio (also known as Piacenza F.C.) from Salva Piace.  History  = Foundation of Piacenza F.C. = Piacenza Football Club was founded in 1919 with Giovanni Dosi as the first club president. Dosi was an ambitious manager, taking control of every social, technical, and administrative aspect of the club, with the sole focus at bringing the club into the national championship under the FIGC. After spending much of the club's early life in the regional leagues, they entered into Serie C for the 1935‚Äì36 season, coming close to gaining promotion into Serie B during 1938 but lost out to Fanfulla.  From Serie B to Serie D  After World War II, Piacenza competed in Serie B for the first time, competing there for two seasons before falling back down to Serie C in 1948. The club were punished for illicit sportsmanship in 1956 and were relegated to Serie D. This proved to be quite a heavy blow for the club as they would continue to yo-yo between Serie C and D until 1964. Piacenza finally returned to Serie B in 1969, under coach Tino Molina and president Vincenzo Romagnoli. 1975‚Äì76 Piacenza Piacenza's history until recent times was mostly undistinguished, with brief spells in Serie B in the 1940s and further spells in 1969‚Äì70, 1975‚Äì76, and 1987‚Äì88 to 1988‚Äì89.  Between Serie A and Serie B  Promotion in 1991 saw a rise in the side's fortunes under coach Gigi Cagni, with the club promoted to Serie A for the first time in 1993, but was immediately relegated in the next season, despite the presence of players such as midfielder Daniele Moretti, winger Francesco Turrini, and forward Giampietro Piovani. For much of the season, Piacenza had battled into mid-table and were even a few points short of a European place, but were relegated on the last day of the season in a tight scrap. The club wisely chose to retain Cagni and most of his squad, and they would achieve promotion as Serie B champions in 1995. The following five years saw the club win many supporters with its all-Italian lineup and successful battles against relegation. In 1997 the club acquired legendary hard man defender Pietro Vierchowod. Despite his advancing years, Vierchowod proved an outstanding purchase, more than holding his own in defence and even scoring decisive goals in the relegation battle. Relegation in 2000 was followed by an instant return to Serie A for two years with outstanding form shown by players like midfielder Enzo Maresca. The club has since remained in Serie B without threatening to mount a promotion challenge. However following a poor 2010‚Äì11 Serie B season, Piacenza found themselves in a relegation playoff against Albinoleffe which they lost due to Albinoleffe's higher league position.  2012: Final bankruptcy after relegation  On 22 March 2012 Piacenza Calcio in strong financial difficulty was declared bankrupt by the court of Piacenza. In this season it was ranked 15th and relegated from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after play-out. On 19 June 2012 the club was finally declared bankrupt and the team was disbanded. = The refoundation: from Lupa Piacenza to Piacenza Calcio 1919 = Following the bankruptcy of Piacenza Football Club, regional amateur club A.C.D. LibertaSpes, recently promoted in the season 2011‚Äì12 to Eccellenza Emilia‚ÄìRomagna after winning Promozione Emilia‚ÄìRomagna Group A, was renamed to Lupa Piacenza after the obtaining the brand for four years from an association \\"Salva Piace\\", in order to continue the football history of Piacenza Football Club (aka Piacenza Calcio). In mid-2013 Lupa Piacenza was renamed Piacenza Calcio 1919. In 2013‚Äì14 Serie D season Piacenza Calcio was placed in the group B along with other team of the same city Pro Piacenza 1919 (formerly Atletico B.P. Pro Piacenza). In the 2015‚Äì16 Serie D season, Piacenza Calcio secured promotion to Lega Pro by winning the Group B title with 96 points and 30 wins over the course of the season, beating second placed Lecco by 16 points.

Thompson in his autobiographical novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The book was originally written under the name Raoul Duke. In Thompson's writings Duke is the main character and narrator of many of Thompson's stories, novels, and articles, often taking part in the events of Thompson's life in Thompson's place. He is portrayed as a cynical, mentally unbalanced, Gonzo journalist whose daily life is a near-perpetual state of intoxication on whatever drugs happen to be available - ranging from cannabis to amyl nitrite to adrenochrome - in an attempt to keep the spirit of the 1960s, a time which he speaks of romantically in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, alive within himself even as the rest of the country forgets it and what it represented. He usually obtains and consumes these substances in the company of his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, a \\"half-crazed 300 pound Samoan\\", whose drug-induced frenzies give even Duke pause. Thompson based Gonzo on his friend Oscar Zeta Acosta. Duke is first mentioned by Thompson in his 1966 book Hell's Angels, where he is described as an outlaw who does not break the law in an offensive way to society, but a way that in fact makes him more acceptable. Duke is often characterized as being somewhat of an author surrogate. His name, according to Thompson in interviews, was inspired by Ra√∫l Castro and John Wayne's nickname \\"The Duke\\", and probably originated as a pseudonym used to check into hotels, as in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Duke was also used so that Thompson could talk about himself ‚Äì after a diving accident Thompson had to spend some time in a decompression chamber, and wrote a letter signed 'Raoul Duke' in which the pseudonym described the insanity of Thompson's condition in the chamber ‚Äì holding up scrawled notes to the single glass window and ordering a television set to watch coverage of the Watergate hearings. The letter appeared in Rolling Stone in August 1973. In The Great Shark Hunt (a large selection of articles written by Thompson) Raoul Duke's name is the one that appears on several essays that were published in newspapers and magazines, including the \\"Police Chief\\", an article published by Scanlan's Monthly (June 1970) in which Duke is apparently an ex-police chief raging at the inadequate amount of real \\"weaponry\\" used by the police and advertised in the (presumably invented) Police Chief magazine. It was signed \\"Raoul Duke (Master of Weaponry)\\". In Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72, Thompson describes Raoul Duke as a sports writer friend, one of the few journalists who can truly write objectively instead of merely talking about the concept of objectivity. In the same section, Thompson calls journalistic objectivity \\"a pompous contradiction in terms\\", and warns the reader not to look for it under his byline. Thompson is quoted in the documentary film Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision, \\"I'm never sure which one people want me to be [Thompson or Duke], and sometimes they conflict... I am living a normal life, but beside me is this myth, growing larger and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to Universities to speak, I'm not sure who they're inviting, Duke or Thompson... I suppose that my plans are to figure out some new identity, kill off one life and start another.\\" Portrayals in other media The Duke character has been portrayed in three films: *The 1980 film Where the Buffalo Roam, in which he is portrayed by Bill Murray *The 1998 film adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in which he was portrayed by Johnny Depp. *The 2011 film Rango, Raoul makes a cameo, voiced by Johnny Depp Homages Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury character Uncle Duke is based on Thompson's Raoul Duke. Although the Doonesbury character is usually referred to only as \\"Duke\\", various other names for him have appeared over the years, including having the first name \\"Raoul\\" See also * Author surrogate * Oscar Zeta Acosta, on whom the character of Dr. Gonzo is based References External links * Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Part 1 of the original version as first published in Rolling Stone, Nov. 11, 1971.

He had one son J.B. Hartley (1814-1869). Hartley's career Despite having no experience of dock building, Hartley was the first full-time professional dock engineer in the world. He had previously worked for his father Bernard Hartley, a stonemason, architect and bridgemaster John Carr, and the Duke of Devonshire. Initially he was appointed Deputy Dock Surveyor to John Foster Jr. However, due to John Foster Jr. resigning three days later, he was promoted to Acting Dock Surveyor. During his service, he not only built new docks, but also modernised all of the existing docks with the exception of the Old Dock (opened in 1715), which had become disused and filled in. The docks at Liverpool grew from during his tenure. In 1831 he was appointed to convert the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal to a railway line. He persuaded the company to keep the canal open and build the railway more or less along its route. Between 1841 and 1843 he prepared a number of different designs for fireproof construction of dockside warehouses. In 1843, he made models of warehouse arches at the Trentham Street Dockyard, to test sheet iron lined timber floored building method and brick and iron building materials. Through fire testing of these models, he eventually convinced the Dock Board Trustees of the benefits of his iron framed construction method. These experiments proved the worthiness of his fireproof design and he designed the Albert Dock to these specifications. Hartley‚Äôs improvements over earlier dock and warehouse design included the use of locks to keep the water at a constant level, so that loading and unloading of ships‚Äô cargoes was not reliant on the tide and the enclosure of the dock with high boundary walls, to reduce theft. He also adapted and improved the design of St Katherine‚Äôs Dock in London, by incorporating high arches in the buildings to accommodate cranes. In his younger days, Hartley is reputed [reference wanted] to have worked for William Alexander Madocks at Port Madock (now Porthmadog) in Caernarfonshire, Wales. Examination of the piers of the Britannia Bridge there, across the River/Afon Glaslyn, shows cyclopean masonry of the type used by Hartley in Liverpool. The bridge can be dated c.1810 (give or take a year), was probably built in the dry and the river diverted through it in 1811/1812. The parapets have been renewed; there is a main road and a tramway/railway running across the bridge. Evidence of the original tramway was found during renewal of the road surface about 2008. It is thought by some to be the oldest railway bridge in the world still in use, but it has not carried a tramway/railway for the whole of that time.

She is currently a councilor at large for the Rotorua District Council. She previously stood as a candidate for Parliament, serving briefly as deputy leader of the small Christian Heritage Party. Early life Raukawa-Tait was born in Feilding, New Zealand and raised a Catholic. She has worked in a number of jobs, both in New Zealand and in Zurich, Switzerland. In the early 1990s she was in business in Rotorua and was a member of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for one term. Her most well-known role was as chief executive of Women's Refuge, an organisation which supports women who suffer domestic violence.. She was a contentious chief executive bringing embarrasment to the organisation after attending the premiere of a strip club in central Wellington3 causing staff to lose faith in her judgement 4 Political career Merepeka Ruakawa-Tait was elected to the Rotorua District Council in 2011. In 2013 Merepeka was re- elected to the Rotorua District Council. Previously, in 2001, she made a high- profile bid for the mayoralty of Wellington; however, after a weak performance at a candidates' meeting and a perceived failure to articulate policies and vision for the city, her support tapered off and she eventually placed sixth. Shortly before the 2002 elections, it was announced that Raukawa-Tait would be standing as a candidate for the Christian Heritage Party. This surprised many commentators, as Raukawa-Tait's previous comments did not indicate a great affinity with Christian Heritage policies ‚Äì in particular, she was considered to be markedly more tolerant of homosexuality than the party. As a personal recruit of then party leader Graham Capill, Raukawa-Tait was immediately elected deputy leader of the party. In the election itself, Raukawa-Tait contested the Wairarapa electorate against Labour's Georgina Beyer. Raukawa- Tait eventually placed third, winning 19% of the vote. This was the best result achieved by any Christian Heritage candidate in that election. Not long after the election, however, Raukawa-Tait and Capill entered into a dispute about the election campaign. Her campaign manager, Adam Owens, alleged that Capill's management of the party's campaign was poor, with little strategy and poor advertising. Owens alleged that the party was being financially mismanaged by Capill, and that he was not a \\"proper person\\" to lead a political party. After a protracted dispute, Raukawa-Tait and the entire Wairarapa Electorate Committee resigned from the party, citing \\"the lack of financial accountability\\" and \\"un-Christian threats and intimidation\\". In 2003 she reconciled with Capill, and they gave joint interviews in national newspapers saying that their falling out had been the fault of Adam Owens, and they jointly condemned him. In 2003 Raukawa-Tait stood as a District Council candidate in a controversial and unsuccessful by-election campaign for the Masterton District Council. She finished last. She left Masterton after her election defeat. Life outside politics She worked as CEO of the West Auckland Hospice for a time, and she works as a speaker and consultant and has appeared from time to time as a panellist on the television advice show How's Life. She lives in Rotorua, works as a celebrity speaker. In 1993 she was convicted in the Rotorua District Court, under her previous name Merepeka Sims, for failing to pay her employees' PAYE tax to the Inland Revenue, a serious offence under New Zealand law, because she said she needed the money for her businesses.

He created his first animated short \\"Tapum! the weapons' story\\" in 1958 at the age of 20. His most famous character, a hapless little man named \\"Signor Rossi\\" (Mr. Rossi), has been featured in many animated shorts as well as starring in three feature films: Mr. Rossi Looks for Happiness (1976), Mr. Rossi's Dreams (1977), and Mr. Rossi's Vacation (1977). Biography In 1965, Bozzetto produced his first feature-length animated film: West and Soda, a parody of American Western films. In 1968, Bozzetto released VIP my Brother Superman, a superhero spin-off. However, his best-known work is probably the 1976 feature film Allegro Non Troppo, a collection of short pieces set to classical music in the manner of Walt Disney's Fantasia, but more humorous in nature, economical in execution and with more sophisticated narrative themes. After a long break, Bozzetto produced a live-action film in 1987, Under the Chinese Restaurant, his last feature film work until assisting on the pilot for Mammuk (2002), an animated film set in prehistoric times (now being produced by Rai Cinema and The Animation Band). 1990 saw the release of Grasshoppers (Cavallette), which was an Academy Award nominee for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Short Film Winners:1991 Oscars In 1995, he produced an animated short for Hanna-Barbera/Cartoon Network Studios' What a Cartoon! series entitled Help? and in 1996, in cooperation with RAI and with the support of Cartoon (Media Programme of the European Union), he created The Spaghetti Family a 26-episode cartoon television series. In recent years, Bozzetto has turned the animation from traditional cel to flash cartoons, most notably with the award-winning Europe and Italy, a witty and graphically elegant commentary on European vs. Italian socio-cultural attributes. This comic also inspired the creation of the Polandball meme.

(editors) (1998) Social Structure and Change: Religion and Kinship (Volume 5 of Social Structure and Change) Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, California, ; Sage Publications, New Delhi, India, was the leader of native resistance in Cyrenaica, currently Eastern Libya under the Senussids, against the Italian colonization of Libya. A teacher-turned-general, Omar was also a prominent figure of the Senussi movement, and he is considered the national hero of Libya and a symbol of resistance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. Beginning in 1911, he organised and, for nearly twenty years, led the Libyan resistance movement against the Italian colonial empire during the Pacification of Libya. After many attempts, the Italian Armed Forces managed to capture Al-Mukhtar near Solonta and hanged him in 1931. Early life 'Omar Al-Mukhtar was born in 1858 to a family in the town of Zanzur near Tobruk, in the region of Ottoman Cyrenaica, belonging to the Senussi (who were seen as Libyan Ashrafs) Arab clan just like Emir or King Idris es Senussi , eventually becoming chief or leader of the clan. As a child Omar lost his father early on, and spent his youth in poverty, he was adopted by a great sheikh, and was friends with the nephew of Hussein Ghariani, Sharif al Geriani. His uncle was a political- religious leader in Cyrenaica, and received his early education at the local mosque, before continuing his studying for eight years at the Senussi university in Jaghbub,Rodolfo Graziani, \\"Cirenaica Pacificata\\" pg.269 (Benamer translation) the holy city of the Senussi Tariqa, He became a popular expert on the Quran and an imam, joining the confraternity of the Senussi, he also came to be well informed of the social structure of his society, as he was chosen to settle intertribal disputes. Mukhtar developed a strong relationship with the Senussid Movement during his years in Jaghbub, in 1895, Al-Mahdi Senoussi traveled with him south to Kufra, and on another occasion further south to Karo in Chad, where he was appointed as sheikh of Zawiyat Ayn Kalk, when the French Empire encroached on Chad in 1899 he was sent among other Senussites to help defend Chad from the French, as the Senussi considered their expansion dangerous due to their missionary activities in Central and West Africa. In 1902, Omar was recalled north after the death of Al-Mahdi, the new Senussi leader Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi appointed him as Sheikh of the troubled Zawiyat Laqsur in Northern Cyrenaica.  Italian invasion  Italian invasion. In October 1911, during the Italo-Turkish War, the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) under the command of Admiral Luigi Faravelli reached the shores of Libya, then a territory subject to Ottoman control. The admiral demanded that the Ottoman administration and garrison surrender their territory to the Italians or incur the immediate destruction of the city of Tripoli and Benghazi. The Ottomans and their Libyan allies withdrew to the countryside instead of surrendering, and the Italians bombarded the cities for three days, and then proclaimed the Tripolitanians to be 'committed and strongly bound to Italy'.Bruce Vandervort, p. 261 This marked the beginning of a series of battles between the Italian colonial forces and the Libyan armed opposition in Cyrenaica.Encyclopedia of World Biography on Omar al-Mukhtar, BookRags.com  Guerrilla warfare  Omar Mukhtar photographed with Libyan Senussi fighters. A teacher of the Qur'an by profession, Mukhtar was also skilled in the strategies and tactics of desert warfare. He knew local geography well and used that knowledge to advantage in battles against the Italians, who were unaccustomed to desert warfare. Mukhtar repeatedly led his small, highly alert groups in successful attacks against the Italians, after which they would fade back into the desert terrain. Mukhtar‚Äôs men skilfully attacked outposts, ambushed troops, and cut lines of supply and communication. The Regio Esercito (Italian Royal Army) was left astonished and embarrassed by his guerrilla tactics.Libya profile - Timeline, BBC News Africa, 1 November 2011 In the mountainous region of Jebel Akhdar (\\"Green Mountain\\") in 1924, Italian governor Ernesto Bombelli created a counter-guerrilla force that inflicted a severe setback to guerilla forces in April 1925. Mukhtar then quickly modified his own tactics and was able to count on continued help from Egypt. In March, 1927, despite occupation of Giarabub from February 1926 and increasingly stringent rule under Governor Attilio Teruzzi, Mukhtar surprised Italian troops at Raheiba. Between 1927 and 1928, Mukhtar reorganised the Senusite forces, who were being hunted constantly by the Italians. Even General Teruzzi recognized Omar's qualities of \\"exceptional perseverance and strong will power.\\" Marshal Pietro Badoglio, Governor of Libya from January 1929, after extensive negotiations concluded a compromise with Mukhtar (described by the Italians as his complete submission) similar to previous Italo-Senusite accords. At the end of October, 1929, Mukhtar denounced the compromise and re-established a unity of action among Libyan forces, preparing himself for the ultimate confrontation with General Rodolfo Graziani, the Italian military commander from March 1930. A massive offensive in June against Mukhtar's forces having failed, Graziani, in full accord with Badoglio, Emilio De Bono (Minister of the Colonies), and Benito Mussolini, initiated a plan to break the Libyan MujƒÅhideen:100,000 population of Jebel Akhdar would be relocated to concentration camps on the coast, and the Libyan- Egyptian border from the coast at Giarabub would be closed, preventing any foreign help to the fighters and depriving them of support from the native population. These measures, which Graziani initiated early in 1931, took their toll on the Senusite resistance. The rebels were deprived of help and reinforcements, spied upon, hit by Italian aircraft, and pursued on the ground by the Italian forces aided by local informers and collaborators. Mukhtar continued to struggle despite increased hardships and risks, but on 11 September 1931, he was ambushed near Slonta. Mukhtar's final adversary, Italian General Rodolfo Graziani, has given a description of the Senusite leader that is not lacking in respect: \\"Of medium height, stout, with white hair, beard and mustache. Omar was endowed with a quick and lively intelligence; was knowledgeable in religious matters, and revealed an energetic and impetuous character, unselfish and uncompromising; ultimately, he remained very religious and poor, even though he had been one of the most important Senusist figures.\\"Rodolfo Graziani, \\"Cirenaica Pacificata\\" pg.265  Capture and execution  Omar Mukhtar entering the court room. Mukhtar's struggle of nearly twenty years came to an end on 11 September 1931, when he was wounded in battle near Slonta, and then captured by the Italian Army. On 16 September 1931, on the orders of the Italian court and with Italian hopes that Libyan resistance would die with him, Mukhtar was hanged before his followers in the Suluq prisoner of war camp at the age of 73 years old.

The dock is in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock to the south and with access to the river via the Canning Half Tide Dock to the west. The Canning Graving Docks are accessed from the dock. History British Empire Dockyards and Ports, 1909 Canning Dock was opened in 1737 as the Dry Dock, a protected tidal basin providing an entrance to Old Dock. Having been subsequently enclosed as a wet dock three years earlier, in 1832 it was officially named after the Liverpool MP George Canning. To the east is the site of Old Dock, built in 1709, which was the world's first enclosed commercial dock. Canning Dock would have initially served ships involved in the trans Atlantic slave trade. Access to the northern half of the dock system was via Georges Dock, George's Basin and into Prince's Dock. In 1899, Georges Basin and George's Dock were filled in and the site is now the Pier Head. Along with the Albert Dock and others in the immediate vicinity, Canning Dock was abandoned as a commercial shipping facility in 1972 due to the rising cost of dredging and falling traffic. =Graving docks = the half tide dock Adjoining the dock basin are two dry graving dock built by Henry Berry between 1765-9. They were lengthened and deepened by Jesse Hartley in the 1840s. In the 1980's the graving docks became part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum and home to two of the museums ships, the pilot cutter Edmund Gardner and the schooner De Wadden. Redevelopment Canning Dock was restored from 1983 providing access to the Canning Graving Docks, which are part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum. By March 2009 work was completed on a ¬£22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further of navigable waterway.

The 221-foot (67 m) granite obelisk was erected between 1825 and 1843 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, with granite from nearby Quincy conveyed to the site via the purpose-built Granite Railway, followed by a trip by barge. There are 294 steps to the top. An exhibit lodge built near the base of the monument in the late 19th century houses a statue of fallen hero Dr. Joseph Warren. Bunker Hill is one of the sites along the Freedom Trail and is part of Boston National Historical Park. The monument underwent a $3.7 million renovation, completed in 2007, that included repairs, handicap accessibility improvements, and new lighting. The Bunker Hill Museum across the street was dedicated in June of that year and includes many exhibits about the battle. No admission charge applies to the museum or monument. Background The monument was one of the first in the United States. An earlier memorial at the site had been erected in memory of fallen Bunker Hill hero Dr. Joseph Warren, a Mason, in 1794 by King Solomon's Lodge of Masons, and was initially an 18-foot (5.5 m) wooden column topped with a gilt urn. In front of the obelisk is a statue of Col. William Prescott, a native of Groton, Massachusetts, another hero of Bunker Hill. According to popular stories, he coined the famous Revolutionary War phrase, \\"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes\\" during the battle. However, various writers attribute it to Israel Putnam, John Stark, Prescott or Richard Gridley, while a few question whether it was said at all.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. Major General Israel Putnam: Hero of the American Revolution, p. 97, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina, 2017 . The monument is not on Bunker Hill, but instead on Breed's Hill, where most of the fighting in the misnamed Battle of Bunker Hill actually took place. The Monument Association, which had purchased the battlefield site, was forced to sell off all but the hill's summit in order to complete the monument. Breed's Hill Breed's Hill is a glacial drumlin located in the Charlestown section of Boston, Massachusetts. It is located in the southern portion of the Charlestown Peninsula, a historically oval, but now more roughly triangular, peninsula that was originally connected to Cambridge in colonial times by a short, narrow isthmus known as the Charlestown Neck. It is best known as the location where in 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War, most of the fighting in the Battle of Bunker Hill took place. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the peninsula's shape and connections to other landforms were significantly altered, with the waters of the Charles River between Cambridge and Charlestown heavily filled in.Mapping Boston, Krieger, Alex, ed., MIT Press 1999, pp. 16-18. Much of the hill is now occupied by residential construction, but the summit area is the location of the Bunker Hill Monument and other memorials commemorating the battle. The hill is about high, and is topped by Monument Square, site of the Bunker Hill Monument. The hill slopes fairly steeply to the east and west. In addition to its historic sites and tourist-oriented facilities, the hill is the site of a great deal of residential property, as well as supporting municipal and retail infrastructure. It is about from Bunker Hill. History The Americans, having caught word of a British plan to fortify the Charlestown peninsula, decided to get to the peninsula first, fortify it, and present sufficient threat to cause the British to leave Boston. On June 16, 1775, under the leadership of General Putnam and Colonel Prescott, the Americans stole out onto the Charlestown Peninsula with instructions to establish defensive positions on the hills overlooking Boston. A redoubt, a small and usually temporary defensive fortification, was constructed on nearby Breed's Hill, probably due to its closer proximity to Boston compared to Bunker Hill. The next morning, June 17, the British were astonished to see the rebel fortifications upon the hill and set out to reclaim the peninsula. The resulting conflict was called the Battle of Bunker Hill because that is where Prescott originally intended‚Äîand was ordered‚Äîto build the fortifications. Also, some people considered Breed's Hill a part of Bunker Hill, while others called it Charlestown Hill.Ketchum, pp. 82-83 British soldiers under Howe sent 2,400 men to attack Breed's Hill. A force of 1,500 colonists held off three British attacks, then retreated when the colonists ran out of gunpowder. 450 colonists were killed or wounded, compared to 1,150 British casualties. In 1825, the Bunker Hill Monument Association began construction of the Bunker Hill Monument, acquiring of land for the purpose.  Construction  William Ticknor, a well-known Boston lawyer and antiquarian, first suggested the memorial. An interested group of men met for breakfast at the home of Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins, including William Tudor, Daniel Webster, Professor George Ticknor, Doctor John C. Warren, William Sullivan, and George Blake. On May 10, 1823, the first public meeting was called. Each member subscribed five dollars, and on June 7, 1823, the Bunker Hill Monument Association was established and the work of raising money was begun. Famed nineteenth-century philanthropist Amos Lawrence contributed $10,000 to the monument's erection. 19th century lodge built near the base of the monument In the spring of 1825 the directors had purchased about 15 acres (61,000 m¬≤) on the slope of Breed's Hill, but had not yet chosen a design. The first design committee consisted of Webster, noted engineer Loammi Baldwin, Jr., George Ticknor, Gilbert Stuart, and Washington Allston. One hundred dollars was offered for the best design; about 50 plans were presented in response. Choice was soon narrowed to a column and an obelisk and a new committee was appointed to procure designs and estimate expenses for each. At the next meeting the majority voted that the obelisk designed by Solomon Willard be used. The directors laid the cornerstone on June 17, 1825. The Marquis de Lafayette (who was on a 14-month tour of the United States on the 50th anniversary of the War) performed the ceremony, Webster delivered the oration, and the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, conducted the services. Rev. Joseph Thaxter, who was wounded in the battle, officiated as chaplain at the ceremony, offering a prayer in thanks for the colonists' victory. More than 100,000 attended the event, including 190 veterans who had participated in the battle. Blocks of granite for the monument averaged two cubic yards each and were quarried by wedging. Delivered to the site of the monument at an actual cost of $5.40 per cubic yard from a quarry opened for the purpose far under the average contract offers for the same of $24.30.The Civil Engineer's Pocket-Book, Trautwine et al., 19th Edition, 1909 Work proceeded somewhat slowly at first, but the Granite Railway was completed in short order and became operational on October 7, 1826, as the first commercial railroad in the United States functioning as a common carrier. Construction was frequently halted as available funds were depleted. To bring the project to completion the Monument Association in 1838 began to sell off the of the battlefield as house lots, eventually preserving only the summit of Breed's Hill as the monument grounds. Neighbors disgruntled with the construction eyesore were rumored to have plans to raise money to tear down the partially completed monument. Sarah Josepha Hale and the readers of her magazine supplied funds essential to the monument's successful completion. The capstone was laid on July 23, 1842 with the monument being dedicated on June 17 of the following year, again with a Daniel Webster oration. According to the Boston Latin School Association's \\"Points of Pride Quiz\\" for December 2007, BLS boys helped erect the Boston landmark. The Bunker Hill Monument Association maintained the monument and grounds until 1919, when it was turned over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 1976 the monument was transferred to the National Park Service and became a unit of Boston National Historical Park. The monument was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, in part for its architectural significance as a major early war memorial, and the nation's largest-scale memorial prior to the construction of the Washington Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and was included in the Monument Square Historic District in 1987.

Bush and led the Office of Counterterrorism in the U.S. State Department until his resignation in 2004. Previously Black served in the Directorate of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Director of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC). In 1973, Black completed his BA at the University of Southern California (USC). The next year he earned a master's degree in international relations, also at USC. Later that year he left the doctoral program to join the CIA.Steve Coll, Ghost Wars (Penguin, 2005 edn), pp.266-7; Cofer had friends in Southern California and made trips camping to Lake Tahoe CA and Reno, NV. \\"Ambassador Cofer Black Becomes Vice-Chairman at Blackwater USA \\", Blackwater USA press release, Feb. 4, 2005. CIA career up to 1999 At the CIA, Black trained for the clandestine service and volunteered for Africa due to his childhood experiences there. During his CIA career, Black served six foreign tours in field management positions. Initially, he worked as a case officer in Lusaka, Zambia during the Rhodesian Bush War. He then transferred to Somalia, where he served for two years during the conflict between Ethiopians and Somalis. He worked in South Africa during the National Party government's war against guerrilla movements opposing the apartheid system. While assigned to Kinshasa, Zaire, Black was involved in the Reagan Administration's covert action program to arm anti-communist guerrillas in neighboring Angola. In 1993, Black transferred from London to Khartoum, Sudan, where he served as CIA Station Chief until 1995. This was at a low point in U.S.-Sudanese relations, particularly over the latter country's sponsorship of terror and the harboring of Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Black oversaw the collection of human intelligence on terrorist cells and support structures, and toward the end of his tenure, he was targeted by Al Qaeda for assassination {see Woodward, Bush At War, p. 9}. Black was also responsible for the collection of intelligence that directly led to the 1994 capture of the terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal. In 1995, Black was named the Task Force Chief in the Near East and South Asia Division. From June 1998 through June 1999, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Latin America Division.Steve Coll, Ghost Wars (Penguin, 2005 edn), pp. 267, 271; \\"Ambassador Cofer Black Becomes Vice-Chairman at Blackwater USA ,\\" Blackwater USA press release, Feb. 4, 2005. Director, CTC, 1999-2002 In June 1999 CIA chief George Tenet named Black director of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC).Steve Coll, Ghost Wars (Penguin, 2005 edn), p. 456. In this capacity, Black served as the CIA Director's Special Assistant for Counterterrorism as well as the National Intelligence Officer for Counterterrorism.\\"Ambassador Cofer Black Becomes Vice-Chairman at Blackwater USA ,\\" Blackwater USA press release, Feb. 4, 2005. Black's promotion was a part of Tenet's \\"grand plan\\" for dealing with al-Qaeda. Black was the operational chief in charge of this effort. Tenet also put \\"Richard,\\" one of his own assistants, in charge of the CTC's bin Laden tracking unit. Black still headed the CTC at the time of the attacks of September 11, 2001. =Al-Qaeda strategy, 1999‚Äì2001= In December 1998 CIA chief Tenet \\"declared war\\" on Osama bin Laden.Coll, Ghost Wars, pp.436‚Äì7, and p.646 note 42; 9/11 Commission Report, chapter 11, p. 357 (HTML version). Early in 1999 Tenet \\"ordered the CTC to begin a 'baseline' review of the CIA's operational strategy against bin Laden.\\" In the spring he \\"demanded 'a new, comprehensive plan of attack' against bin Laden and his allies.\\" The CTC had produced a \\"comprehensive plan of attack\\" against bin Laden and previewed the new strategy to senior CIA management by the end of July 1999. By mid-September, it had been briefed to CIA operational level personnel, and to the NSA, the FBI, and other partners. The strategy was called simply, \\"the Plan.\\" > ... [Cofer] Black and his new bin Laden unit wanted to \\"project\\" into > Afghanistan, to \\"penetrate\\" bin Laden's sanctuaries. They described their > plan as military officers might. They sought to surround Afghanistan with > secure covert bases for CIA operations‚Äîas many bases as they could arrange. > Then they would mount operations from each of the platforms, trying to move > inside Afghanistan and as close to bin Laden as they could to recruit agents > and to attempt capture operations. Black wanted recruitments and he wanted > to develop commando or paramilitary strike teams made up of officers and men > who could \\"blend\\" into the region's Muslim populations. Black also arranged for a CIA team, heade It is not clear what relation this \\"Qaeda cell,\\" which appeared to duplicate the function of the Bin Laden unit, had to the unit. Parallel with these developments, in November‚ÄìDecember 1999 Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Nawaf al-Hazmi visited Afghanistan, where they were selected for the \\"planes operation\\" that was to become known as 9/11.9/11 Commission Report, chapter 5, pp. 155‚Äì8, 168 HTML version. Data derived from subsequent intelligence interrogations of captives. Working with a Malaysian security unit, the CIA watched al-Hazmi and his companion Khalid al-Mihdhar as they attended in January 2000 a Qaeda conference in Kuala Lumpur, later determined to be where decisions about the \\"planes operation\\" were made. > \\"We surveil them. We surveil the guy they're there to meet,\\" Black recalled. > \\"Not close enough to hear what they're saying, but we're covering, taking > pictures, watching their behavior. They're acting kind of spooky. They're > not using the phone in the apartment. They're going around, walking in > circles, just like junior spies. Going up to phone booths, making a lot of > calls. It's like, 'Who are these dudes?'\\"Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 487‚Äì88. According to an internal CIA report on the performance of the agency prior to the 9/11 attacks, Black was criticized for not passing on information to the FBI that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar had subsequently entered the United States. In addition, the 9/11 Commission found that while Black testified before Congress's Joint Inquiry into 9/11 that the FBI had access to information on the two hijackers, the 9/11 Commission found no such evidence of this. The CIA increasingly concentrated its diminished resources on counter-terrorism, so that resources for this particular activity increased sharply. At least some of the Plan's more modest aspirations were translated into action. Intelligence collection efforts on bin Laden and al-Qaeda increased significantly from 1999. \\"By 9/11,\\" said Tenet, \\"a map would show that these collection programs and human [reporting] networks were in place in such numbers as to nearly cover Afghanistan.\\"Coll, Ghost Wars, pp. 457, 466‚Äì72, 485, and p. 654 note 7; Tenet statement to the Joint Inquiry on 9/11, Oct. 17, 2002; 9/11 Commission Report, chapter 4, pp. 142‚Äì3 (HTML version); George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA (Harper Press, 2007), pp. 119, 120. During the summer of 2001, Tenet, Black, and one of Black's top assistants‚Äî\\"Rich B\\" (i.e. \\"Richard\\")‚Äîwere active in advertising the dangers of al-Qaeda to the new Bush administration. At a meeting with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and others on July 10, \\"Rich\\" predicted a \\"spectacular\\" terrorist attack against US interests \\"in the coming weeks or months\\" ... \\"Multiple and simultaneous attacks are possible.\\" After the meeting, \\"Rich and Cofer congratulated each other,\\" feeling that at last the CIA had gotten the full attention of the administration. At an internal CIA update in late July, \\"Rich\\" dramatically predicted, \\"They're coming here!\\" (i.e. the USA).George Tenet, At The Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA (Harper Press, 2007), pp. 145, 149, 150‚Äì3, 158. One of the ways in which CIA/CTC surveiled Osama bin Laden in his Afghan base was with the Predator reconnaissance drone. A joint CIA-USAF program of flights in autumn 2000 (dubbed \\"Afghan Eyes\\") produced probable sightings of the Qaeda leader. Black became a \\"vocal advocate\\" of arming the aircraft with missiles to kill bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders in targeted killings. During the new Bush administration in 2001, Black and \\"Richard\\" continued to press for Predators armed with adapted Hellfire anti-tank missiles. Legal and technical issues delayed the program. Black urged Tenet to promote the matter at the long- awaited Cabinet-level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism of September 4, 2001. The CIA chief duly did so. The CIA was authorized to \\"deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft.\\" [See Bin Laden Issue Station.] =September 11, 2001= After the 9/11 strikes on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, some CTC staff refused an order to evacuate the CIA headquarters building at Langley. They included the shift of the Global Response Center on the exposed sixth floor, which Black would eventually argue had \\"a key function in a crisis like this.\\" Tenet finally accepted that Black wouldn't leave, and that their lives would be put at risk.Tenet, At The Center of the Storm, pp. 164-65. The conversation is a virtual replica of that given in Bob Woodward, Bush At War (2002/3) (Publisher's extract from chapter 1). The CTC obtained passenger lists from \\"the planes that had been turned into weapons that morning.\\" \\"[A] CTC analyst raced over to the printing plant,\\" from which most CIA staff had been evacuated, and pointed out the names Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who they had \\"been looking for the last few weeks.\\" This was the first \\"absolute proof\\" that the attacks were an Al-Qaeda plot.Tenet, At The Center of the Storm, p. 167. The CTC had first come across the names in connection with potential terrorist activity in the winter of 1999-2000 [see above]. = Post 9/11: Global War on Terror = The CIA's planning efforts had put them in a better position to respond after the attacks. As Tenet put it, > How could [an intelligence] community without a strategic plan tell the > president of the United States just four days after 9/11 how to attack the > Afghan sanctuary and operate against al-Qa'ida in ninety-two countries > around the world?Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, pp. 121-2. This was at a \\"war council,\\" a restricted group of the National Security Council, chaired by President Bush at Camp David on September 15, 2001. Black was also present. Tenet proposed first to send CIA teams into Afghanistan to collect intelligence and mount covert operations. The teams would act jointly with military Special Operations units. \\"President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.\\"9/11 Commission Report, chapter 10, p. 332 (HTML version; Tenet, At the Center of the Storm, p. *.) Woodward's Bush at War mentions two meetings at which Black was present while implementing this plan with memorable \\"Blackisms.\\" In a September 13 meeting with BushWoodward, Bush at War, pp. 52. Black said Later Black used the same technique to impress the Russians.Woodward, Bush at War, p. 103. The CIA geared up to take the lead in the attack on al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The NALT team, led by Gary Schroen, entered the country once more on September 26, 2001. A new branch was added to the CTC‚ÄîCTC Special Operations, or CTC/SO. Hank Crumpton, the former head of CTC operations, was recalled to head it. Black told him, \\"Your mission is to find al-Qa'ida, engage it, and destroy it.\\"Tenet, At The Center Of The Storm, pp. 211, 217, 221-3. Testifying at the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the September 11 attacks in 2002, Black eschewed the offer of anonymity because \\"I want to look the American people in the eye.\\"Testimony of Cofer Black (copy on Federation of American Scientists' website). During the \\"war on terror\\" Black is said to have played a \\"leading role in many of the [CIA]'s more controversial programs, including the rendition and interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects and the detention of some of them in secret prisons [outside the USA].\\"Dana Hedgpeth. \\"Blackwater's Owner Has Spies for Hire\\", Washington Post, Nov. 3, 2007. But there has never been any solid factual support for these contentions. Black had resigned from government service in 2004 and entered the private sector before the controversial renditions occurred. Black's legacy is that he created and led the team that successfully counter-attacked Al-Qaeda and the Taliban immediately after 9/11, while concurrently leading the successful implementation of the presidentially approved \\"Worldwide Attack Matrix,\\" in which the CIA engaged all known Al Qaeda operatives and supporters on a global basis. This full court press may have stopped Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda from implementing any follow-up attacks on the United States if any such attacks had been planned. In addition, Black can be credited with having provided clear early warnings to the president's top advisors on July 10, 2001‚Äîtwo months before 9/11‚Äîthat a major terrorist attack was imminent, and with having urged that immediate preventive action be taken. Post-CIA career =US Department of State (2002‚Äì2004)= Black became the US Department of State's Ambassador-at-Large for counter-terrorism in late 2002. He held this position until November 2004. > As the Coordinator for Counter-terrorism [at the State Department], > Ambassador Black's office, S/CT, had primary responsibility for developing, > coordinating and implementing U.S. counter-terrorism policy. On behalf of > the Secretary of State, Ambassador Black represented the Department on the > Counter-terrorism Security Group. His office played a leading role on the > Department of State's counter-terrorism task forces organized to coordinate > responses to international terrorist incidents. [His] responsibilities > included coordinating U.S. Government efforts to improve counter-terrorism > cooperation with foreign governments, including the policy and planning of > the Department's Antiterrorism Training Assistance Program. =Private sector work (2005‚Äìpresent)= From 2005 to 2008 Black was Vice Chairman of Blackwater USA (later renamed Blackwater Worldwide, then Xe, and finally Academi), a US-based private security firm which is \\"the biggest of the State Department's three private security contractors\\".Matthew Lee, \\"Feds Target Blackwater in Weapons Probe\\", Associated Press, September 22, 2007. Black resigned in 2008 reportedly after learning of illegal payments to Iraqi officials.MARK MAZZETTI and JAMES RISEN, \\"Blackwater Said to Approve Iraqi Payoffs After Shootings\\", The New York Times, Nov. 10, 2009, p.A01. Black is also Chairman of Total Intelligence Solutions (Total Intel), a private intelligence gathering group. This company was created in February 2007 by the Prince Group, the holding company that owns Blackwater. Total Intel was formed by the merger of The Black Group LLC (also led by Black), Terrorism Research Center, Inc., and Technical Defense.Dana Hedgpeth, \\"Blackwater's Owner Has Spies for Hire\\", Washington Post, Nov. 3, 2007, p.A01. In March 2006 Black allegedly suggested at an international conference in Amman, Jordan, that Blackwater USA was ready to move towards providing security professionals up to brigade size for humanitarian efforts and low intensity conflicts. Black denies the allegation. Critics have suggested this may be going too far in putting political decisions in the hands of privately owned corporations. The company denies this was ever said. In January 2016 Black became an independent director of publicly traded biotechnology company Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO).http://www.nwbio.com/nw-bio-announces-appointment-of-two-new- independent-directors-with-biotechpharma-expertise-and- cybersecurityinvestigations-expertise/ In February 2017, Burisma Group, an oil and gas corporation based in Ukraine, announced the addition of Black to the company's board of directors. Mitt Romney presidential campaign On April 26, 2007, Black was chosen by Mitt Romney, a Republican candidate in the 2008 United States presidential election, to head his counter-terrorism policy advisory group. In October 2011, Black was chosen by Romney to serve as \\"Special Adviser\\" on all foreign policy issues. Awards In addition to numerous performance awards and meritorious citations, Black received the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the George H. Bush Medal for Excellence, and the Exceptional Collector Award for 1994.

The program consisted of an interdisciplinary living/learning community with small class sizes and student-designed focuses. Majors included Interdisciplinary Studies, Environmental Science, and Environmental Studies. Academics were divided into three core areas: Creativity and Culture, Social Systems, and Natural Systems. Western, also known as the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, was cited as a primary reason for Miami University making the list of \\"Public Ivies\\" in Richard Moll's book, The Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities. In the mid-1960s, when it was the Western College for Women, the campus served as the staging ground for Freedom Summer, a voter registration drive in Mississippi. The Western campus Located directly east of the main campus of Miami University, Western College is characterized by winding pathways through forest and stone bridges over creeks. Peabody Hall, currently a coed dormitory, is said to be haunted by its namesake Helen Peabody. Other buildings on Western Campus include McKee Hall, Mary Lyon Hall, Kumler Chapel, Western Lodge, Ernst Theater, Western Tower, Ice House, Summer House, Sawyer Hall (former gymnasium, heating plant, pool and dining hall), Boyd Hall, Hoyt Hall, the Art Museum, and non-WCP buildings, Clawson Hall, Alexander Dining Hall, Presser Hall, Langstroth Cottage, Havighurst Hall, and Thomson Hall. Merger with College of Arts and Sciences In March 2006, Miami University Provost Jeffrey Herbst recommended to Miami University President Dr. James C. Garland that the Western College Program be phased out in favor of expanding Miami's Honors Program. The proposal called for the creation of the Western Honors College. This proposal met with resistance from Western faculty, students and alumnae. On June 23, 2006, The Board of Trustees voted to eliminate the School of Interdisciplinary Studies in favor of a \\"Western Honors College\\" in an attempt to expand the honors program at Miami. On October 24, 2006, the University Senate began deliberations on the persistence of the program (without the school classification). In January 2007, it was announced that the Western College Program would be merged into the College of Arts and Sciences. The Western College Program became the Western Program, Department of Individualized Studies. Rather than having a department of permanent faculty, the program would have one central faculty member with students taking classes led by faculty in several different departments. Students now receive a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree rather than the Bachelor of Philosophy its graduates were awarded in the Western College Program. Critics say the program may provide diverse courses with faculty from different backgrounds but the student-faculty bond which was a strongly beneficial attribute of Western's previous incarnation may suffer. However, such concerns have turned out to be largely unfounded. The alleged plan to rid Western of permanent faculty never came to pass. After the transition, many Western College Program faculty remained as full-time faculty members for the Western Program.

An organisation or individual without an exit strategy may be in a quagmire. At worst, an exit strategy will save face; at best, an exit strategy will deliver an objective worth more than the cost of continuing the execution of a previous plan considered \\"deemed to fail\\" by weight of the present situation. In warfare In military strategy, an exit strategy is understood to minimise losses of what military jargon called \\"blood and treasure\\" (lives and material). The term was used technically in internal Pentagon critiques of the Vietnam War (cf. President Richard Nixon's promise of Peace With Honor), but remained obscure to the general public until the Battle of Mogadishu, Somalia when the U.S. military involvement in that U.N. peacekeeping operation cost the lives of U.S. troops without a clear objective. Republican critics of President Bill Clinton derided him for having no exit strategy, although he had inherited an active military operation from his predecessor, President George H. W. Bush. The criticism was revived later against the U.S. involvement in the Yugoslav wars, including peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and the Kosovo war against Serbia. The term has been adopted by critics of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and especially Iraq. President George W. Bush was said to have no exit strategy to remove troops from Iraq, and critics worried about the number of Coalition soldiers and Iraqi civilians who would suffer injury or death as a result. President Barack Obama did not publicly announce an exit strategy for the troops in Afghanistan. In public policy An exit strategy may operate as a means of implementing the termination of a policy or to demonstrate that termination is feasible, for example from joining the Euro.Hoover Institute, An Exit Strategy From the Euro, 9 January 2012, accessed 2 March 2016 In business In entrepreneurship and strategic management an exit strategy or exit plan is a way to transition the ownership of a company to another company (e.g. through a merger or acquisition), to investors (e.g. through an Initial public offering) or to the owner's children or family. Other types of exit strategies include management buyouts and employee buyouts. Winding up a company, whether through a bankruptcy or voluntary dissolution, is also an exit strategy. Bringing on board strategic or financial partners may be considered a form of exit, albeit a partial exit, as it may help ensure succession and survival of the business.Nemethy, Les, Business Exit Planning: Options, Value Enhancement, and Transaction Management for Business Owners. John Wiley & Sons, 2011 Exit strategies are also used to ensure businesses are prepared for the termination of significant contracts or other business relationships. \\"There are many reasons why contracts come to an end, including non-performance by one or both parties, a significant change in the requirements of either party, or that the contract has run its course. In almost all cases, having a well-developed exit strategy is critical. The strategy is usually developed as the means by which to withdraw from a working relationship with a supplier. It can incorporate the process of returning assets, transferring back key employees and the conditions under which a relationship can terminate, for example, the failure to meet service level agreements, changes in circumstances, and ethical breaches\\".CIPS Australasia, CIPS Procurement Topics: Exit Strategies, accessed 2 March 2016 Transition companies are professional mergers and acquisitions companies that assist business owners with their exit strategy. Services offered are often referred to as transition management services.

Flowing along the trace of the active Awatere Fault, it runs northeast through a straight valley to the west of the Inland Kaikoura mountains. This valley is parallel with that of the Clarence River, to the south. It flows for from its source in the mountainous interior to reach Cook Strait close to the town of Seddon. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"swift river\\" for Awatere. Awatere River bridge In 1887 the Awatere River was without any bridge crossing and at the time was noted by Parliament to be the only river not bridged between Picton and Bluff. Planning of a 325-metre joint road and rail bridge began in 1896, designed by Peter Seton Hay, and construction by Scott Brothers Ltd, a Christchurch based company, began two years after. Back in those times, bridge building lacked the modern engineering technology that is used today, and much of the construction was done via human and animal power. The laying of caissons which formed the foundations of the bridge was notoriously treacherous to workers at the risk of developing the bends due to long exposure of working in pressurised conditions. Construction was completed on 18 July 1901. The original road/rail bridge was opened on 10 October 1902. Construction took three years at the cost of ¬£22,500. State Highway 1 crosses the Awatere River at its current point just north of Seddon. The initial bridge remained the crossing until 2007 when most recently traffic signals were added to either direction to control vehicles on the platform, which was only wide enough for one lane of traffic. A new $15 million two-lane road bridge was constructed with the railway being the sole use of the original bridge and officially opened on 9 November 2007. The vehicle deck on the original bridge was decommissioned as it was deemed too expensive to retain its use for pedestrians and cyclists.

Production and content  After attracting mixed reviews for much of his 1980s output, Pop hired longtime Stooges fan Don Was as producer, who would later produce Avenue B, and opted for a hard rock sound. Many songs on the album incorporate a lyrical theme of the United States facing dangers of cultural decay and implosion. Slash and Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses fame were featured on the album as songwriters and performers. The cover was drawn by American cartoonist Charles Burns. The album's personnel includes studio musicians Waddy Wachtel and Kenny Aronoff. The album is the first studio album that features Pop contributing guitar. He plays a majority of the guitar parts along with Wachtel and Slash.  Release  The album peaked at number 90 on the Billboard 200 and stayed on the charts for 37 weeks. The song \\"Livin' On the Edge of the Night\\" was released before the album as a soundtrack for the hit movie Black Rain starring Michael Douglas and Andy Garc√≠a. The song reached number 16 on Modern Rock Tracks. \\"Candy\\" reached number 30 on Mainstream Rock Tracks, number 5 on Modern Rock Tracks and number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. The first single from the album, \\"Home\\", reached number 2 on Modern Rock Tracks. After completing the album, Pop conducted a successful world tour; his 1991 performance in Paris was recorded and later released on DVD. Several famous fans appeared on stage with Pop during the tour, including longtime fan Johnny Depp.  Reception  The album gave Pop some of his strongest reviews since his David Bowie collaborations, and \\"Candy\\", with the B-52's vocalist Kate Pierson, became his first MTV hit.

It consists of Great Badminton and Little Badminton. The main street in 2013 History In 1612 Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, bought from Nicholas Boteler his manors of Great and Little Badminton, called Madmintune in the Domesday Book while one century earlier the name Badimyncgtun was recorded, held by that family since 1275. Badminton House The village houses the Duke of Beaufort's residence, Badminton House, which has been the principal seat of the Somerset family since the late 17th century. Badminton House also gives its name to the sport of badminton. Amenities The village does have a small shop which also serves as a post office. =Transport= The village is located close to the A46 and A433, the B4040 passes south of it. The next motorway junction is Tormarton Interchange between A46 and M4. The former railway station in nearby Acton Turville closed in 1968, but the line is still active. The nearest railway station is Yate on the Bristol‚ÄìGloucester line. West of the village is Badminton Airfield. Horse trials The village is famous for its horse trials, which take place in early May each year in the grounds of Badminton House. St Michael and All Angels The parish church of St Michael and All Angels in Great Badminton is attached to the Duke of Beaufort's residence.St Michael and All Angels Church, Great Badminton, 19 July 2013 The current church was built in 1785 and serves as the principal burial place of the Somerset family. Nearly all Dukes and Duchesses are interred here. A smaller church, also dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, stands in neighbouring Little Badminton.St Michael and All Angels Church, Little Badminton, 19 July 2013 Little Badminton To the north of the main village is the small rural settlement of Little Badminton. Here can be found farm houses, cottages and estate lodges very much in the traditional Cotswold style of architecture. Remains of a medieval 'sunken village' can be seen in Little Badminton, as well as an ornamental dovecote or croft, which is mentioned in the Domesday book. Notable events Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War and later commander of all the British forces in the Crimean War was born, raised and buried in Badminton. He was the youngest son of the 5th Duke of Beaufort. The village of Badminton played host to the Dowager Queen Mary during the Second World War, who was evacuated from Marlborough House in London to take up residence at Badminton House for the duration of the war. She lived here with her niece Mary, Duchess of Beaufort, wife of the 10th Duke. Badminton Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in the late 1890s or early 1900s.

Bennett, . If a document is delivered but not accepted, it is said to have been lodged with or received by the clerk (but not filed). Courts will not consider motions unless an appropriate memorandum or brief is filed before the appropriate deadline. Usually a filing fee is paid which is part of court costs. Filing systems In civil procedure systems, filing rules can be mandatory or permissive. In a mandatory filing system, all documents of legal importance exchanged between the parties are also filed with the court, while in a permissive filing system, nothing needs to be filed until the case reaches a point where direct judicial management is absolutely necessary (such as the brink of trial). For example, the United States federal courts operate on a mandatory filing system (with minor exceptions for the most routine discovery exchanges).See Rule 5(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In contrast, from the reign of Edward IV during the late 1400s to the late 1990s (that is, before the 1998 promulgation of the Civil Procedure Rules), the trial courts of England and Wales normally did not maintain comprehensive pretrial case files (beyond recording the issuance of a writ to initiate a legal proceeding). Instead, after service of a writ, the parties merely served their pleadings on each other, then at some point in time, one party would ask the court to set down the case for trial (that is, put the case on a list of cases awaiting the setting or \\"fixture\\" of trial dates) and lodge two copies of the pleadings with the court (along with other documents relevant to the planned trial). Even after they had been lodged (i.e., temporarily deposited) with the court, the pleadings were not filed immediately. Rather, one copy was for the personal use of the judge, while the other copy would be officially filed after the trial together with the judgment to establish the court's permanent record of the issues that had been formally adjudicated at trial. In the United States, a permissive filing system has persisted to the present in the state of New York, which was modified in 1992 but still largely operates in its traditional form in certain lower courts. Professor Siegel points out that under this system, \\"it is possible ... for a case to come and go ‚Äî such as by settlement ‚Äî without the court having any record of the case at all.\\" Filing may also refer to submission of a form to a government agency, with or without an accompanying fee. Filing methods Filing traditionally has been performed by visiting a clerk at a filing window, paying a filing fee by cash, check, or credit card, and submitting the document to be filed in duplicate or even triplicate. For each document filed, the court clerk inspects the document to ensure compliance with the court's rules on how legal documents should be formatted, verifies that the filer has not been declared a vexatious litigant, and confirms that the case number and caption are for a valid case. Next, the court clerk then stamps both copies with a large stamp that indicates the name of the court and the date the document was filed, then keeps one copy for the court's files and returns one copy to the filer for the filer's own records. In certain jurisdictions, the clerk will stamp duplicate copies returned to the filer as \\"file-conformed\\" or \\"conformed copy\\" rather than \\"filed\\". These stamps mean the duplicate copy appears to conform to the appearance of the original document, and in turn, a copy bearing such a stamp can be submitted as evidence with later filings of the act of filing of the original. But the \\"filed\\" stamp is reserved for the original document that goes into the court file, and will be seen outside that file only if one obtains a certified copy photocopied directly from the original document on file. In courts that require triplicate submissions, the third copy is then taken (either by the clerk or by the filer) to the chambers or courtroom of the judge assigned to the case. The clerk then adds the document to the docket for the case as well as any related deadlines or events. If the document is the first pleading filed in a case (usually the complaint), the court clerk also assigns a new case number and opens a new file for the case. A newer phenomenon is electronic filing, in which lawyers simply upload Portable Document Format electronic documents to a secure website maintained either by the court (for example, the U.S. has CM/ECF) or by a private commercial service like LexisNexis. This is convenient in that many courts can now accept filings at all hours, rather than only during regular business hours. Where e-filing is in effect, the filer is normally required to lodge a \\"courtesy copy\\" (that is, a conventional paper copy) at the chambers of the assigned judge by the next business day. The courtesy copy of the filing is merely used to decide the motion at issue and is discarded when no longer needed, since the electronic file is now the court's master copy of the case file. Filing fees Generally, filing fees are controversial because some individuals believe that they impede access to justice. Although American litigants complain about fees all the time (for example, it costs $435 to file a complaint in Los Angeles), the American system is considered to be quite plaintiff-friendly by experts on comparative law. In explaining the relative paucity of product liability litigation outside of the United States, Professor Reimann notes: \\"In the United States, it is cheap to file a lawsuit.\\" Many legal systems have filing fees for complaints that are proportional to the amount sought. Thus, the greater the damages sought, the higher the fee to file. Even when one seeks a waiver for grossly unfair fees, courts tend to waive only the amount in excess of the plaintiff's total assets, with the result that just to initiate a meritorious case, an already severely injured or damaged plaintiff may have to go bankrupt. What some consider to be the inherent unfairness of this system as actually implemented in Austria resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2004).

Williamson (born 1967) is an American military science fiction and military fiction author best known for his libertarian-themed Freehold series published by Baen Books. Between 2004 and 2016, Williamson published eight Freehold novels, exploring military and political themes as well as first contact with alien beings. This was followed by the Forged in Blood (2017) and Freehold: Resistance (2019) anthologies, consisting of short stories taking place in the Freehold universe, some by Williamson and some by other authors, including Larry Correia, Tony Daniel, Tom Kratman and Brad R. Torgersen. Work outside the Freehold universe includes The Hero (2004), written with John Ringo, and the time travel story A Long Time Until Now (2014). Short fiction by Williamson includes the story \\"Soft Casualty\\", an exploration of psychological warfare which won a readers' choice award organized by Baen Books. Williamson's Wisdom From My Internet, a collection of witticisms and political polemic from the Internet, was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2015. As of 2016, Williamson's books had sold half a million copies. Biography Williamson was born in 1967 in Birkenhead, England. His family moved to Canada, then to Newark, Ohio, where he graduated from Newark High School in 1985. After high school, he joined the military and served in a support role in the Air Force for 5 years, then in the Air and Army National Guard, for a total of 22 years. Williamson's military career included service with the US Air Force in deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Williamson has three children and is married. Freehold books Williamson's first book, Freehold, was released in January 2004 and made #3 on the April 2004 Locus Bestsellers list for science-fiction and fantasy paperbacks. Freehold tells the story of Kendra Pacelli, a young soldier who begins the book in the service of a world-dominant, authoritarian United Nations. Accused of a crime she did not commit, she flees Earth for the Freehold of Grainne where she struggles to adapt to the climate and culture of an ultra- libertarian planet. She eventually joins the Freehold military and fights in a war against a UN invasion. Williamson has remarked that the main character is partially based on himself and his experience immigrating from the UK to Canada and the United States. Don D'Ammassa criticized Freehold as a political tract with an oversimplified and unrealistic view of humanity calling it a \\"very long but frankly not very entertaining diatribe\\". Michael M. Jones of SF Site conversely called Williamson's portrayal of a libertarian society \\"sound and believable\\" and described the book as \\"a satisfactory debut\\". Ginger Armstrong of Kliatt called Freehold a \\"highly readable SF adventure\\" with \\"a strong female protagonist\\". Carolyn Cushman of Locus noted heavy emphasis on the exposition of Libertarian ideology with plotting and pacing taking a back seat but described the novel as \\"amazingly entertaining\\". Many of Williamson's other works are set in the universe established in Freehold. One is Contact with Chaos (2009) where humanity has first contact with alien beings. This becomes a further source of conflict between the United Nations and the Freeholders. In a review of the book, Joseph T. Major praised Williamson for refraining from heavy-handed political messages and instead creating \\"a diverse, varied human interplanetary society ... trying to understand an exotic, alternative nonhuman society\\". Other novels set in the Freehold universe include Better to Beg Forgiveness... (2007) which Mark Lardas of the Galveston Daily News praised as an \\"exciting and violent adventure\\" and Rogue (2011) which he described as Williamson setting \\"a new, higher standard for himself\\". The novel Do Unto Others (2010) made the Wall Street Journal best- seller list in hardcover science fiction and Angeleyes (2016) sold in more than 100,000 copies. Williamson was the editor of Forged in Blood, which was released in September 2017. The book is set in Williamson's Freehold universe and he also wrote or co-wrote five of its 16 stories; other contributors included Larry Correia, Tony Daniel, and Tom Kratman. The stories are linked as they trace the history of a single sword, from its forging in Japan in the third century BC through to Williamson's Freehold of Grainne in the 24th century. Mark Lardas praised the authors for creating a coherent anthology while attempting \\"something original [by] telling a story through an object.\\" He described the result as an \\"engaging book\\". The science fiction review magazine Tangent described the work as a celebration of \\"soldiers and their tools\\" that is satisfying to those for whom that premise appeals. A further anthology, Freehold: Resistance, was released in December 2019. Reviewers praised the tight braiding together of the different contributions to form \\"a mosaic novel masquerading as an anthology\\". Other works Among works not set in the Freehold universe is Williamson's second novel, The Hero (2004), which was written with John Ringo and made the Locus Bestseller list in February 2006. The book is a part of the Legacy of the Aldenata series. It appeared in German as Invasion - Heldentaten and in Russian as –ì–µ—Ä–æ–π. Williamson has also written the Target: Terror (2004-2005) military fiction series which is set in the world of the Target: Terror arcade game. His stand- alone novels include the time-travel story A Long Time Until Now (2014) which was praised for its characterization and survivalist elements. As of 2016, Williamson's books had sold half a million copies. Williamson has contributed short fiction to numerous anthologies, including many which take place in the Valdemar and Elemental Masters shared universes created by Mercedes Lackey. He has also contributed stories to the Heroes in Hell shared universe and to many anthologies of military science fiction published by Baen. An anthology of Williamson's short fiction, Tour of Duty (2013), was reviewed by Publishers Weekly which singled out \\"The Humans call it Duty\\" as \\"strong\\" and \\"Desert Blues\\" as \\"subtly haunting\\". In 2015, Baen Books released an anthology, The Year's Best Military SF & Space Opera, which was described by Don Sakers of Analog as \\"long overdue\\". Baen Books invited readers to vote for the best story from the volume. Sakers commented: \\"We can only hope that the award, like the anthology, will become an annual event.\\" Williamson won the readers' poll for the short story \\"Soft Casualty\\" and was presented with an award at Dragon Con. The story deals with psychological warfare as an occupying force encounters harsh resistance tactics. Williamson's Wisdom From My Internet (2014), a collection of witticisms and political polemic from the Internet, was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2015. The Hugo nominations that year triggered accusations of politically motivated bloc voting. The controversy resulted in a number of categories, including the one containing Wisdom From My Internet, receiving \\"No Award\\". Williamson himself stated while the poll was underway that he had voted for no award in all categories, including the one in which his work appeared. Themes Williamson was recruited as an author by ex-soldier and publisher Jim Baen who \\"recruited a batch of younger, like-minded authors from similar backgrounds\\"; Williamson, David Drake, John Ringo and Tom Kratman. Commonalities in the works of these authors include the setting of a civilization in decline with heroes battling against conventional wisdom. John Clute comments in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction that a pattern running through the works of Williamson is a fight to maintain freedom against external enemies with the heroes adhering to libertarian principles. Clute notes the frequent presence of female heroes in Williamson's works and feminist critic Liz Bourke describes Williamson's treatment of female characters as \\"less clearly marginalizing\\" than that of John Ringo and Tom Kratman. Blair Nicholson, in a doctoral thesis from the University of Waikato, points out commonalities in the authorial stances of Williamson and David Weber who both emphasize that in military science fiction, the hypothesized military environment must be depicted in realistic detail down to details of strategy and tactics. According to Williamson the work should then seek to \\"explore the proposed system, and its interactions with the people ‚Äì soldiers and civilians ‚Äì involved\\". Nicholson notes that Williamson depicts the United Nations as an enemy, and particularly so in his Freehold (2004) novel, where the United Nations appears as an authoritarian oppressor. This depiction of the United Nations has parallels in the Marine in Space series by Ian Douglas and in the works of Tom Kratman and is reflective of a negative right-wing popular opinion on the institution.

He published more than 70 works, and his poems have been translated to 12 languages.  Biography  Paavo Haavikko was born and grew up in Helsinki. His father was a bookbinder and later in import business. 1951. In 1951 Haavikko graduated from the Kallio Coeducational School, and published his first collection of poems. In the 1950s Haavikko published several poetry collections more, culminating later in the collection entitled Talvipalatsi ('The Winter Palace'; 1959). He was at the forefront of the emerging modernist movement in Finland, and in the following decades he went on to have a profound influence on many other genres as well. As a result of his literary achievements, he became the leading writer of his generation and of the entire postwar period in Finland. Paavo Haavikko with his first wife, the writer Marja-Liisa Vartio (1924‚Äì1966). Haavikko's first wife Marja- Liisa Vartio was also a writer. They had two children. Marja-Liisa Vartio died in 1966, and Haavikko stopped writing for a long time. Haavikko married Ritva Rainio in 1971. They lived separately since 1983.  Career as a writer  Haavikko started his career as a poet, but he published in almost every genre of literature. His drama has seldom been played on traditional theatre scenes. Television series Rauta-aika illustrated freely the Finnish National epic Kalevala. Operas Ratsumies (English title: The Horseman) and Kuningas l√§htee Ranskaan (English title: The King goes forth to France) were composed by Aulis Sallinen to librettos by Haavikko. Haavikko placed many of his works in historical context but included references to more modern politics, such as Juho Kusti Paasikivi and Stalin in his play Agricola ja kettu ('Agricola and the Fox'), or Urho Kaleva Kekkonen as a Viking ruler. He scrutinized Finland's leading politicians and civil servants in his column in weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti. Images occurring often in Haavikko's poetry included the king, palaces, gardens, and the woods. Haavikko was talented in describing love, romantic and relationships between men and women. After the death of his first wife he started to write about subjects less discussed in poetry: economy, politics and society.  Reception  The high opinion of Haavikko's poetry was not confined to his home country: John Ashbery considered The Winter Palace as \\"one of the great poems of the century\\".  Business life  From 1967 to 1983, Haavikko was literary director of the Otava publishing company, and from 1989 to his death owner of the Art House publishing company.Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2008. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC He and his family had a company producing peat for fuel. He also owned forest. When he died, his family inherited 3 million euros.

At the age of 26, he became the youngest professor to receive tenure at Harvard. He is also a chess master and a chess composer. Early life Elkies was born to an engineer father and a piano teacher mother. He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City for three years before graduating in 1982 at age 16. A child prodigy in 1981, at age 14, he was awarded a gold medal at the 22nd International Mathematical Olympiad, receiving a perfect score of 42, one of the youngest to ever do so. He went on to Columbia University, where he won the Putnam competition at the age of sixteen years and four months, making him one of the youngest Putnam Fellows in history. He was a Putnam Fellow two more times during his undergraduate years. He earned his Ph.D. in 1987 under the supervision of Benedict Gross and Barry Mazur at Harvard University. From 1987 to 1990 he was a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows. Work in mathematics In 1987, he proved that an elliptic curve over the rational numbers is supersingular at infinitely many primes. In 1988, he found a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture for fourth powers. His work on these and other problems won him recognition and a position as an associate professor at Harvard in 1990. In 1993, he was made a full, tenured professor at the age of 26. This made him the youngest full professor in the history of Harvard. Along with A. O. L. Atkin he extended Schoof's algorithm to create the Schoof‚ÄìElkies‚ÄìAtkin algorithm. Elkies also studies the connections between music and mathematics; he is on the advisory board of the Journal of Mathematics and Music. He has discovered many new patterns in Conway's Game of LifeGame of Life Status page, Jason Summers. and has studied the mathematics of still life patterns in that cellular automaton rule. Elkies is an associate of Harvard's Lowell House. Elkies is one of the principal investigators of the Simons Collaboration on Arithmetic Geometry, Number Theory, and Computation, a large multi-university collaboration involving Boston University, Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, and MIT. Elkies is the discoverer (or joint-discoverer) of many current and past record-holding elliptic curves, including the curve with the highest-known lower bound (‚â•28) on its rank, and the curve with the highest-known exact rank (=20). Music Elkies is a bass-baritone and plays the piano for the Harvard Glee Club. Jameson N. Marvin, former director of the Glee Club, compared him to \\"a Bach or a Mozart,\\" citing \\"[h]is gifted musicality, superior musicianship and sight-reading ability.\\" Chess Elkies is a composer and solver of chess problems (winning the 1996 World Chess Solving Championship).

Hartley served ten terms in the United States House of Representatives where he represented the New Jersey's 8th and New Jersey's 10th congressional districts. He is by far best known for being the House of Representatives sponsor of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. Background Hartley was born in Harrison, New Jersey on February 22, 1902. After going through the Harrison public schools and Rutgers Preparatory School for high school, Hartley went on to attend Rutgers University. Following his studies in 1923, he successfully ran for the position of library commissioner for Kearny, New Jersey. After holding that position for two years, Hartley was named as the police and fire commissioner for Kearny, a position he held until 1928. In that same year, he was nominated as a Republican to run for the United States House of Representatives seat for New Jersey's 8th congressional district. Hartley defeated the incumbent Paul J. Moore in a close election on November 6, 1928. The final vote count in the election was 64,915 votes for Hartley and 64,594 for Moore, making the margin of defeat a slim 0.2%. pg. 1161 Politics Hartley was sworn in at age twenty-seven as the youngest member of the 71st United States Congress on March 4, 1929. Hartley was again challenged by Paul J. Moore in the 1930 House elections for the seat in New Jersey's 8th district. In another close race, Hartley beat out Moore, capturing 44,038 votes, or 50.4% of the vote, in comparison to 43,195 votes (or 49.4%) of the vote for Moore.Moore (1994), pg. 1166 He was one of a relatively small number of Republicans to hold their seats throughout the Great Depression and World War II. In the 1932 election, he defeated William W. Harrison for the House seat in New Jersey's 10th congressional district.Moore (1994), pg. 1171 and in the 1934 he beat William Herda Smith.Moore (1994), pg. 1176 Hartley had another close race in 1936, in which he beat out Democratic challenger Lindsay H. Rudd in a close 50.2%-49.6% race.Moore (1994), pg. 1181 Hartley soundly defeated Rudd again in 1938,Moore (1994), pg. 1186 and won re-election in 1940 against William W. Holmwood,Moore (1994), pg. 1191 in 1942 against Frederic Bigelow,Moore (1994), pg. 1196 in 1944 against Luke A. Kiernan Jr.,Moore (1994), pg. 1201 and in 1946 against his future successor Peter W. Rodino Jr.Moore (1994), pg. 1206 =Taft- Hartley= Hartley found the level of postwar labor unrest to be very disturbing, and felt that it threatened both economic and political stability. In 1946, the Republicans returned their first majority in both houses of Congress since the 1928 election in which Hartley was first elected. With his party in the majority, Hartley served as the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 80th United States Congress. Along with United States Senator Robert A. Taft who was Chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the next year he introduced legislation to curb what he felt were the worst of labor's excesses. The resultant Taft-Hartley Act was a major revision of the 1935 Wagner Act (officially known as the National Labor Relations Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by the post-war Congress. The act placed limits on labor tactics such as the secondary boycott, and gave each state the option to enact right-to- work laws if it so chose (24 states have done so). This provision, known as Section 14(b), was one of the Act's most controversial. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the Act, but Congress overrode the veto on June 23, 1947, with 20 of the 45 Democratic Senators and 107 of the 188 Democratic Representatives joining with Republicans to override the veto. It is in the platform of all major U.S. labor unions to call for the repeal of the Act, especially Section 14 (b), and at times this has been reflected in the platform of the Democratic Party. However, the only time this has ever seemed likely was when the Democrats had a huge majority in both houses of Congress following the Republican electoral disaster of 1964. Even then, the repeal bill passed 221‚Äì203 in the House, but the two-thirds majority it needed in the Senate was never attained, partly because of long filibustering by Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. Labor allies failed to break the filibuster, and the repeal bill was withdrawn by the Democratic Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, in 1966.'Right to Work' Repeal Again Loses in Senate, CQ Almanac 1966. Congressional Quarterly. Hartley did not seek any further election to Congress following the term in which the Act which bears his name was passed, and his service concluded on January 3, 1949. Later life Hartley ran unsuccessfully for one of the two New Jersey senatorial seats in 1954 and he returned to New Jersey and lived for fifteen more years as a business consultant, seeing the Act withstand its toughest test and remain intact. He died in Linwood, New Jersey, and was buried in Fairmount Cemetery, in Newark. His son, Al Hartley, was a cartoonist best known for his work on Archie Comics.Staff. \\"Al Hartley, 81; Illustrated 'Archie' Comic Strips\\", Los Angeles Times, May 29, 2003.

Development may be limited by the fact that the area is not properly legalised, and has lands to which more than one owner can produce a title; as a result it is hard to legally buy and sell property. The commercial zone is the centre of Cofradia, where most retail buying and selling occurs. Events General Esperanzano Gregorio Ferrera surrendered at Cofradia 26 June 1931 after a six-years-long attempted uprising. Telegraph service in Cofradia began 7 November 1905; the first telegraphist was Don Juan Magnar. Other early telegraphists were Cesar Mejia, who arrived in 1908 from an unknown location and Don Rodolfo Castillo who arrived on 7 March 1911 from Santa B√°rbara. The dam was built in 1936‚Äì37 under the supervision of engineer Gonzalo R. Luque. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time was Don Jos√© Castro L√≥pez, who presided over the inauguration of the dam 24 December 1937. Education The first school was founded in 1900; its first teacher was Don Filadelfo L√≥pez Morales. A boys' school was founded in 1900, by teacher Donaldo Sabillon V√°squez. The girls' school was founded between in 1905 and 1912; its first teacher was Elvia Julia Morales. Another boys' school was founded in 1930 under the direction of Leandro Rodr√≠guez. The Miguel Paz Barahona girls school was founded 24 December 1937 at the same time as the inauguration of a municipal water system. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time, Don Jos√© Castro L√≥pez, appointed Do√±a Laura Vda. de Alcocer the director, and in 1920 Don Donaldo was promoted to the position, with a monthly salary of Lps. 90. At that time, sixth grade was offered only in the more advanced villages, with children in others only going to the fifth grade. The age of matriculation ranged between 7 and 18 years. The teachers were very strict disciplinarians: if a student failed to show up for school, a teacher's assistant would seek the student out and bring him or her back to school, to be punished there by the teacher; and punished again by his or her parents upon arriving back home. The students received 8 hours of lessons daily. Teaching materials for students included a notebook made of sewn office paper, ink made with blue aniline. Pencils were of made candle wax, the satchels were made of cloth or nylon.

An ASG is at a higher level of abstraction than an abstract syntax tree (or AST), which is used to express the syntactic structure of an expression or program. ASGs are more complex and concise than ASTs because they may contain shared subterms (also known as \\"common subexpressions\\"). Abstract semantic graphs are often used as an intermediate representation by compilers to store the results of performing common subexpression elimination upon abstract syntax trees. ASTs are trees and are thus incapable of representing shared terms. ASGs are usually directed acyclic graphs (DAG), although in some applications graphs containing cycles may be permitted. For example, a graph containing a cycle might be used to represent the recursive expressions that are commonly used in functional programming languages as non-looping iteration constructs. The mutability of these types of graphs, is studied in the field of graph rewriting. The nomenclature term graph is associated with the field of term graph rewriting, which involves the transformation and processing of expressions by the specification of rewriting rules, whereas abstract semantic graph is used when discussing linguistics, programming languages, type systems and compilation. Abstract syntax trees are not capable of sharing subexpression nodes because it is not possible for a node in a proper tree to have more than one parent. Although this conceptual simplicity is appealing, it may come at the cost of redundant representation and, in turn, possibly inefficiently duplicating the computation of identical terms. For this reason ASGs are often used as an intermediate language at a subsequent compilation stage to abstract syntax tree construction via parsing. An abstract semantic graph is typically constructed from an abstract syntax tree by a process of enrichment and abstraction. The enrichment can for example be the addition of back-pointers, edges from an identifier node (where a variable is being used) to a node representing the declaration of that variable. The abstraction can entail the removal of details which are relevant only in parsing, not for semantics.  Example: Code Refactoring  For example, consider the case of code refactoring. To represent the implementation of a function that takes an input argument, the received parameter is conventionally given an arbitrary, distinct name in the source code so that it can be referenced. The abstract representation of this conceptual entity, a \\"function argument\\" instance, will likely be mentioned in the function signature, and also one or more times within the implementation code body. Since the function as a whole is the parent of both its header or \\"signature\\" information as well as its implementation body, an AST would not be able to use the same node to co- identify the multiple uses or appearances of the argument entity. This is solved by the DAG nature of an ASG. A key advantage of having a single, distinct node identity for any given code element is that each element's properties are, by definition, uniquely stored. This simplifies refactoring operations, because there is exactly one existential nexus for any given property instantiation. If the developer decides to change a property value such as the \\"name\\" of any code element (the \\"function argument\\" in this example), the ASG inherently exposes that value in exactly one place, and it follows that any such property changes are implicitly, trivially, and immediately propagated globally.

Shimada, occurred near Guadalajara as the men were en route to join the Scot Expedition at Acapulco. Cromwell was Senior Scientist with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Research Associate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California. His field of work was the physical environment and its relation to fisheries. He became a weather officer in the Army Air Force during World War II.. After receiving a B.A. degree from University of California (Los Angeles) in 1947, he returned to La Jolla, his boyhood home, as a student at Scripps, receiving an M.S. degree in oceanography from the University of California (La Jolla) in 1949. At Scripps he was strongly influenced by H. U. Sverdrup. From 1949 to 1953 he was Oceanographer at Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations,NOAA website Honolulu, Oscar Elton Sette, then Director, and Cromwell initiated a far-sighted and intensive survey of the physical and biological characteristics of Pacific equatorial waters, which had been the subject of much speculation but little observation. For many months he participated in the field work from the HUGH M. SMITH, and for more and harder months he carried out the analysis of the observations. As a result of this pioneering work, the knowledge of the physical and biological structure of the equatorial Pacific Ocean has been vastly advanced. These achievements are the more remarkable when one notes that comparable surveys of the equatorial Atlantic and Indian oceans are still lacking. Cromwell confirmed the existence of upwelling at the equator, disproved the existence of upwelling at the northern edge of the Equatorial Countercurrent, and originated a reasonable model of wind-induced current transport in the equatorial zone Cromwell, Townsend (1953). \\"Circulation in a meridional plane in the central equatorial Pacific.\\" Journal of Marine Research 12 196-213.

John Abernethy Senior accompanied Patrick Adair on a deputation from the general committee of Ulster presbyterians, who presented a congratulatory address to William III in London 1689, and obtained from the king a letter (9 November 1689) recommending their case to Duke Schomberg.'Nine Ulster Lives', Gerard O'Brien, Peter Roebuck, P127 In his thirteenth year John Abernethy Junior entered the University of Glasgow, and on concluding his course there went on to Edinburgh, where his he soon moved in the most cultured circles. Returning home, he was licensed to preach from his Presbytery before he was twenty-one. In 1701 he was called to accept charge of an important congregation in Antrim; after an interval of two years, mostly spent in further study in Dublin, he was ordained there on 8 August 1703. He became a noted debater in the synods and assemblies of his church and a leading evangelist. He has been described as being at this time \\"the young minister of Antrim ... a man of studious habits, heretical opinions, and remarkable ability.\\" In 1712, he was devastated by the loss of his wife (Susannah Jordan). Five years later, he was invited to the congregation of Usher's Quay, Dublin, and also to what was called the Old Congregation of Belfast. The synod assigned him to Dublin. After careful consideration he refused, and remained at Antrim. This refusal aroused disapproval; and a controversy followed, Abernethy standing firm for religious freedom and repudiating the ecclesiastical courts. The controversy and quarrel bears the name of the two camps in the conflict, the \\"Subscribers\\" and the \\"Non-subscribers.\\" Abernethy and his associates sowed the seeds of the struggle (1821-1840) in which, under the leadership of Dr Henry Cooke, the Arian and Socinian elements of the Irish Presbyterian Church were thrown out. Much of what he contended for, and which the \\"Subscribers\\" opposed bitterly, was silently granted in the lapse of time. In 1726, the \\"Non-subscribers\\" were cut off, with due ban and solemnity, from the Irish Presbyterian Church. In 1730 he moved to Wood Street, Dublin. It was said of him that, although a \\"Non-subscriber,\\" he was a Trinitarian.A history of Presbyterianism in Dublin and the south and west of Ireland by Rev Clarke H Irwin, 1890, page 318 However, Dr Henry Cooke stated that Arianism \\"made very considerable progress under the patronage of high names, as Abernethy, the author of a very excellent work upon the Attributes, who gave it a great deal of eclat\\".THE HOUSE OF LORDS THE SESSIONAL PAPERS 1801-1833: VOL. 215, 1826-7, P148 In 1731 came the greatest controversy in which Abernethy was involved.

In 1953, Brathwaite received a B.A. honours degree in History from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and he also began his association with the BBC's Caribbean Voices programme in London. In 1954 he received a Diploma of Education from Pembroke College, Cambridge. =The years in Ghana= The year 1955 found Brathwaite working as an education officer in the Gold Coast with the Ministry of Education. This saw him \\"witness Kwame Nkrumah coming to power and Ghana becoming the first African state to gain independence, which profoundly affected his sense of Caribbean culture and identity\\", and he was also able to study with the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia. In 1960, while he was on home leave from Ghana, Brathwaite married Doris Monica Wellcome, a Guyanese graduate in Home Economics and Tropical Nutrition from the University of Leicester, with whom he would have a son, Michael. During his years in Ghana, Brathwaite's writing flowered, with Odale's Choice (a play) premiering at the Mfantsiman Secondary School in Cape Coast, in June 1962.James Gibbs, Nkyin- kyin: Essays on the Ghanaian Theatre, Rodopi, 2009, p. 43. A full production of the play was later taken to Accra. =Return to the Caribbean and the UK= In 1962‚Äì63, Brathwaite crossed the waters again and found himself as resident tutor in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies in St Lucia. Later in 1963, he made his journey to the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus in Kingston, Jamaica, to teach in the History Department. In 1966, Brathwaite spearheaded, as co-founder and secretary, the organization of the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) from London, other key figures involved being John La Rose and Andrew Salkey.\\"John La Rose\\", GPI website.Kathleen Ho, \\"The Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) and the Trinidad February Revolution of 1970\\", Northwestern University. In 1971 he launched Savacou, a journal of CAM, at the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year, Brathwaite received the name Kamau from Ngugi wa Thiong'o's grandmother at Limuru, Kenya, while on a City of Nairobi Fellowship to the University of Nairobi.Innes, Lyn (5 February 2020), \\"Edward Kamau Brathwaite obituary\\", The Guardian.

The K5 was introduced in 1989. It is recoil operated and uses a conventional Browning-type locking system. It is mostly carried by commissioned officers in the South Korean military. Design The K5 is a compact, lightweight pistol with an unconventional trigger mechanism called \\"fast action\\". The frame is made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum alloy with a matte anodized finish, while the slide is constructed out of forged 4140 steel with a matte finish. The barrel is made of forged 4150 steel with a (6 grooves) right twist. The pistol features an unusual \\"fast action\\" trigger mechanism which allows the hammer to be decocked while still keeping the mainspring compressed. The \\"fast action\\" (also known as Triple Action, and most recently known as Double Action Plus+) mode allows the trigger travel of the double-action mode and the trigger weight of single- action mode. This allows a more accurate first shot due to the lighter weight of the trigger. It is also safer due to the longer trigger travel required to fire the pistol. A light pull on the trigger causes the hammer to flick back, after which the pistol would behave in conventional single-action mode. The pistol can also be fired in traditional double and single-action modes. The factory double-column type box magazines hold 13 or 15 rounds for the full size variant or for the compact variant 10 rounds. Smith & Wesson 59-series magazines are known to be compatible with the DP51 but will protrude slightly. The magazine release is of the push button type. The pistol has three-dot iron sights. The safety consists of an ambidextrous safety external safety and a passive firing pin block which (as its name implies) blocks the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled. The handgrip panels are made of one piece polymer. Commercial sales The K5 was marketed commercially in the United States between the early to late 1990s through various importers, including FirstShot, Inc., Kimber of America, Inc., B-West Imports, Inc., and Davidsons, Inc. as the DP51, with a compact version known as the DP51C and S&W; caliber version known as the DH40. It is most recently reintroduced through collaboration between Daewoo (now S&T; Motiv) and Lionheart Industries of Redmond, WA in 2011 as the LH9, LH9C, and LH9 MKII (amongst other variants), featuring numerous updates including a redesigned hammer, wider slide serrations with added serrations to the front of the slide, redesigned grips, Cerakote finish, and optional Picatinny rail (as the MKII). The internal design and basic functions remain identical to the original and all the parts interchange between the original and the Lionheart variants.

It was developed by Victor Entertainment and first published in Japan in 1993, and later in Europe and North America in 1994. A sequel, Keio Flying Squadron 2, was released in 1996. The game refers to Japanese culture, both ancient and modern simultaneously. Plot The game is set in the Edo Shogunate era of Japanese history (1865-1868). Rami Nana-Hikari, a seemingly typical teenager, has been the keeper of the Key to the Secret Treasure. Rami is really a descendant of aliens who came to Earth in ancient times. She doesn't know the importance of the Treasure, and her overbearing grandmother doesn't remember what secret the Key unlocks. The Key has been stolen (while Rami was at the local mini-mart, a common hangout for teens then), and now she must get the Key back. Rami rides into battle on her trusty dragon, Spot, as she encounters various enemies such as a sea monster, the U.S. Navy, the Russian Army, and the Seven Gods of the Good Fortune, until she arrives at the ship of Dr. Pon Eho, a raccoon billed as the most intelligent creature on Earth with an IQ of 1400, his appearance being appropriate for the thief that he is. This game features animated cutscenes provided by Studio Pierrot. Gameplay The game consists of Rami riding on top of Spot, who can shoot fireballs at enemies. When Spot is not firing, two smaller dragons (companion fighters) appear one after another to assist Rami and Spot. The lesser dragons shoot smaller fireballs and can be sacrificed to do larger damage, only to reappear when Spot ceases to shoot. Characters Japanese names are given in the western order, given name first. *Rami Nana-Hikari - Grandchild of an ancient family with the mission of guarding the Key that opens the Ark, Rami wears a traditional kimono at the beginning of the game, and later changes into the \\"Super Ultra Cute Battle Suit\\", which is nothing more than a bunny girl costume, complete with bunny ears and tail. In the English version of the game she is 20 years old, while in the Japanese version she is 14 years old. Voiced by Miho Kanno (Japanese); Samantha Paris (English). *Spot Nana-Hikari - Rami's pet dragon, always loyal but as lazy as his owner. Spot has no problems with flying and shooting fireballs. Spot is called Pochi in the Japanese release of the game. Voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English). *\\"Grandma\\" and \\"Grandpa\\" Nana-Hikari - Rami's biological grandparents who have raised her from a young age and have brought her up to be the next keeper of the Secret Treasure. They were former keepers themselves, continuing a long line of ancestors in their clan that have kept the Treasure safe for many generations. They are now retired, and have passed the job to Rami. Grandma is a rather harsh person who does not take lightly to Rami acting like a slob, and Grandpa is just a little dopey. If Rami does not defend the Secret Treasure, it's quite doubtful Grandma will ever let her eat dinner in their house again. Voiced by Keiko Yamamoto (Japanese; Grandma), J≈çji Yanami (Japanese; Grandpa); Roger L. Jackson (English; both). *Dr. Pon Eho - A super intelligent raccoon who stole the Key to the Secret Treasure. His IQ is 1400. He is a member of Greenpeace. Voiced by J≈çji Yanami (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English). *Narrator - Voiced by Yusaku Yara (Japanese); Roger L. Jackson (English). Release Keio Flying Squadron was released on August 6, 1993, in Japan, and on November 10, 1994, in North America by Victor Entertainment. In the United Kingdom, a playable demo disc for Keio Flying Squadron containing the first stage was provided by the Sega Pro CD magazine in its December 1994 issue. While the demo ends after the first stage, it is identical to the full version, and the whole game is accessible in the demo disc by using a level select cheat code. Reception M! Games reviewed the game, giving it a score of 71 out of 100. Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"The game received an extra star because a few bits actually made us laugh, but that's it.\\" Retro Gamer included among top ten Mega CD games, calling it \\"a perfectly acceptable substitute\\" OF Konami's Parodius that features \\"similar style of horizontally scrolling wackiness and puts the Mega-CD hardware to good use to produce some excellent cut-scenes and a brilliant CD-quality soundtrack.\\" References External links *Keio Flying Squadron at MobyGames Category:1993 video games Category:Dragons in video games Category:Sega CD games Category:Sega CD-only games Category:Science fantasy video games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:Video games set in the 19th century Category:Video games featuring female protagonists ","title":"Keio Flying Squadron"},{"id":"1137125","text":"The Tam√°stslikt Cultural Institute is a museum and research institute located on the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton in eastern Oregon.

On August 12, 1993, ‚Äúthe Oregon Trail Sesquicentennial Wagon Train was stopped by Indians on horseback at the east boundary of the Umatilla Indian Reservation,‚Äù in order to draw attention to the lack of federal funding for the Tribes‚Äô Oregon Trail interpretive center. Antone Minthorn, the chairman of the General Council for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, spoke to those on the Wagon Train and the gathered crowd. In his speech, he noted that the Tribes ‚Äúraised more than $4 million ‚Äì more than the three companion trail projects in Baker City, The Dalles and Oregon City combined,‚Äù all of which received federal funding. Minthorn‚Äôs speech focused on the importance of the proposed interpretive center to the Tribes and surrounding area: > Our vision was to create an interpretive center, telling the Tribes‚Äô story > to visitors from all over the world. This vision calls for not only > exhibits, but also for an on-going center of learning and research for > Indians and non-Indians for all time ... It is difficult to overstate the > importance of this project to both the Tribe and this region as a whole.

Minthorn‚Äôs symbolic protest called for ‚Äúnation-wide support‚Äù in presenting ‚Äúa different perspective of Manifest Destiny.‚Äù In December 1993, the plans for the circular interpretive center were unveiled. Created by exhibit designer Jean Jacques Andre, the permanent exhibit planned to ‚Äúfocus on the Tribes before the white man‚Äôs arrival, the current reservation and the tribe‚Äôs vision for the future,‚ÄùPhinney, Wil. ‚ÄúTheme for tribal center unveiled: Focus won‚Äôt be exclusively on history.‚Äù East Oregonian, December 20, 1993. and include a section on the Oregon Trail ‚Äúand its impacts on the tribal way of life.‚Äù The original funding strategy evolved to include private funding, and the Tribes used illustrated plans for the interpretive center to increase support.‚ÄúFund- raising effort for center turning to private sources.‚Äù East Oregonian, December 20, 1993. In May 1994, Representative Bob Smith endorsed the interpretive center, and testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior ‚Äúin support of a $2 million request for the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.‚Äù‚ÄúSmith endorses Tribes‚Äô center.‚Äù East Oregonian, May 17, 1994.

Within the first three weeks of opening, approximately 4,000 people visited the Tam√°stslikt Cultural Institute. Naming The site was initially to be named The Oregon Trail on the Umatilla Indian Reservation Interpretive Institute. Tribal elders deliberated, and decided a shorter name would be more practical. The name Tam√°sclikt, from the Walla Walla North East Sahaptin dialect, was suggested by √Åtway Celia Bearchum.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs In a Name.‚Äù Tam√°stslikt Cultural Institute blog. Retrieved 20 April 2013. Tam√°sclik, a verb, means to ‚Äúturn over,‚Äù as in the turning of the seasons, or years. The English spelling is Tam√°stslik, and the addition of a ‚Äòt‚Äô to the end changes the word from a verb to a name. Linguist Dr. Noel Rude made an orthographic correction to the name.

ASOs are capable of altering mRNA expression through a variety of mechanisms, including ribonuclease H mediated decay of the pre-mRNA, direct steric blockage, and exon content modulation through splicing site binding on pre-mRNA. Several ASOs have been approved in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere.  Nomenclature  The common stem for antisense oligonucleotides drugs is -rsen. The substem -virsen designates antiviral antisense oligonucleotides.International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for biological and biotechnological substances  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  = Half-life and stability = ASO-based drugs employ highly modified, single-stranded chains of synthetic nucleic acids that achieve wide tissue distribution with very long half-lives.Weiss, B. (ed.): Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides and Antisense RNA : Novel Pharmacological and Therapeutic Agents, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1997. For instance, many ASO- based drugs contain phosphorothioate substitutions and 2' sugar modifications to inhibit nuclease degradation enabling vehicle-free delivery to cells. = In vivo delivery = Phosphorothioate ASOs can delivered to cells without the need of a delivery vehicle. ASOs do not penetrate the blood brain barrier when delivered systemically but they can distribute across the neuraxis if injected in the cerebrospinal fluid typically by intrathecal administration. Newer formulations using conjugated ligands greatly enhances delivery efficiency and cell-type specific targeting. Approved therapies = Batten disease = Milasen was a novel individualized therapeutic agent that was designed and approved by the FDA for the treatment of Batten disease. This therapy serves as an example of personalized medicine. In 2019, a report was published detailing the development of milasen, an antisense oligonucleotide drug for Batten disease, under an expanded-access investigational clinical protocol authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Milasen \\"itself remains an investigational drug, and it is not suited for the treatment of other patients with Batten's disease\\" because it was customized for a single patient's specific mutation. However it is an example of individualized genomic medicine therapeutical intervention. =Cytomegalovirus retinitis= Fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene), was approved by the U.S. FDA in August 1998, as a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis. = Duchenne muscular dystrophy = Several morpholino oligos have been approved to treat specific groups of mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In September 2016, eteplirsen (ExonDys51) received FDA approvalU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Springs, Maryland. News Release: FDA grants accelerated approval to first drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, September 19, 2016. for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 51 of the dystrophin transcript. In December 2019, golodirsen (Vyondys 53) received FDA approval for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript. In August 2020, viltolarsen (Viltepso) received FDA approval for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript. =Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome= Volanesorsen was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of familial chylomicronaemia syndrome in May 2019. =Familial hypercholesterolemia= In January 2013 mipomersen (marketed as Kynamro) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. =Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis= Inotersen received FDA approval for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin- mediated amyloidosis in October 2018. The application for inotersen was granted orphan drug designation. It was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and licensed to Akcea Therapeutics. =Spinal muscular atrophy= In 2004, development of an antisense therapy for spinal muscular atrophy began. Over the following years, an antisense oligonucleotide later named nusinersen was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals under a licensing agreement with Biogen. In December 2016, nusinersen received regulatory approval from FDA and soon after, from other regulatory agencies worldwide. Investigational therapies = Current clinical trials = As of 2020 more than 50 antisense oligonucleotides were in clinical trials, including over 25 in advanced clinical trials (phase II or III).  Phase III trials  = Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis = Tofersen (also known as IONIS-SOD1Rx and BIIB067) is currently being tested in a phase 3 trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to mutations in the SOD1 gene. Results from a phase 1/2 trial have been promising. It is being developed by Biogen under a licensing agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. = Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis = A follow-on drug to Inotersen is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and under license to Akcea Therapeutics for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. In this formulation the ASO is conjugated to N-Acetylgalactosamine enabling hepatocyte-specific delivery, greatly reducing dose requirements and side effect profile while increasing the level of transthyretin reduction in patients. = Huntington's disease = Tominersen (also known as IONIS-HTTRx and RG6042) is currently being tested in a phase 3 trial for Huntington's disease. It is being developed by Roche under a licensing agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.  Phase I & II trials  Clinical trials are ongoing for several diseases and conditions including: Acromegaly, age related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, beta thalassemia, cardiovascular disease, centronuclear myopathy, coagulopathies, cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, diabetes, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica, familial chylomicronemia syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, Fuchs' dystrophy, hepatitis B, hereditary angioedema, hypertension, IgA nephropathy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, multiple system atrophy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Parkinson's disease, prostate cancer, Stargardt disease, STAT3-expressing cancers, Usher syndrome. = Preclinical development = Several ASOs are currently being investigated in disease models for Alexander disease, ATXN2 (gene) and FUS (gene) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, Lafora disease, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myotonic dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease, and prion disease, Rett syndrome, spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.

Life She was the daughter of Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski and Konstancja Czartoryska. She was reportedly close to her brother Stanis≈Çaw during their childhood. On 19 November 1748 she married Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. The marriage was arranged to give the Czartoryska-Poniatowski family political party an ally in her spouse, and she was expected by her family to influence him. However, her spouse was indifferent to her, and she left him to live with the Masovian voivode Andrzej Mokronowski, whom she eventually married. This was a time of difficulty for her, as she was exposed to conflict with her family and her elopement was treated a scandal. =Sister of the King= In 1763, her brother was elected king of Poland. She was described as her brother's close confidante and friend, and her relationship with him is described as sentimental and tender, but she was said to lack any understanding of - or interest - in political issues. In 1769, she advised the king to ally with France in order to be given a secure future with an allowance if he should be deposed by the Bar Confederation. Her brother the king granted her Moskow, Bielsko and Krosno as starosti for her personal income. She lived a life in comfort and had a private Italian orchestra, theater and ballet, and spent the winters in Warsaw and the summers in Bialystok. She was called pretty but not intelligent, and her receptions was visited by foreign travelers and diplomats. In Bialystok, she introduced several social inventions such as schools and hospitals. She was included in the circle of advisers of her brother, and supported the career of Joachim Chreptowicz. She and her sister Ludwika Maria Poniatowska both opposed her brother's suggested marriage to princess Sophia Albertina of Sweden. In 1783, she visited France with her husband. In 1784, she was widowed a second time. She stayed with her brother the King in Warsaw all through the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising to support him, despite being afraid, and the first shots during the revolution is said to have been fired near her palace. She supported Stanis≈Çaw Mokronowski during the uprising, but advised her brother not to endanger his safety. She followed her brother on his exile to Grodno.

In this episode, after leaving Enterprise stranded, Doctor Arik Soong and his Augments travel to \\"Cold Station 12\\", a secretive pathogen and bio-medical facility run by Starfleet Medical and the Denobulans, where much of this episode's plot unfolds. Once inside, they begin torturing the scientists with the goal of retrieving some 1,800 augmented embryos, allowing them to expand their race. The production team created several new sets to represent the space station itself, as well as re-using some from \\"Borderland\\" to represent the Klingon starship. The make-up team were required to make Brent Spiner look younger for flashbacks and to show the progression of a character's exposure to a number of pathogens. The story-arc has been considered one of the best seen in Enterprise, and critics praised \\"Cold Station 12\\", specifically for the special effects and character development, but felt that the death scene crossed the line. On first broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.1 percent of the population according to Nielsen ratings, placing it in fifth position for the timeslot. Plot After the escape of Doctor Soong and the Augments, Captain Archer and his crew proceed to the coordinates Soong had provided earlier in the mission. On Trialis IV, the away team find an abandoned building where the young Augments were raised and schooled by \\"father\\" Soong. They also capture a banished member of the Augments named Udar. Nicknamed \\"Smike\\" by his Augment siblings after a handicapped character from the comic novel Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens, he is taken to Enterprise. Analysis reveals that although Udar's DNA is similar to the other Augments, he has none of their enhanced abilities (except for superior hearing). Meanwhile, Soong and the Augments capture Barzai, a Denobulan medical ship, and use it to enter the medical facility called Cold Station 12 (C-12). They soon overpower security and capture the scientists there, including its chief medical officer, Doctor Jeremy Lucas (Doctor Phlox's Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart). Due to security protocols, tensions begin to surface between Soong and Malik, as to how to coerce Lucas into divulging the entry codes. Malik convinces Soong to torture Lucas, and failing that, to expose a scientist to a deadly pathogen using a containment chamber. Enterprise approaches within transporter range, and beams an away team (including Phlox) to the facility. They are soon detected, however, and imprisoned with the facility's staff. Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having lost contact with the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself to a number of pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail. Production The episode was the second of a three-part storyline, which was intended to link Enterprise more closely to Star Trek: The Original Series with the return of genetically engineered \\"Augments\\" which had appeared alongside Khan Noonian Singh in \\"Space Seed\\" and the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. It was preceded by the episode \\"Borderland\\", and followed by \\"The Augments\\". Production on the episode began on August 24, 2004, and concluded on September 1. There were several swing sets created for the episode, specifically to cover the scenes filmed on board the station. It re-used the sets created for \\"Borderland\\" to represent the Klingon vessel captured by the Augments. There were also sets created to represent the compound where Soong raised the genetically altered humans, which was set up different as flashbacks to the character's childhoods were also shot for this episode. It was directed by Mike Vejar, who had directed several earlier episodes of Star Trek, most recently \\"Stratagem\\". It was written by Consulting Producer Alan Brennert, his first writing credit in the franchise. There was some specific work required by the make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go through a series of levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot. There were several guest actors in \\"Cold Station 12\\". The character, Dr. Jeremy Lucas, had been previously mentioned in the episodes \\"Dear Doctor\\" and \\"Doctor's Orders\\" as a friend of Phlox. But \\"Cold Station 12\\" marked the first occasion that the character appeared on screen, played by Richard Riehle. The actor had previously appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Inner Light\\" as well as the Star Trek: Voyager episodes \\"Fair Haven\\" and the follow-up episode \\"Spirit Folk\\". Guest stars Spiner, Alec Newman and Abby Brammell resumed their roles from the previous episode in the trilogy, \\"Borderland\\". Reception and home media release \\"Cold Station 12\\" was first broadcast on November 5, 2004, on UPN. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 2.1 percent of the population of the United States and by four percent of those watching television at the time. This put it in fifth place for the 8pm timeslot, behind Totally Outrageous Behavior and World's Craziest Videos on Fox. Bill Gordon, writing for the website Sci-Fi Pulse, said that it was a \\"nearly flawless episode\\", with his one critique in his analysis of the plot being targeted at Captain Archer telling Soong that they were sending over the self-destruct code for the station. He said that there was an \\"epic\\" quality to \\"Cold Station 12\\" that made him compare it to the Star Trek film franchise, saying that it had \\"stellar FX shots, to first class character and story development, to a quality of writing that has been sadly lacking in the Star Trek universe of late.\\" In her review for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green praised the episode, saying it was an improvement on \\"Borderland\\" and that Spiner was even better. But she found the murder of the doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far. She said that themes raised in \\"Cold Station 12\\" mirrored those which could have appeared on The Original Series but that this episode didn't take the time to discuss them. She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. The mini-arc featuring the episodes \\"Borderland\\", \\"Cold Station 12\\" and \\"The Augments\\" were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt. Viewing of \\"Cold Station 12\\" was included alongside the Doctor Who episode \\"The Beast Below\\" in the course \\"Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who\\" at the University of Dubuque to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many. In 2018, Screen Rant praised casting Brent Spinner as the character Arik Soong. Ahome media release of \\"Cold Station 12\\" was as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray release of the fourth season of Enterprise was on April 1, 2014.

It was the first land discovered south of 60¬∞ south latitude in 1819, a historic event that marked the end of a centuries-long pursuit of the mythical Terra Australis Incognita and the beginning of the exploration and utilization of real Antarctica. The name Livingston, although of unknown derivation, has been well established in international usage since the early 1820s. Geography Renier Point Tangra Mountains Livingston Island is situated in West Antarctica northwest of Cape Roquemaurel on the Antarctic mainland, south-southeast of Cape Horn in South America, southeast of the Diego Ram√≠rez Islands (the southernmost land of South America), due south of the Falkland Islands, southwest of South Georgia Islands, and from the South Pole.L.

Sofia: St. Kliment Ohridski University Press, 2015. pp. 17‚Äì28. The island is part of the South Shetlands archipelago, an islands chain extending in east- northeast to west-southwest direction, and separated from the nearby Antarctic Peninsula by Bransfield Strait, and from South America by the Drake Passage. The South Shetlands cover a total land area of (late 20th-century estimate; the current figure might be somewhat less than that due to coastal change), comprising (from east to west) the eleven principal islands of Clarence, Elephant, King George, Nelson, Robert, Greenwich, Livingston, Deception, Snow, Low and Smith, and a number of minor islands, islets and rocks. Livingston is separated from neighbouring Greenwich Island to the east by the wide McFarlane Strait, and from Snow Island to the west-southwest by the wide Morton Strait. Deception Island, situated in Bransfield Strait barely southwest of Livingston's Barnard Point, is an active volcano last erupting in 1967, 1969 and 1970Deception Island: Management Package.

There are many islets and rocks lying in the surrounding waters, particularly off the north coast. More sizable among the adjacent minor islands are Rugged Island off Byers Peninsula, Half Moon Island in Moon Bay, Desolation Island in Hero Bay, and Zed Islands off Williams Point. Ice cliffs, often withdrawing during recent decades to uncover new coves, beaches, spits, points and minor islands, form most of the coastline. Except for the ice-free Byers Peninsula and some isolated patches, the land surface is covered by an ice cap with ice domes and plateaus in the central and western areas, and a number of valley glaciers formed by the more mountainous relief of eastern Livingston. Certain areas of the ice cap, especially near glacier termini or over steeper slopes, are densely crevassed and almost inaccessible without specialized equipment. Elsewhere, the surface is smooth, hard and comfortable for walking, skiing or snowmobiling. However, the danger of falling into some hidden crevasse masked by a snow bridge is ever-present, including in frequently visited and supposedly well-known localities. Protracted periods of warmer weather tend to make the snow bridges more unstable and hazardous. Typical of the island's glaciology are the conspicuous ash layers originating from volcanic activity on neighbouring Deception Island.J. L√≥pez Mart√≠nez. Geolog√≠a de la Ant√°rtida Occidental.

Climatic conditions are influenced by the following specific factors: the island's location in the narrowest part of the Southern Ocean (less than 600 km between the Antarctic Convergence and the Antarctic Peninsula); the relatively small amplitude of water temperatures in the surrounding sea; the local relief including Tangra Mountains, one of the highest mountain ranges in the archipelago that contributes to shaping the local atmospheric circulation; and the ice cap of the island.N.

The highest daily temperature recorded on the island is (measured at the Chilean Base), and the lowest is (at the Spanish base). Following a period of warming during the second half of the 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula region has experienced a period of cooling in the early 21st century. For Livingston Island this cooling has reached over the 12-year period 2004‚Äì2016, and for the summer average temperatures over the same period. That has resulted in a longer snow cover duration in the coastal ice- free areas,C. Recio, F. Navarro, J. Otero, J. Lapazaran and S. Gonz√†lez.

During December 1819 William Smith was back with his ship to the South Shetlands. This time he was chartered by Captain William Shirreff, British commanding officer in the Pacific stationed in Chile, and accompanied by Lieutenant Edward Bransfield who was tasked to survey and map the new lands. On 30 January 1820 they sighted the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula, unaware that three days earlier the continent had already been discovered by the Russian Antarctic expedition of Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von Bellingshausen and Mihail Lazarev. Derelict Norwegian whaling boat on Half Moon Island One year later, the Russians had circumnavigated Antarctica and arrived in the South Shetlands region. On 6 February 1821 they approached Livingston Island and observed eight British and American ships off Byers Peninsula. While sailing between Deception and Livingston, Bellingshausen met with American sealer Nathaniel Palmer, yet another pioneer of Antarctic exploration who is alleged to have sighted the mainland himself during the previous November. Palmer informed the Russians that seal hunting in the area was going at full steam, with Smith alone having taken 60,000 seal skins. The Antarctic sealing industry south of 60¬∞S was initiated in the 1819/20 summer season by the early voyage of Joseph Herring (ship's mate during Smith's first visit) who stepped ashore in Hersilia Cove, Rugged Island on Christmas Day of 1819, followed by James Sheffield (with second mate, a 20-year-old Nathaniel Palmer), James Weddell, and possibly Carlos Timbl√≥n from Buenos Aires. American historian Edouard Stackpole wrote of the early 19th century sealers: George Powell's 1822 chart; the track is that of his sloop Dove in November 1821 As the seals were killed onshore the hunters spent protracted periods of time there, seeking refuge from the elements in purpose-built stone huts, tent bivouacs or natural caves. Livingston Island became the most populous place in Antarctica for a time, its dwellers exceeding 200 in number during the 1820‚Äì23 South Shetlands sealing rush.B. Basberg and R. Headland.

This time Livingston Island was not directly involved, although the southernmost Hektor Whaling Station was operated by Norway on nearby Deception Island from 1912 to 1931. Whaling likewise depleted its resource and gave way at the turn of the 1970s to modern Antarctic fishing industry pioneered by the fishing fleets of the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany and Bulgaria.K.-H.

Cambridge University Press, 1992. 359 pp. A significant milestone in Livingston Island's history was the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 and entered into force in 1961, which effectively placed the region south of 60¬∞ south latitude under the joint governance of the consultative (voting) parties to the treaty, providing in particular for the freedom of scientific exploration. The treaty left the personnel of the Antarctic bases under their respective home countries‚Äô jurisdiction, and essentially froze the existing sovereignty claims. (Livingston, in particular, was claimed by Britain in 1820 with letters patent of annexation promulgated in 1908, by Chile in 1940 and by Argentina in 1942 ‚Äî claims not recognized, among others, by the US and Russia, which have formally reserved their rights to claim Antarctic territories.R. Wilson. National Interests and Claims in the Antarctic. Arctic 17 (1964) No. 1\\\\. pp. 1‚Äì64) Since then, the evolving Antarctic Treaty System has been providing an increasingly comprehensive legal framework for all Antarctic- related activities, including environmental protection and exploitation of marine living resources, and has proved an example of uniquely successful international cooperation. Toponymy Devils Point and Hell Gates, with Morton Strait and Snow Island in the background, and Smith Island on the right horizon Mount Friesland, with Presian Ridge in the foreground and The Synagogue in the left background The names of many geographical features on the island refer to its early history. Among the commemorated are ship captains such as the Americans James Sheffield, Christopher Burdick, Charles Barnard, Chester, Robert Johnson, Donald MacKay, Robert Inott, David Leslie, Benjamin Brunow, Robert Macy, Prince Moores, William Napier and Daniel Clark (first mate), the Britons William Shirreff, M‚ÄôKean, John Walker, Ralph Bond, Christopher MacGregor, T. Binn and William Bowles, the Australian Richard Siddins, people like the New York shipowner James Byers, the American whaling merchants William and Francis Rotch, British Admiralty hydrographer Thomas Hurd, and John Miers, publisher of the first chart of the South Shetland Islands based on the work of William Smith, or sealing vessels like Huron, Williams (William Smith's brig), Hersilia, Samuel, Gleaner, Huntress, Charity, Hannah, Henry, John, Hero (Nathaniel Palmer's sloop), Cora, Hetty, Essex and Mercury. Some of the place names given by the nineteenth century sealers are descriptive, such as Devils Point, Hell Gates and Neck or Nothing Passage, hazardous places where ships and people were lost; False Bay, sometimes confused in thick weather with neighbouring South Bay; Needle Peak; Black Point; or the Robbery Beaches where American sealers were robbed of their sealskins by the British. However, names like Livingston, Mount Friesland, Ereby Point and Renier Point that also became established during the first few seasons after the discovery of the island remain of unknown origin. Huron Glacier with Atanasoff Nunatak on the left and Delchev Peak on the right, McFarlane Strait with Moon Bay and Half Moon Island, and Greenwich Island in the background Bransfield Strait with Antarctic Peninsula in the background, Peshev Ridge, Brunow Bay and Needle Peak in the middle ground, and Catalunyan Saddle in the foreground Livingston was the third name of the island, introduced in 1821 by the British sealer Robert Fildes (as quoted above), replacing the popular early name Friesland Island (variously spelled also as Frieseland, Freesland, Freeseland, Frezeland, Freezland, Frezland and FreezelandLivingston Island. UK Antarctic Place-names Committee. BAT Gazetteer, row 4451) and the name Smolensk given by Bellingshausen in commemoration of one of the great battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The toponyms Friesland and Smolensk are now preserved as Mount Friesland and Smolensk Strait respectively. While the name Livingston is sometimes misspelt as Livingstone, it has nothing to do with the Scotsman David Livingstone, an 8-year-old boy in 1821 who was yet to become a cotton mill worker and still later a missionary and famous explorer of Africa. Some place names on the island are given by Argentina and Chile, such as Charr√∫a Ridge, Scesa Point, Arroyo Point, Bruix Cove, Ocoa Point, Dreyfus Point, Mansa Cove, Ag√ºero Point etc. Several Argentine names commemorate crewmen of the Argentine Navy Lockheed Neptune aircraft that crashed in poor weather on the then uninhabited island on 15 September 1976, killing 10 aircrew and a civilian television cameraman. Features like Point Smellie and Willan Nunatak are named after British scientists who have carried out field work on the island. Other names reflect the Spanish and Bulgarian exploration and mapping in the area, such as Espa√±ola Cove, Mount Reina Sof√≠a, San Telmo Island, Ballester Point and Castellvi Peak (after Antonio Ballester and Josefina Castellv√≠, doyens of the Spanish Antarctic programme), Quiroga Ridge, Da√±obeitia Crag, Ojeda Beach, Enrique Hill, S√†bat Hill, Casanovas Peak, Bulgarian Beach, Krum Rock (or Krumov Kamak), Pimpirev Beach (after Christo Pimpirev, doyen and leader of the Bulgarian Antarctic programme), Vergilov Ridge, Kuzman Knoll, Dimov Gate, Gurev Gap, Yankov Gap etc. Hesp√©rides Point is named after BIO Hesp√©rides, a Spanish Navy oceanographic vessel serving in particular as a resupply ship for the Spanish and Bulgarian bases for many years. Rongel Point and Las Palmas Cove are also named after modern Antarctic ships. A concentration of place names (probably the highest in Antarctica) arising from local topographic diversity ‚Äì over fifty names, mostly Chilean, occurs on the small ice-free headland forming the northern extremity of Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula and ending in Cape Shirreff. Scientific bases and camps Juan Carlos I Base (Spain) Ohridski Base (Bulgaria) The first modern, 'post-sealer' habitation facility on Livingston Island was the British base camp Station P that operated during the 1957/58 summer season at South Bay, on the east side of the small ice-free promontory ending in Hannah Point. The scientific bases of Juan Carlos I (Spain) and St. Kliment Ohridski (Bulgaria; often shortened by non-Bulgarians to Ohridski Base, sometimes misspelt as Ohridiski) were established in early 1988 at South Bay, on the northwest coast of Hurd Peninsula. Doctor Guillermo Mann Base (Chile) and adjoining Cape Shirreff Field Station (USA) operate on Cape Shirreff since 1991 and 1996 respectively, while C√°mara Base (Argentina) on the tiny nearby Half Moon Island is one of the early bases in the Antarctic Peninsula region established in 1953. These facilities are used also by visiting scientists from various nations; in particular, the Bulgarian base has hosted the first steps in Antarctic research by scientists from countries such as Portugal, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Mongolia and Turkey. All four bases are permanent settlements, although inhabited only during the summer season. Their accommodation capacity is ca. 51, 18, 11 and 12 persons respectively, making it a total of 92 persons (80 for Livingston Island proper). The number of people inhabiting the bases in any particular season is actually greater as some of them stay for part of the time and are replaced by others.Pedro Duque inaugura la remodelaci√≥n de una base en la Ant√°rtida. EFE Future website, 4 February 2019 C√°mara Base (Argentina) with Livingston Island in the background Guillermo Mann Base (Chile, left) and Cape Shirreff Field Station (USA, right) Occasional or more permanent field camps support research in remote areas of the island. Camp Byers (Spain) operates regularly on the banks of Petreles Stream, South Beaches near Nikopol Point on Byers Peninsula; that site is also designated for use as an International Field Camp. The seasonal Camp Livingston (Argentina) is also situated on Byers Peninsula, while Sally Rocks Camp (Bulgaria) supported geological research on southern Hurd Peninsula. Camp Academia site situated at elevation in upper Huron Glacier, W√∂rner Gap area served as a base camp of the Tangra 2004/05 topographic survey. It is accessible by routes from St. Kliment Ohridski and Juan Carlos I base respectively, and offers convenient overland access to Tangra Mountains to the south; Bowles Ridge, Vidin Heights, Kaliakra Glacier and Saedinenie Snowfield areas to the north; Huron Glacier to the east; and Perunika Glacier and Huntress Glacier to the west. The site is named for the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in appreciation of its contribution to Antarctic exploration, and has been designated as the summer post office Tangra 1091 of the Bulgarian Posts since 2004. Field work done out of Camp Academia during the 2004/05 season was noted in 2012 by Discovery Channel, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Collection and the British Antarctic Survey as a timeline event in Antarctic exploration.Discovering Antarctica Overview. Discovery Channel UK website, 201214 November 2004: Tangra. Discovering Antarctica Timeline. Discovery Channel UK website, 2012 Protected areas and sites Camp Byers / International Field Camp Camp Academia In order to protect Antarctica, the Antarctic Treaty system enforces a strict general regime regulating human presence and activities on the continent, and designates certain protected territories where access is allowed only for scientific purposes, and with special permission. There are two such nature reserves on Livingston Island established in 1966: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ASPA 149 Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Island, and ASPA 126 Byers Peninsula. These comprise respectively Byers Peninsula, which is the largest ice-free land area in the South Shetlands, and the small peninsula of Cape Shirreff together with Gerlovo Beach, nearby San Telmo Island and adjacent waters. Subject of protection in ASPA 126 are the fossils demonstrating the link between Antarctica and other austral continents, a variety of abundant flora and fauna including colonies of seals and penguins that are the subject of scientific study and monitoring, as well as numerous historical monuments dating from the nineteenth century. This territory has been identified also as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its breeding colonies of Antarctic terns and kelp gulls.Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island. BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas. BirdLife International, 2019 ASPA 149 features diverse plant and animal life, notably penguin and seal colonies including the largest fur seal breeding colony in the Antarctic Peninsula region.Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 149 Cape Shirreff and San Telmo Island.

Appendix A: Tourism. Science and Stewardship in the Antarctic. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 1993. 124 pp. Since then the number of tourists visiting Antarctica has grown to several tens of thousands annually. Over 95% of them tour the South Shetlands and the nearby Antarctic Peninsula. Hannah Point on the south coast of Livingston, Half Moon Island off its east coast, Aitcho Islands just north of Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are among the most popular destinations. Tourists arrive mainly in cruise ships, and are landed by Zodiac rigid inflatable boats to walk along designated trails led by tourist guides and enjoy picturesque scenery and wildlife. Zodiac boats are the preferred means of local sea transport, being particularly suitable for navigation among floating ice and landing at places lacking port facilities. Naturally, this is only possible in summer as the sea surface is partially or completely frozen in ice over one meter thick in winter. Visits by yachts and extreme tourism such as kayaking have become increasingly popular, too. Zodiac boat Cruise ships visiting Hannah Point occasionally make a sightseeing detour to the Bulgarian base, where the tourists could visit the Livingston Island Museum established in October 2012, the old and new chapels of St. Ivan Rilski ‚Äì the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica consecrated in February 2003, and the Monument to the Cyrillic Script erected on Pesyakov Hill in March 2018.B.

Information on the South Shetlands including Livingston Island Category:Bulgaria and the Antarctic Category:Islands of the South Shetland Islands Category:Seal hunting ","title":"Livingston Island"},{"id":"1137218","text":"Tinea, or ringworm, is any of a variety of skin mycoses. Tinea is a very common fungal infection of the skin. Tinea is often called \\"ringworm\\" because the rash is circular, with a ring-like appearance. It is sometimes equated with dermatophytosis, and, while most conditions identified as \\"tinea\\" are members of the imperfect fungi that make up the dermatophytes, conditions such as tinea nigra and tinea versicolor are not caused by dermatophytes.  Tinea pedis (foot)  Athlete's foot (also known as \\"ringworm of the foot\\", tinea pedum,Braun-Falco, Otto et al. 2000. Dermatology. Berlin: Springer, p. 323. and \\"moccasin foot\\") is a common and contagious skin disease that causes itching, scaling, flaking, and sometimes blistering of the affected areas. Its medical name is tinea pedis, a member of the group of diseases or conditions known as tinea, most of which are dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin), which in turn are mycoses (broad category of fungal infections). Globally, athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population. Tinea pedis is caused by fungi such as Epidermophyton floccosum or fungi of the genus Trichophyton including T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. These fungi are typically transmitted in moist communal areas where people go barefoot, such as around swimming pools or in showers, and require a warm moist environment like the inside of a shoe to incubate. Fungal infection of the foot may be acquired (or reacquired) in many ways, such as by walking in an infected locker room, by using an infested bathtub, by sharing a towel used by someone with the disease, by touching the feet with infected fingers (such as after scratching another infected area of the body), or by wearing fungi- contaminated socks or shoes. Infection can often be prevented by keeping the feet dry by limiting the use of footwear that enclose the feet, or by remaining barefoot. The fungi may infect or spread to other areas of the body (such as by scratching one's feet and then touching one's groin). For each location on the body, the name of the condition changes. A fungal infection of the groin is called Tinea cruris, or commonly \\"jock itch\\". The fungi tend to spread to areas of skin that are kept warm and moist, such as with insulation (clothes), body heat, and sweat. However, the spread of the infection is not limited to skin. Toe nails become infected with fungi in the same way as the rest of the foot, typically by being trapped with fungi in the warm, dark, moist inside of a shoe. Fungal infection of the nails is called tinea unguium, and is not included in the medical definition of \\"athlete's foot\\", even though toe nails are part of the foot. Fungi are more difficult to kill inside and underneath a nail than on and in the skin. But if the nail infection is not cured, then the fungi can readily spread back to the rest of the foot. The fungi can also spread to hair, grow inside hair strands, and feed on the keratin within hair, including the hair on the feet, the hair of one's beard, and the hair on one's head. From hair, the fungi can spread back to skin. To effectively treat athlete's foot, it is necessary to treat the entire infection, wherever it is on the body, until the fungi are dead and the skin has fully healed. There is a wide array of over the counter and prescription topical medications in the form of liquids, sprays, powders, ointments, and creams for killing fungi that have infected the feet or the body in general. For persistent conditions, oral medications are available by prescription.  Tinea unguium (nails)  Onychomycosis (also known as \\"dermatophytic onychomycosis,\\" or \\"tinea unguium\\" is a fungal infection of the nail. It is the most common disease of the nails and constitutes about half of all nail abnormalities. This condition may affect toenails or fingernails, but toenail infections are particularly common. It occurs in about 10% of the adult population.  Tinea manuum (hand)  Tinea manuum (or tinea manus) is a fungal infection of the hand. It is typically more aggressive than tinea pedis but similar in look. Itching, burning, cracking, and scaling are observable and may be transmitted sexually or otherwise, whether or not symptoms are present.  Tinea cruris (groin)  Tinea cruris, also known as \\"crotch itch\\", \\"crotch rot\\", \\"Dhobie itch\\", \\"eczema marginatum\\", \\"gym itch\\", \\"jock itch\\", \\"jock rot\\", \\"scrot rot\\" and \\"ringworm of the groin\\" is a dermatophyte fungal infection of the groin region in any sex, though more often seen in males. In the German sprachraum this condition is called tinea inguinalis (from Latin inguen = groin) whereas tinea cruris is used for a dermatophytosis of the lower leg (Latin crus). Tinea cruris is similar to Candidal intertrigo, which is an infection of the skin by Candida albicans. It is more specifically located between intertriginous folds of adjacent skin, which can be present in the groin or scrotum, and be indistinguishable from fungal infections caused by tinia. However, candidal infections tend to both appear and disappear with treatment more quickly. It may also affect the scrotum.  Tinea corporis (body)  Tinea corporis (also known as \\"ringworm\\", tinea circinata, and tinea glabrosa) is a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the arms and legs, especially on glabrous skin; however, it may occur on any part of the body, it present as annular, marginated plaque with thin scale and clear center. Common organism are Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Micosporum canis. Treatment include : Grisofluvine, itraconazole and clotrimazole cream .  Tinea capitis (scalp)  Tinea capitis (also known as \\"Herpes tonsurans\\", \\"Ringworm of the hair,\\" \\"Ringworm of the scalp,\\" \\"Scalp ringworm\\", and \\"Tinea tonsurans\\") is a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the scalp. The disease is primarily caused by dermatophytes of the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically single or multiple patches of hair loss, sometimes with a 'black dot' pattern (often with broken-off hairs), that may be accompanied by inflammation, scaling, pustules, and itching. Uncommon in adults, tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-pubertal children, more often boys than girls. At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of Trichophyton infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from Microsporum species are mainly in South America, Southern and Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans, animals, or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp, without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral antifungal agent; griseofulvin is the most commonly used drug, but other newer antimycotic drugs, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have started to gain acceptance, topical treatment include selenium sulfide shampoo.  Tinea faciei (face)  Tinea faciei is a fungal infection of the face. It generally appears as a red rash on the face, followed by patches of small, raised bumps. The skin may peel while it is being treated. Tinea faciei is contagious just by touch and can spread easily to all regions of skin.  Tinea barbae (beard)  Tinea barb√¶ (also known as \\"Barber's itch,\\" \\"Ringworm of the beard,\\" and \\"Tinea sycosis\\") is a fungal infection of the hair. Tinea barbae is due to a dermatophytic infection around the bearded area of men. Generally, the infection occurs as a follicular inflammation, or as a cutaneous granulomatous lesion, i.e. a chronic inflammatory reaction. It is one of the causes of folliculitis. It is most common among agricultural workers, as the transmission is more common from animal-to-human than human-to-human. The most common causes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. verrucosum.  Tinea imbricata (overlapping pattern)  Tinea imbricata (also known as \\"Tokelau\\") is a superficial fungal infection of the skin limited to southwest Polynesia, Melanesia, Southeast Asia, India, and Central America. It is associated with Trichophyton concentricum.  Tinea nigra (black)  Tinea nigra (also known as \\"superficial phaeohyphomycosis,\\" and \\"Tinea nigra palmaris et plantaris\\") is a superficial fungal infection that causes dark brown to black painless patches on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.  Tinea versicolor (various colors)  Tinea versicolor (also known as dermatomycosis furfuracea, pityriasis versicolor, and tinea flava) is a condition characterized by a skin eruption on the trunk and proximal extremities, hypopigmentation macule in area of sun induced pigmentation. During the winter the pigment becomes reddish brown. Recent research has shown that the majority of tinea versicolor is caused by the Malassezia globosa fungus, although Malassezia furfur is responsible for a small number of cases. These yeasts are normally found on the human skin and only become troublesome under certain circumstances, such as a warm and humid environment, although the exact conditions that cause initiation of the disease process are poorly understood. Treatment include [griseofulivin], topical selenium shampoo and topical ketoconazole. The condition pityriasis versicolor was first identified in 1846. Versicolor comes from the Latin, from ' to turn + color.  Tinea incognito (disguised)  Tinea incognito is a fungal infection (mycosis) of the skin caused by the presence of a topical immunosuppressive agent. The usual agent is a topical corticosteroid (topical steroid). As the skin fungal infection has lost some of the characteristic features due to suppression of inflammation, it may have a poorly defined border, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and florid growth. Occasionally, secondary infection with bacteria occurs with concurrent pustules and impetigo.Habif, T. P. (1995) Clinical Dermatology. Mosby, 3rd ed.; pp. 41-42.

He formerly served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal MP from 1988 to 2014, and as member of the Toronto City Council from 2014 until 2019, when his seat was vacated due to campaign spending violations. Karygiannis served concurrently as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal (2005) and was previously parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport (2003‚Äì2005). On April 1, 2014, he resigned his seat as a Member of Parliament in order to stand in the Toronto municipal election for Toronto City Councillor in Ward 39, and subsequently was elected to that seat. On November 6, 2019, Karygiannis was removed from office for exceeding election expenses in the 2018 municipal election; however, on November 25, an Ontario Superior Court judge returned Karygiannis to office, accepting his explanation that the expense violation was an inadvertent clerical error.Jennifer Pagliaro, \\"Judge rules Jim Karygiannis can have seat back on Toronto city council\\". Toronto Star, November 25, 2019. On June 24, 2020, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the Superior Court's decision resulting in the automatic forfeiture of his seat. On August 5, 2020, a stay on the decision was granted by the Ontario Court of Appeal while Karygiannis appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, thereby reinstating him as councillor. On September 24, 2020, the Supreme Court declined to give Karygiannis leave to appeal and he lost his seat. Personal life Karygiannis was born in Athens, Greece. Before entering politics, Karygiannis was a businessman and industrial engineer. He immigrated to Canada in 1966, and has a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto. He also holds a degree of Fellowship of Business Administration from the Canadian School of Management. He is married with four daughters. Politics Karygiannis has been involved with politics as a Liberal since the late 1980s, first in provincial politics and later as a federal MP. He ran as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1987 provincial election. He lost to David Reville of the Ontario New Democratic Party by about 1,500 votes. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons the following year in the federal election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent W. Paul McCrossan by 858 votes in the newly created riding of Scarborough‚ÄîAgincourt. Karygiannis was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. In June 2005, however, he strongly criticized other socially- conservative Liberals who had threatened to bring down the government on the marriage issue. =In government= He won a landslide re-election in the 1993 federal election as the Liberals won a majority government, and was easily re- elected in subsequent federal elections. Karygiannis was a prominent Toronto organizer for Jean Chr√©tien in the Liberal Party's 1990 leadership contest, and was credited with delivering considerable support to Chr√©tien from the city's Greek community. In 2002, Karygiannis was voted \\"laziest MP\\" in a poll of Parliamentary staffers by The Hill Times.Tony L. Hill. Canadian Politics, Riding by Riding: An In-Depth Analysis of Canada's 301 Federal Electoral Districts. Prospect Park Press, 2002. , 9780972343602 In April 2004, Karygiannis brought forward a private member's motion which recognized the death of 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923 as a genocide. The motion was approved by parliament 153 to 68, with support among Liberal backbench and opposition MPs, though Prime Minister Martin and his cabinet did not show up for the free vote and insisted that the motion is non-binding. Foreign Minister Bill Graham has defended the government's position that the event constituted a \\"tragedy\\" rather than the purposeful extermination of minority Armenians. In response to Martin's assertion that foreign policy rests with the cabinet, Karygiannis said that a clear majority of Parliament saw it differently and urged Martin to live up to his promise to give MPs real clout. The Turkish government was strongly critical of the motion and argued that Canadian MPs were rewriting history, while the Turkish Embassy suggested that relations between the two countries would be harmed as a result.\\"Turkey denounces Armenian genocide vote in Commons\\", CBC News, April 22, 2004. Retrieved August 1, 2014. Local press has also described his genocide recognition cause as one that \\"splits cultural communities\\". Karygiannis played a prominent role in organizing Toronto-area support for victims of the December 2004 earthquake in Southeast Asia. He called for cooperation between the city's Tamil and Sinhalese communities for the relief effort in Sri Lanka, and personally travelled to Sri Lanka to witness the tsunami devastation firsthand. He was later criticized by fellow Member of Parliament David Kilgour for traveling to an area of Sri Lanka dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers), as the faction was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many countries. Karygiannis defended his decision, saying that his intent was to confirm that disaster aid was reaching the region. Despite Kilgour's concerns, Karygiannis's travels did not provoke a diplomatic incident with Sri Lanka. In March 2005, Karygiannis travelled to Guyana to witness the damage that recent floods had done in the country. He helped to secure CIDA aid for Guyana of over million Canadian. When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in September 2005, Karygiannis was one of the first Canadian parliamentarians to organize a Canadian relief effort. =In opposition= In September 2007, the Canadian government announced that it would recognize the country Macedonia as the \\"Republic of Macedonia\\" rather than by its previous designation as the \\"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\\" This decision was criticized by the government of Greece, which claims the name Macedonia as its own. Karygiannis also opposed the government's decision and indicated that the Greek-Canadian community would mobilize against it.Alan Freeman, \\"Canada to recognize Balkan state as Macedonia despite disputed name\\", The Globe and Mail, September 21, 2007, A18. In February 2009, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced that he would review and possibly reduce or eliminate federal funding to the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) after its president criticized Kenney's pro-Israel position in the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza conflict. Karygiannis subsequently asked the parliamentary ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, to investigate whether Kenney was abusing his position.Editorial: Subsidizing hatred, National Post, March 5, 2009. During his term of services in the 40th Parliament between November 2008 and December 2010, Karygiannis voted 171 times out of a possible 311 possible votes. The Globe and Mail ranked him third in the list of politicians that missed votes. =Liberal Party= Known as a Chr√©tien loyalist throughout the 1990s, Karygiannis announced in 2002 that he would support Paul Martin in the next Liberal leadership contest. In making his decision, he told an interviewer that it was time for Chr√©tien to retire \\"with dignity\\", rather than risk a potentially divisive leadership review. When Martin became Liberal party leader on December 12, 2003, he appointed Karygiannis as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport. Karygiannis was the National Chairman for MP Joe Volpe's campaign to lead the Liberal Party of Canada, but he resigned on July 21, 2006, over disagreements with Volpe's pro-Israeli stance on the conflict in Lebanon. On July 26, 2006, Karygiannis said that he was considering a run for the Liberal leadership himself because he felt the other candidates were \\"lacking\\" on the issue of foreign policy. At the leadership convention, he supported Bob Rae, but then threw his support to St√©phane Dion when Rae was eliminated from the ballot. = Removal from office = On November 6, 2019, Karygiannis was removed as a member of City Council for Ward 22 due to misspending on the supplementary financial statement of his 2018 election. The Municipal Elections Act permitted a maximum of 10 per cent of total funds ($6,120.80) to be spent for \\"parties and other expressions of appreciation\\" in Ward 22 after election day; Karygiannis exceeded this limit by $25,962.70. Karygiannis argued that the expense was an inadvertent clerical error, which represented a legitimate and legal expense that was simply miscategorized in the wrong line item.Kirthana Sasitharan, \\"Jim Karygiannis lost his city council seat due to clerical error, lawyer tells court\\". CBC News, November 21, 2019. On November 25, Justice William Chalmers of the Ontario Superior Court ruled that Karygiannis's explanation was acceptable and that he could retake office immediately. Karygiannis returned to City Hall and resumed his work as a councillor the next day.Bryan Passifiume, \\"Reinstated Jim Karygiannis welcomed back to City Hall\\". Toronto Sun, November 26, 2019. On December 2, 2019, Toronto resident Adam Chaleff filed an appeal of the decision.Jennifer Pagliaro, \\"Jim Karygiannis‚Äôs reinstatement on Toronto council challenged in court\\". Toronto Star, December 2, 2019. On June 24, 2020, the Court of Appeal overturned the Superior Court's ruling stating that Karygiannis had \\"not clearly demonstrated to this court that this was a mere 'clerical error'\\" and he was removed from office for a second time. Controversies On February 22, 2011, Jim Karygiannis joined a protest rally of the Armenian Youth Federation by the Embassy of Azerbaijan in Ottawa timed to the anniversary of the Nagorno-Karabakh separatist movement in Azerbaijan. During his four-minute speech, he called for the Azerbaijani ambassador Farid Shafiyev to be stripped of his diplomatic privileges and leave Canada. Shafiyev reacted by saying Karygiannis had \\"crossed the line of civility and decency and used the language of the level of street hooliganism.\\" Later another Liberal multiculturalism critic Rob Oliphant in a telephone call to Shafiyev expressed his regret about his colleague's statement and added that Karygiannis's words did not represent the attitudes of the Liberal Party.Avinash Gavai.

The event was boycotted by the Jewish, Chinese, Turkish, and Macedonian communities. A spokesperson for B'nai Brith Canada said the Liberal Party should consider putting forth a better representative of the party to deal with multiculturalism matters, due to Karygiannis's being \\"divisive on some issues\\", instead of bringing communities together. The Council of Turkish Canadians released a statement where it explained its unwillingness to participate in the event by Karygiannis's \\"past attempts to promote ethnic division and intolerance against Canadians of different national origin\\", particularly Turks, Azeris and Macedonians.Council of Turkish Canadians Boycotts Community Meeting: Karygiannis Unfit to Facilitate. Council of Turkish Canadians. August 17, 2011 In mid-August 2011, Karygiannis's former Conservative opponent Harry Tsai, among others, signed a collective letter on behalf of the Taiwanese Canadian Association of Toronto, requesting that Bob Rae remove Karygiannis from his multicultural critic's post. The letter cited his poor attendance of the House of Commons and bad treatment of Canada's Turkish and Macedonian community as reasons to be considered unfit. According to Tsai, Karygiannis contacted him by telephone saying he did not care about what they had written and expressing content that the authors of the letter \\"had been able to write in English\\". In his public response, Karygiannis denied making such a comment and complained that the letter was signed in part by \\"Turks and Macedonians, who don't like it, because I am Greek, and they have problems with Greeks.\\" As for Tsai's discontent, Karygiannis explained it by the Conservative candidate's feelings after having got \\"his butt kicked\\" during the election.Althia Raj.

It stretches for some from near the South Island in the west, to the Chatham Islands in the east. It is New Zealand's most productive and important fishing ground, as well as important habitat for whales. Relative to the rest of the Pacific Ocean waters around New Zealand, the Chatham Rise is relatively shallow, no more than deep at any point. This shallowness is made more remarkable by the depth of the ocean immediately to the north and south. To the northeast, the Hikurangi Trench, an extension of the much deeper Kermadec Trench, drops to below close to the New Zealand coast, and further from the coast the Rise borders on the Hikurangi Plateau. To the south, similar depths are achieved in the Bounty Trough. Past the eastern end of the rise, the sea floor drops away to the abyssal plain. Geology Geologically and tectonically, the Chatham Rise can be thought of as an extension of the eastern South Island. It was largely dry land at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago) and formed a large peninsula extending from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands at that time. The Cretaceous landscape of the Chatham Rise was characterized by a volcanic landscape. Fossils found on the Chatham Islands characterize the flora and fauna of the Chatham Rise in the late Mesozoic. The region had forests dominated by gymnosperms (such as Araucaria, Mataia and Podocarpus) and Lycopodiopsida (clubmosses). Some angiosperms were also present. Dinosaurs such as theropods dwelt on the peninsula and probably evolved into numerous endemic forms (Stilwell et al. 2006). Commercial fishing Subtropical and subantarctic waters meet to form the subtropical front over the Chatham Rise (orange) The Chatham Rise is New Zealand's most productive and important commercial fishing ground. The region is analogous to the North Sea's \\"Broad Fourteens\\", but is significantly deeper. Warm subtropical surface waters from the north and cold subantarctic surface waters from the south meet in the vicinity of the Chatham Rise to create a subtropical front. Nutrient rich waters from the south mix with warm northern waters and create ideal conditions for plankton and the animals that feed on them. The fishing grounds near the subtropical front and particularly the Chatham Rise provide 60% of New Zealand's fish catch. Because the Chatham Rise is relatively shallow, it is accessible to both midwater trawling and bottom trawling. Species include the main hoki, hake, ling, silver warehou, squid, orange roughy and deep sea (oreo) dory fisheries.NZ Ministry of Fisheries: Fisheries and their ecosystems. Retrieved 13 June 2008. The traditional approach to fisheries management has been to focus on a single species ‚Äì determining how many can be caught before the breeding population is affected to the point of harming the species fishery. There is a current trend towards ecosystem based fisheries.University of Liverpool (2006). \\"Marine Ecologists To Help Rebuild Decreasing Fish Stocks\\". ScienceDaily. Removing any fish affects other marine life up and down the food chain, such as marine life that eat the fish, and the marine life eating the marine life that eat the fish. Scientists from NIWA are examining over 40,000 fish stomachs to see what different species are eating across the Chatham Rise. These studies, combined with other studies on marine mammals and sea birds and with relevant ocean and climate studies, will show how the different parts fit together in the Chatham Rise ecosystem.

The two white spheres represent methyl groups. They are bound to two cytosine nucleotide molecules that make up the DNA sequence. DNA methylation is a biological process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. Methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence. When located in a gene promoter, DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene transcription. In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, repression of transposable elements, aging, and carcinogenesis. Two of DNA's four bases, cytosine and adenine, can be methylated. Cytosine methylation is widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, even though the rate of cytosine DNA methylation can differ greatly between species: 14% of cytosines are methylated in Arabidopsis thaliana, 4% to 8% in Physarum, 7.6% in Mus musculus, 2.3% in Escherichia coli, 0.03% in Drosophila, 0.006% in Dictyostelium(Information found in abstract) and virtually none (0.0002 to 0.0003%) in Caenorhabditis or fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. pombe (but not N. crassa). Adenine methylation has been observed in bacterial, plant, and recently in mammalian DNA, but has received considerably less attention. Methylation of cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine occurs at the same 5 position on the pyrimidine ring where the DNA base thymine's methyl group is located; the same position distinguishes thymine from the analogous RNA base uracil, which has no methyl group. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms then correct it back to the original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute A for G, turning the original C:G pair into a T:A pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation. This misincorporated base will not be corrected during DNA replication as thymine is a DNA base. If the mismatch is not repaired and the cell enters the cell cycle the strand carrying the T will be complemented by an A in one of the daughter cells, such that the mutation becomes permanent. The near-universal replacement of uracil by thymine in DNA, but not RNA, may have evolved as an error-control mechanism, to facilitate the removal of uracils generated by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine.Ang√©la B√©k√©si and Be√°ta G V√©rtessy \\"Uracil in DNA: error or signal?\\" DNA methylation as well as many of its contemporary DNA methyltransferases have been thought to evolve from early world primitive RNA methylation activity and is supported by several lines of evidence. In plants and other organisms, DNA methylation is found in three different sequence contexts: CG (or CpG), CHG or CHH (where H correspond to A, T or C). In mammals however, DNA methylation is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides, with the cytosines on both strands being usually methylated. Non-CpG methylation can however be observed in embryonic stem cells, and has also been indicated in neural development. Furthermore, non-CpG methylation has also been observed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and it occurred mainly in a CpApC sequence context.  Conserved function of DNA methylation  Typical DNA methylation landscape in mammals The DNA methylation landscape of vertebrates is very particular compared to other organisms. In mammals, around 75% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in somatic cells, and DNA methylation appears as a default state that has to be specifically excluded from defined locations. By contrast, the genome of most plants, invertebrates, fungi, or protists show ‚Äúmosaic‚Äù methylation patterns, where only specific genomic elements are targeted, and they are characterized by the alternation of methylated and unmethylated domains. Supplemental figures appear to be only accessible via the science.sciencemag.org paywall. High CpG methylation in mammalian genomes has an evolutionary cost because it increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations. Loss of amino-groups occurs with a high frequency for cytosines, with different consequences depending on their methylation. Methylated C residues spontaneously deaminate to form T residues over time; hence CpG dinucleotides steadily deaminate to TpG dinucleotides, which is evidenced by the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (they occur at only 21% of the expected frequency). (On the other hand, spontaneous deamination of unmethylated C residues gives rise to U residues, a change that is quickly recognized and repaired by the cell.) = CpG islands = In mammals, the only exception for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed CpG islands that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content. CpG islands are usually defined as regions with 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used. Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 CpG islands in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long. They are major regulatory units and around 50% of CpG islands are located in gene promoter regions, while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters. Reciprocally, around 60-70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. The majority of CpG islands are constitutively unmethylated and enriched for permissive chromatin modification such as H3K4 methylation. In somatic tissues, only 10% of CpG islands are methylated, the majority of them being located in intergenic and intragenic regions. = Repression of CpG-dense promoters = DNA methylation was probably present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in promoter regions correlates negatively with gene expression. CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never methylated, but, reciprocally, transcriptionally silent genes do not necessarily carry a methylated promoter. In mouse and human, around 60‚Äì70% of genes have a CpG island in their promoter region and most of these CpG islands remain unmethylated independently of the transcriptional activity of the gene, in both differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Of note, whereas DNA methylation of CpG islands is unambiguously linked with transcriptional repression, the function of DNA methylation in CG-poor promoters remains unclear; albeit there is little evidence that it could be functionally relevant. DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in \\"cancer\\". = Repression of transposable elements = DNA methylation is a powerful transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes that need to be silent permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation does not have the flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of transposable elements. Transposon control is one the most ancient functions of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists. It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose. = Methylation of the gene body of highly transcribed genes = A function that appears even more conserved than transposon silencing is positively correlated with gene expression. In almost all species where DNA methylation is present, DNA methylation is especially enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. The function of gene body methylation is not well understood. A body of evidence suggests that it could regulate splicing and suppress the activity of intragenic transcriptional units (cryptic promoters or transposable elements). Gene-body methylation appears closely tied to H3K36 methylation. In yeast and mammals, H3K36 methylation is highly enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. In yeast at least, H3K36me3 recruits enzymes such as histone deacetylases to condense chromatin and prevent the activation of cryptic start sites. In mammals, DNMT3a and DNMT3b PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3 and the two enzymes are recruited to the body of actively transcribed genes.  In mammals  Dynamic of DNA methylation during mouse embryonic development. E3.5-E6, etc., refer to days after fertilization. PGC: primordial germ cells = During embryonic development = DNA methylation patterns are largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost all of the methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages ‚Äì initially in the zygote, then during the first few embryonic replication cycles of morula and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period. Whereas DNA methylation is not necessary per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a ‚Äúlocked‚Äù state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical for the maintenance of mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA methylation appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate only a limited number of genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question. Due to the phenomenon of genomic imprinting, maternal and paternal genomes are differentially marked and must be properly reprogrammed every time they pass through the germline. Therefore, during gametogenesis, primordial germ cells must have their original biparental DNA methylation patterns erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent. After fertilization, the paternal and maternal genomes are once again demethylated and remethylated (except for differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes). This reprogramming is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes. =In cancer= In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. Typically, there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes. Generally, in progression to cancer, hundreds of genes are silenced or activated. Although silencing of some genes in cancers occurs by mutation, a large proportion of carcinogenic gene silencing is a result of altered DNA methylation (see DNA methylation in cancer). DNA methylation causing silencing in cancer typically occurs at multiple CpG sites in the CpG islands that are present in the promoters of protein coding genes. Altered expressions of microRNAs also silence or activate many genes in progression to cancer (see microRNAs in cancer). Altered microRNA expression occurs through hyper/hypo-methylation of CpG sites in CpG islands in promoters controlling transcription of the microRNAs. Silencing of DNA repair genes through methylation of CpG islands in their promoters appears to be especially important in progression to cancer (see methylation of DNA repair genes in cancer). =In atherosclerosis= Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have been implicated in cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In animal models of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue, as well as blood cells such as mononuclear blood cells, exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms may be used as an early biomarker of atherosclerosis since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and risk prevention. Two of the cell types targeted for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated homocysteine levels causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of homocysteine inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects genes that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, all of which are critical in forming atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of homocysteine also result in hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) gene, causing its down regulation. ERŒ± protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state. Hypermethylation of the ERŒ± promoter thus allows intimal smooth muscle cells to proliferate excessively and contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Another gene that experiences a change in methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there is an increase in methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The downregulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependent manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far. =In aging= In humans and other mammals, DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately estimate the age of tissues and cell types, forming an accurate epigenetic clock. A longitudinal study of twin children showed that, between the ages of 5 and 10, there was divergence of methylation patterns due to environmental rather than genetic influences. There is a global loss of DNA methylation during aging. In a study that analyzed the complete DNA methylomes of CD4+ T cells in a newborn, a 26 years old individual and a 103 years old individual were observed that the loss of methylation is proportional to age. Hypomethylated CpGs observed in the centenarian DNAs compared with the neonates covered all genomic compartments (promoters, intergenic, intronic and exonic regions). However, some genes become hypermethylated with age, including genes for the estrogen receptor, p16, and insulin-like growth factor 2. =In exercise= High intensity exercise has been shown to result in reduced DNA methylation in skeletal muscle. Promoter methylation of PGC-1Œ± and PDK4 were immediately reduced after high intensity exercise, whereas PPAR-Œ≥ methylation was not reduced until three hours after exercise. At the same time, six months of exercise in previously sedentary middle-age men resulted in increased methylation in adipose tissue. One study showed a possible increase in global genomic DNA methylation of white blood cells with more physical activity in non-Hispanics. = In B-cell differentiation = A study that investigated the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), showed that there is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages. The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and memory B cells. Furthermore, this study showed that there is a similarity between B cell tumors and long-lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures. = In the brain = Two reviews summarize evidence that DNA methylation alterations in brain neurons are important in learning and memory. Contextual fear conditioning (a form of associative learning) in animals, such as mice and rats, is rapid and is extremely robust in creating memories. In mice and in rats contextual fear conditioning, within 1‚Äì24 hours, it is associated with altered methylations of several thousand DNA cytosines in genes of hippocampus neurons. Twenty four hours after contextual fear conditioning, 9.2% of the genes in rat hippocampus neurons are differentially methylated. In mice, when examined at four weeks after conditioning, the hippocampus methylations and demethylations had been reset to the original naive conditions. The hippocampus is needed to form memories, but memories are not stored there. For such mice, at four weeks after contextual fear conditioning, substantial differential CpG methylations and demethylations occurred in cortical neurons during memory maintenance, and there were 1,223 differentially methylated genes in their anterior cingulate cortex. Active changes in neuronal DNA methylation and demethylation appear to act as controllers of synaptic scaling and glutamate receptor trafficking in learning and memory formation. DNA methyltransferases (in mammals) Possible pathways of cytosine methylation and demethylation. Abbreviations: S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM), DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase), Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) In mammalian cells, DNA methylation occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides and is carried out by two general classes of enzymatic activities ‚Äì maintenance methylation and de novo methylation. Maintenance methylation activity is necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase that is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells. It is thought that DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the de novo methyltransferases that set up DNA methylation patterns early in development. DNMT3L is a protein that is homologous to the other DNMT3s but has no catalytic activity. Instead, DNMT3L assists the de novo methyltransferases by increasing their ability to bind to DNA and stimulating their activity. Mice and rats have a third functional de novo methyltransferase enzyme named DNMT3C, which evolved as a paralog of Dnmt3b by tandem duplication in the common ancestral of Muroidea rodents. DNMT3C catalyzes the methylation of promoters of transposable elements during early spermatogenesis, an activity shown to be essential for their epigenetic repression and male fertility. It is yet unclear if in other mammals that do not have DNMT3C (like humans) rely on DNMT3B or DNMT3A for de novo methylation of transposable elements in the germline. Finally, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) has been identified as a DNA methyltransferase homolog, containing all 10 sequence motifs common to all DNA methyltransferases; however, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) does not methylate DNA but instead methylates cytosine-38 in the anticodon loop of aspartic acid transfer RNA. Since many tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, there have been attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the Œ≤-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation. In plants Significant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a CpG site, in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, Arabidopsis DNA is highly methylated, mass spectrometry analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified. The principal Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the de novo class or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughter strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a de novo DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication. Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the Chromatin Database). It is not clear how the cell determines the locations of de novo DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that for many (though not all) locations, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules. The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA. This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against RNA viruses and/or transposons, both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their mutagenic effect. Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to somatic embryogenesis in the plants (Isah 2016). In insects Diverse orders of insects show varied patterns of DNA methylation, from almost undetectable levels in flies to low levels in butterflies and higher in true bugs and some cockroaches (up to 14% of all CG sites in Blattella asahinai). Functional DNA methylation has been discovered in Honey Bees. DNA methylation marks are mainly on the gene body, and current opinions on the function of DNA methylation is gene regulation via alternative splicing DNA methylation levels in Drosophila melanogaster are nearly undetectable. Sensitive methods applied to Drosophila DNA Suggest levels in the range of 0.1‚Äì0.3% of total cytosine. This low level of methylation appears to reside in genomic sequence patterns that are very different from patterns seen in humans, or in other animal or plant species to date. Genomic methylation in D. melanogaster was found at specific short motifs (concentrated in specific 5-base sequence motifs that are CA- and CT- rich but depleted of guanine) and is independent of DNMT2 activity. Further, highly sensitive mass spectrometry approaches, have now demonstrated the presence of low (0.07%) but significant levels of adenine methylation during the earliest stages of Drosophila embryogenesis. In fungi Many fungi have low levels (0.1 to 0.5%) of cytosine methylation, whereas other fungi have as much as 5% of the genome methylated. This value seems to vary both among species and among isolates of the same species. There is also evidence that DNA methylation may be involved in state-specific control of gene expression in fungi. However, at a detection limit of 250 attomoles by using ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry DNA methylation was not confirmed in single cellular yeast species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe, indicating that yeasts do not possess this DNA modification. Although brewers' yeast (Saccharomyces), fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces), and Aspergillus flavus have no detectable DNA methylation, the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has a well-characterized methylation system. Several genes control methylation in Neurospora and mutation of the DNA methyl transferase, dim-2, eliminates all DNA methylation but does not affect growth or sexual reproduction. While the Neurospora genome has very little repeated DNA, half of the methylation occurs in repeated DNA including transposon relics and centromeric DNA. The ability to evaluate other important phenomena in a DNA methylase-deficient genetic background makes Neurospora an important system in which to study DNA methylation. In other eukaryotes DNA methylation is largely absent from Dictyostelium discoidium where it appears to occur at about 0.006% of cytosines. In contrast, DNA methylation is widely distributed in Physarum polycephalum where 5-methylcytosine makes up as much as 8% of total cytosine In bacteria Adenine or cytosine methylation is part of the restriction modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence- specific restriction enzymes and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by bacteriophage. E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for E. coli Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA‚ÄìDam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the E. coli genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in an increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair. One region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the origin of replication, which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle. Expression of certain genes, for example, those coding for pilus expression in E. coli, is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In E. coli, these pili operons have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics. On the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of adenines in the sequences AAC(N6)GTGC and GCAC(N6)GTT. In Clostridioides difficile, DNA methylation at the target motif CAAAAA was shown to impact sporulation, a key step in disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization. =Molecular cloning= Most strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of E. coli K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase). In fact, it is possible to unmethylate the DNA extracted from dam+/dcm+ strains by transforming it into dam-/dcm- strains. This would help digest sequences that are not being recognized by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. The restriction enzyme DpnI can recognize 5'-GmeATC-3' sites and digest the methylated DNA. Being such a short motif, it occurs frequently in sequences by chance, and as such its primary use for researchers is to degrade template DNA following PCRs (PCR products lack methylation, as no methylases are present in the reaction). Similarly, some commercially available restriction enzymes are sensitive to methylation at their cognate restriction sites and must as mentioned previously be used on DNA passed through a dam-/dcm- strain to allow cutting. Detection DNA methylation can be detected by the following assays currently used in scientific research: * Mass spectrometry is a very sensitive and reliable analytical method to detect DNA methylation. MS, in general, is however not informative about the sequence context of the methylation, thus limited in studying the function of this DNA modification. * Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), which is based on a chemical reaction of sodium bisulfite with DNA that converts unmethylated cytosines of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional PCR. However, methylated cytosines will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated. * Whole genome bisulfite sequencing, also known as BS-Seq, which is a high-throughput genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. It is based on the aforementioned sodium bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA, which is then sequenced on a Next- generation sequencing platform. The sequences obtained are then re-aligned to the reference genome to determine the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides based on mismatches resulting from the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracil. * Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, also known as RRBS knows several working protocols. The first RRBS protocol was called RRBS and aims for around 10% of the methylome, a reference genome is needed. Later came more protocols that were able to sequence a smaller portion of the genome and higher sample multiplexing. EpiGBS was the first protocol where you could multiplex 96 samples in one lane of Illumina sequencing and were a reference genome was no longer needed. A de novo reference construction from the Watson and Crick reads made population screening of SNP's and SMP's simultaneously a fact. * The HELP assay, which is based on restriction enzymes' differential ability to recognize and cleave methylated and unmethylated CpG DNA sites. * GLAD-PCR assay, which is based on a new type of enzymes ‚Äì site-specific methyl-directed DNA endonucleases, which hydrolyze only methylated DNA. * ChIP-on-chip assays, which is based on the ability of commercially prepared antibodies to bind to DNA methylation-associated proteins like MeCP2. * Restriction landmark genomic scanning, a complicated and now rarely used assay based upon restriction enzymes' differential recognition of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites; the assay is similar in concept to the HELP assay. * Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), analogous to chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation is used to isolate methylated DNA fragments for input into DNA detection methods such as DNA microarrays (MeDIP- chip) or DNA sequencing (MeDIP-seq). * Pyrosequencing of bisulfite treated DNA. This is the sequencing of an amplicon made by a normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide at a time to the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mismatch, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mismatch is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage of methylation per CpG island. * Molecular break light assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase activity ‚Äì an assay that relies on the specificity of the restriction enzyme DpnI for fully methylated (adenine methylation) GATC sites in an oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore and quencher. The adenine methyltransferase methylates the oligonucleotide making it a substrate for DpnI. Cutting of the oligonucleotide by DpnI gives rise to a fluorescence increase. * Methyl Sensitive Southern Blotting is similar to the HELP assay, although uses Southern blotting techniques to probe gene-specific differences in methylation using restriction digests. This technique is used to evaluate local methylation near the binding site for the probe. * MethylCpG Binding Proteins (MBPs) and fusion proteins containing just the Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) are used to separate native DNA into methylated and unmethylated fractions. The percentage methylation of individual CpG islands can be determined by quantifying the amount of the target in each fraction. Extremely sensitive detection can be achieved in FFPE tissues with abscription-based detection. * High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-PCR analytical technique. The target DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines are preserved. PCR amplification is then carried out with primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature that can be used in quantitative methylation detection. * Ancient DNA methylation reconstruction, a method to reconstruct high-resolution DNA methylation from ancient DNA samples. The method is based on the natural degradation processes that occur in ancient DNA: with time, methylated cytosines are degraded into thymines, whereas unmethylated cytosines are degraded into uracils. This asymmetry in degradation signals was used to reconstruct the full methylation maps of the Neanderthal and the Denisovan. In September 2019, researchers published a novel method to infer morphological traits from DNA methylation data. The authors were able to show that linking down-regulated genes to phenotypes of monogenic diseases, where one or two copies of a gene are perturbed, allows for ~85% accuracy in reconstructing anatomical traits directly from DNA methylation maps. *Methylation Sensitive Single Nucleotide Primer Extension Assay (msSNuPE), which uses internal primers annealing straight 5' of the nucleotide to be detected. *Illumina Methylation Assay measures locus-specific DNA methylation using array hybridization. Bisulfite-treated DNA is hybridized to probes on \\"BeadChips.\\" Single-base base extension with labeled probes is used to determine methylation status of target sites. In 2016, the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip was released, which interrogates over 850,000 methylation sites across the human genome. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) Differentially methylated regions, are genomic regions with different methylation statuses among multiple samples (tissues, cells, individuals or others), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. The identification of DMRs among multiple tissues (T-DMRs) provides a comprehensive survey of epigenetic differences among human tissues. For example, these methylated regions that are unique to a particular tissue allow individuals to differentiate between tissue type, such as semen and vaginal fluid. Current research conducted by Lee et al., showed DACT1 and USP49 positively identified semen by examining T-DMRs. The use of T-DMRs has proven useful in the identification of various body fluids found at crime scenes. Researchers in the forensic field are currently seeking novel T-DMRs in genes to use as markers in forensic DNA analysis. DMRs between cancer and normal samples (C-DMRs) demonstrate the aberrant methylation in cancers. It is well known that DNA methylation is associated with cell differentiation and proliferation. Many DMRs have been found in the development stages (D-DMRs) and in the reprogrammed progress (R-DMRs). In addition, there are intra- individual DMRs (Intra-DMRs) with longitudinal changes in global DNA methylation along with the increase of age in a given individual. There are also inter-individual DMRs (Inter-DMRs) with different methylation patterns among multiple individuals. QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a quantitative approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR can be used as an effective tool for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples. Gene-set analysis (a.k.a. pathway analysis; usually performed tools such as DAVID, GoSeq or GSEA) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. MeDIP- seq, MeDIP-ChIP, HELP-seq etc.), and a wide range of studies have thus mistakenly reported hyper-methylation of genes related to development and differentiation; it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numbers of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene. DNA methylation marks DNA methylation marks ‚Äì genomic regions with specific methylation patterns in a specific biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual ‚Äì are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type- specific hypomethylation marks are associated with the cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type- specific hypomethylation. The entropy-based Specific Methylation Analysis and Report Tool, termed \\"SMART\\", which focuses on integrating a large number of DNA methylomes for the de novo identification of cell type-specific methylation marks. The latest version of SMART is focused on three main functions including de novo identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by genome segmentation, identification of DMRs from predefined regions of interest, and identification of differentially methylated CpG sites. = In identification and detection of body fluids = DNA methylation allows for several tissues to be analyzed in one assay as well as for small amounts of body fluid to be identified with the use of extracted DNA. Usually, the two approaches of DNA methylation are either methylated-sensitive restriction enzymes or treatment with sodium bisulphite. Methylated sensitive restriction enzymes work by cleaving specific CpG, cytosine and guanine separated by only one phosphate group, recognition sites when the CpG is methylated. In contrast, unmethylated cytosines are transformed to uracil and in the process, methylated cytosines remain methylated. In particular, methylation profiles can provide insight on when or how body fluids were left at crime scenes, identify the kind of body fluid, and approximate age, gender, and phenotypic characteristics of perpetrators. Research indicates various markers that can be used for DNA methylation. Deciding which marker to use for an assay is one of the first steps of the identification of body fluids. In general, markers are selected by examining prior research conducted. Identification markers that are chosen should give a positive result for one type of cell. One portion of the chromosome that is an area of focus when conducting DNA methylation are tissue-specific differentially methylated regions, T-DMRs.The degree of methylation for the T-DMRs ranges depending on the body fluid. A research team developed a marker system that is two-fold. The first marker is methylated only in the target fluid while the second is methylated in the rest of the fluids. For instance, if venous blood marker A is un-methylated and venous blood marker B is methylated in a fluid, it indicates the presence of only venous blood. In contrast, if venous blood marker A is methylated and venous blood marker B is un-methylated in some fluid, then that indicates venous blood is in a mixture of fluids. Some examples for DNA methylation markers are Mens1(menstrual blood), Spei1(saliva), and Sperm2(seminal fluid). DNA methylation provides a relatively good means of sensitivity when identifying and detecting body fluids. In one study, only ten nanograms of a sample was necessary to ascertain successful results. DNA methylation provides a good discernment of mixed samples since it involves markers that give ‚Äúon or off‚Äù signals. DNA methylation is not impervious to external conditions. Even under degraded conditions using the DNA methylation techniques, the markers are stable enough that there are still noticeable differences between degraded samples and control samples. Specifically, in one study, it was found that there were not any noticeable changes in methylation patterns over an extensive period of time. Computational prediction DNA methylation can also be detected by computational models through sophisticated algorithms and methods. Computational models can facilitate the global profiling of DNA methylation across chromosomes, and often such models are faster and cheaper to perform than biological assays. Such up-to-date computational models include Bhasin, et al., Bock, et al., and Zheng, et al. Together with biological assay, these methods greatly facilitate the DNA methylation analysis.

Biography Chapanis received a PhD in Psychology from Yale University in 1943. He was notably active in improving aviation safety around the time of World War II, although his career covered a wide range of domains and applications. One of his major contributions was shape coding in the aircraft cockpit. After a series of runway crashes of the Boeing B-17, Chapanis found that certain cockpit controls were confused with each other, due partly to their proximity and similarity of shape. Particularly, the controls for flaps and landing gear were confused, the consequences of which could be severe. Chapanis proposed attaching a wheel to the end of the landing gear control and a triangle to the end of the flaps control, to enable them to be easily distinguished by touch alone. Thereafter for that aircraft there were no further instances of the landing gear being mistakenly raised while the aircraft was still on the ground. This particular shape-coding of cockpit controls is still used today. In 1949 he published the first textbook on the subject of ergonomics, Applied Experimental Psychology: Human Factors in Engineering Design. In the 1950s, Chapanis worked with Bell Labs on the design of push-button telephone handsets, conducting experiments that led to the present layout of the keys.

Presentation It is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. ICF syndrome patients exhibit facial anomalies which include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. Genetics Mutations in four genes can cause this syndrome:Ren R, Hardikar S, Horton JR, Lu Y, Zeng Y, Singh AK, Lin K, Coletta LD, Shen J, Lin Kong CS, Hashimoto H, Zhang X, Chen T, Cheng X (2019) Structural basis of specific DNA binding by the transcription factor ZBTB24. Nucleic Acids Res Cell division cycle associated protein 7 (CDCA7), DNA-methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3B), Lymphoid specific helicase (HELLS) and Zinc finger- and BTB domain containing protein 24 (ZBTB24). The CDCA7 gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q31.1). The DNMT3B gene is located on chromosome 20 (20q11.2)). The HELLS gene is located on chromosome 10 (10q23.33) The ZBTB24 gene is located on chromosome 6 (6q21) This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Diagnosis Treatment For ICF patients the most diffused therapy consists of repeated intravenous infusions of immunoglobulins for the patients entire lifespan. In 2007, Gennery et al. cured the humoral and cellular immunological defect in three ICF1 patients by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The only side effect was related to the development of autoimmune phenomena in two of them.

Traditionally, transactions on savings accounts were widely recorded in a passbook, and were sometimes called passbook savings accounts, and bank statements were not provided; however, currently such transactions are commonly recorded electronically and accessible online. People deposit funds in savings accounts for a variety of reasons, including as a safe place where to hold their cash. Savings accounts normally pay interest. A number of countries require savings accounts to be protected by deposit insurance and some countries provide a government guarantee for at least a portion of the savings account balance. There are a number of types of savings accounts for particular purposes, such as for young savers, for retirees, Christmas club accounts, investment accounts, money market accounts, besides other. Some accounts require a minimum deposit, a deposit on a regular basis, notice of withdrawal, and other special conditions. Almost all savings accounts accrue compound interest over time. Regulations =United States= In the United States, Sec. 204.2(d)(1) of Regulation D (FRB) limits withdrawals from savings accounts to 6 pre-authorized transfers or withdrawals (excluding withdrawals via an automated teller machine) per month or a statement cycle of at least four weeks. There is no limit to the number of deposits into the account. Violations of the regulation may result in a service charge, or may result in the account being changed to a checking account. Regulation D sets smaller reserve requirements for savings account balances. In addition, customers can plan withdrawals to avoid fees and earn interest, which contributes to more stable savings account balances on which banks can lend. A savings account linked to a checking account at the same financial institution can help avoid fees due to overdrafts and reduce banking costs.

He is the Liberal Member of Parliament for the riding of Scarborough‚ÄîGuildwood. McKay was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance from 2003 to 2006 during the government of Paul Martin, then served as an opposition MP and critic until November 2015 during the government of Stephen Harper. As of April, 2019, he serves as Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security; Chair of the Canadian Section of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence; and Vice-President of the Canada-United Kingdom Inter-Parliamentary Association, along with membership in several other groups and committees. McKay was sworn in as a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on December 12, 2003, and carries the designations of Honourable and Privy Councillor (PC) for life. Born in Toronto, Ontario, McKay has lived most of his life in Scarborough district of Toronto. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto at Scarborough and a Bachelor of Laws degree from Queen's University. He attends an evangelical church in Toronto.OttawaWatch: Madeleine, Maurice and the Almighty. Lloyd Mackey. CanadianChristianity.com. May 11, 2006. After practising private law, he was elected to represent Scarborough East in 1997 and was re-elected in 2000. After Scarborough East was abolished in 2003 he was elected to represent the riding of Scarborough‚ÄîGuildwood in 2004. McKay was re-elected in the 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2015 federal elections. Early life and career A lifelong resident of Scarborough, McKay went to five of the area's public schools. He attended and graduated at Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute. McKay attended the University of Toronto Scarborough campus where he earned his Bachelor of Arts. He later earned his Bachelor of Laws from Queen's University. After completing his degree he went into private practice as a real estate attorney, assuming positions of leadership in the legal community. Most notably, he was the President of the Durham Bar Association, an Executive Member of County and District Law Association, Real Estate Executive of the Canadian Bar Association, and a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada's Committee on Title Insurance. Election to Federal Parliament McKay was first elected to the House of Commons in June 1997 as a Liberal during the general election of the 36th Canadian Parliament. McKay was twice elected to the former electoral district of Scarborough East, in 1997 and 2000, with 54.3 and 59.8 percent of the vote respectively. After 2000, the riding of Scarborough East was abolished and became Scarborough-Guildwood, which acquired parts of Scarborough Southwest and Scarborough Centre. McKay is the Member of Parliament for Scarborough-Guildwood and was elected as the representative for the riding in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2015 with 57.5, 53.3, 50.2, 36.2 and 60.0 percent of the vote respectively. Parliamentary experience =Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance= From 2003 to 2006, McKay served as Parliamentary Secretary to then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale. Paul Martin, during his tenure as Prime Minister, implemented a number of reforms aimed at making parliament more democratic. One of these reforms gave greater authority to MPs serving as Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister, in contrast to their previous role that had been largely clerical with little purview over government policy. To this end, McKay was given ministerial responsibility for the improvement of partnerships between the public and private sectors. During the 2003‚Äì2006 period the Ministry of Finance tabled two consecutive balanced budgets and implemented its productivity strategy, aimed at improving economic growth through innovation, elimination of domestic trade barriers, competitive taxes, and improved infrastructure among other initiatives. =Critic portfolios= McKay served as the Critic for the Environment for the Liberal Party of Canada during the government of Steven Harper He was appointed to the role by Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau on August 21, 2013.

The Bill requires that Canadian foreign aid be exclusively targeted toward the goal of poverty reduction, and requires timely and transparent reporting of how such funds are spent. Private Members' Bills rarely receive Royal Assent as most bills originate from the cabinet of the party controlling the most seats (the party in government). =An Act to amend the Hazardous Products Act (fire-safe cigarettes) - C-260= In 2002 McKay introduced Bill C-260, an amendment to the already existing Hazardous Products Act, which forces tobacco manufacturers to produce fire safe cigarettes in response to the threat of fire posed by cigarettes left unattended. The Bill requires that cigarettes meet regulated ignition propensity standards (RIPs) by law and provide evidence to the Minister of Health of compliance with the regulation. As of October 1, 2005, all cigarettes in Canada are manufactured to self-extinguish before burning to the cigarette filter, thus reducing the risk that it will start a fire when forgotten or when the smoker falls asleep. Prior to the C-260, the Canadian Ministry of Health estimated that unattended cigarettes resulted in 2085 fires, 70 deaths and $28.1 million in damages to property. Health Canada further estimated that RIP cigarettes would prevent 34-68% of fire loss damages.http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/nm-show.asp?story=366 After C-260 received Royal Assent in 2003, Canada became the first country to introduce nationwide ignition propensity regulations on cigarettes, and has become an example used by advocacy groups in other nations for the imposition of such regulations.http://www.firesafecigarettes.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=81&itemID;=1033&URL;=Legislative%20updates/Adoptions/Canada%20the%20first%20nation%20to%20enact%20a%20fire- safe%20cigarette%20law =The Development Assistance Accountability Act - C-293= In 2006 McKay introduced Private Members‚Äô Bill C-293, which called for significant changes to the manner in which Canada's official development assistance is delivered and administered. Often referred to as the ‚ÄòBetter Aid Bill,‚Äô its primary purpose is to mandate that the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) target Canada's Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the specific goal of poverty reduction in developing nations. Prior to the passage of C-293, parliamentary committees and NGOs had called for a clearer mandate for ODA. Critics of Canada's aid spending noted that assistance was often sent to countries that have recently experienced strong economic growth and prosperity or have dubious records regarding human rights. In an article from June 19, 2007, National Post columnist John Ivison reported that Canada had sent $7.7 million to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for job creation programs and reconciliation projects, despite the country's healthy economy, lower taxation rate and higher per capita GDP.John Ivison. The National Post. Tuesday, June 19, 2007 In another example, Ivison noted that in 2004-2005 China received $57 million in ODA, amid concerns held by the international community about human rights abuses. The Bill established a set of principles that CIDA must take into account when adjudging how aid is to be spent. First, it requires that the perspectives and concerns of those who receive ODA be taken into account. This means that Canadian aid flows will have to respect the priorities of its beneficiaries - the people living in poverty. Secondly, it requires that ODA be promulgated in a manner consistent with Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner. Due to the legislated focus on long-term poverty reduction, ODA cannot be redirected towards international military efforts or short-term disaster relief (areas of policy that the Canadian government must fund separately) and is subject to judicial review and oversight by the Minister. Senator Rom√©o Dallaire moved third reading of C-293 in the Senate. Senator Dallaire hailed the Bill saying: \\"My colleague in the other place, the Honourable John McKay, introduced Bill C-293 in the House of Commons in May 2006, almost two years ago. It has come a long way since then and has been put through many valuable and essential debates. I believe the debates initiated by Bill C-293 were so important that they will inform the nature of any future essential international development policy and legislation in this country. It is a first step.\\" On March 20, 2008 C-293 passed third reading in the House of Commons with unanimous support from all parties. It received Royal Assent on May 29, 2008, thus becoming law as the Development Assistance Accountability Act, (An Act respecting the provision of official development assistance abroad). Canada's Development Assistance Accountability Act represents a trend among other nations that provide foreign aid toward legislated mandates for the provision of foreign aid. In 2002 the U.K. passed the International Development Act that entrenched poverty reduction as the preponderant focus of its foreign aid.http://dsp- psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/PRB-e/PRB0631-e.pdf Other countries with similar legislation include Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium. McKay is one of the more active Members of the Canadian Parliament on the issue of aid to developing nations, having been the Vice President of CIDO; an organization devoted the development of microfinancing in developing nations. In 2007 McKay travelled with Michael Savage M.P. (Liberal), Alexa McDonough M.P. (NDP), and Bill Casey M.P. (Conservative) to Kenya as part of a Parliamentary envoy to assess the efficacy and potential of ODA in developing nations. Though C-293 had been introduced prior to the trip, according to McKay the Kenyan sojourn gave greater urgency to the need for ODA reform. \\"We did not come away with easy answers regarding development and poverty, but a much clearer sense that we do have the capacity for meaningful change.\\"McKay, John. The Face of Poverty. http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/nm- show.asp?story=347, p.7 C-293 has received praise from a diverse array of groups and organizations including Canada's Coalition to End Global Poverty, Make Poverty History, Engineers without Bordershttp://www.ewb.ca/en/enews/2008/06/5.html and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. Private Members' Bill C-300 =Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act - Bill C-300= On February 9, 2009 John McKay introduced his latest Private Member's Bill C- 300 to the House of Commons. The Bill was defeated on October 26, 2010 during its third reading. Bill C- 300, also cited as the Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act, has the stated purpose of promoting \\"environmental best practices and to ensure the protection and promotion of international human rights standards in respect of the mining, oil or gas activities of Canadian corporations in developing countries\\". The Act would require the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of International Trade to investigate and report on any single complaint against the activities of a Canadian extractive sector company in a developing country. The Ministers could also investigate matters on their own initiative. The Ministers would publish the results of any specific investigation, and submit annual reports of activities carried out under the Act to the House of Commons and the Senate for review. The Act would also amend the laws governing Export Development Canada, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, to require those organizations to withdraw financial support and consular support from companies acting \\"inconsistently\\" with corporate social responsibility (CSR) Guidelines. McKay has stated that the intent of the bill is that these investigations be carried out within the existing organization and with the existing personnel available to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of International Trade 40th PARLIAMENT, 3rd SESSION, Monday, September 20, 2010, EDITED HANSARD, NUMBER 066 Said McKay: \\"NGOs and government officials who have expressed concerns about the practices of some mining, oil, and gas operations in developing countries will be encouraged by Bill C-300. This Bill will provide strong incentives for Canadian corporations in developing countries to follow environmental and human rights standards.\\"http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/nm-show.asp?story=527 However, the intended and actual scope and impact of the Bill is not clear. John McKay sometimes characterizes the bill as a modest law that would merely ensure that the Canadian government does not directly support extractive industry companies that do not adhere to CSR standards.John McKay, Speech to Mining Industry Representatives Addressing Criticisms of C-300, April 15, 2010 However, it appears that the law would oblige or empower (oblige in response to a complaint, empower if they believe warranted) the Ministers to investigate and report on any Canadian mining or oil company regardless of whether it was currently receiving support ‚Äì so the potential sanction of government condemnation would apply to any extractive industry company, if one of the Ministers decides it is not acting consistently with the CSR guidelines. C-300 is not without controversy. While there has been no disagreement with the bill's stated intent in continuing to improve Canada's performance in CSR, many groups argue that the bill has flaws that would prevent it from achieving its objective. The mechanism of the bill is not aimed at changing the CSR performance of projects in developing countries, only from dissuading Canadian companies from initiating or maintaining investments in projects that may be found inconsistent with the CSR Guidelines. John McKay has used Talisman Energy divesting of its share of a venture in Sudan as an example of how it would be feasible for Canadian companies to comply with the bill.Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, Thursday May 13, 2010 While this did eliminate Talisman's exposure to the poor CSR performance of that venture, there is evidence that this actually reduced CSR performance in Sudan by eliminating Talisman's advocacy for CSR measures. This approach contrasts to the National Roundtables on CSR 2007 Advisory Group's recommendations,National Roundtables on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the Canadian Extractive Industry in Developing Countries: Advisory Group Report and the current government initiatives, that are aimed at supporting and enforcing improved performance in the developing world. Export Development Canada (EDC) would be required to withdraw even existing financing from a company that has been found in a Ministerial investigation to have activities inconsistent with the guidelines to be established under Bill C-300. EDC notes that they currently conduct CRS assessments of financings in sensitive markets or for sensitive projects, and work with companies to ensure that required standards are met before receiving EDC support.EDC's response to Bill C-300, Opening Remarks to The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development by Jim McArdle, Senior Vice President, October 27, 2009, EDC believes that by working with companies to resolve CSR issues they contribute more to CSR than if they were forced to exit the relationship as soon as the guidelines are not met. EDC's support in this sector helped generate $21.4 billion in Canadian GDP and sustain 139,000 Canadian jobs in communities across the country and this might be in jeopardy if Bill C-300 were to become law. Representatives of the mining industry also note that key stakeholders were not consulted in the development of the bill, and is not in keeping with the spirit and intent of the recommendations of the National Roundtable on CSR.Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, Bill C-300 Position Statement, August 2009 http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/publications/na/pdf/090812-bill-c-300-position- statement.pdf Representatives of the legal community in Canada and the extractive industry have noted that C-300 is problematic in several ways, including Canada's capacity, expertise or jurisdiction to enforce CSR guidelines abroad or to supersede local authorities. It also forces the Canadian government into a punitive approach, rather than allowing the government to assist companies is resolving CSR issues.Comments by Jim Peterson, Counsel with the Faskin Martineau and former Canadian federal Minister of International Trade, while appearing before The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, November 26, 2009 As is evidenced through public statements and media appearances, Bill C-300's critics represent a wide array of extractive industry and business interests.http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/tradingdesk/archive/2010/03/08/pdac-2010-miners- unite-against-bill-c-300.aspxRichard J. King, Ogilvy Renault LLP, CSR in the Mining Sector - An environmental law perspective on Bill C-300BDO Dunwoody Weekly CEO/Business Leader Poll - Compas Survey on C-300Fraser Institute - ‚ÄúPrivate member‚Äôs bill unfairly targets Canadian mining industry‚Äù However, Bill C-300 is also supported by a wide array of public academics, and NGOs both internationally and within Canada.http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/newsshow.asp?int_id=80590 Supporters of the Bill include (but are not limited to): Amnesty International, the Halifax Initiative, Make Poverty History, MiningWatch Canada, Africa Files, World Vision, The North-South Institute, Canadian Labour Congress, Development and Peace (Canada), Ecojustice Canada, Rights and Democracy, Social Justice Committee of Montreal, and Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. Various private individuals and foreign governments have weighed-in both as supporters and as critics of the Bill. Professor Richard Janda of the McGill University Faculty of Law produced a report entitled, Bill C-300: Sound and Measured Reinforcement for CSR.http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/images/newsmanager/newsfiles/bill%20c-300%20report%20-%20final.pdf According to Professor Janda Bill C-300 would make Canadian companies world leaders in CSR, and that good CSR performance would give Canadian extractive companies a competitive edge and international business advantage. Industry submissions agree that good CSR performance is generally a source of competitive advantage. Professor Janda's report does not examine the current position of Canadian companies and CSR, nor does it examine whether C-300 is required in order to make Canadian companies world leaders, both which are beyond the scope of the report. However, John McKay has stated that Canadian companies already have a competitive advantage in some developing countries because they are held to higher standards of practice and more likely to fulfill licensing conditions. Essentially, there is agreement that CSR is important, and that Canada is already in many ways a strong player - the debate is whether C-300 will improve CSR performance, and if so whether it is the most appropriate way to do so. An important difference between the basis of Professor Janda's conclusions and the concerns of industry is the presumption of how easy, or not, it will be for the Minister receiving a complaint to determine if it is \\"frivolous or vexatious\\". Professor Janda states that \\"the general requirement that a complaint appear to be reasonable on its face is nevertheless sufficiently stringent to allow the Minister in question efficiently to screen out complaints that are frivolous and vexatious\\", whereas industry representatives state that this will not be an easy determination, given that the complaints will likely relate to activities in remote areas and particularly if the complaint comes from an individual outside of Canada (in a developing country). A second important difference in the view of the Janda report and submissions from industry and other members of the legal community is the presumption of how complaints will be investigated. Professor Janda refers to the legality in Canada for the Canadian government to hear evidence from \\"witnesses abroad\\", and gives examples of foreign fact-finding related to assistance in natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts. However, he does not address the practicality or legality of investigating matters related to breaches of laws in foreign countries, which may include investigation of the actions of the foreign government. Submissions critical of C-300 point out that many of the various allegations made against Canadian companies also imply breaches of law in the host country, or include accusations against the police or military of the host country, or challenge the conformity of host country laws with international standards (such as for recognition of indigenous peoples) - and that these would likely be difficult to investigate from Canada, or for the Canadian government to investigate in the host country. The Janda report also finds Bill C-300 is consistent with the National Roundtables Advisory Group's recommendations, with an even more modest set of proposals. However, this is based on examination of the 6 \\"major components\\" of the proposed Canadian CSR Framework, which is a central recommendation in the Advisory Group report, rather than the 26 specific recommendations contained in the Advisory Group report. In fact, the Bill does not reflect any of the specific recommendations of the Roundtables, although it is frequently referenced to the Ombudsman called for in the Roundtable recommendations. Supporters of C-300 state that the Bill is a better representation of the Ombudsman than the recently created Office of the Extractive Sector CSR Counsellor, because C-300 can force investigations and impose sanctions.Mining Weekly, C-300 MP makes his case to a room full of miners However, the Ombudsman office described in the recommendations was not to have the power to impose sanctions, it was proposed to \\"provide advisory, fact-finding and reporting functions\\". A separate \\"standing tripartite Compliance Review Committee\\" (presumably representing government, business, and civil society) was proposed that, in cases of serious non-compliance, would make recommendations with regard to the \\"withdrawal of financial and/or nonfinancial services\\" by the government. The Janda report rebuts further criticism by claiming Bill C-300's direct effects to be within federal jurisdiction, and therefore, not extraterritorial. However, this opinion does not address the legitimacy of the Canadian government investigating allegations related to the activities of foreign governments, nor investigation of crimes (other than \\"crimes of universal jurisdiction\\") occurring in foreign countries, nor investigation of the activities of foreign nationals working in their home country. As noted above, critics of the bill point out that allegations that have been presented as justification for the bill would require these sorts of extraterritorial investigations. The Janda report insists that Bill C-300's expectations on Canadian corporations have a strong legal foundation. Bill C-300 supporters claim that since the mining companies receive investment from Export Development Canada (EDC), which is funded by Canadian taxpayers, and Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) their actions ought to be transparent and accountable to Canadians.McKay, John, \\"Holding Mining Companies Accountable for Actions Abroad,\\" Ottawa Life, January 2010. The submissions critical of C-300 do not argue against this principle, and have noted that the existing CSR Commitment of EDC, and CPP Policies and Reports on Responsible Investinghttp://www.cppib.ca/Responsible_Investing/ currently provide at least a measure of such transparency and accountability. Additionally, C-300 does not include any of the transparency measures included in the recommendations of the National Roundtables 2007 Advisory Group report - many of which would not require government expenditure and therefore would be suitable for a Private Member's Bill.

It was photographed from the air by US Navy Operation Highjump in 1946‚Äì47. The bay was entered in January 1948 by US Navy Operation Windmill icebreakers Burton Island and stations in the Windmill Islands in the NE portion of the bay. Named by the US-ACAN for the sloop of war , flagship of the USEE under Wilkes, from which a series of coastal landfalls along Wilkes Land were discovered and plotted during January‚ÄìFebruary 1840. Wilkes' chart suggests a possible coastal recession corresponding closely with the longitudinal limits for Vincennes Bay, although pack ice conditions prevented close reconnaissance by the USEE of the coast in this immediate area. Vincennes Bay is roughly triangular, 120 km north-south and 150 km east-west at its northern extremity, and thus covers an area of about 9,000 km2. To the east lies the icecap of Law Dome and the north-south oriented Windmill Islands coast of Precambrian basement, which is the setting for Antarctic stations Wilkes (USA, 1957‚Äì59) and Casey (Australia, 1959‚Äìpresent day). The Knox Coast forms the western boundary of Vincennes Bay, where the East Antarctic ice sheet terminates in continuous ice cliffs. The southern coastline of Vincennes Bay is marked by the Vanderford and Adams Glaciers. The Vanderford Glacier drains the western hemisphere of Law Dome and together with the Adams Glacier, drains the main East Antarctic ice sheet via the Aurora subglacial basin, a major feature of East Antarctica.Drewry, D.J. (editor) 1983. Antarctica: Glaciological and geophysical folio. Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge. Petersen Bank (<200 m) is located on the eastern side of the bay and another shallow bank is located on the western side; however, much of Vincennes Bay lies deeper than 1000 m below sea level. Glacial erosion has produced an over- deepened glacial trough on the inner shelf, up to 2,100 m in depth locally, and most of the inner shelf area is characterised by exposed basement rocks as seen on GI-gun seismic profiles. Glacial marine sedimentation processes in the bay are characterised by siliciclastic sediments dominating over biogenic sediments even in deep, inner shelf troughs.Harris, P.T., Taylor, F., Domack, E., DeSantis, L., Goodwin, I., Quilty, P.G., O'Brien, P.E., 1997. Glacimarine siliciclastic muds from Vincennes Bay, East Antarctica; preliminary results of an exploratory cruise in 1997. Terra Antarctica 4, 11-20. Water circulation in the Bay involves landward flow at depth, bringing warmer ocean water into contact with the base of the Vanderford Glacier. This water becomes mixed with fresh meltwater and suspended glacial sediments to form a buoyant plume that rises and flows in a seaward direction under the ice shelf.Harris, P.T., 2000. Sedimentological Signatures of Sub-Ice Shelf Circulation: An Example From Vincennes Bay, East Antarctica. Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania 133, 57-62.

It is the largest opera company in Canada and one of the largest producers of opera in North America. The COC performs in its own opera house, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. For forty years until April 2006, the COC had performed at the O'Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall). History 300x300px Nicholas Goldschmidt and Herman Geiger-Torel founded the organization in 1950 as the Royal Conservatory Opera Company. Geiger-Torel became the COC's artistic director in 1956 and its general director in 1960. The company was renamed the Canadian Opera Association in 1960, and the Canadian Opera Company in 1977. Geiger-Torel retired from the general directorship in 1976. Lotfi Mansouri was the COC's general director from 1976 to 1988. In 1983, the COC introduced surtitles (supertitles) to their productions, the first company to use them in an opera house. Productions included Joan Sutherland's first performance of Donizetti's Anna Bolena. Brian Dickie served as the COC's general director from 1988 to 1993. Dickie named Richard Bradshaw the COC's chief conductor and head of music in 1989. Elaine Calder was the COC's general director from 1994 to 1997. In 1998, Bradshaw was named general director. During his tenure, Bradshaw secured funding for the COC's new permanent home, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Previously, the COC had been performing at the O'Keefe Centre (renamed to the Hummingbird Centre and then the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts). In 2006, the COC opened its new opera house with an all-new production of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Michael Levine was the designer, and there were four directors: Michael Levine (Das Rheingold), Atom Egoyan (Die Walk√ºre), Fran√ßois Girard (Siegfried), and Tim Albery (G√∂tterd√§mmerung). In 2006, Bradshaw's contract as general director was renewed for another 10 years. Bradshaw died of a sudden heart attack on August 15, 2007. In June 2008, Alexander Neef was named the COC's general director; he formally assumed the position in October 2008. In October 2008, Johannes Debus made his debut with the COC as a conductor in a production of Prokofiev's War and Peace, where he earned critical acclaim. In January 2009, the COC announced the appointment of Johannes Debus as the company's music director. Pianist and vocal coach Sandra Horst currently serves as the company's chorus master. The 2019/2020 COC theatre season was cut short due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, on which the COC ceased all remaining productions for that theatre season from March 2020 onwards due to restrictions on large indoor gatherings. The COC hoped to restart the shortened 2020/2021 theatre season by January 2021, however on October 6, 2020, it was announced that the entire 2020/2021 COC theatre season was cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.

The island is mountainous, rising to over in the south. A long fjord, Perseverance Harbour, nearly bisects it, opening out to sea on the east coast. The island is listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The island is an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead Area Outside Territorial Authority, like all other outlying islands, other than the Solander Islands. It is the closest piece of land to the antipodal point of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, meaning that the furthest away city is Limerick, Ireland. Campbell Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Meteorological station at Beeman Cove (unmanned/automatic since 1995) Campbell Island was discovered in 1810 by Captain Frederick Hasselborough of the sealing brig Perseverance, which was owned by shipowner Robert Campbell's Sydney-based company Campbell & Co. (whence the island's name).The Antarctic Dictionary Captain Hasselborough was drowned on 4 November 1810 in Perseverance Harbour on the south of the island, along with a young woman and a boy. The island became a seal hunting base, and the seal population was almost totally eradicated. The first sealing boom was over by the mid-1810s. The second was a brief revival in the 1820s. The sealing era lasted from 1810 till 1912 during which time 49 vessels are recorded visiting for sealing purposes, one of which was lost off the coast.R.K. Headland, Historical Antarctic Sealing Industry, Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, 2018, p.166. The whaling boom extended here in the 1830s and '40s. In 1874, the island was visited by a French scientific expedition intending to view the transit of Venus. Much of the island's topography is named after aspects of, or people connected with, the expedition. In 1883 the American schooner Sarah W. Hunt, a whaler, was near Campbell Island. Twelve men in two small whaleboats headed for the island in terrible weather looking for seals. One of the boats disappeared, and the other boat with six men aboard managed to make it ashore. Sanford Miner, the captain of the Sarah W. Hunt, assumed all the whalers were lost, and sailed away to Lyttelton, New Zealand. Fortunately for the stranded whalers, a seal protection boat, the Kekeno, happened to arrive at the island, and rescued the castaways. The captain's behaviour caused an international scandal. In the late 19th century, the island became a pastoral lease. Sheep farming was undertaken from 1896 until the lease, along with the sheep and a small herd of cattle, was abandoned in 1931 because of the Great Depression.Ian S. Kerr, Campbell Island, a History, Wellington: A.H. & A.W. Reed,1976. In 1907, a group of scientists spent eight days on the island group surveying. The 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition conducted a magnetic survey and also took botanical, zoological and geological specimens. During World War II, a coastwatching station was operative at Tucker Cove at the north shore of Perseverance Harbour as part of the Cape Expedition program. Following the passage of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the island was officially altered to Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku. An amateur radio DXpedition organised by the Hellenic Amateur Radio Association of Australia visited Campbell Island during November‚ÄìDecember 2012. The team consisted of ten amateur radio operators from around the world, a NZ Department of Conservation Officer and the ship's crew of six including the captain on the sailing vessel \\"Evohe\\". The ZL9HR DXpedition team made 42,922 on-air contacts during an eight-day operating period.  Weather station  After World War II, the coast watching facilities were used as a meteorological station until the summer of 1958, when a new base was established at Beeman Cove, a few hundred metres further east. The new location provided improved exposure for the weather instruments, particularly wind recordings, and more modern accommodation for up to 12 full-time staff. The new meteorological station (WMO ID 93944) station at Beeman Cove was operated by the New Zealand government with ten full-time staff. Each team undertook 12-month expeditions to the island to undertake three hourly weather reports and twice daily radiosonde flights using hydrogen filled balloons. Weather reports were radioed back to New Zealand using HF radio to ZLW Wellington Radio. In addition to its primary purpose as a meteorological station, staff at the station also made measurements of the earth's magnetic field, the ionosphere, and aurora australis, and undertook Albatross banding and whale counts of primarily Southern Right Whales for the New Zealand Wildlife Service. In April 1992, staff of the weather station were snorkelling at Northwest Bay when one of them, Mike Fraser, was attacked by a great white shark some offshore from the beach at Middle Bay. Fraser managed to return to shore with the assistance of one of his team, Jacinda Amey, after suffering severe lacerations to both his arms. The team kept Fraser alive at the bay‚Äîsome from the main base‚Äîwhile a rescue helicopter from Taupo was called and made an emergency flight to the island to repatriate him to Invercargill Hospital. This was the longest ever single-engine helicopter rescue in the world. Jacinda Amey was awarded the New Zealand Cross‚Äîthe highest bravery medal for civilians‚Äîfor assisting the injured team member from the water.Recipients of the New Zealand Cross: Jacinda Margaret Amey ‚Äì date of act: 24 April 1992; year of award: 1999 The rescue helicopter pilot, John Funnell, was awarded the New Zealand Bravery Medal.Funnell, J.

In 1995, station staff were permanently withdrawn when the manual weather observation programme was replaced by an automated weather station, and the upper air soundings ceased. Today periodic visits to the island are undertaken by the Royal New Zealand Navy to maintain the weather station and transport conservation staff undertaking field research. Other visitors to the island include occasional summer time eco-tourism cruises. In May 2018, scientists in New Zealand documented what they believe is the largest wave ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere to date. The wave was measured by a weather buoy near the island. The legend of The Lady of the Heather The Lady of the Heather is the title of a romantic novel by Will Lawson. The novel is a mixture of facts and fiction elaborating on the incidents surrounding Captain Hasselburg's death on Campbell Island. The story is about a daughter of Bonnie Prince Charlie, exiled to Campbell Island after she is suspected of treachery to the Jacobite cause.\\"Tekeli-li\\" or Hollow Earth Lives: A Bibliography of Antarctic Fiction Her character was inspired by Elizabeth Farr.Tragic Drownings at Campbell Island, The Sealer's Shanty Farr was probably what would now be called a \\"ship girl\\", but the presence of a European woman at this remote place, and her death, gave rise to The Lady of the Heather story.Lawson, Will, The Lady of the Heather, Angus and Robertson Ltd., Sydney & London 1945 (First Edition Oswald-Sealy (NZ) Ltd., ) The accident happened when William Tucker was present on the Aurora. Tucker was another unusual character in the sealing era who became the source of a legend and a novel.Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784-1817, Dunedin: Port Daniel Press, 2005, , pp.73-75. The remoteness and striking appearance of the sealing grounds, whether on mainland New Zealand or the subantarctic islands, and the sealing era's early place in Australasia's European history, supply the elements for romance and legend which are generally absent in the area's colonial history. Climate Campbell Island has a maritime tundra climate (K√∂ppen ET). The island receives only 647 hours of bright sunshine annually and it can expect less than an hour's sunshine on 215 days (59%) of the year. The peaks of the island are frequently obscured by clouds.

Campbell Island also hosts numerous penguin species that breed on the island, including the yellow-eyed penguin, the rockhopper penguin, and the erect-crested penguin. Other albatross species breed on the island as well, such as the wandering albatross, the light-mantled sooty albatross, and both the Black-browed mollymawk and the grey-headed mollymawk. Other bird species that breed on the island include the sooty shearwater, the grey petrel, the white-chinned petrel, the endemic Campbell Island shag, the grey duck, the southern skua, the southern black-backed gull, the red-billed gull, the Antarctic tern, the song thrush, the Common blackbird, the Dunnock (Hedge sparrow), the New Zealand pipit, the white-eye, the lesser redpoll, the chaffinch, and the starling. =World's most remote tree= Campbell Island is home to what is believed to be the world's most remote tree - a solitary Sitka spruce, more than 100 years old.

The tree is believed to have been introduced by Lord Ranfurly between 1901 and 1907. The tree has been proposed as a golden spike signal marker for the start of the anthropocene epoch. =Conservation= In 1954, the island was gazetted as a nature reserve. Feral Campbell Island cattle were eliminated by about 1984 and feral Campbell Island sheep were culled during the 1970s and 1980s, with their eventual extermination in 1992. In 2001, brown rats (Norway rats) were eradicated from the island nearly 200 years after their introduction. This was the world's largest rat eradication programme. The island's rat-free status was confirmed in 2003. Since the eradication, vegetation and invertebrates have been recovering, seabirds have been returning and the Campbell teal, the world's rarest duck, has been reintroduced. An undescribed Cyanoramphus parakeet was discovered (in fossil bones) in 2004, along with evidence of a falcon or harrier.https://www.notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Holdaway%20et%20al.%202010.pdf Banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus) are also believed to have inhabited the island at one point. Other native landbirds include the New Zealand pipit and the Campbell snipe, a race of the Subantarctic snipe, Coenocorypha aucklandica, described race perseverance. It was discovered only in 1997 on a tiny rat-free island off the south coast, Jacqeumart Island. The snipe had survived there and began recolonising the main island after the rats had been removed. Marine mammals have shown gradual recovery in the past decades. Sea lions and southern elephant seals have begun to re-colonize the island. Some southern right whales still come into bays in the winter to winter or calve most notably at Northwest Bay and Perseverance Harbour,http://tiamaexpeditions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2014-Campbell- Island-Southern-Right-Whale-Survey.pdf but in much smaller number than in the Auckland Islands. Historically, fin whales used to inhabit close to shore. The area is one of five subantarctic island groups designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.New Zealand Sub-Antarctic Islands - UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Geology  Campbell Island is an extinct volcanic cone that marine erosion has worn down into its present shape. The volcano has been extinct for some six million years and glacial ice cover prevented vegetation from growing on the island until approximately 15,000 years ago. Research During World War II, the New Zealand government had coastal watchers on the island with trained naturalists who made observations of the geology, flora, and fauna of Campbell Island. To mark the 200th anniversary of its discovery, the Campbell Island Bicentennial Expedition (CIBE) was undertaken from December 2010 to February 2011. The research expedition was the largest multidisciplinary expedition to the island in over 20 years, and aimed to document the island's human history, assess recovery of the island's flora and invertebrate fauna since the removal of sheep and the world's largest rat eradication programme, study the island's plentiful but little understood streams and characterise the unusual stream fauna, and reconstruct past environmental conditions and deduce long term climate change from tarn sediment cores. The expedition was run by the 50 Degrees South Trust, a charitable organisation established to further research and education on New Zealand's Subantarctic Islands, and to support the preservation and management of these World Heritage ecosystems. The expedition and the programme outputs can be followed at the CIBE website.

Touted as special event programming, the hour-long episode aired just before the Daytime Emmy Awards on June 23, 1992. Unlike other soaps, which also aired one-off specials at night, the Another World special followed existing storylines, in the hopes that viewers tuning in early for the Daytime Emmys would be intrigued with what they saw, and by extension, would watch the show in the afternoon. The universal theme was love, and the stories followed four existing (and popular) couples in the series. To appeal to many demographics, thirtyish couple Cass (Stephen Schnetzer) and Frankie (Alice Barrett) were featured, as well as twentysomethings Ryan and Vicky (Paul Michael Valley and Jensen Buchanan) and Jake and Paulina (Tom Eplin and Judi Evans Luciano). Teen supercouple Dean and Jenna (Ricky Paull Goldin and Alla Korot) received most of the story in the special episode, as a party was being thrown in honor of his new album. On the show, Dean was a budding singer, and an album was produced. One of his songs, Ladykiller, became wildly popular and was played on the Times Square Jumbotron in the special episode. Other stories revolved around Jake and Paulina seeking out a justice of the peace to get married, only to end up calling it off, while Ryan and Vicky fought their attraction to one another, only to give in to their desires at the end of the episode. The special brought in low ratings, ranking 78th out of 96 programs that week with a 6.1/11 rating/share, ranking a distant third in its timeslot, behind Full House (#11, 12.7/24) and Home Improvement (#3, 14.8/27) on ABC, and Rescue 911 (#14, 12.3/23) on CBS.http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1992/BC-1992-07-06.pdf Another AW nighttime special was not attempted, although its sister show, Days of Our Lives, produced more one-off episodes.

A staff facade from the 1904 World's Fair, the entrance to an entertainment concession on The Pike. Staff is chiefly made of powdered gypsum or plaster of Paris, with a little cement, glycerin, and dextrin, mixed with water until it is about as thick as molasses. When staff is cast in molds it can form any shape. To strengthen it coarse cloth or bagging, or fibers of hemp or jute, are put into the molds before casting. It becomes hard enough in about a half-hour to be removed and fastened on the building in construction. Staff may easily be bent, sawed, bored, or nailed. Its natural color is murky white, but it may be made to resemble any kind of stone. Staff was invented in France about 1876 and was used in the construction and ornamentation of the buildings of the Paris Expositions of 1878 and of 1889. It was also largely used in the construction of the buildings of the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, at the Omaha and Buffalo Expositions in 1898 and 1901, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and at later expositions and on temporary buildings of other kinds.

In each episode, Ray takes a one-day trip to an American, Canadian, or European city with only $40 US, to spend on food. While touring the city, she finds restaurants to go to (often based on local recommendations), and usually manages to fit three meals and some sort of snack or after-dinner drink into her small budget. The show premiered on April 1, 2002, five months after the debut of 30 Minute Meals, making it her second show on the Food Network. Some clips are sometimes used in Ray's later series, Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Another Food Network series, Giada's Weekend Getaways starring Giada De Laurentiis, is similar in format. In 2010, The Travel Channel began airing reruns of the show. As of 2013, the show is no longer in reruns on the Travel Channel. Details According to Ray, visiting a fast food restaurant, particularly those of national chains, is considered cheating (she says so explicitly in the Orlando episode). On occasion, smaller sit-down restaurant chains (such as Bahama Breeze in the Las Vegas episode, or Bongos in the South Beach episode) are visited. Generally, non-food items and non-food-related activities are not included in her budget. Ray always offers tips on what to see in the various cities, as well as hints on how to save money and find bargains while traveling. She also emphasizes researching whatever city she plans to visit through the Internet and asking the local citizens for their recommendations. Initially, Ray only used item prices against her $40 limit. She started including applicable taxes and tips during the first season. On occasion, she does go over budget; however, during her trips to Philadelphia and Arizona, she did so on purpose. Her cheapest day was in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003, when she spent just under $25 USD including taxes and tips (at the time, less than $40 Canadian, although she budgeted for $40 USD). On occasions, she has had to get creative to stay on-budget; for example, she accidentally blew half her budget on her second meal in her first Miami episode. The pilot, shot in Los Angeles, had a 12-hour limit, but subsequent episodes raised it to 24 hours. Usually episodes begin in the morning with breakfast, occasionally brunch. Episodes almost always feature four paid meals, but on at least one occasion, in the Research Triangle (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC), she did five meals. Also on rare occasion, only three meals are paid, and a fourth ends up being free. On only one occasion, in Antigua, she partook of a hotel's free Continental breakfast, but she still did four paid meals in that episode. On her first visit to Las Vegas during the first season, Ray began with dinner and stayed overnight, ending with breakfast. She did several episodes in Europe when the euro was still valued less than the U.S. dollar. She has not visited Europe since the U.S. dollar has fallen under the euro in value. She has also visited several island locales, including Bermuda and Antigua, both of which generally accept the U.S. dollar. Ray has occasionally drawn controversy when some meals end up calculating with less-than-traditional tips.

It was also the site of two Calvinistic Methodist colleges at different times; the first sponsored by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon (an English methodist leader) in the late eighteenth century; the second supported by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Connexion in the later nineteenth century. Teulu Trefeca Teulu Trefeca (the building is depicted here in 1860 when in use as a Calvinistic Methodist College) In 1752, Harris, who was born in Trefeca and was one of the foremost leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival, established a Christian community there known as Teulu Trefeca ('the Trefeca Family'), modelled on the Moravian Herrnhutt community of Count von Zinzendorf. John Wesley preached for Harris's 'family' when visiting Trevecca in August 1769 for the first anniversary of Trevecca College. The additions to Harris's family house were in an unusual neo-Gothic architectural style, one of the first examples in Wales, completed by 1772. Trevecca College (1768-1792) Trevecca College, 1768 In 1768, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, established a theological seminary in Trevecca. The remote site was chosen partly in order that Harris, the Countess's friend, could keep watch on the new institution for her. The opening of the college coincided with the expulsion from St Edmund Hall, Oxford of six students because of their alleged Methodist leanings.British History Online: The City of Cambridge: Theological Colleges Most of the six were sponsored by Lady Huntingdon to form part of the inaugural student body at her college. The use of the term 'college' set Trevecca apart from the Dissenting Academies, but was controversial in the mid-eighteenth century, implying some measure of equivalence with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Many students at Trevecca, however, were not of sufficient means to attend the ancient universities and, unlike an exclusively scholarly setting, and despite their isolated situation, studies at Trevecca were frequently interrupted by long preaching assignments around Britain. The college transferred to Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, in 1792.Dissenting Academies Online: The Countess of Huntingdon's College, Trevecka (1768-1791), accessed 3 April 2016 The building used is now a farmhouse (College Farm).

Thomas Charles, a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist had tried to arrange for taking over the Trevecca College buildings when the trustees of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion removed their seminary to Cheshunt in 1792; but the Bala revival broke out just at the time, and, when things grew quieter, other matters pressed for attention. A college had been mooted in 1816, but the intended tutor died suddenly, and the matter was for the time dropped. Candidates for the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Connexional ministry were compelled to shift for themselves until 1837, when Lewis Edwards (1809-1887) and David Charles (1812-1878) opened a school for young men at Bala. North and South alike adopted it as their college, the associations contributing a hundred guineas each towards the education of their students. In 1842, the South Wales Association opened a college at Trevecca in the old home of Howell Harris. The Rev. David Charles became principal of Trevecca (from 1842 to 1863), and the Rev. Lewis Edwards of Bala. After the death of Dr Lewis Edwards, Dr. Thomas Charles Edwards resigned the principalship of the University College at Aberystwyth to become head of Bala (1891), now a purely theological college, the students of which were sent to the university colleges for their classical training. In 1872, a Harris Memorial Chapel was added to Trefeca, designed by R. G. Thomas of Menai Bridge. The building is now Coleg Trefeca, a lay training centre for the Presbyterian Church of Wales. In 1905 David Davies of Llandinam, one of the leading laymen in the Connexion, offered a large building at Aberystwyth as a gift to the denomination for the purpose of uniting North and South in one theological college; but in the event of either association declining the proposal, the other was permitted to take possession, giving the association that should decline the option of joining at a later time. The Association of the South accepted, and that of the North declined, the offer; Trevecca College was turned into a preparatory school on the lines of a similar institution set up at Bala in 1891. In 1906 this became the United Theological College in Aberystwyth under its Principal Owen Prys.D.

The theatre was designed to seat 3,500 patrons, but after extensive renovations in the 1940s it now seats up to 2,765. Massey Hall and the more intimate Eaton Auditorium were the only substantial concert venues in Toronto before the 1982 opening of Roy Thomson Hall. Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on June 15, 1981. The Hall was closed in July 2018, as it started a two-year-long renovation, including a new seven-storey addition and two smaller concert rooms. History The idea for Massey Hall began with Hart Massey. The idea of Massey Music Hall began with Hart Massey, who wanted to build a music hall in order to fill the need for a secular meeting place where people from Toronto and area could meet and enjoy choral music not of a religious theme. Massey also wanted to construct the building in memory of his son Charles, who loved music. Massey also did not want the music hall to make large profits. He wanted both rich and poor to attend events. Ideally, once all expenses were paid, Massey wanted tickets for a season of lectures to sell for $1. The building was designed with a neoclassical facade, and features moorish arches that span the width of the interior hall. This interior was inspired by the Alhambra Palace in Spain as well as Louis Sullivan's Chicago Auditorium. The exterior neoclassical facade was a preference voiced from Lillian, Hart Massey's daughter. Designed by architect Sidney Badgley, Massey Hall was completed in 1894 at a cost of $152,390.75. Construction was financed by Hart Massey of Massey-Harris (later Massey Ferguson) holding company. The hall's debut concert was on June 14, 1894. The Albert Building, at 15 Shuter Street, was added as a janitorial residence in 1917, and later converted as backstage space.http://www.masseyhall.com/mh_history However, it will be demolished and replaced by a new addition during pending renovations in spite of potential historic value (featuring a two storey oriel window).http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=a401fcf074da4410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel;=f6a300ad867a0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD The exterior is Palladian architecture while the interior is Moorish Revival architecture. 10 years after the completion of construction, a pair of fire escape staircases were installed along the front face of the building. They were installed to deal with fire concerns of the building. These fire escapes are considered an iconic part of Massey Hall's exterior. At some point in its renovation history, three of the windows at the front of the venue were converted into doors, The doors at the front of the venue were painted red (from their earlier brown-gold colour), a large neon sign was hung above the main entrance, and notice boards listing upcoming acts were revamped on either side of those doors. Entrance of Massey Hall in August 2017. In 1933, the Massey Foundation undertook further renovations to the hall. It is currently used for a variety of events and is operated by the same corporation as Roy Thomson Hall. In 1994, to commemorate the hall's 100th anniversary, the basement was completely refurbished to include Centuries, a fully stocked bar. Prior to this addition, alcohol was not permitted in the hall. The decor of Centuries includes hundreds of photos of artists who have performed there over the years (largely collecting portraits of popular music stars since the eighties) including many autographs. Centuries has a capacity of 220 people, and often hosts CD release parties and post-show parties for the visiting artists. Roughly five years after Centuries was created, an additional bar in the balcony lounge was added.

Located downtown in the city's entertainment district, it is home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Opened in 1982, its circular architectural design exhibits a sloping and curvilinear glass exterior. It was designed by Canadian architects Arthur Erickson and Mathers and Haldenby. Itzhak Perlman acted as a special advisor to the architects on accessibility needs for disabled performers and guests. The hall seats 2,630 guests and features a pipe organ built by Canadian organ builders Gabriel Kney from London, Ontario. The hall was formerly known as The New Massey Hall during its construction and pre-construction phase. It acquired its official name on January 14, 1982, as thanks to the family of Roy Thomson (first Lord Thomson of Fleet and founder of the publishing empire Thomson Corporation), who had donated C$4.5 million to complete the fundraising efforts for the new hall. The hall was renovated over a period of six months in 2002, after years of complaints from musicians about the quality of its acoustics. Filmmaker Jeffery Klassen's 2005 film, Toronto Architecture, interviews Arthur Erickson about the structure. Erickson talks of the point of the grey structure being that of a container which people were to fill up with their own decorations. The pond was originally designed to be used as a skating rink in the winter. The building was influenced by Erickson's journeys in Japan and his relationship with the North American Aboriginals.Peter Oundjian conducts Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Roy Thomson Hall, June 2014 The hall is one of the main venues used by the Toronto International Film Festival, with many gala screenings held there each year including a festival-closing screening of the year's People's Choice Award winner.

The opposite effect is observed when large areas of color are placed adjacent to each other, resulting in color contrast. References * Albers, J.

The land on which it is located was a gift from the Government of Ontario. It is the home of the Canadian Opera Company (COC) and the National Ballet of Canada.\\"Xiao Nan Yu is heart-wrenching in National Ballet‚Äôs Onegin: review\\". Toronto Star, November 27, 2016. Michael Crabb. The building's modernist design by was created by Canadian firm Diamond and Schmitt Architects, headed by Jack Diamond. It was completed in 2006, and the interior design includes an unusual glass staircase. History In the 1980s, the Canadian Opera Company and financier Hal Jackman, president of the Ballet Opera House Corporation, had begun lobbying for a new building to replace the O'Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall). This building had housed the opera company for about 40 years. The company had also previously been housed in the Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street and the Elgin Theatre on Yonge Street.Eatock, Colin. \\"The COC builds its dream home,\\" Queen's Quarterly, vol 113, no 4, winter 2006. Earlier in the city's history, the Grand Opera House stood at Bay and Adelaide until it was demolished in 1927. =Bay Street proposal= In 1984, Ontario premier Bill Davis promised that a piece of provincially owned land at Bay Street and Wellesley Street would be the home for the new opera house. The lot was estimated to be worth some $75 million. A design competition was won by the postmodern project of Moshe Safdie.Photograph of Safdie's model In 1988, the project was approved and the existing stores and government offices on the site were demolished. After a new NDP provincial government under Bob Rae was elected in 1990, inheriting a large deficit because of a recession, the $311 million project was deemed excessively costly. The province was also dealing with the unexpectedly high $550 million cost of the SkyDome project. When the opera house corporation refused to modify the design to lower costs, the government withdrew its funding commitment two months after the election. In 1992, the province cancelled the project and the land was sold to developers. Two towers in the \\"Opera Place\\" development have been built on Bay Street, but as of June 2011, the rest of the property remains vacant. =University Avenue project= In 1997, the province allocated a parking lot, which previously housed offices for the Supreme Court of Ontario at Queen and University, for the project. The lot was valued at C$31 million, and the federal and provincial governments also pledged funding for a new more modest project that would cost about $130 million. The original plan called for a tower of offices and condominiums to be built by Olympia and York which would help fund the project. It would be further supplemented by a $20 million donation by Christopher Ondaatje. However, both Olympia and York and Ondaatje developed concerns about the project and withdrew. More importantly, the municipal government of Mel Lastman refused to provide any municipal funding. The project collapsed again in 2000. In 2002 the opera company under Richard Bradshaw issued an invitation in 2002 for designs. The company had secured a $20 million donation from the Four Seasons hotel chain in exchange for perpetual naming rights to the complex. Ten architectural firms submitted proposals and the modernist design by Canadian company Diamond and Schmitt Architects, headed by Jack Diamond, was selected. The complex took three years to construct at an estimated cost of $181 million. To provide wheelchair accessibility, elevator access to the concourse level of Osgoode subway station was integrated into the construction of the Centre. The Centre had its grand opening on 14 June 2006, with regularly scheduled performances commencing on 12 September 2006 with the inaugural production in the new opera house being Richard Wagner's epic tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung). Governor General Micha√´lle Jean and other prominent Canadians attended the event. Three complete Ring Cycles were performed in September 2006. R. Fraser Elliott Hall design R. Fraser Elliott Hall The five-tiered, horseshoe-shaped auditorium was modelled after European opera houses. Collaborating with Diamond Schmitt, New York-based theatre planning and design specialists Fisher Dachs Associates arranged the room‚Äôs geometry and seating configuration to bring each of the 2,000 seats, including tiered balconies, as close to the stage as possible while maintaining an unobstructed view. The acoustics were designed by Bob Essert of Sound Space Design and a team that included Aercoustics Engineering, Wilson Ihrig and Engineering Harmonics. The undulating back walls of the venue, which diffuse the sound throughout the auditorium by reflecting the sound waves back to the stage, account for about 90 percent of the audible sound for the audience. To prevent audience members from detecting specific sounds and vibrations including traffic noise, the rumble from the adjacent subway line and streetcar line, and even the sirens of the emergency vehicles rushing to the nearby hospitals, the theatre sits on 489 rubber insulating pads. Other design elements reflect historic performance halls, including the Roman Amphitheatre. Exterior The hall was constructed on a limited budget, using contrasting materials. The City Room glass walls, curtain walls held by steel fixtures, look out on University Ave and Queen Street. The east, south and north sides are clad in dark brick. Windows on the north side have a view of Osgoode Hall, but the exterior on that side is unadorned. On the west is the sidewalk extension City Room, which is transparent and which illuminates the street. The solid, massive eastern facade broken only by horizontal windows, in contrast, blends into its office building and brick surroundings, towards York Street. John Bentley Mays states in his 2006 Canadian Architect article that East wall is \\"unresponsive to the need of vitality on the street.\\" The southern, Richmond Street facade, also plain brick punctuated by dressing room windows, is opposite the Hilton Hotel. Architect Diamond defends his rather plain design, stating, \\"You do not make a city out of iconic pieces\\". Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre The Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre in the City Room links Rings 3 and 4. It provides seating for 100 patrons. During the season several concerts per week in a variety of genres are presented here.

The caption says, \\"The Hobble Skirt. 'What's that? It's the speed-limit skirt!, because a hobble skirt limits the wearer's stride. A hobble skirt was a skirt with a narrow enough hem to significantly impede the wearer's stride. It was called a \\"hobble skirt\\" for that very reason; it seemed to hobble any woman as she tried to walk around while wearing one. Hobble skirts were a short-lived fashion trend that peaked between 1908 and 1914. History Hobble skirt style, 1911 Journalist Marguerite Martyn drew this sketch of herself wearing a hobble skirt while interviewing millionaire Edward Howland Robinson Green in 1911, with a quotation from him. Long pencil skirts considered as a modern variation of the old hobble style The hobble skirt may have been inspired by one of the first women to fly in an airplane. At a 1908 Wright Brothers demonstration in Le Mans, France, Mrs. (Edith) Hart O. Berg asked for a ride and became the first American woman to fly as a passenger in an airplane, soaring for two minutes and seven seconds. She tied a rope securely around her skirt at her ankles to keep it from blowing in the wind during the flight. According to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, a French fashion designer was inspired by the way Mrs. Berg walked away from the aircraft with her skirt still tied and created the hobble skirt based on her ingenuity. The French fashion designer in the Berg story might have been Paul Poiret who claimed credit for the hobble skirt, but it is not clear whether the skirt was his invention or not. Skirts had been rapidly narrowing since the mid-1900s. Slim skirts were economical because they used less fabric. The hobble skirt became popular just as women were becoming more physically active. Hobble skirts inspired hundreds of cartoons and comic postcards. One series of comic post cards called it the \\"speed-limit skirt.\\" There were several reports of women competing in hobble skirt races as a joke. Boarding a streetcar in a hobble skirt was particularly difficult. In 1912, the New York Street Railway began running hobble skirt cars with no step up. Los Angeles introduced similar streetcars in 1913. Hobble skirts were directly responsible for several deaths. In 1910, a hobble-skirt-wearing woman was killed by a loose horse at a racetrack outside Paris. A year later, eighteen-year-old Ida Goyette stumbled on an Erie Canal bridge while wearing a hobble skirt, fell over the railing, and drowned. To prevent women from splitting their skirts, some women wore a fetter or tied their legs together at the knee. Some designers made alterations to the hobble skirt to allow for greater movement. Jeanne Paquin concealed pleats in her hobble skirts while other designers such as Lucile offered slit or wrap skirts. The hobble skirt trend began to decline in popularity at the beginning of World War I, as the skirt's limited mobility did not suit the wartime atmosphere.

Money market funds are managed with the goal of maintaining a highly stable asset value through liquid investments, while paying income to investors in the form of dividends. Although they are not insured against loss, actual losses have been quite rare in practice. Regulated in the United States under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and in Europe under Regulation 2017/1131, money market funds are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries.See Markus K. Brunnermeir,Deciphering the 2007-08 Liquidity and Credit Crunch, Journal of Economic Perspectives (May, 2008)(arguing that investment banks reliance on commercial paper and repo markets had increased over the last 3 years. This reliance is seen in the fact that 25% of assets purchased by investment banks had been funded through the repo market.) Explanation Money market funds seek to limit exposure to losses due to credit, market, and liquidity risks. Money market funds in the United States are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Rule 2a-7 of the act restricts the quality, maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds. Under this act, a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt, which matures in under 13 months. The portfolio must maintain a weighted average maturity (WAM) of 60 days or less and not invest more than 5% in any one issuer, except for government securities and repurchase agreements. Securities in which money markets may invest include commercial paper, repurchase agreements, short-term bonds and other money funds. Money market securities must be highly liquid and of the highest quality.  History  In 1971, Bruce R. Bent and Henry B. R. Brown established the first money market fund.Hershey, Robert D., Jr. \\"Overnight Mutual Funds for Surplus Assets\\", The New York Times, January 7, 1973. Accessed June 22, 2010. It was named the Reserve Fund and was offered to investors who were interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return. Several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years. Money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general, which until that time, were not widely utilized. Money market funds in the United States created a solution to the limitations of Regulation Q, which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at 5.25%. Thus, money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts. In the 1990s, bank interest rates in Japan were near zero for an extended period of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low. Money market funds in Europe have always had much lower levels of investments capital than in the United States or Japan. Regulations in the EU have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money market funds for short-term deposits. Breaking the buck Money market funds seek a stable net asset value, or NAV per share (which is generally $1.00 in the United States); they aim to never lose money. The $1.00 is maintained through the declaration of dividends to shareholders, typically daily, at an amount equal to the fund's net income. If a fund's NAV drops below $1.00, it is said that the fund \\"broke the buck\\". For SEC registered money funds, maintaining the $1.00 flat NAV is usually accomplished under a provision under Rule 2a-7 of the 40 Act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value, provided that certain conditions are maintained. One such condition involves a side-test calculation of the NAV that uses the market value of the fund's investments. The fund's published, amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than 1/2 cent per share, a comparison that is generally made weekly. If the variance does exceed $0.005 per share, the fund could be considered to have broken the buck, and regulators may force it into liquidation. Breaking the buck has rarely happened. Up to the 2008 financial crisis, only three money funds had broken the buck in the 37-year history of money funds. It is important to note that, while money market funds are typically managed in a fairly safe manner, there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund (by way of infusing capital to reimburse security losses) and avoid having the funds break the buck. This was done because the expected cost to the business from allowing the fund value to drop‚Äîin lost customers and reputation‚Äîwas greater than the amount needed to bail it out.See for instance Gould, Carol Insurance for Funds: Safety for Whom\\" , The New York Times, September 29, 1996 accessed June 13, 2011 and Deborah Brewster and Joanna Chung \\"Fear of money market funds 'breaking the buck'\\",The Financial Times, September 18, 2011 accessed June 13, 2011. The first money market mutual fund to break the buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. An argument has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years.\\"Is your Money Market Fund Safe?\\" , Changing Times, The Kiplinger Magazine, October 1981 accessed August 13, 2011. However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest \\"solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations\\". Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund \\"breaking the buck\\".\\"Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-5881\\", December 29, 1982 accessed August 13, 2011. The Community Bankers US Government Fund broke the buck in 1994, paying investors 96 cents per share. This was only the second failure in the then 23-year history of money funds and there were no further failures for 14 years. The fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities. As interest rates increased, these floating rate securities lost value. This fund was an institutional money fund, not a retail money fund, thus individuals were not directly affected. No further failures occurred until September 2008, a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds. However, as noted above, other failures were only averted by infusions of capital from the fund sponsors.Deborah Brewster and Joanna Chung \\"Fear of money market funds 'breaking the buck'\\",The Financial Times, September 18, 2011 accessed June 13, 2011. September 2008 Money market funds increasingly became important to the wholesale money market leading up to the crisis. Their purchases of asset- backed securities and large-scale funding of foreign banks' short-term U.S.-denominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace. The week of September 15, 2008, to September 19, 2008, was very turbulent for money funds and a key part of financial markets seizing up. =Events= On Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. On Tuesday, September 16, 2008, The Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck when its shares fell to 97 cents after writing off debt issued by Lehman Brothers. Continuing investor anxiety as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant redemptions from money funds in general, as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions. Through Wednesday, September 17, 2008, prime institutional funds saw substantial redemptions. Retail funds saw net inflows of $4 billion, for a net capital outflow from all funds of $169 billion to $3.4 trillion (5%). In response, on Friday, September 19, 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced an optional program to \\"insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund‚Äîboth retail and institutional‚Äîthat pays a fee to participate in the program\\". The insurance guaranteed that if a covered fund had broken the buck, it would have been restored to $1 NAV. The program was similar to the FDIC, in that it insured deposit-like holdings and sought to prevent runs on the bank. The guarantee was backed by assets of the Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund, up to a maximum of $50 billion. This program only covered assets invested in funds before September 19, 2008, and those who sold equities, for example, during the subsequent market crash and parked their assets in money funds, were at risk. The program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows, but drew criticism from banking organizations, including the Independent Community Bankers of America and American Bankers Association, who expected funds to drain out of bank deposits and into newly insured money funds, as these latter would combine higher yields with insurance. The guarantee program ended on September 18, 2009, with no losses and generated $1.2 billion in revenue from the participation fees. =Analysis= The crisis, which eventually became the catalyst for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, and do not have cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression. The drop in demand resulted in a \\"buyers strike\\", as money funds could not (because of redemptions) or would not (because of fear of redemptions) buy commercial paper, driving yields up dramatically: from around 2% the previous week to 8%, and funds put their money in Treasuries, driving their yields close to 0%. This is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities, and thus a money fund is a \\"virtual bank\\": the assets of money funds, while short term, nonetheless typically have maturities of several months, while investors can request redemption at any time, without waiting for obligations to come due. Thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions, the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale, depressing their sale price. An earlier crisis occurred in 2007‚Äì2008, where the demand for asset-backed commercial paper dropped, causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles. As a result of the events, the Reserve Fund liquidated, paying shareholders 99.1 cents per share.  Statistics  The Investment Company Institute reports statistics on money funds weekly as part of its mutual fund statistics, as part of its industry statistics, including total assets and net flows, both for institutional and retail funds. It also provides annual reports in the ICI Fact Book. At the end of 2011, there were 632 money market funds in operation,2012 INVESTMENT COMPANY FACT BOOK. Tables 37-39, Pages 170-172. Note: Data for funds that invest primarily in other mutual funds were excluded from the series. with total assets of nearly US$2.7 trillion. Of this $2.7 trillion, retail money market funds had $940 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Institutional funds had $1.75 trillion under management.  Types and size of money funds  In the United States, the fund industry and its largest trade organization, the Investment Company Institute, generally categorize money funds into the type of investment strategy: Prime, Treasury or Tax-exempt as well as distribution channel/investor: Institutional or Retail. = Prime money fund = A fund that invests generally in variable- rate debt and commercial paper of corporations and securities of the US government and agencies. Can be considered of any money fund that is not a Treasury or Tax-exempt fund. = Government and Treasury money funds = A Government money fund (as of the SEC's July 24, 2014 rule release) is one that invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are ‚Äúcollateralized fully‚Äù (i.e., collateralized by cash or government securities). A Treasury fund is a type of government money fund that invests in US Treasury Bills, Bonds and Notes. = Tax-exempt money fund = The fund invests primarily in obligations of state and local jurisdictions (\\"municipal securities\\") generally exempt from U.S. Federal Income Tax (and to some extent state income taxes). = Institutional money fund = Institutional money funds are high minimum investment, low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations, governments, or fiduciaries. They are often set up so that money is swept to them overnight from a company's main operating accounts. Large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country, but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund. = Retail money fund = Retail money funds are offered primarily to individuals. Retail money market funds hold roughly 33% of all money market fund assets. Fund yields are typically somewhat higher than bank savings accounts, but of course these are different products with differing risks (e.g., money fund accounts are not insured and are not deposit accounts). Since Retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than Institutional funds, their yields are generally lower than Institutional funds. SEC rule amendments released July 24, 2014, have 'improved' the definition of a Retail money fund to be one that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit its shareholders to natural persons. = Money fund sizes = Recent total net assets for the U.S. Fund industry are as follows: total net assets $2.6 trillion: $1.4 trillion in Prime money funds, $907 billion in Treasury money funds, $257 billion in Tax-exempt. Total Institutional assets outweigh Retail by roughly 2:1.The Investment Company Institute, Money Market Fund Assets, July 24, 2014. The largest institutional money fund is the JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund, with over US$100 billion in assets. Among the largest companies offering institutional money funds are BlackRock, Western Asset, Federated Investors, Bank of America, Dreyfus, AIM and Evergreen (Wachovia). The largest money market mutual fund is Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Nasdaq:VMFXX), with assets exceeding US$120 billion.https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/vmfxx The largest retail money fund providers include: Fidelity, Vanguard, and Schwab.  Similar investments  = Money market accounts = Banks in the United States offer savings and money market deposit accounts, but these should not be confused with money mutual funds. These bank accounts offer higher yields than traditional passbook savings accounts, but often with higher minimum balance requirements and limited transactions. A money market account may refer to a money market mutual fund, a bank money market deposit account (MMDA) or a brokerage sweep free credit balance. =Ultrashort bond funds= Ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds, similar to money market funds, that, as the name implies, invest in bonds with extremely short maturities. Unlike money market funds, however, there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort bond funds, unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. = Enhanced cash funds = Enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds, in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation, but which: * Invest in a wider variety of assets, and do not meet the restrictions of SEC Rule 2a-7; * Aim for higher returns; * Have less liquidity; * Do not aim as strongly for stable NAV. Enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds, but others in riskier, higher yielding, less liquid assets such as: * Lower-rated bonds; * Longer maturity; * Foreign currency‚Äìdenominated debt; * Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP); * Mortgage- backed securities (MBSs); * Structured investment vehicles (SIVs). In general, the NAV will stay close to $1, but is expected to fluctuate above and below, and will break the buck more often. Different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash ‚Äì some consider preservation of principal as paramount, and thus take few risks, while others see these as more bond-like, and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal. These are typically available only to institutional investors, not retail investors. The purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets, but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds ‚Äì to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash. That is, within one's asset allocation, one has a continuum between cash and long-term investments: * Cash ‚Äì most liquid and least risky, but low yielding; * Money markets / cash equivalents; * Enhanced cash; * Long-term bonds and other non- cash long-term investments ‚Äì least liquid and most risky, but highest yielding. Enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents. There are also funds which are billed as \\"money market funds\\", but are not 2a-7 funds (do not meet the requirements of the rule). In addition to 2a-7 eligible securities, these funds invest in Eurodollars and repos (repurchase agreements), which are similarly liquid and stable to 2a-7 eligible securities, but are not allowed under the regulations. Systemic risk and global regulatory reform = US Regulatory Reform = A deconstruction of the September 2008 events around money market funds, and the resulting fear, panic, contagion, classic bank run, emergency need for substantial external propping up, etc. revealed that the U.S. regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades. It has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system. To the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain, from borrower to lender, and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels, episodic financial crisis may be averted. In the 1970s, money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers. The funds provided a more direct link, with less overhead. Large banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Notably, the Fed is itself owned by the large private banks, and controls the overall supply of money in the United States. The OCC is housed within the Treasury Department, which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multi-trillion dollar debt of the U.S. government. The overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs. actual ongoing tax receipts. Unquestionably, the private banking industry, bank regulation, the national debt, and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected. Interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the Fed, and inflation (all else being equal) allows today's fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars. The third major bank regulator, designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing, with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself. They also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits. From the outset, money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the SEC as they appeared to be more like investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. deposits and loans (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC‚Äôs focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude. To many retail investors, money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits. Virtually all large money market funds offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual‚Äôs account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability. To illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds, a simplified example will help. Imagine only retail \\"depositors\\" on one end, and S&P; 500 corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other. The depositors assume: * Extremely short duration (60 days or less) * Extremely broad diversification (hundreds, if not thousands of positions) * Very high grade investments. After 10‚Äì20 years of stability the ‚Äúdepositors‚Äù here assume safety, and move all cash to money markets, enjoying the higher interest rates. On the borrowing end, after 10‚Äì20 years, the S&P; 500 corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, which are very stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis. Over time, money market fund \\"depositors\\" felt more and more secure, and not really at risk. Likewise, on the other end, corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper. Using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets. This expands credit. It‚Äôs also over time clearly long-term borrowing on one end, funded by an on-demand depositor on the other, with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between. In the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the U.S. financial industry regulators. A step along this line has been the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past, as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above, fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators. Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made. A second solution, more focused on money market funds directly, is to re-regulate them to address the common misunderstandings, and to ensure that money market \\"depositors\\", who enjoy greater interest rates, thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking. These risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants, and various other substantial systemic risks factors. One solution is to report to money market ‚Äúdepositors‚Äù the actual, floating net asset value. This disclosure has come under strong opposition by Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as others. The SEC would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds, however to date the SEC has been internally politically gridlocked. The SEC is controlled by five commissioners, no more than three of which may be the same political party. They are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry, and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation. As such, the SEC is not concerned over overall credit extension, money supply, or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation. As the SEC was gridlocked, the Financial Stability Oversight Council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the SEC doesn‚Äôt button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis. The SEC has argued vociferously that this is \\"their area\\" and FSOC should back off and let them handle it, a viewpoint shared by four former SEC Chairmen Roderick Hills, David Ruder, Richard Breeden, and Harvey Pitt, and two former commissioners Roel Campos and Paul S. Atkins. = US Reform: SEC Rule Amendments released July 24, 2014 = The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued final rules that are designed to address money funds‚Äô susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. There are several key components: Floating NAV required of institutional non-government money funds The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable NAV, i.e., they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market value-based or \\"floating\\" NAV, rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000). Fees and gates The SEC is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund‚Äôs weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and/or to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to \\"gate\\" funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund‚Äôs weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund‚Äôs board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. Other provisions In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Additionally, stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10%. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.Securities and Exchange Commission: Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2014/33-9616.pdf = EU Regulatory Reform = In parallel with the US Reform, the EU completed drafting of a similar regulation for the money market fund product. On 30th June 2017, Regulation (EU) 2017/1131 for money market funds was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, introducing new rules for MMFs domiciled, managed or marketed in the European Union. This entered into effect in March 2019. The regulation introduces four new categories of fund structures for MMFs: * Public Debt Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMFs are short-term MMFs. Funds must invest 99.5% in government assets. Units in the fund are purchased or redeemed at a constant price rounded to the nearest percentage point. * Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMFs are short-term MMFs. Funds around are purchased or redeemed at a constant price so long as the value of the underlying assets do not deviate by more than 0.2% (20bps) from par (i.e. 1.00). * Short Term Variable NAV ‚Äì Short-term Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) MMFs are primarily invested in money market instruments, deposits and other MMFs. Funds are subject to looser liquidity rules than Public Debt CNAV and LVNAV funds. Units in the funds are purchased or redeemed at a variable price calculated to the equivalent of at least four significant figures (e.g. 10,000.00). * Standard Variable NAV VNAV‚Äì Standard MMFs must be VNAV funds. Funds are primarily invested in money market instruments, deposits and other short-term assets. Funds are subject to looser liquidity rules than Public Debt CNAV and LVNAV funds AND may invest in assets of much longer maturity. Units in the funds are purchased or redeemed at a variable price calculated to the equivalent of at least four significant figures (e.g. 10,000.00). Although the starting products were similar, there are now considerable differences between US and EU MMFs. Whilst EU MMF investors mostly moved to successor fund types, investors in US MMFs undertook a huge and persisting switch from Prime into Government MMF. The EU MMF Regulation does not make any reference to either fund or portfolio external credit rating requirements. Throughout the transition EU MMFs overwhelmingly retained their existing ratings, and the credit rating agencies have confirmed their commitment to the MMF-specific rating criteria they each maintain. A major difference in scope is that, on a like-for-like basis, US MMFs may be compared only to EU short-term MMFs.

The building opened as the O'Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960, and it has hosted a variety of international attractions and stars. From 1996 to 2007, the building was known as the Hummingbird Centre for the Performing Arts. From 2007 to 2019, it was known as the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts. On September 15, 2019, it was re-branded as Meridian Hall. The theatre, designated a heritage building by the City of Toronto government,Watkiss, Ulli S., comp. O'Keefe Centre. Rep. Toronto, 2008. 1 Front Street East O'Keefe Centre. City of Toronto, 25 June 2008. underwent renovations to restore its iconic features such as the marquee canopy and York Wilson's lobby mural, The Seven Lively Arts. Restoration of the wood, brass and marble that were hallmarks of the original facility was undertaken, along with audience seating, flooring upgrades, new washrooms and reconfigured lobby spaces. Following two years of renovations and restoration work, the building reopened its doors on October 1, 2010, fifty years to the date of the first opening night performance. History The Centre was built on land formerly occupied by a series of commercial buildings, including the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company, and previously it was the site of the Great Western Railway Terminal (later the Toronto Wholesale Fruit Market). Motorcade for Elizabeth II passes the performing arts venue still under construction, 1959 The idea for a performing arts centre that could serve the needs of an increasingly dynamic city predates the building's opening by almost 20 years. In the mid-1940s, Nathan Phillips issued a challenge to Toronto industrialists to underwrite the cost of a multipurpose centre for theatre, music and dance. Response to Phillips' challenge was not immediate. E.P. Taylor, the racehorse-loving head of Canadian Breweries, which owned O'Keefe Brewing, offered in early 1955 to build a performing arts centre that would not only serve the needs of local institutions but increase the diversity of entertainment options available in Toronto. Toronto City Council immediately accepted the proposal in principle, but not until 1958 was the project finally approved to be built. Among others, United Church spokesmen opposed money from the sale of beer to be used for community development. Taylor assigned one of his key executives, Hugh Walker, to oversee building what was to be known as the O'Keefe Centre during its first 36 years. Opening night of the O'Keefe Centre in October 1960 The O'Keefe Centre opened on October 1, 1960, with a red-carpet gala. The first production was Alexander H. Cohen's production of the pre-Broadway premiere of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot, starring Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. Camelot was followed by musical productions featuring such artists as Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Angela Lansbury, Alfred Drake, Yul Brynner, Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Katharine Hepburn and Rudolf Nureyev. Popular artists including Bob Dylan, Janet Jackson, Steve Earle, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Lou Reed, Elton John and bands such as The Who, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, The Carpenters, The Clash and Beastie Boys played concerts at the performing arts venue. Other artists who have performed on the arts venue's stage in a range of solo shows, revues and jazz spectaculars include: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Marlene Dietrich, Diana Ross, Anne Murray, Tom Jones, Danny Kaye, Judy Garland, Sammy Davis, Jr., Bill Cosby, Jack Benny, Liza Minnelli and Liberace. The venue has also played host to several large-scale ballet and dance performances. The National Ballet of Canada held seasonal performances at the venue from 1964 to 2006. The venue has also seen frequent visits by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. The venue has also welcomed a diverse range of international dance companies such as Les Ballets Africains, Britain's Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Ballet, the National Ballet of Cuba, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ballet Folklorico of Mexico, as well as the Kirov and Bolshoi Ballet companies from Russia. It was during a 1974 Bolshoi visit that a young Mikhail Baryshnikov defected from Soviet Russia by escaping the venue into a waiting getaway car, aided by later Jim Peterson and businessman Tim Stewart.\\"Baryshnikov‚Äôs defection is one for the books,\\" Martin Knelman, The Toronto Star, 5 October 2010. Like The National Ballet, The Canadian Opera Company also made the Centre its home stage, from as early as 1961 to 2006. Many of Canada's greatest singers, as well as a host of international opera stars, have performed for Centre audiences in COC productions. In addition, although touring opera is now rare, in earlier days the performing arts venue played host to The Met and to such towering voices as those of Birgit Nilsson, Pl√°cido Domingo and Renata Scotto. Signage for the performing arts venue from in 2007. From 1996 to 2007, the centre was known as the Hummingbird Centre. In early February 1996, the building was renamed the Hummingbird Centre in recognition of a major gift from a Canadian software company, Hummingbird Communications Ltd. The $5-million donation allowed the Centre to undertake a number of capital improvements and repairs, among them the installation of an elevator and an acoustic reinforcement system for the auditorium. In September 2007, Sony bought the naming rights to the Centre for $10-million, and a 10-year partnership was born. When the Ballet and Opera moved to the Four Seasons Centre in 2006, it meant a more open programming schedule. This has allowed the Centre to place even greater emphasis on being an important community resource, where people from all backgrounds can gather to share their distinct and vibrant cultures. Notable performances that reflect this mandate include the Last Empress with its dramatic, musical portrayal of an important figure in Korean history, the Virsky Ukrainian Dance Company, South Africa's Soweto Gospel Choir, Shaolin Warriors, Ricky Cheng, David Rudder & Friends and Club Tropicana. In 2006, the performing arts venue received approval from the City of Toronto for the development of a high-rise condominium building beside the Centre. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind (who also designed the Crystal addition to the Royal Ontario Museum), the L Tower was built on the southwest corner of the property. The Sony Centre closed on 26 June 2008 to begin the theatre renovations, which were unveiled on October 1, 2010. In June 2012, the Sony Centre hosted the Canadian premiere of the Philip Glass/Robert Wilson opera Einstein on the Beach. On 21 January, it was announced that the municipal government of Toronto entered into a C$30.75 million 15-year partnership with Meridian Credit Union, re-branding the Sony Centre into Meridian Hall, and the Toronto Centre for the Arts into the Meridian Arts Centre. The arts venues formally adopted their new names on September 15, 2019.  Architecture  The centre's foyer features a mural by York Wilson Designed by Peter Dickinson, the performing arts venue is a distinctive building and an example of a mid-twentieth century Modern performing arts venue. It is four storeys high and is broken up into three main forms: the entrance block, auditorium and fly tower. The central form of the building is highly symmetrical with an open floor plan. Structurally, the performing arts venue is not overcomplicated and uses steel trusses and concrete to hold the majority of the building together. In addition to the structure, the performing arts venue's auditorium houses a very sophisticated acoustic system, which gives the audience the sense that the sound is surrounding them (Canadian Architect 18). When it comes to materiality, the majority of the original materials are still in the building today. Materials used include: Alabama limestone, glazing, granite, copper, bronze, Carrara marble, carpet, cherry plywood panels and Brazilian Rosewood. The performing arts venue is very diverse with its range of materials and employs them in such a way that they are not overshadowed by the unique forms of the building. The interior also features a grand double-height foyer with coffered ceilings, a wide mural by the famous Toronto-born artist York Wilson, cantilevering staircases that appear to be floating, bright bronze auditorium doors, and a fan-shaped auditorium with a huge curving balcony.

It was born out of the hot rod culture of Southern California of the 1960s. In the early days of hot rodding, many fashions and styles developed. Over time, each of these distinct styles of customizing have blended and reshaped our everyday life. Artists such as Von Dutch (Kenny Howard), Robert Williams, and custom car builder Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth; along with Lyle Fisk, Dean Jeffries; hot rod and lowrider customizers such as the Barris Brothers (Sam and George Barris); along with numerous tattoo artists, automobile painters, and movies and television shows such as American Graffiti and The Munsters (The Munster Koach, DRAG-U-LA) have all helped to form what is known as Custom Culture. Custom Culture is usually identified with the greasers of the 1950s, the drag racers of the 1960s, and the lowriders of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Custom Culture are the Skinheads, mods and rockers of the 1960s, the punk rockers of the 1970s, the metal and rockabilly music, along with the scooterboys of the 1980s, and psychobilly of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop Mercurys, to custom Harley-Davidson and Triumph motorcycles, to metal-flake and black primer paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who is part of this automobile subculture. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kustom Kulture had taken on a rebirth of American subcultures from the 1950s and 1960s with DIY activities. Each style is distinct, and has its roots in American automobile history. Many styles that would not have tolerated each other in the past now come together in large car shows. Kustom Graphics The rebirth of Kustom Kulture has seen the use of the term ‚ÄúKustom Graphics‚Äù to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos.  Sweden and Finland  Swedish hot rodders with a 1960s American car at Power Big Meet Locals in these countries, influenced by American culture, have created a local hot rod culture which is vibrant in Sweden and Finland where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as Power Big Meet and clubs like Wheels and Wings in Varberg, Sweden have established themselves in Hot Rod culture. Since there is very little \\"vintage tin\\" the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or Volvo 240) rear axle, a small block V8, and fiberglass tub, but some have been built using for instance a Volvo Duett chassis. Because the Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle. Some 1950s and 1960s cars are also hot rodded, like Morris Minor, Ford Anglia, Volvo Amazon, Ford Cortina, '57 Chevy, to name but a few. These are known as custom cars (sometimes spelled Kustom).

When presented with an intense sound stimulus, the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles of the ossicles contract. The stapedius stiffens the ossicular chain by pulling the stapes (stirrup) of the middle ear away from the oval window of the cochlea and the tensor tympani muscle stiffens the ossicular chain by loading the tympanic membrane when it pulls the malleus (hammer) in toward the middle ear. The reflex decreases the transmission of vibrational energy to the cochlea, where it is converted into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain. Acoustic reflex threshold The acoustic reflex threshold (ART) is the sound pressure level (SPL) from which a sound stimulus with a given frequency will trigger the acoustic reflex. The ART is a function of sound pressure level and frequency. People with normal hearing have an acoustic reflex threshold (ART) around 70‚Äì100 dB SPL. People with conductive hearing loss (-i.e. bad transmission in the middle ear) may have a greater or absent acoustic reflex threshold. The acoustic reflex threshold is usually 10‚Äì20 dB below the discomfort threshold. However the discomfort threshold is not a relevant indicator of the harmfulness of a sound: industry workers tend to have a higher discomfort threshold, but the sound is just as harmful to their ears. The acoustic reflex threshold can be decreased by the simultaneous presentation of a second tone (facilitator). The facilitator tone can be presented to either ear. This facilitation effect tends to be greater when the facilitator tone has a frequency lower than the frequency of the elicitor (i.e. the sound used to trigger the acoustic reflex). Characteristics and effects * For most animals, the acoustic reflex is the contraction of both middle ear muscles: the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles. However in humans, the acoustic reflex only involves the contraction of the stapedius muscle, not the tensor tympani. * The contraction of the stapedius muscle occurs bilaterally in normal ears, no matter which ear was exposed to the loud sound stimulation. * The prevalence of bilateral acoustic reflexes in persons 18‚Äì30 years old is 85.3% (82.9%, 87.4%) 95th percentile confidence interval N = 3280 and in all persons 74.6% (73.2%, 75.9%) N = 15,106. * The acoustic reflex mostly protects against low frequency sounds. *When triggered by sounds 20 dB above the reflex threshold, the stapedius reflex decreases the intensity of the sound transmitted to the cochlea by around 15 dB. * The acoustic reflex is also invoked when a person vocalizes. In humans, the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex reduces sound intensities reaching the inner ear by approximately 20 decibels. The reflex is triggered in anticipation of the onset of vocalization. While the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex in humans results in an approximate 20 dB reduction in transduction to the inner ear, birds have a stronger stapedius reflex that is invoked just before the bird tweets.  Protection role The protection of the organ of Corti, provided by the acoustic reflex against excessive stimulation (especially that of the lower frequencies) has been demonstrated both in humans and animals. But this protection effect is limited. According to the article Significance of the stapedius reflex for the understanding of speech, the latency of contraction is only about 10ms, but maximum tension may not be reached for 100 ms or more. According to the article Le traumatisme acoustique, the latency of contraction is 150 ms with noise stimulus which SPL is at the threshold (ATR), and 25‚Äì35 ms at high sound pressure levels. Indeed, the amplitude of the contraction grows with the sound pressure level stimulus. Because of this latency, the acoustic reflex cannot protect against sudden intense noises. However, when several sudden intense noises are presented at a pace higher than 2‚Äì3 seconds of interval, the acoustic reflex is able to play a role against auditory fatigue. Thursday, April 23, 2020 Moreover, the full tension of the stapedius muscle cannot be maintained in response to continued stimulation. Indeed, the tension drops to about 50% of its maximum value after a few seconds. In damage risk criteria for exposure to impulse noise, the acoustic reflex is integral to the Auditory Hazard Assessment Algorithm for Humans model and the Integrated Cochlear Energy models. These two models estimate the response of the basilar membrane in response to an input stimulus and summate the vibration of the segments of the basilar membrane to predict the potential risk for hearing loss. The acoustic reflex can be activated before an impulse reaches the ear through an assumed conditioned response or it can be activated after the stimulus exceeds a specific level (e.g. 134 dB). Recent measurements of the acoustic reflex with a group of 50 subjects found that only 2 of the subjects exhibited any pre-activation of the reflex in the warned (countdown) or volitional control of the eliciting stimulus. Measurement Most of the time, the stapedius reflex is tested with tympanometry. The contraction of the stapedius muscle stiffens the middle-ear, thus decreasing middle-ear admittance; this can be measured thanks to tympanometry. The acoustic stapedius reflex can also be recorded by means of extratympanic manometry (ETM). The stapedial reflex can be measured with laser Doppler velocimetry. Jones et al. focused a laser on the light reflex of the manubrium in awake human subjects. The amplitude of a 500 Hz probe tone was used to monitor the vibrations of the tympanic membrane. Various elicitors were presented to the subjects: 1000 Hz tone-burst for 0.5 s at 100 dB SPL, recorded .22 caliber gunshot noise with a peak level of 110 dB SPL. The amplitude of the 500 Hz probe tone was reduced in response to the eliciting stimuli. Time constants for the rate of onset and recovery were measured to be about 113 ms for the tone and 60-69 ms for the gunshot recordings. Examples of the onset and recovery of the acoustic reflex measured with a 350x350pxAs the stapedius muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, a measurement of the reflex can be used to locate the injury on the nerve. If the injury is distal to the stapedius muscle, the reflex is still functional. A measurement of the reflex can also be used to suggest a retrocochlear lesion (e.g., vestibular schwannoma, acoustic neuroma). The acoustic reflex normally occurs only at relatively high intensities; contraction of middle ear muscles for quieter sounds can indicate ear dysfunction (e.g. tonic tensor tympani syndrome -TTTS). The pathway involved in the acoustic reflex is complex and can involve the ossicular chain (malleus, incus and stapes), the cochlea (organ of hearing), the auditory nerve, brain stem, facial nerve, superior olivary complex, and cochlear nucleus. Consequently, the absence of an acoustic reflex, by itself, may not be conclusive in identifying the source of the problem.

The presence of ongaonga (Urtica ferox), an endemic tree nettle, near the bottom entrance gives the cave its name. Until April 2010, when the nearby Ellis Basin cave system was found to be deeper, Nettlebed Cave was thought to be the deepest cave system in the southern hemisphere. It drops 889 metres below its upper entrance (Blizzard Pot) to its lower exit (the Pearse River resurgence), and its 24 kilometres of cave passages make it New Zealand's third longest cave. In January 2014 a group of cavers established that the Nettlebed Cave was connected to the Stormy Pot Cave. Exploration Nettlebed Cave was first explored by cavers in 1969 through the dry overflow passage of a large spring pouring into the Pearse River. By 1973 1.3 kilometres of passages had been mapped. It was not until 1979 that a flowstone squeeze known as the Hinkle-horn-honking-holes was passed, making further explorations possible. Five successive Christmas expeditions (1979-80 through 1983-84) utilising underground camps at Salvation Hall and Soft Rock Cafe led to the exploration and mapping of a further 20 kilometres. In 1986 another cave (Blizzard Pot) was connected with Nettlebed Cave, providing an upper entrance to the system, and made the overall depth 889m from the highest point in Blizzard Pot to the deepest point in Nettlebed Cave. The long-sought-after connection between Nettlebed and Stormy Pot was made from the Nettlebed side on the 29th February 2014, at the end of a week-long camp at Soft Rock Cafe. After a kerosene smoke test had previously indicated a likely point of connection, a team of four (Kieran McKay, Bruce Mutton, Gavin Holden, Jonathan Ravens) dug out the rubble from a choked, drafting, rift to reach the bottom of a small muddy shaft. A tight squeeze at the top of this climb was enlarged slightly with a rock hammer to emerge at the bottom of the urinal pitch for the Rover's Return bivvi (a low sandy passage used as a temporary campsite at one of Stormy Pot's further reaches) http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/9675130/Southern-hemispheres-deepest-cave- found. The team were extremely grateful for the NZSS policy of carrying out all solid human waste. The overall depth of the combined system (from the top entrance, Big Friendly Giant, to the deepest surveyed point in Nettlebed's Midas Chambers) was later confirmed as 1180m when an accurate GPS survey of the entrance locations was undertaken in December 2015. As of December 2019, the total surveyed length of Nettlebed/Stormy Pot is 47,969.7 metres. Pearse Resurgence The Pearse Resurgence is the source of the Pearse Stream, and is the resurgence point for all caves on Mt Arthur, including all water flowing in Nettlebed Cave (under normal water levels). This has been confirmed by positive dye tests from caves in the Ellis Basin to the south, from Windrift to the west, and from Nettlebed Cave itself. On 21 March 2007, a team of international cave divers set a New Zealand cave diving record by reaching a depth of 177m (581 feet below ground level) in the Pearse Resurgence.Dive New Zealand site \\" In 2011, divers reached depth, by placing four decompression habitats along the cave main tunnel, but were still unable to trace the source. During the 2014 Wet Mules diving expedition, the Pearse was dived to a record depth of -217m http://www.wetmules.com/home/pearse- resurgence/2014-pearse-resurgence-expedition.

Allen Road, also known as Allen Road and The Allen, is a short expressway and arterial road in Toronto, Ontario. It starts as a controlled- access expressway at Eglinton Avenue West, heading north to just south of Transit Road, then continues as an arterial road north to Kennard Avenue, where it continues north as the northern portion of Dufferin Street. Allen Road is named after late Metro Toronto chairman William R. Allen and is maintained by the City of Toronto. Landmarks along the road include the Lawrence Heights housing project, Yorkdale Shopping Centre and Downsview Park (formerly CFB Downsview). A section of the Toronto subway Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity is located within its median from Eglinton Avenue to north of Wilson Avenue, and briefly runs parallel to it underground in the vicinity of Sheppard Avenue. The portion south of Sheppard Avenue was originally constructed as part of the Spadina Expressway project. The Spadina Expressway was a proposed north‚Äìsouth freeway, intended to connect downtown Toronto to the suburb of North York and to serve the Yorkdale Shopping Centre project. It was only partially built before being cancelled in 1971 due to public opposition. It was proposed in the mid-1950s as part of a network of freeways for Metro Toronto. Its cancellation prompted the cancellation of the rest of the network.  Route description  Allen Road, looking north from Glencairn Avenue. Allen Road at Eglinton Avenue West. A strip of land was purchased south of Eglinton by the City of Toronto, preventing the expressway from being extended. The road begins at Eglinton Avenue West with two separate signalized intersections with the street. The northbound lanes intersect with Eglinton to the east of Eglinton West station, and the two southbound lanes connect to Eglinton Avenue west of the station. The road proceeds north to Lawrence Avenue West as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of in the northerly direction until north of Eglinton Avenue. The tracks of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity are situated between the roadways. There is a subway station at Glencairn Avenue. The roadway and subway are situated in a cut-out section of land, with grass and trees on either side. The roadway intersects with Lawrence Avenue West with on- and off-ramps which are signalized. Lawrence West station and bus terminals are located between the two roadways. North from Lawrence Avenue, the roadway is six lanes, with a speed limit of . The Allen is connected to Yorkdale Road by on- and off-ramps. Yorkdale station is located between the two roadways and over the Yorkdale connecting ramps. For a short stretch, the Allen is eight lanes, the lanes connected to the Yorkdale Road exits. On either side of the road through this stretch concrete retaining walls were built on both sides. The interchange of the Allen and Highway 401 is a hybrid of the turbine and clover-stack. The Allen proceeds on bridges over the lanes of the 401, with ramps from the Allen to 401 passing overhead. The interchange also serves to connect Yorkdale Road with the 401. The exit from the northbound Allen to the 401 serves as a ramp to both directions of the 401, with two lanes proceeding north of the 401. Similarly, two lanes are provided southbound over the 401, and access from the eastbound and westbound 401 merges with the Allen south of Yorkdale Road. Access to Yorkdale Road from the eastbound 401 is provided at the partial Dufferin Street interchange to the west. The southbound ramp from the Allen to the eastbound 401 flies over the whole interchange and connects with the eastbound 401 collector lanes. The interchange is one of the few on Highway 401 that uses conventional light poles instead of high-mast lighting due to the nearby Downsview Airport. The subway is situated on bridges over the 401 between the northbound and southbound lanes. From north of the 401, the Allen is four or six lanes, passes over Wilson Avenue (with Wilson station being above the namesake avenue within Allen Road's median), and meets with Transit Road at a signalized intersection. The subway diverges from the route just north of Wilson Avenue, with a large subway yard and bus garage, known as Wilson Yard, to the west of the road. Just south of Transit Road, a partial interchange with Wilson Heights is provided. It was the former northern terminus of the road until 1982. North of Transit Road, Allen Road is an arterial road of four or six lanes, meeting Sheppard Avenue West at a signalized intersection. The subway line, now underground, returns to follow the road's alignment just south of Sheppard West station on the east side of the intersection, with the bus terminal being on the southeast corner of Sheppard. The line continues north of the road under a grass berm, then curves west to cross under it and leave the corridor. Allen Road's speed limit through this section is . It continues north, still maintaining the higher speed limit with signalized intersections at Rimrock and Kennard Avenue. The road becomes Dufferin Street north of Kennard Avenue.  History  = Spadina Expressway = The Spadina Expressway was a proposed expressway intended to run from north of Highway 401 into the downtown of Toronto via the Cedarvale and Nordheimer Ravines and Spadina Road. Various versions of the proposal showed it starting to the north of North York at today's highway 407, between Bathurst and Dufferin Streets. It then travelled south to meet highway 401 a half-mile east of Dufferin. It was cancelled due to public opposition, although not before the northern section was started and the expropriation of a number of homes. The interchange at the 401 evolved over time to a complex 26 bridge interchange, the most-complex in Ontario to that time. The Spadina was envisioned at first to provide access to the Yorkdale development from the 401, with a four-lane road. While the Spadina was being planned, the 401 highway was being developed into the present-day 12-lane highway and the Spadina was being revised to a six-lane highway to downtown, with a subway line in the middle. It cost $13 million in 1960s dollars to build, after being initially estimated to cost $1 million. From the 401 south to Eglinton, the roadway was to be in a trench, with the rapid-transit line in the middle. South of Eglinton, it continued into the Cedarvale Park below ground level. The route south of Eglinton was never built and several variations of the plan were proposed. Plans were initially for the road to be on the surface of the ravines and the subway below the surface, at least as far as Spadina Road with a tunnel under St. Michael's College north of St. Clair. Another plan projected the roadway to be completely underground also for this stretch, on top of the subway line. From Spadina Road south of St. Clair and further south, the roadway would be underground to Davenport Road, opening into an interchange on Davenport Road. The stretch from Davenport south was also not built. 'No highway' routes proposed rebuilding Spadina Road and Madison Avenue south to Bloor Street as arterial roads. The highway plan proposed a highway width from Spadina's west side to Madison's east side, in an exposed trench south to Bloor Street. If a Crosstown Expressway were to be built then the Davenport interchange might not have been built and a Crosstown interchange instead. Various proposals for the Spadina south of Bloor Street were made. The 1969 functional design proposed an express route in the centre of the Spadina Avenue, and parallel two-lane streets on either sides to provide access to the businesses. Other proposals included no highway south of Sussex Street, just north of Harbord.  1943‚Äì61: Planning for the route  Approved route of Spadina Expressway By the 1940s, urban development extended past the City of Toronto's borders. It was recognized within the planning department of the city that population growth would take place and that the farmlands outside of the City's border would be developed. In 1943, the City of Toronto Planning Board developed a plan for the area within a nine-mile radius of Yonge Street and Queen Street. It included a network of superhighways that included the Spadina Expressway. In November 1947, the Toronto City Planning Board presented a plan to the City of Toronto Civic Work Committee for two new arterial roads: one along the lakeshore running east-west and another running north-south to the west of downtown. The lakeshore route was at first abandoned, while the north-south route was approved. The Spadina Road project would be a new road from Front Street at the south, to St. Clair Avenue to the north, along the route of the existing Spadina Avenue and Spadina Road. The \\"jog\\" at Bloor Street connecting the two existing roads would be straightened, the existing Spadina Road widened, and a new cut of the Davenport Road escarpment would be made, taking the road to St. Clair Avenue. The proposal was added to the January 1, 1948, municipal election, where it was approved narrowly by the voters by a vote of 34,261 to 32,078. While the proposal was adopted, the narrow approval led councillors of the time to hold off on approval of construction. A proposal for a highway from the north-west to downtown was developed in 1949 by the Toronto and Suburban Planning Board, part of a plan for numerous expressways in the Toronto area, including the \\"Lakeshore Expressway\\" (the eventual Gardiner Expressway) and Don Valley Parkway highways. It was initially to be named \\"North West Drive\\", or \\"Spadina Road Extension\\". The route was laid out by two members of the board, future Metro chairman Fred Gardiner and James P. Maher, chairman of the Toronto Planning Board. The proposal died when York Township rejected the idea. When Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) was formed in 1954, one of its first priorities was highway building. Metro proposed building routes into and out of downtown, as well as encircle the downtown with an \\"expressway ring.\\" The routes of the Lakeshore and Don Valley expressways were less controversial and allowed to proceed, while others such as the Crosstown, Scarborough and Spadina Expressways were put off for further study. The other expressways planned to cut through developed areas, and were also considered to be needed less urgently. A parallel development to extend the provincial Highway 400 was proposed to the west, to connect to the Lakeshore Expressway in the area of Fort York. In 1959, the Spadina Expressway became part of the Metro official transportation plan. The original plan intended to connect a \\"Highway 403 bypass\\" in the vicinity of today's Highway 407 in the city of Vaughan south through the borough of North York, just east of Downsview airport, then south between Dufferin Street and Bathurst Street as far south of Eglinton. The highway would have gone into a ravine as far south as St. Clair Avenue through the borough of York. It would then enter Toronto proper, going directly south through the Annex neighbourhood, connecting to an east-west \\"Crosstown Expressway\\" south of Dupont Street, and ended at the intersection of Bloor Street and Spadina Avenue. Spadina Avenue would be reconstructed with express lanes in the middle all the way south to the waterfront. The project planned a rapid-transit line in conjunction with the expressway. It would operate above ground north of Eglinton Avenue, and travel underground south to connect at Spadina station of the Bloor-Danforth line. The above-ground section was situated between the lanes of the highway.  1961‚Äì62: Proposal and approval  The expressway was considered critical for the development of the planned $42 million CAD Yorkdale Shopping Centre, south-west of the Spadina-401 interchange. At one point, the Yorkdale development was under the threat of cancellation without the approval to proceed with the Spadina. Only after Metro Council formally approved the whole Spadina project in 1962, did the land owners T. Eaton Co. Limited and developers Webb and Knapp (Canada) Limited announce construction. The interchange of the 401 with today's William R. Allen Road has connections with the private roadways of Yorkdale. Estimates of the cost were first determined in 1961, of $65 million CAD, with construction to proceed from 1967 until 1970. At that time, Metro and Toronto were in discussions about the route south of Dupont Street, as to whether it would be an elevated highway or at ground level in that section. On December 12, 1961, Metro Council first approved the Spadina Expressway project, committing $5 million CAD in a 13‚Äì8 vote. This covered the cost of the first section from Highway 401 to Lawrence Avenue. At the same time Council put off approving the whole route and voted 19‚Äì2 to delete the Crosstown Expressway from the transportation plan. The plan proposed the most-complex highway interchange attempted in Ontario to that point. It covers . Opposition to the project started before construction began. In 1960, members of the Cedarvale Ratepayers Association disrupted meetings of the Metro Toronto Roads Committee discussing the project. York Township, which became the Borough of York, opposed the construction of the highway through its municipality, and through the York Township-owned Cedarvale Ravine, characterized as \\"the only park area west of Bathurst Street and north of St. Clair Avenue available to serve 100,000 citizens\\", and members of the Association proposed a study of the need for the expressway, and to suggest studying the route of Dufferin Street instead. The Roads Committee turned down their requests. York Township threatened to go to the Supreme Court of Canada to block Metro from taking their park. Metro Chairman Fred Gardiner opined, \\"I can't see how anyone would allow one of 13 municipalities to block an expressway.\\" As the route of the proposed Crosstown Expressway was being drawn up at the same time, neighbouring residents of Rosedale opposed the construction of the Crosstown Expressway intended to connect to the Spadina, through their neighbourhood. Routing of the Crosstown was proposed along Dupont Street in the area, although the City of Toronto proposed a routing north of the railway lines, closer to Davenport. The Crosstown would continue east through the Rosedale neighbourhood to connect to the Don Valley Parkway. In 1961, Metro Roads Committee held meetings to hear submissions on the routing of the expressway. Forest Hill Village objected to the proposed route of the expressway though the village, as the village would suffer \\"serious economic loss\\" according to Reeve Laurie Simonsky. The road and the interchange at Eglinton Avenue would require the demolition of 276 buildings and bisect the village. Forest Hill proposed a tunnel from the Cedarvale Ravine north, under Forest Hill. Gardiner, former reeve of Forest Hill, admitted that the project would be harmful to the village, \\"but there is urgent need for an expressway to serve the northwest Metro area\\" and that the route through the village was the only one that would allow the expressway to enter the Cedarvale Ravine. In June 1961, the section of the Spadina Expressway south of the Crosstown Expressway was cancelled. The Spadina would now terminate at an interchange with the Crosstown, and Spadina Road north of Bloor Street would be widened. This ended a dispute between the City of Toronto and Metro Toronto. Metro wanted to build an expressway through to the Gardiner, while the city wanted to build an expressway further west, in the vicinity of Christie Street, which would connect the Crosstown to the Gardiner. The plan to build down Spadina Avenue would have demolished 1 Spadina Crescent, in the centre of Spadina, just north of College Street. Opponents to the expressway started organizing. Ratepayers Associations banded together to object to the municipal expressway plan, forming the Coordinating Committee of Toronto Ratepayers Associations and the Metro Ratepayers Transportation Committee. The ratepayers objected to the $400 million CAD municipal expressway plan as expensive and \\"unleashing a torrent of private passenger vehicles into the city centre.\\" University of Toronto professor James Acland of the Rathnelly Residents Association spoke of the futility of combining rapid transit and expressways on one route. \\"They won't persuade anyone to park his car and take rapid transit when there is a wonderful expressway inviting him to drive downtown.\\" S. A. Hudson, president of the Lawrence Heights Ratepayer Association cited figures showing the roadway would carry 10,000 vehicles into the core at rush hour, requiring for parking alone. The group placed ads in newspapers prior to the December 12, 1961, vote of Metro Council on the Spadina and Crosstown expressways, urging the rejection of the plan. The pressure was partially effective as Council voted 19‚Äì2 to delete the Crosstown, but approved the first stage of the Spadina by 13‚Äì8, while putting off approval of the downtown route. The vote put the whole project in doubt. At the time the province paid for half of the cost of roadways, but it did not contribute to rapid transit. The province before approving any road funds for the project, wanted Council approval for the whole project, while the vote covered only the Lawrence to Highway 400 section, including the interchange. The province's transportation minister, William Goodfellow, wrote to Metro Council to state that since Metro had not voted to approve the whole project, that the province would not consider connecting Spadina with Highway 401. The vote to have Metro's Road Committee study the route south of Lawrence, led to the Roads Committee to hold public hearings. North York Council voted unanimously to fight for approval of the whole project. Councillor Irving Paisley blamed that downtown business interests were behind opposition to the project. \\"The whole scheme is being jeopardized by several organizations with political strings, local grievances or selfish aims.\\" Paisley organized a campaign to support the building of the project, together with the Yorkdale developer Webb and Knapp. Paisley himself wrote the submissions of 8 of the 25 North York ratepayer associations in favour of the project, including the submissions of some associations that were defunct. Employees of the Yorkdale developer started a letter-writing campaign, and Paisley and Webb and Knapp collaborated on submissions. Hearings heard deputations from more than 30 ratepayer associations. Strong support was heard from North York associations and opposition was mostly from York, Forest Hill and the City of Toronto associations. Opponents also proposed a $10 auto tax and $25 truck tax to pay for the cost of Metro expressways instead of paying the costs from property taxes and wanted Metro to finish the Gardiner and Don Valley expressways before starting any others. York Reeve William Saunders became a staunch opponent of the project, publicly announcing that York would fight the project in court. York's Cedarvale Park was in the path of the project and by law, the lands could not be taken by Metro without York's consent. The Roads Committee asked the Metro Legal Committee to look into proposing provincial legislation to get the lands. On February 19, 1962, Metro Roads Committed approved the whole project by a 5‚Äì1 vote, the only dissenter being future Toronto Mayor William Dennison. The meeting was picketed by opponents with signs proclaiming \\"Spadina Expressway No!\\", \\"Taxes at Critical Level\\" and \\"We are Watching How You Vote.\\" The committee also recommended removing the Crosstown from the plan. Metro Chairman William R. Allen, whom the road would ultimately be named after, spoke in favour of the project based on the rapid transit portion of the project, which included commuter parking lots at northern stations. \\"If this does not get the motorist out his vehicle and back to rapid transit, Metro Council cannot be blamed.\\" On March 6, 1962, the full Metro Council voted 14‚Äì8 to approve the whole project, with the Lawrence to 401 section to start construction in 1964. The approval would allow Metro to purchase lands for the project, but approval to actually construct the highway would not take place until the 1967 budget. By this time, opposition had developed on several points: * the high cost of the project, and the tax burden, * putting the highway through a section of Cedarvale Park, * building the Spadina will make the Crosstown inevitable, leading to further demolitions in the city, * property owners whose properties would be affected, * the addition of more cars to the downtown. Source: Globe and Mail editorial, March 9, 1962  1963‚Äì69: Construction  By 1963, costs had risen to over $73 million CAD for the plan. Metro, which was also constructing the Gardiner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway and Bloor-Danforth subway lines had fallen under the scrutiny of the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) over its spending. The OMB had to approve the 1963 budget before Metro could. The Spadina was separated from the 1963 budget, and the OMB held hearings into the project. In submissions to the OMB, the townships of Forest Hill and York again objected. CCTTRA, and the CCTRA noted its objections. Allan Ackman, of the Wellesley-Bloor Street ratepayers asked \\"what compensation is there for all the people will be exposed to the deadly poisonous clouds of fumes from the cars on it?\\" The Cedarvale ratepayers had obtained the advice of Lewis Mumford on matters of town planning and stated that the expressway was of no use without the cancelled Crosstown. Publisher Allan Perly objected to Yorkdale being such a beneficiary. The Deer Park ratepayers objected on the increases of taxation. The OMB upheld the Spadina project. The OMB stated in its decision that the \\"sectional interest must give way to the public need of the larger area.\\" On the issue of the ravine parklands, the OMB stated \\"The board should and does expect that any park land that may be lost to York Township as a result of this undertaking will be replaced, insofar as may be possible in the circumstances, by suitable alternative lands for that purpose.\\" Construction started in 1963 with the clearing of the route. The area north of Lawrence Avenue was open land. South of Lawrence, dozens of homes were demolished. Coinciding with the opening of the Yorkdale mall, an interim roadway was opened from Lawrence north to Yorkdale Road in 1964. In 1964, Metro released another transportation plan, which extended the Spadina south of Bloor, again requiring the demolition of homes south of Davenport. Toronto City Council adopted an Official Plan opposing the Crosstown Expressway and the Christie Expressway completely. Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs overruled the city, and modified the city's Plan to allow for the construction of both expressways.TPB, pg. 10 The City and Metro were now in disagreement. In 1966, the section from Lawrence Avenue north to Wilson Avenue opened. Construction then started on the section south to Eglinton Avenue. York Council had dropped its opposition to the expressway and made an agreement with Metro on the use of Cedarvale Park for the expressway. This agreement provided for the creation of of park lands in the Borough of York to replace the park lands lost to the expressway trench. This plan would have meant the expropriation of homes for the replacement lands and residents of York protested the plan to the Council. The cost of the expropriation plan was an estimated $4 million of construction, plus the loss of the assessment, while putting a cover over the roadway within the park would have cost $5 million. The opposition led Metro to agree to building the expressway within a tunnel under the park. As construction proceeded, opposition to the expressway grew among City of Toronto residents. In October 1969, the \\"Stop Spadina, Save Our City Co-ordinating Committee\\" (SSSOCCC) was formed, under the chairmanship of University of Toronto professor Alan Powell. The group was a coalition of students, academics, politicians, ratepayer groups and business people. Notable among the opposition was urban theorist Jane Jacobs, who moved to the Annex in 1969, fresh from a battle to stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway in New York City. Marshall McLuhan, too, was opposed to the expressway and said: \\"Toronto will commit suicide if it plunges the Spadina Expressway into its heart... our planners are 19th century men with a naive faith in an obsolete technology. In an age of software Metro planners treat people like hardware ‚Äî they haven't the faintest interest in the values of neighbourhoods or community. Their failure to learn from the mistakes of American cities will be ours too.\\"quoted in Nowlan and Nowlan, inside front cover In the 1969 civic election, three councilors were elected in Toronto on a platform of immediately ending Spadina construction: Ying Hope, William Kilborn and John Sewell.  1969‚Äì71: Review and cancellation  By 1969, all but $10 million of the approved $76 million was spent, completing the roadway only to Lawrence Avenue, and the road bed to Eglinton Avenue. Metro learned that the project would require a further $80 million for completion and halted construction and decided to review the project. The total cost of the project (including the rapid transit line) was now $237 million. A trench had been dug in Cedarvale Park, and Metro Roads and Traffic Commissioner Sam Cass attempted to commit Metro to construction south of Eglinton by arranging to call for tenders in building a tunnel in the park. The call, going against Metro Council's explicit instructions, was noticed only one day before they would be published. The call was cancelled by Metro Chairman Albert Campbell. SSSOCCC developed its public campaign. SSSOCCC produced a short film by McLuhan entitled \\"The Burning Would\\" explaining the reasons to stop the project while poking fun at expressway backers. SSSOCCC also held public lectures with Jacobs and started a petition campaign. SSSOCCC members David and Nadine Nowlan, professors at U of T released their book The Bad Trip, an economic analysis of the project and explanation of their opposition. Metro Council voted to apply to the OMB for permission to borrow the funds and requested that the OMB held hearings. OMB Hearings began on January 4, 1971. Opposition groups banded together under the banner of \\"The Spadina Review Corporation\\" and hired one of Canada's top trial lawyers, John Josiah \\"J. J.\\" Robinette, to plead their case. Metro presented its case based on technical studies showing the road was needed to manage expected traffic. Council was represented by its solicitor and its witnesses included Metro and City Commissioners and American transportation planner Alan Voorhees. Opposition groups based their case on the factors of noise, pollution, destruction of homes and the expected increase of traffic the roadway would cause. Their witnesses included Jack Fensterstock of the New York City Department of Air Resources,The Globe and Mail, 1971-01-21, James MacKenzie, \\"Pollution Predicted to be worse than New York's\\", Toronto.The Globe and Mail, 1971-01-22, James MacKenzie, \\"Monoxide level safe on present Spadina, expert tells OMB\\", Toronto. neighbourhood residents, as well as urban planners, economists and architects. No elected officials, nor the Metro chairman, appeared to defend or oppose the project. The Board held 16 days of hearings and gave its approval by a vote of 2‚Äì1, OMB chairman J. A. Kennedy dissenting, on February 17, 1971. The Corporation then proceeded to appeal directly to the provincial government cabinet. On June 3, 1971, the provincial government of Bill Davis withdrew its support, effectively killing the project. The province would support the new Spadina subway line extension only. Speaking in the Ontario Legislature, Davis said: > \\"If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the > Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a > transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good > place to stop.\\"Sewell, 1993 Toronto Mayor Dennison was shocked at the result. \\"It's shocking that a group who never at any time suggested workable alternative routes has successfully opposed something as important in the growth of Metro as was the Don Valley\\". Metro Toronto chairman Albert Campbell was incensed at the provincial government, stating, \\"It may mean that we will never build another expressway.\\"  Ramifications  The debate over the Spadina Expressway, and its eventual cancellation, is regarded as a watershed moment in local politics. Toronto City Council was changing at the time to oppose the \\"top- down\\" planning of the Metro government. A \\"Reform Era\\" in Toronto politics was beginning, which brought to Toronto City Hall David Crombie, John Sewell, Allan Sparrow and Colin Vaughan. This new council viewed the Metro government and its officials with suspicion as not being accountable to local residents. In the 1950s and 1960s, Metro and City Councils had pushed through numerous large projects in transportation, and housing. The impacts on the central neighbourhoods had been substantial and had led to grassroots organizing. Councillors Sewell and Vaughan came directly from the grassroots campaigns. According to Albert Rose in his study of Metro from 1953‚Äì1971, the cancellation of the project raised four issues that would affect Metro Council afterwards: * Who plans? ‚Äì Until this point, planning had been done by professional planners or Metro department heads based on technical issues, such as projected traffic congestion. Metro had not provided a policy for the planners to follow. * Role of the OMB in policy ‚Äì The OMB was in charge of approving capital borrowing, a consideration dating from the days of the Depression. In the case of the Spadina, it had had to decide on an issue far beyond approving whether a municipality could afford the project. * Role of the OMB in planning ‚Äì The OMB became an approver of land development disputes, which often pitted municipalities or residents or developers against each other. Was this an appropriate role for the OMB? * Role of the Metro chairman ‚Äì The Metro chairman did not appear at the OMB to defend the project at the OMB. Chairman Campbell took a neutral position on a very important project. Premier Davis called a provincial election not long after the decision, in October 1971. Davis' campaign strategy used the Spadina decision to differentiate his government from past Progressive Conservative governments. Davis, who was both attacked and lauded for the Spadina cancellation, was re- elected with increased support in Toronto. Davis would remain in power in Ontario until 1985, when he retired from politics. The cancellation marked the beginning of the end of construction of Metro's planned expressway network. Metro highway projects such as the Crosstown, Scarborough and Richview Expressways did not proceed. Other than extending the Allen Road, Metro Toronto did not build another expressway and erased the other expressways from its official plans. Metro would proceed in future years to complete the Spadina subway line, extend the Yonge Street line, and build the Sheppard subway line. In the opinion of critics, the move set \\"in motion a trend that has yet to abate: politicians overruling the painstaking work of urban and transportation planners\\". There is often a long line of vehicles in the southbound lanes from as far north as Lawrence Avenue queued to exit on Eglinton and often long lineups of cars on Eglinton trying to get on the Allen Road. In addition, the Spadina subway line, which is located within the median, has been criticized as the \\"worst place to put that route... The stations that serve the Allen Road corridor are among the most uninviting, unwalkable places in the city.\\" = 1971‚Äìpresent= At the time of cancellation in 1971, the expressway was paved to Lawrence Avenue, while the portion running further south to Eglinton Avenue had been graded only and was given the nickname the \\"Davis ditch\\". Traffic from and to the southerly end of the road at Lawrence spilled onto neighbourhood streets, as the activists predicted, especially onto Marlee Avenue. Esther Shiner, who lived near the Lawrence intersection, was elected to North York Council in 1973 on a platform to get the expressway completed to Eglinton Avenue. She headed the \\"Go Spadina\\" public campaign that was successful in persuading Metro, against the wishes of the City of Toronto, to pave the ditch and opened the road to Eglinton on September 8, 1976. In response, Davis made plans to transfer a strip of land south of Eglinton to the City of Toronto to block any further extension. Metro and the province ended their dispute in an agreement to build the Black Creek Drive arterial road, a southerly extension of Highway 400. Metro would transfer its Spadina lands south of Eglinton to the province, and the province would build Black Creek Drive south to Weston Road. Metro officials dragged their feet by attempting to get the buffer strip moved to Bathurst and St. Clair, enabling a possible future extension to Bathurst, and a widened Bathurst street, but the province threatened to simply expropriate the lands and the lands were turned over to the province in 1984. On February 7, 1985, on his final day in office, Davis delivered to the City of Toronto a wide strip of the land on the south side of Eglinton Avenue West at the Allen intersection, with a 99-year lease, blocking any possible extension to the south. Opponents such as Shiner had wanted the province to hold onto the land, hoping that a future premier would be willing to consider the highway. Shiner felt that \\"the expressway will be built, bit by bit, into the city\\". Shiner had received a $20 million estimate from Metro officials to extend Spadina as a four-lane south to Davenport. After the land transfer, North York Council made several attempts to get Premier David Peterson to reconsider Davis's actions, but he refused to meet Council representatives over the issue. Shiner attempted to get a Metro-wide plebiscite but failed. North York sponsored a telephone survey of Toronto residents to show support for extending the expressway, but a majority supported transit improvements instead. Shiner's attempts ended only when she died of cancer in 1987. Metro chairman Dennis Flynn and Metro planners still pushed for the completion as late as 1988, with the release of a traffic study of northwestern Metro that recommended extending the Spadina south, but Metro Council defeated further studies in a 14‚Äì12 vote on July 5, 1988. Another proponent left the scene that year as long-time Metro Commissioner of Roads and Traffic Sam Cass retired. The Spadina subway line was built in the median of the project right-of-way from Wilson to Eglinton. The route south of Eglinton follows the approximate route planned for later sections of the expressway, albeit underground. During the planning of the route, alternate routes directly south along Christie Street and south along Bathurst Street were also considered. After the use of the University section of the subway by Bloor‚ÄìDanforth trains was abandoned, the original route of the subway to connect with the St. George station was agreed upon. The University section of the Yonge line was made into a part-time route until the Spadina subway extension was built. After the cancellation of the Expressway in 1971, the subway's construction had not been started. Route studies occurred again, the original route was confirmed once more, and it proceeded to construction. It opened in 1978. In 1995, most of the 401‚ÄìAllen interchange overpasses were rehabilitated. The interchange was later modified from 2001 to 2004, when Ontario widened the westbound collectors to four lanes, eliminating the forced exit lane. In 1996, Metro Council voted to end the matter finally and sell the 112 expropriated properties south of Eglinton Avenue. The properties were appraised and sold at fair market value, offered first to their former owners. The proceeds were divided between Metro and Ontario, with Metro keeping two-thirds up to $30 million, and proceeds above $30 million split equally. One home purchased by Metro in 1967 for $50,000 had appreciated in value to $440,000 by 1997. During the 2010 Toronto mayoral election, Rocco Rossi proposed completing the expressway in a tunnel to meet the Gardiner Expressway. However, Rossi's position in favour of extending the expressway conflicted with the plans for the Lawrence Heights revitalization project. Later that week, after much criticism of Rossi by other candidates and the media, Rossi revised his position to one of \\"studying\\" building a tunnel. In 2012, the City of Toronto started an environment assessment of improvements to the Allen Road area. The study's goals included how to make Allen Road better for the people who travel on it and the communities that surround it. It said that \\"Continuing Allen Road south, similar to the original 1950s expressway plan, is not being considered an option.\\"Allen Road Study The City of Toronto In 2012, the City modified the Lawrence Avenue on- ramp to the northbound Allen, removing the right-turn channelization and one- lane merge into a two-lane on-ramp for both east and westbound traffic. The southbound Allen off-ramp to Lawrence Avenue was converted to two lanes, and the lanes were changed to one lane for each of left and right turns. =Chronology= The road opened in four phases: * Lawrence Avenue West to Yorkdale Road ‚Äì February 1964 * Lawrence Avenue West to Wilson Heights ‚Äì December 1966 * Lawrence Avenue West to Eglinton Avenue West ‚Äì September 8, 1976 * Clanton Park to Kennard ‚Äì 1982Toronto Expressways ‚Äì Transfer Points.

In September 2014, the City of Toronto released six options for the terms of reference for an environmental assessment. The options were as follows: # Maintain the roadway as is. # Maintain the roadway, make conditions for pedestrians easier, and enhance access to subway stations. # Make significant improvements to the corridor through the addition of HOV lanes, bike paths and pedestrian infrastructure. # Transform the roadway to a surface roadway. # Transform the roadway to a tunnel or deck. # Eliminate the roadway entirely and open up the space for other uses.

He is best known as the longtime host of Burke's Backyard, a lifestyle program produced by his wife's company CTC Productions which ran for 17 years from 1987 to late 2004 on the Nine Network. He was also responsible for the creation of garden makeover program Backyard Blitz, starring former colleague Jamie Durie. Career In 2004, Business Review Weekly listed Burke among its top 50 entertainers list, saying he earned an estimated A$7.2 million in 2004. Burke is a professional horticulturist and former board member of Landcare Australia and has been active in a number of other public roles. Burke spent 20 years working on his own home and garden. He has been an outspoken critic of numerous environmental advocacy groups. From July 2005 to late 2008, Burke was the Chair of the Australian Environment Foundation, a group that has links to the politically conservative Institute of Public Affairs. Burke was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 26 January 2010 for service to conservation and the environment through advisory roles, to the horticultural industry, and to the media as a television presenter. Burke appeared on A Current Affair in July 2015, with his wife Marea, discussing her health battles including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and breast cancer. Sexual misconduct allegations An investigation started when journalist Tracey Spicer announced on Twitter that she was investigating the sexual harassment by powerful men in the Australian entertainment industry. Spicer said \\"One name kept recurring - Don Burke\\". On 26 November 2017, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Sydney Morning Herald published a joint investigative piece containing claims that Burke had sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, and bullied women throughout his television career. The report quotes alleged female victims, as well as both female and male witnesses, including David Leckie the former head of the Nine Network, on which Burke's programs aired comparing Burke to American producer Harvey Weinstein. Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles, Tracey Spicer and Alison Branley received a Walkley Award for their investigation. Other former Channel Nine executives went \\"on the record\\" to comment on the allegations. Sam Chisholm said, \\"Don Burke was a disgrace because of his behaviour internally and externally. This precluded him from ever becoming a major star.\\" Peter Meakin said, \\"There was gossip about inappropriate language and he was incredibly demanding. If someone fell short of the mark, he would excoriate them. He was unforgiving.\\" In response to the allegations, Burke released a lengthy statement which said he was \\"deeply hurt and outraged at the false and defamatory claims\\" and suggested the \\"baseless\\" claims were from former employees who \\"bear grudges against me\\". Burke also stated that he has had a \\"life-long opposition to sexism and misogyny\\". Burke claimed to have self- diagnosed Asperger's Syndrome and, in a media interview following revelations about his alleged misconduct, said that these \\"genetic failings\\" were to blame for some of his conduct. In response, Autism Awareness Australia stated that Burke's claim was \\"beyond appalling\\" and \\"gobsmacking\\". In the following days, many celebrities came forward to recount their observations of Burke's sexist and offensive behaviour, including Susie O'Neill, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Di Morrissey, Debra Byrne, Tottie Goldsmith, Amity Dry and Mike Carlton.

It is located along the Scarborough Bluffs, south of Kingston Road, from Grey Abbey Trail in the east. History In early 18th century, Osterhout Log Cabin was built in Guildwood. The log cabin is one of Toronto's oldest buildings still standing. The Guild Inn in 1956, two years after it was acquired by Metropolitan Toronto. In 1914, the Guild Inn was opened. Initially a private residence, it later became an art colony, and a hotel. From 1941 to 1947, the inn was leased by the Government of Canada as a base for the Women's Royal Naval Service, HMCS Bytown II, and later a military hospital. After Metropolitan Toronto was formed in 1954, taxes on the Guild Inn property increased to the point that the owners Rosa and Spencer Clark decided to sell of their property, which became the basis for the Guildwood Village subdivision. The Clarks remained involved with the development of the subdivision, in its design and layout to preserve as many trees in the area as possible. Development started in 1957 with the famous \\"Avenue of Homes\\" display of upscale homes. The community introduced a number of new ideas in subdivision design, including winding roads and cul-de-sacs to reduce through traffic, and underground power and phone lines. \\"Rear-lot parks were modelled after English footpaths as walkways within the community.\\" The Clarks helped design the entrance gates to the subdivision. After most of Toronto's Stanley Barracks (New Fort York) was demolished in 1953, its gates were salvaged and re-erected at the entrance to Guildwood Village. These gates, now called the \\"Guildwood Gates\\" still provide a unique and grand entrance to the community at the corner of Kingston Road and Guildwood Parkway. Guild Park is famous for its historical architectural fragments from the fa√ßades of demolished buildings in Downtown Toronto. Just west of the Guild Inn is Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute.

The Guildwood Village flag can be seen flying in Guildwood Village from cars, store windows and residential flag poles. The flag has deep meaning in its symbols and colours. The four quadrants read Guild ‚Äì Wood ‚Äì Village ‚Äì on the Bluffs and represent Guildwood Village‚Äôs rich history of arts and culture, the abundant woods and green spaces, unique mid- century architecture, the Scarborough bluffs and a strong, vibrant Guildwood Village community. Education Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school situated in Guildwood. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular public school board that operates several schools in the neighbourhood, including one secondary school, Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute. In addition to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, TDSB also operates several elementary schools in Guildwood.

The drowned valley is an arm of Pelorus Sound / Te Hoiere, it runs for from the northeast to southwest, joining Pelorus Sound a quarter of the way down the latter's path to the Cook Strait. Queen Charlotte Sound, the largest sound in Marlborough, lies to the southeast, parallel to Kenepuru Sound. Some of the small side arms of the two sounds are only hundreds of metres apart, at Te Mahia Bay and Portage Bay, but are separated by a steep serrated range of hills. Not surprisingly, one of the settlements on this stretch of coast is called Portage, named for the simplest method of passing between the two sounds. Queen Charlotte Track runs along the ridge of hills between Kenepuru Sound and Queen Charlotte Sound. Early road development linking Picton with Kenepuru contributed to Kenepuru Sound being used as a holiday destination. Resorts and holiday houses are dotted along the coast and at Te Mahia Bay and Portage Bay. A sealed, but windy, narrow road leads along the southern shore of Kenepuru Sound all the way to Kenepuru Head.

It aired on KBS2 from July 7 to September 9, 2003 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. The series is the third installment of season-themed tetralogy Endless Love drama series directed by Yoon Seok-ho. It had an average viewership rating of 10.7% and reached a peak viewership of 11.6%. Plot Yoo Min-woo's (Song Seung-heon) first love was Seo Eun-hye (Shin Ae). However, Eun-hye gets into a car accident and dies. Without Min-woo's knowledge, her parents decide to donate her organs. Shim Hye-won (Son Ye-jin) has suffered from a possibly fatal heart disease ever since childhood. Miraculously, she finds that she will be obtaining a heart from a donor, the deceased Eun-hye. Suffering from the pain of losing his girlfriend, Min-woo goes to Italy to study, with the memories of Eun-hye still lingering in his heart. When he returns to Korea, fate takes a turn and brings Hye-won and Min-woo together. When the two first meet at the airport, Hye-won's heart (Eun-hye's heart) oddly beats faster when she is around Min-woo. Park Jung-jae (Ryu Jin) is Hye-won's fianc√©. Jung-jae's younger sister, Park Jung-ah (Han Ji-hye) meets Min-woo in Italy and falls for him. Meanwhile, Min-woo feels guilt towards Eun-hye, because his feelings of love are stirred once again as he keeps being around Hye-won. Coincidentally, Min-woo ends up being hired as the art director for Jung-jae's project \\"Summer Scent,\\" with Hye-won as their florist. Hiding their prior encounter in the forest, they awkwardly greet each other as if they'd never met. During the project, their fondness deepens, and Min-woo begins to \\"recognize\\" similarities between Eun-hye and Hye-won. Hye-won, on the other hand, believes it to be fate that her heart beats faster whenever Min-woo is near. Their fondness for each other soon triggers Jung-ah's and shortly thereafter, Jung- jae's suspicions. Jung-jae, however, chooses to turn a blind eye as he deeply loves Hye-won. It is then Hye-won's turn to be confused as to whether her feelings for Min-woo are true, or a physiological result of Eun-hye's past feelings for him. As a result, she decides to leave Min-woo, trying to cover up her feelings of guilt towards Jung-jae and Jung-ah. She returns to Jung- jae's side and agrees to marry him. To forget Hye-won, Min-woo decides to leave for Italy indefinitely, but only after seeing her one last time. At Hye- won's wedding, Min-woo casts one last glance at her and then leaves. With Min- woo near, Hye-won's heart once more signals his presence, and thus alerted, she sees Min-woo leaving. Desperately trying to catch Min-woo, Hye-won collapses. Min-woo rushes Hye-won to the hospital with Jung-jae arriving a little later. Jung-jae, angry at Min-woo for having caused Hye-won's collapse, tells him to leave for Italy but Min-woo agrees to leave only after Hye-won has regained consciousness. Soon, Hye-won wakes up and a deeply angered Jung- jae forbids Min-woo to see her, ordering him to leave on the spot. However, Min-woo agrees to leave only after Hye-won promises him to undergo heart surgery, for not having the operation would mean her certain demise. Soon after his arrival in Italy, Min-woo receives a letter notifying him that Hye- won died during the operation. Three years later, with memories of Hye-won in his heart, Min-woo returns to Korea as the manager of an Art Centre. During his absence, Hye-won has undergone a heart transplant after the initial surgery, and then traveled to the United States for another transplant. On his way up the steps to the Art Centre and on her way down after her delivery, they meet again. The abnormal beating of Hye-won's new heart signals Min-woo's presence to her, and thus once and for all, confirms their love for each other to be authentic.

In the , Calliope had a population of 3,438 people.  Geography  Calliope is near the 'cross-roads' of the Bruce Highway and the Dawson Highway in Central Queensland, SSW of the port city of Gladstone. Gladstone Monto Road (State Route 69) runs south from the Dawson Highway through the locality. Industries of the town and surrounds since that time have included gold mining, beef, timber, and more recently heavy industry (Aluminium, Coal, LNG), shipping and tourism. History Township, 1928 The town takes its name from the Calliope River, which in turn was named after HMS Calliope by the Governor of New South Wales, Charles Augustus FitzRoy, on 18 April 1854, after travelling from Sydney to Port Curtis on board that ship. Alluvial gold was mined in the area after its discovery in 1862. The following year Queensland's first goldfield was officially proclaimed. Calliope Post Office opened on 1 March 1864. Calliope State School opened on 2 September 1872. Booroom State School opened on 1911 and closed on 1939. Booroom is a parish west of Calliope. In the , Calliope had a population of 3,058 people. In the , Calliope had a population of 3,438 people. Local attractions The Calliope River Historical Village is situated on the banks of the Calliope River. Lake Awoonga resulted from the construction of a dam on the Boyne River. Lake Awoonga supplies water to the city of Gladstone, and Calliope and other townships in the region, as well as supplying the major industries for which the Gladstone region is known. Total capacity of Lake Awoonga is 777,000 megalitres (203,412,500,000 gallons). The catchment area contributing to the Lake is 2,240 square kilometres (864.87 square miles) and is surrounded by the Boyne, Dawes and Many Peaks Ranges. Lake Awoonga is home to a thriving array of native animals, several of which are of conservation significance. Two fauna species are listed as vulnerable: the yellow-bellied glider and the grey-headed flying fox. For the bird-watching enthusiast, Lake Awoonga is a paradise with more than 225 species or over 27% of Australia's bird species found in the region. The southern squatter pigeon is listed as vulnerable and of conservation significance, and twenty-seven species are listed on International Migratory Conservation Agreement lists.Dept of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts Migratory Species in Australia Lake Awoonga is arguably one of the most important near-coast bird refuges on the East Coast of Australia. View of Lake AwoongaThe Gladstone Area Water Board operates a fish hatchery which breeds barramundi and mangrove jack for release into Lake Awoonga. Barramundi over 20 kg (44.09 lbs) are regularly caught, and the heaviest caught by August 2008 weighed in at a hefty 36.5 kg (80.47 lbs). In addition, the mangrove jack breeding program has resulted in Lake Awoonga holding the largest stocks in Australia with over 13,000 released. Since 1996 over two and a half million barramundi fingerlings and 340,000 mullet fingerlings have been released into Lake Awoonga.Gladstone Area Water Board - Official Site Calliope has an 18-hole golf course with club and a bowls club. There are two pubs and an annual rodeo held each year. The town also has a swimming pool, racecourse, sports fields, Hazelbrook Park and a skateboard ramp. Recent years have seen the introduction of a child care centre, supermarket shopping, specialty stores, doctors surgeries and other essential services. A large number of new homes and town houses have been built in Calliope due to its proximity to Gladstone Port and associated industries such as LNG.Mayors reflect on council merger complications - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) Amenities Until 2008, Calliope was the council headquarters of the Calliope Shire which included Boyne Island, Tannum Sands, Ambrose, Mount Larcom and most of the industrial plants plus Awoonga dam. Calliope has now become one of the towns under the umbrella of the Gladstone Regional Council after the merger of the Calliope Shire Council and the former Gladstone City Council. GRC still maintain significant offices in Calliope. The Calliope Library is on Don Cameron Drive; it is operated by the Gladstone Regional Council. There is a Gladstone Regional Council administration centre at 5 Don Cameron Drive. Media: Calliope is serviced by Christian FM radio 87.6FM. The Calliope branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the CWA Hall at 2 Bloomfield Street.  Education  Calliope State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Stirrat Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 613 students with 48 teachers (41 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (16 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

The baffles is the area in the water directly behind a submarine or ship through which a hull-mounted sonar cannot hear. This blind spot is caused by the need to insulate the sonar array, commonly mounted near the bow, from the noise of the vessel's machinery. During the Cold War, one submarine would frequently attempt to follow another by hiding in its baffles. This led to the practice of \\"clearing the baffles\\", that is, turning to observe the blind spot and detect any followers. Related maneuvers included the \\"Crazy Ivan\\", a hard turn to clear the baffles and position the submarine to attack any followers, and \\"Angles and Dangles\\", a five-hour process of rapid direction and speed changes to ensure that all items aboard were properly secured for hard maneuvering and would not fall or shift suddenly, producing noise that the enemy could detect.Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage (New York: Harper Paperbacks, 2000), pp. 137, 144. The baffles-clearing maneuvers undertaken by Soviet Yankee-class submarines were dubbed \\"Yankee Doodles.\\"Sontag and Drew, Blind Man's Bluff, 130-139. Hiding in a sub's baffles is dangerous because of the risk of collision. Such tactics have fallen out of use since the advent of the towed- array sonar, which negates the baffles' blind spot. Background and etymology Since a sonar array is extremely sensitive to underwater sounds, it must be protected from the noise generated by machinery on the vessel on which the sonar is installed. Otherwise, its own noise would tend to drown out other sonar targets. To reduce noise, sound-attenuating material is placed between the sonar and the rest of the vessel. This makes the sonar much more effective, but causes a blind spot where this material is: as most hull- mounted sonars are located at the front of the vessel, the resulting blind spot is located directly behind the vessel. The term baffles is likely derived from a lesser used definition of the word itself, that of \\"a partition that prevents interference between sound waves in a loudspeaker.\\" In the instance of its usage in terminology pertaining to submarines, the definition can be expanded and slightly modified to, \\"an area behind the submarine that due to the cavitation and the wake left by the propulsion system impedes the ability for on-board sonar systems to accurately establish what, if anything, is behind the submarine.\\" Maneuvers related to the baffles =Clearing the Baffle Area= A submarine tracking another submarine can take advantage of its quarry's baffles to follow at a close distance without being detected. Periodically, a submarine will perform a maneuver called clearing baffles, in which the boat will turn left or right far enough to listen with the forward array sonar for a few minutes in the area that was previously blocked by the baffles. Good tactics require a submarine to clear baffles at irregular intervals and in different directions so that a pursuing submarine cannot predict when and how the next baffle-clearing maneuver will be made. When a submarine clears its baffles, a pursuing submarine must take measures to avoid detection by, or worse, collision with, the submarine ahead. In some cases, submarine commanders could choose to clear baffles by executing one or a series of hard turns in order to not only clear the baffles, but also be in a favorable position to attack the potentially following submarine. Such extreme maneuvers were more commonly used by Soviet Navy submarines during the Cold War than by other forces, leading to the maneuver's nickname: \\"Crazy Ivan\\". The \\"crazy\\" came from the danger such a maneuver posed to both submarines, first being detection of the following submarine, which was commonly avoided by stopping the engines and going to maximum silence, and secondly by collision, as the momentum of the pursuing boat could result in collision with the leading submarine. The sudden, unexpected nature of the maneuver led to the term being used in the English-speaking world. The term Crazy Ivan has sometimes separately been used to describe the possibility of a rogue Soviet leader committing to military action, typically in reference to a limited launch of ICBMs against the US, originating from the Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October. =Angles and Dangles= Although not specifically a baffle- clearing maneuver, the exercise known as \\"Angles and Dangles\\" (a series of random figure eights, sharp turns, and depth changes) is intended to eliminate the unintended self-noise which could occur during a baffle-clearing event. The exercise is executed at the start of a voyage, in order to determine if loose items aboard the submarine are properly rigged for sea; loose items can fall or shift position during the sudden maneuvers required during baffle clearing, making noise that could be detected by the opposing submarine. =Use of towed array sonars= Most present-day submarines and ships carry a towed array sonar: a sonar sensor mounted on a long tow cable streamed out behind the vessel. This detects acoustic energy in the area behind the ship, reducing the need for baffle-clearing maneuvers. One reason for this is that towed-array sonars typically have a different frequency response than hull- mounted sonar sensors.

The position has been abolished in almost all provinces in recent decades (Quebec in 1970, Ontario 1985, most recently by British Columbia in 2000); the exceptions are Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia,Nova Scotia Legislature Page listing the various Cabinet portfolios assigned in Nova Scotia. where it still exists but is no longer a senior portfolio. The position existed prior to Confederation in the Province of Canada (as well as in the previous provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada) and the various governments in Atlantic Canada under British rule, though in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island the title was colonial secretary. British Columbia also had a colonial secretary prior to becoming a province of Canada in 1871. Before the granting of responsible government and the emergence of the position of premier, the provincial secretary was the leading position in the executive councils appointed by the various governors and lieutenant-governors of British North America. Frequently, provincial secretaries during these periods were the most powerful elected representatives in their jurisdictions. The provincial secretary was the equivalent of the former Canadian Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Canada. Like its federal counterpart it included an eclectic variety of responsibilities that were not assigned to other ministers, most of which would eventually evolve into portfolios of their own. In Nova Scotia, where the position originated in 1720, the provincial secretary was also the treasurer of the province until 1946. The provincial secretary was also responsible for official communications between the provincial government and the Colonial Office in London as well as with other provincial and colonial governments (and after 1867 the federal government). As well, the position also included various duties related to ceremonial occasions, visits by dignitaries, protocol, relations between the government and the office of lieutenant-governor and commemorative events particularly in relation to the monarchy. Generally, the provincial secretary acted as a province's registrar-general and was responsible for formal documents and records such as licences, birth and death certificates, land registries and surveys, business registrations and writs. As well, the position was generally responsible for the administration of the civil service and of elections. Provincial secretaries were usually the most senior member of the provincial cabinet outside of the premier, and the office holder was often designated as acting premier when the premier was out of province, ill or otherwise unavailable. The position of provincial secretary was particularly important in Manitoba from 1870 to 1874, as that province's institutions were being established. The province had no premier during this period, and its lieutenant-governors acted as the de facto leaders of government. The early provincial secretaries (including Alfred Boyd and Henry Joseph Clarke) were the most prominent elected officials in the province, and are retroactively regarded as premiers in many modern sources. The provincial secretary continued to oversee miscellaneous government activities into the twentieth-century (Nova Scotia's Public Service Act conferred to the position responsibility for all matters not specifically assigned to any other minister). Frequently, twentieth-century provincial secretaries would concurrently hold other cabinet portfolios. Non-governmental In many organizations in Canada the provincial secretary is also the name of a senior officer at the provincial level. The Monarchist League of Canada, for instance, has provincial secretaries in various parts of the country who are primarily responsible for the organizing the league's activities in a specific province. In the provincial sections of the New Democratic Party, the provincial secretary is the senior administrative officer, and may be by title or function chief executive officer, of the non-parliamentary wing of the party and is responsible for organizing provincial conventions, provincial councils and other meetings, membership drives, fundraising and other day-to- day operations. As well, the provincial secretary usually has a senior role in administering the party's electoral campaigns.

Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, Hypostomus plecostomus, and are popular as aquarium fish. Common names Members of the family Loricariidae are commonly referred to as loricariids, suckermouth armoured catfishes, armoured catfish. The name \\"plecostomus\\", and its shortened forms \\"pleco\\" and \\"plec\\", are used for many Loricariidae, since Plecostomus plecostomus (now called Hypostomus plecostomus) was one of the first loricariid species imported for the fish-keeping hobby. Some loricariids are not normally considered \\"plecostomus\\", such as Farlowella catfish. In their native range, these fish are known as cascudos or acar√≠s. =L-numbers= Some types of loricariids are often referred to by their 'L-number'; this has been become common since imports of loricariid catfish from South America often included specimens that had not been taxonomically described. Currently, L-numbers are used not only by fish-keeping enthusiasts, but also by biologists, since they represent a useful stopgap until a new species of fish is given a full taxonomic name. In some cases, two different L-numbered catfish have turned out to be different populations of the same species, while in other cases, multiple (but superficially similar) species have all been traded under a single L-number. Taxonomy and evolution Because of their highly specialized morphology, loricariids have been recognized as a monophyletic assemblage in even the earliest classifications of the Siluriformes, meaning they consist of a natural grouping with a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Loricariidae is one of seven families in the superfamily Loricarioidea, along with Amphiliidae, Trichomycteridae, Nematogenyidae, Callichthyidae, Scoloplacidae, and Astroblepidae. Some of these families also exhibit suckermouths or armor, although never in the same individual, as in loricariids. This is the largest catfish family, including about 684 species in around 92 genera, with new species being described each year. However, this family is in flux, and revisions are likely. For example, the subfamily Ancistrinae is accepted as late as the 2006 edition of Nelson's Fishes of the World; it later becomes grouped as a tribe, because of its recognition as a sister group to the Pterygoplichthyini. Under Ambruster, six subfamilies are recognized: Delturinae, Hypoptopomatinae, Hypostominae, Lithogeneinae, Loricariinae, and Neoplecostominae. Monophyly for the family is strongly supported, except, possibly, the inclusion of Lithogenes. Lithogenes is the only genus within the subfamily Lithogeneinae. This genus and subfamily, the most basal group in Loricariidae, is the sister group to the rest of the family. Neoplecostominae are the most basal group among the loricariids with the exception of Lithogeneinae. However, the genera of Neoplecostominae do not appear to form a monophyletic assemblage. The two subfamilies Loricariinae and Hypoptopomatinae appear to be generally regarded as monophyletic. However, the monophyly and composition of the other subfamilies are currently being examined and will likely be altered substantially in the future. The Hypostominae are the largest subfamily of Loricariidae. It is made up of five tribes. Four of the five tribes, Corymbophanini, Hypostomini, Pterygoplichthyini, and Rhinelepini, include about 24 genera. The fifth and largest tribe, Ancistrini (formerly recognized as its own subfamily), includes 30 genera. Loricariid fossils are extremely rare. The fossil record of Loricariidae extends back to the upper Miocene. Within the superfamily Loricarioidea, the Loricariidae are the most derived; in this superfamily, the trend is toward increasingly complex jaw morphology, which may have allowed for the great diversification of the Loricariidae, which have the most advanced jaws. Distribution and habitat The family Loricariidae is vastly distributed over both the east and west sides of the Andes mountains, however, most species are generally restricted to small geographic ranges. They are primarily found in freshwater habitats of South America, but several loricariines and hypostomines are native to Panama, and two species (Fonchiiichthys uracanthus and Hemiancistrus aspidolepis) are native to Costa Rica. Species occur in swift-flowing streams from the lowlands up to in elevation. They can also be found in a variety of other freshwater environments. They can be found in torrential mountain rivers, quiet brackish estuaries, black acidic waters, and even in subterranean habitats. Description and biology This family has extremely variable color patterns and body shapes. Loricariids are characterized by bony plates covering their bodies, similar to the bony plates in callichthyids. (In Latin, lorica means corselet). These fish exhibit a ventral suckermouth, with papillae (small projections) on the lips. When present, the adipose fin usually has a spine at the forward edge. These fish have, when they are present, a unique pair of maxillary barbels. These fish have relatively long intestines due to their usually herbivorous or detrivorous diets. The body is characteristically flattened in this family. Taste buds cover almost the entire surface of the body and fin spines. Body lengths can range from in Nannoplecostomus eleonorae to over in Panaque, Acanthicus, and Pterygoplichthys. One of the most obvious characteristics of the loricariids is the suckermouth. The modified mouth and lips allow the fish to feed, breathe, and attach to the substrate through suction. The lips were once believed to be unable to function as a sucker while respiration continued, as the inflowing water would cause the system to fail; however, respiration and suction can function simultaneously. Inflowing water passing under the sucker is limited to a thin stream immediately behind each maxillary barbel; the maxillae in loricariids support only small maxillary barbels and are primarily used to mediate the lateral lip tissue in which they are embedded, preventing failure of suction during inspiration. To achieve suction, the fish presses its lips against the substrate and expands its oral cavity, causing negative pressure. Also, unlike most other catfishes, the premaxillae are highly mobile, and the lower jaws have evolved towards a medial position, with the teeth pointed rostroventrally; these are important evolutionary innovations. The fish rotates its lower and upper jaws to scrape the substrate. Of the two, the lower jaws are more mobile. Loricariid catfishes have evolved several modifications of their digestive tracts that function as accessory respiratory organs or hydrostatic organs. These complex structures would have been independently evolved a number of times within the family. This includes an enlarged stomach in the Pterygoplichthyini, Hypostomus, and Lithoxus, a U-shaped diverticulum in Rhinelepini, and a ring- like diverticulum in Otocinclus. It may be noted that even loricariids with unmodified stomachs have a slight ability to breathe air. Considerable sexual dimorphism occurs in this family, most pronounced during the breeding season. For example, in Loricariichthys, the male has a large expansion of its lower lip, which it uses to hold a clutch of eggs. Ancistrus males have snouts with fleshy tentacles. In loricariids, odontodes develop almost anywhere on the external surface of the body and first appear soon after hatching; odontodes appear in a variety of shapes and sizes and are often sexually dimorphic, being larger in breeding males. In most Ancistrini species, sharp evertible cheek spines (elongated odontodes) are often more developed in males and are used in intraspecific displays and combat. = Omega iris = The omega iris allows loricariids to adjust the amount of light that enters their eye. Unusual for bony fish, many species have a modified iris called an omega iris. The dorsal segment of the iris expands downward over the pupil to form a loop which can expand and contract, called an iris operculum; when light levels are high, the pupil reduces in diameter and the loop expands to cover the center of the pupil, giving rise to a crescent-shaped, light-transmitting partial pupil. This feature gets its name from its similarity to an upside-down uppercase Greek letter omega (Œ©). The origins of this structure are unknown, but breaking up the outline of the highly visible eye has been suggested to aid camouflage in what are often highly mottled animals. Species in the tribe Rhinelepini are an exceptional group among loricariids, having a circular iris. The presence or absence of the iris operculum can be used for identification of species in the subfamily Loricariinae. Genetics As of 2000, only 56 loricariid species have been cytogenically investigated. The basal diploid number of chromosomes is 2n = 54 in this family, but with a wide variation in the chromosome number in this fish group, ranging from 2n = 36 in the Loricariinae, Rineloricaria latirostris, to 2n = 96 in a species of Upsilodus (Hemipsilichthys). Most members of the Ancistrini and Pterygoplichthyini have 52 chromosomes. Karyotypic evolution by means of centric fusions and centric fissions seems to be a common feature among loricariids; this is demonstrated by a higher number of biarmed chromosomes in species with lower diploid number and many uniarmed chromosomes in species with higher diploid numbers. Studies conducted with representatives of some genera of Hypostominae showed, within this group, the diploid number ranges from 2n = 52 to 2n = 80. However, the supposed wide karyotypic diversity the family Loricariidae or the subfamily Hypostominae would present is almost exclusively restricted to the genus Hypostomus, and the species from the other genera had a conserved diploid number. In some species, there is a ZZ/ZW sex- determination system. Ecology Panaque nigrolineatus attached to a piece of wood The suckermouth exhibited by these catfish allows them to adhere to objects in their habitats, even in fast-flowing waters. The mouth and teeth also are adapted to feed on a variety of foods, such as algae, invertebrates, and detritus. Some species, notably the Panaque, are known for xylophagy, or the ability to digest wood. Most species of loricariids are nocturnal animals. Some species are territorial, while others, such as Otocinclus, prefer to live in groups. Air-breathing is well known among many loricariids; this ability is dependent on the risk of hypoxia faced by a species; torrent-dwelling species tend to have no ability to breathe air, while low-land, pool-dwelling species, such as those of Hypostomus, have a great ability to breathe air. Pterygoplichthys is known for being kept out of water and sold alive in fish markets, surviving up to 30 hours out of water. Loricariids are facultative air breathers; they will only breathe air if under stress and will only use their gills in situations when oxygen levels are high. The dry season is a likely time for this; there would be little food in the stomach, which would allow its use for air breathing. Loricariids exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, including cavity spawning, attachment of eggs on the underside of rocks, and egg-carrying. Parental care is usually good, and the male guards the eggs and sometimes the larvae. The eggs hatch after four to 20 days, depending on the species. Three species known from subterranean habitats are true troglobites with reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes: Ancistrus cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso.Romero, A., editor (2001).

Loricariids are popular aquarium fish, where they are often sold as \\"plecs\\", \\"plecos\\" or \\"plecostomus\\". These fish are often purchased because of their algae-eating habits, though this role may not be carried out. Most species are in fact detritivores. A great many species of loricariids are also sold for their ornamental qualities, representing many body shapes and colors. Most species of loricariids are nocturnal and will shy away from bright light, appreciating some sort of cover to hide under throughout the day. As they often originate from habitats with fast-moving water, filtration should be vigorous. A number of species of loricariids have been bred in captivity.

The planet has also been referred to as Bryak, Yod,Adventure Comics #356 (May 1967) and in current continuity, Yod-Colu. Planetary information 20th century Colu is a rim world found on the approach to the Magellanic Clouds. It is the only inhabitable planet of its star system and is the fourth planet from its sun. The surface is split between 50% land and water, and while it has polar ice caps and a few deserts, and has two moons, is mostly temperate. The majority of its populace lives in large cities with less than 1% of its population residing elsewhere outside those cities.L.E.G.I.O.N. #1 (February 1989) In Pre-Zero Hour continuity, Colu's capital was given as Metaire and was the most advanced city in the galaxy, in which the shrine of enlightenment was built.Legionnaires #8 (November 1993) In Mark Waid's Legion reboot, Colu uses its shrinking technology (pioneered by the original Brainiac) to make maximum use of its surface area. It is sometimes known as the \\"Bottle Planet of Colu\\". Inhabitants The Coluan race is essentially a green-skinned humanoid race. The average member of the Coluan race is noted for having an \\"eighth level\\" intelligence (far higher than humans), with the notable exception of the Dox family who have a \\"twelfth level\\" intelligence due to genetic mutation. They also have exceptionally long lifespans lasting for centuries (approximately 500 years), which Brainiac 5 confirmed was a product of genetic manipulation. In the 30th century setting of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Colu is famous for the incredible intellects of its inhabitants. The most brilliant, but most erratic, are still considered to be the Dox family, which includes the Legion's own Brainiac 5 (a.k.a. Querl Dox). Before the Computer Tyrants took over, the planet was ruled by its greatest intellect. After the Zero Hour reboot, it was revealed that most Coluans prefer purely theoretical research, and found Brainiac 5's interest in experimentation disturbing. It was later revealed that, following their experience with the Computer Tyrants, the Coluans had a prejudice against artificial life.The Legion #10-15 They also came to the conclusion that the Twelfth level intelligence is mentally and socially unstable and that their own Eighth level is the perfect intelligence level needed to function without these problems. However, the same Coluan who mentioned the information later proved that the truth was exactly opposite of this statement in the outcome of the war against Robotica and C.O.M.P.U.T.O..

To perpetrate the illusion that Brainiac was Coluan, young Vril Dox was sent along and instructed to pose as Brainiac's \\"son\\". Dox rebelled against the Tyrants and freed Colu. He was the ancestor of Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes. =Post Crisis= In the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Colu was still ruled by the Computer Tyrants. To remain in control of Colu, the Tyrants would resort to measures such as memory erasing and brainwashing Coluan children so that the populace knew no other lifestyle than the one the Tyrants offered. However, in this timeline they did not create a Brainiac android. Instead they created Brainiac by accident, when they sentenced the rebellious scientist Vril Dox to death, and his consciousness somehow found its way to Earth. His cloned lab assistant, Vril Dox II, eventually overthrew the Computer Tyrants, with the aid of the various heroic aliens who became L.E.G.I.O.N.. The Computer Tyrants downloaded themselves into a robot body, (apparently going on to become Pulsar Stargrave) but were unable to retake Colu from Vril II. Brainiac subsequently returned to Colu and attempted to conquer it using Brainiac 5 and the \\"sleepnet\\" (which was due to be invented on Colu in 750 years). Vril Dox II returned to Colu to stop his father from conquering it and after a struggle, he and Brainiac 5 managed to defeat Brainiac. Afterwards, the Coluan high council decided that the Dox family was barred from ever returning to Colu (which at some point would be overturned). They also declared that they would only research scientific theory rather than experimentation. Brainiac 5 revealed afterwards that Colu was exactly the same in the 21st century as it was in the 31st century - Colu would see no significant developments for the next 1,000 years. =Legionaires 1,000,000= In the Legionaires #1,000,000 one-shot, which showed a possible future for Colu, Colu was said to have joined itself with Bgztl (the homeworld of Phantom Girl). Over time, the two worlds' inhabitants slowly merged powers to form a race of people who, not only had great intelligence, but became spirit intellects, lacking the distraction of flesh. The two joint worlds were Brainiac 417's homeworlds.Legionaires 1,000,000 =Rebirth= The planet Colu was eventually target by one of four Omega Titans that came out from the destroyed Source Wall and was unfortunately destroyed, however its population was able to escape before the planet was consumed by the Omega Titan.justice League: No Justice #3 Other media Authority figures of Colu * Colu has been mentioned in the Legion of Super- Heroes animated series, and later shown in the series finale \\"Dark Victory.\\" In the series, the Coluans are not organic but a race of highly advanced cybernetic beings that function as a \\"hive mind\\" collective, from which Brainiac 5 has separated to become an individual. * The Coluans also appeared in the comics spinoff of the animated series, Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century.Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century #4 * Coluans are mentioned in the Supergirl episode \\"Solitude\\", which features Indigo. It is stated that members of the race served as supercomputers on Krypton. A Coluan, Brainiac 5, is a recurring character in the third season as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. * In the video game Injustice 2, the Coluan Brainiac appears as the game's main antagonist. Brainiac himself mentions hailing from the planet Colu when introducing himself to Black Canary and Green Arrow after capturing them in the main story. In Brainiac's character ending, Brainiac 5, a descendant of the Brainiac who lacks the latter's homicidal tendencies, travels back in time to assist Batman and Superman in defeating his ancestor as Coulans are feared in the 31st century due to his ancestors actions, though Brainiac is put on trial by the Legion for his unauthorized use of a time bubble, but Brainiac 5 himself remains convinced that they will understand his reasoning.

The town comprises two settlements, Anstruther Easter and Anstruther Wester, which are divided by a stream, the Dreel Burn. With a population of 3,500, it is the largest community on the Firth of Forth's north-shore coastline known as the East Neuk. To the east, it merges with the village of Cellardyke. Description Founded as a fishing village, Anstruther is home to the Scottish Fisheries Museum. Its main industry is now tourism, although other small-scale manufacturing and service industries continue. Recreational vessels are now moored in the harbour, and a golf course is situated near the town. Anstruther Pleasure Cruises operate sightseeing/wildlife cruises from the harbour to the Isle of May, the UK's primary puffin location, on board the vessel the May Princess from April to October. An abundance of other wildlife, including seal colonies, also inhabit the island. The Waid Academy, the local state comprehensive school, is a focus of the community and through its secondary role as a community centre. Anstruther has a parish church at its centre that is on a small hill. This structure incorporates a tower/spire feature rare to Britain, but common to the area. Anstruther War Memorial is located in the cemetery, somewhat further inland. It is of an unusual war memorial form, being totally flat to the ground, in the centre of a landscaped roundel, broadly adopting the shape of a celtic cross. Anstruther Easter from Anstruther Wester . The town has several fish and chip shops. The Anstruther Fish Bar, which won Fish and Chip shop of the year in 2001‚Äì2002, was awarded the same prize once again by the Sea Fish Organisation in 2009. Anstruther is home to Scotland's only true-scale model Solar System. The model, which shows the Sun and planets and the distances between them all at the same scale of 1 to ten thousand million, is located mostly in the town centre. It stretches almost 600 m from the Sun to Pluto. Anstruther is close to the Caves of Caiplie situated on the coastal path to Crail. Surface structure leading to \\"Scotland's Secret Bunker\\" Following the end of the Cold War, one of Anstruther's best-kept secrets has become a major tourist attraction. A secret nuclear bunker, built in 1951 and operational until 1993, is located on the B940 near the village. During its operational life, it looked like an ordinary domestic dwelling, but has been renovated and is now open to the public as a museum. The bunker was a subsidiary Regional Seat of Government in time of possible nuclear emergency and would have been occupied by the UK Armed Forces, UKWMO, Royal Observer Corps, and other Civil Service personnel. Somewhat out from the town centre, in Anstruther Wester, stands the Dreel Tavern, taking its name from the adjacent burn. This building dates from the 17th century. Nearby is Buckie House, built in the late 17th century and restored in 1968 by W Murray Jack. The east gable was decorated with scallop shells and whelks or 'buckies' by the slater Andrew Batchelor in the mid 19th century. Its exterior was restored in 2010. History The name of Anstruther derives from Scottish Gaelic. The second element is sruthair ('burn, stream'), but the first element less certain: it is possibly Gaelic √°(i)n ('driving') or aon ('one'), thus meaning either 'driving current or burn' or '(place of or on) one burn'.Simon Taylor and Gilbert M√°rkus, The Place-Names of Fife, 5 vols (Donington: Tyas, 2006-12), III 62. The name of Anstruther Easter derives from Scots easter ('eastern'), since the village lies to the east of Anstruther, and Anstruther Wester correspondingly from Scots wester ('western').Simon Taylor and Gilbert M√°rkus, The Place-Names of Fife, 5 vols (Donington: Tyas, 2006-12), III 55, 62. Anstruther-Easter and -Wester are separated by a small stream called Dreel Burn. Their parishes and that of nearby Kilrenny are immensely historic. Local tradition states that early in the 12th century, Alexander I of Scotland granted the lands of Anstruther to a William de Candela. However, no records survive of this original grant, and the earliest recorded lord of Anstruther was mentioned in a charter of 1225. There have been several theories as to the origin of the, possibly mythical, William, but recent research has suggested he may have been a Norman from Italy. There is evidence that William the Conqueror sought assistance from William, Count of Candela. He sent his son (or possibly his grandson). It may be this was the William de Candela, who received the grant of land from Alexander. William de Candela's son, another William, was said to be a benefactor to the monks of Balmerino Abbey. Balmerino was founded in 1229, long after the likely lifetime of this William. Land in Anstruther Easter, on which a chapel was built and now occupied by the Scottish Fisheries Museum, was gifted to Balmerino by another William, sometime in the 1280s. Both this suggestion, and the Italian origin theory are inaccurate. The de Candela family actually came from Dorset, coming to England probably from Normandy in or around 1066. The de Candela name was dropped by a later generation, in a charter confirming a grant of land to Dryburgh Abbey in 1225, Henry is described as 'Henricus de Aynstrother dominus ejusdem'. His son, also called Henry, was a companion of Louis IX in his crusades to the Holy Land and also swore fealty to Edward I in 1292 and again in 1296. In 1225, it took the intervention of Pope Honorius III to settle a teinds dispute between the monks of Dryburgh Abbey and the fishermen of Anstruther, suggesting that, even then, the fishing was sufficiently good to warrant arguing over.. In December 1583, James VI of Scotland gave the town the status of a Royal Burgh and trading rights, recognizing the importance of the port, called the draucht of Anstruther. The bounds of the new Burgh were the \\"Silver Dyke\\" on the east, the low water line on the south, the Anstruther burn to the west, and the Kylrynnie march road.Donaldson, Gordon, ed., Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 8 (1982), pp. 272‚Äì273 James Melville's diary provides a graphic account of the arrival of a ship from the Spanish Armada to Anstruther. Local tradition has long held that some of the survivors remained and intermarried with the locals. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the town was home to The Beggar's Benison, a gentleman's club devoted to \\"the convivial celebration of male sexuality\\". By the 19th century, Anstruther-Easter, Anstruther-Wester, and Kilrenny were all separate royal and parliamentary boroughs. Anstruther- Easter held tanning, shipbuilding, and fish-curing establishments, as well as a coasting trade. In 1871, the royal burgh of Anstruther-Easter had a population of 1169; the parliamentary burgh, 1289. Anstruther-Wester held 484. The Board of Fisheries constructed a new harbour in the 1870s, completed by 1877 at a cost of ¬£80,000. By the First World War, the communities were connected to St Andrews by the North British Railway. Codliver oil was also being produced. Herring fishing remained a feature of the area until the mid-20th century when, after a record catch in 1936, the shoals mysteriously declined until the industry effectively disappeared by 1947. At one time, the town was well served by trains on the Fife Coast Railway. The line was closed to passengers in 1965. Since the 1950s, Anstruther has been a summer tourist destination. In the summer of 2018 a decision by Fife Council to build a new care home facility on the town's Bankie Park was reversed after a campaign by residents. Twinning Anstruther is twinned with: * Bapaume, France (since October 1991) Notable inhabitants James Anstruther (d. 1606) was a laird of Anstruther and a courtier, and his son Robert Anstruther was a diplomat during the Thirty Years' War. Sir James Lumsden, a soldier of fortune under Gustavus Adolphus was born in the parish of Kilrenny about 1598. William Tennant's poem \\"Anster Fair\\" concerns the town's celebration. Thomas Chalmers, co-founder of the Free Church of Scotland, was born in Anstruther-Easter, where his house has been preserved. David Martin (1737‚Äì1798), the painter and engraver; John Goodsir (1814‚Äì1867), the anatomist; his brother Harry Goodsir, surgeon on the ill-fated Franklin expeditionKaufman MH. Harry Goodsir and the last Franklin expedition, of 1845. Journal of Medical Biography 2004; 12: 82‚Äì89 and Robert Fowler (1853‚Äì1926), artist, were natives of Anstruther. Author Jessie Kerr Lawson (1838-1917) lived for a time in the town, and her sons Andrew Cowper Lawson (1861-1952), geologist, and James Kerr Lawson (1862-1939), painter, were born there. Andrew discovered and named the San Andreas Fault and the mineral Lawsonite is named after him. The family emigrated to Canada where another son, Abercrombie Anstruther Lawson (1870-1927), founding professor of botany at the University of Sydney, was born. Princess Titaua Marama, Chiefess of Haapiti in Polynesia lived in Anstruther from 1892 until she died there in 1898, aged 55. A blue plaque marks the house in which she lived. A book has been written about her life by the British-American author, Fiona J Mackintosh. Archibald Constable, Sir Walter Scott's publisher, was born in the parish of Carnbee, about three miles to the north of Pittenweem. Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart (1887‚Äì1970), director-general of the Political Warfare Executive during World War II, was also born in Anstruther. Sports writer Graham Spiers hails from Anstruther. It was the childhood home of BBC Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman. Anstruther has become known as the base for the Fence Collective, a network of nu-folk musicians. Politics Traditionally, the two Anstruthers returned a single member of Parliament together with Kilrenny, Pittenweem, St Andrews, Cupar, and Crail. Anstruther is in the North East Fife UK Parliament constituency (MP is currently Wendy Chamberlain of the Scottish Liberal Democrats) and the North East Fife Scottish Parliament constituency. In the 2017 General Election Stephen Gethins MP retained his seat by a majority of only two votes. There were three recounts. The narrowly defeated candidate was Lib Dem Elizabeth Riches, a resident of Anstruther and former local councillor. The MSP is currently Willie Rennie, who won back the seat for the Lib Dems from Roderick Campbell of the SNP. Anstruther is in the Mid-Scotland and Fife Scottish Parliamentary region and the Scotland European Parliament constituency. In local politics the ward of East Neuk and Landward (of which Anstruther is part) elects three councillors to Fife Council under the single transferable vote system.

She crossed the Pacific in 1614. She was of the Spanish galleon type, known in Japan as nanban-sen (ÂçóËõÆËàπ, \\"Southern Barbarian ships\\"). She transported a Japanese diplomatic mission of 180 people during the first leg of their trip to the Vatican as envoys to Pope Paul V, headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga and accompanied by the Spanish friar Luis Sotelo. After transporting Hasekura to Acapulco in the Spanish possession of New Spain, the ship returned to Japan. Hasekura and the embassy went on to Europe, eventually reaching Rome. Construction San Juan Bautista was built in 1613 by Date Masamune, the daimy≈ç of Sendai in northern Japan, in Tsuki-No-Ura harbour (Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture). The project had been approved by the Bakufu, the sh≈çguns government in Edo. The sh≈çgun already had two smaller ships (80 and 120 tons) built for him by the English pilot William Adams. The larger, the San Buena Ventura, was given to Spanish shipwrecked sailors to return to New Spain in 1610. The sh≈çgun also issued numerous permits for Red seal ships, destined for Asian trade and incorporating many elements of Western ship design. San Juan Bautista is reported to have required 45 days' work, with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu, 800 shipwrights, 700 smiths, and 3000 carpenters. Two Spanish men are also reported to have participated to the endeavour: the friar Luis Sotelo, and the Spanish captain Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no. These efforts were seen with disapproval by the Spanish government in Manila, and Los Rios Coronel suggested that Luis Sotelo should not be allowed into Japan any further (C. R. Boxer). Two trans-Pacific round-trips Nicol√°s de Cardona, in his 1632 report submitted to the king of Spain, included a view of the bay and city of Acapulco, mentioning the presence of \\"a ship from Japan\\" (letter \\"D\\"), probably the San Juan Bautista (Gonoi, p53). Cardona was in Acapulco between the end of 1614 and March 21, 1615. The full legend reads: A. The ships of the expedition. B. The castle of San Diego. C. The town. D. A ship that has come from Japan. E. Los Manzanillos. F. El Grifo.Nicolas de Cardona \\"Geographic Descriptions\\", by Michael Mathes, p75 The San Juan Bautista is represented in Claude Deruet's painting of Hasekura Tsunenaga in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red swastika on orange background) on the topmast. Upon completion, the ship left on October 28, 1613, for Acapulco in New Spain, with around 180 people on board, consisting of 10 samurai of the sh≈çgun (led by the Minister of the Navy Mukai Sh≈çgen Tadakatsu), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese. The ship arrived in Acapulco on January 25, 1614, after three months at sea. After a year in Acapulco, the ship returned to Japan on April 28, 1615, as Hasekura continued to Europe. It seems that around 50 specialists in mining and silver- refining were invited to Japan on this occasion, so that they could help develop the mining industry in the Sendai area. A group of Franciscans led by Father Diego de Santa Catalina, sent as a religious embassy to Tokugawa Ieyasu also sailed on the ship. The San Juan Bautista arrived in Uraga, Japan on August 15, 1615.Gonoi, p87 In September 1616 the San Juan Batista headed again to Acapulco, at the request of Luis Sotelo. She was sailed by Captain Yokozawa Sh≈çgen, but the trip went wrong and around 100 sailors died en route. San Juan Bautista finally arrived in Acapulco in May 1617. Sotelo and Hasekura met in Mexico for the return trip back to Japan. In April 1618 the ship arrived in the Philippines, where she was sold to the Spanish government there with the objective of building up defenses against the Dutch. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620. During his absence Japan had changed quite drastically: Christianity was being eradicated since its introduction in 1614, and Japan was moving towards a period of seclusion. Because of these persecutions, the trade agreements with New Spain he had been trying to establish were also denied. In the end, his efforts seem to have had few results, and he died two years later of illness. 1993 Replica ship Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga A new San Juan Bautista was reconstructed in 1993 on the basis of the records of the House of Date. Although its blueprints have not been found, the ship's dimensions were recorded properly, permitting a speculative reconstitution. The ship is currently on display in a theme park in Ishinomaki, in northern Japan, close to the location where she was originally built. The replica survived the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami intact with minor damage, and there were hopes in 2011 of using the ship as a symbol of the town's reconstruction.\\"Watanoha, Ishinomaki: The San Juan somehow survived\\" („Çµ„É≥„Éª„Éï„Ç°„É≥Âè∑„Äå‰Ωï„Å®„ÅãËÄê„Åà„Åü„Äç Áü≥Â∑ª„ÉªÊ∏°Ê≥¢) .

Retrieved on 2009-01-08. It is located in the northeast corner of the city. There are over 60 different cultures represented in Malvern, with the most dominant ethnic groups being Caribbean Canadians (mostly Jamaican, Trinidadian, and Guyanese) and South Asian Canadians (mostly Sri Lankan Tamil, Indian and Pakistani). The neighbourhood has the highest concentration of young people in Canada.CANOE - The Toronto Sun CareerConnection - Youth Force History Elderslie House, built in 1864. Malvern was first settled in the mid-1850s. The history of Malvern began in 1856, when the Malvern Post Office was opened in David Brown's general store, which stood at the south-east corner of Finch Avenue and Markham Road. This post office was named after a resort town in England. A year after the post office was opened, Senator David Reesor ‚Äî formerly of Markham Village ‚Äî began selling \\"Village Lots\\" in Malvern. Reesor trumpeted Malvern as the future \\"Capital of Scarborough,\\" anticipating that the Grand Trunk Railway would extend a branch line through here. Unfortunately, when the Grand Trunk Railway began service to this area in 1871, it bypassed Malvern in favour of the neighbouring village of Agincourt. The village centre and post office had by that time moved south to the corner of today's Sheppard Avenue and Markham Road. 24px 11 MB. The Malvern Primitive Methodist Church on the east side of Markham Road north of Sheppard disappeared in the 1970s, but the graves remain today in the care of the Toronto United Church Council. While Malvern never did become a prosperous railway centre, it flourished as a farming community for over one hundred years. In the late 1950s, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation expropriated Malvern's farms to build a \\"model community\\" of affordable homes. The first residents of this modern day Malvern community moved into their homes in 1972. The Malvern community has attempted to improve following Project Impact, in which hundreds of police officers from the Greater Toronto Area cracked down on known associates of the \\"Malvern Crew\\" street gang, in early morning raids across the city on May 12, 2004. During the raids, 71 warrants were executed resulting in the arrest of 65 people. Further raids, and the implementation of Project Pathfinder would result in arrests of the Malvern Crew's rival gang, the \\"Galloway Boys\\", in West Hill. The Malvern branch of the Toronto Public Library was renovated in the early-2000s. In the early 21st century, the area saw public investment in the community, including a major renovation of the Malvern Branch of the Toronto Public Library, the construction of new housing developments, the opening of a new park in 2004, and the opening of the Nike Malvern Sports Complex in 2006. The Toronto Zoo, the Rouge River, and the Rouge Valley Park are also located in the vicinity of Malvern, as was Mammoth Hall, a wooden structure that was once a municipal office, meeting hall and curling rink. Also, the Malvern Community Coalition serves as an active incorporated, non-profit, grassroots community organization which exists to promote and enhance the Malvern Community by engaging, empowering, and connecting community, organizations and institutions.MCC - What's Up in Malvern Education Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute is one of two secondary schools in Malvern. Two public school boards operate schools in Malvern, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Both TCDSB, and TDSB operate one public secondary school in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy, while TDSB operates Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute. In addition to secondary schools, both school boards operate several public elementary schools in the Malvern. They include: * Alexander Stirling Public School (TDSB) * Berner Trail Junior Public School (TDSB) * Burrows Hall Junior Public School (TDSB) * Dr. Marion Hilliard Senior Public School (TDSB) * Emily Carr Public School (TDSB) * Fleming Public School (TDSB) * Grey Owl Junior Public School (TDSB) * Heritage Park Public School (TDSB) * Lucy Maud Montgomery Public School (TDSB) * Malvern Junior Public School (TDSB) * Mary Shadd Public School (TDSB) * Sacred Heart Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Barnabas Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Bede Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Columba Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Florence Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Gabriel Lalemant Catholic School (TCDSB) * Tom Longboat Junior Public School (TDSB) The French-first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Malvern, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/CSV students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. The former S.S. #3 Schoolhouse, serving the Malvern area, built in 1872 stood on of land purchased from George Pearson, is still standing today at 5810 Finch Avenue East. The building is presently used by a private school, Whitefield Christian Academy. Transportation Sewells Road Bridge is a bridge in the northeast of Malvern. Several major roadways are located in Malvern. The neighbourhood is bounded to the south by Highway 401 is a major east-west controlled access highway that passes through Greater Toronto. Several other major roadways include Morningside Avenue, and Sheppard Avenue. Located on Sewells Road, the Sewells Road Bridge is a bridge over the Rouge River, in the northeast of Malvern. =Public transit= Malvern is served by several Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus routes (39 Finch East, 85 Sheppard East, 102 Markham Rd, 116 Morningside, 131 Nugget, 132 Milner, 133 Neilson, 134 Progress, 902 Markham Rd Express, 939C Finch Express, and 985B Sheppard East Express). In the 1980s, there was a plan to bring rapid transit to Malvern by extending the Scarborough line, but lack of government funding prevented any extension of the line. In August 2006, city councillors representing Scarborough rallied for the expansion of the Scarborough line, or its possible light rail replacement, to the Malvern community. Scarborough line extension to Malvern The TTC is currently carrying assessing extending the RT from McCowan to Malvern Town Centre. They have also made a motion that the current study should include the addition of a station where the existing line crosses Brimley Road. In 2006, a study was completed on the prospects of this line. It recommended upgrading the line to handle larger ART Mark II vehicles, at a cost of $360 million (2006 dollars). Extending the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line (either along the current Scarborough RT route, or along a different alignment directly to Scarborough Centre) was not considered cost- effective or justifiable. On June 15, 2007, the Ontario government had released MoveOntario 2020, a plan that would fund 52 different transit projects throughout Toronto and Hamilton for the cost of $17.5 billion, including the Scarborough RT extension to Sheppard Avenue, which would meet the proposed Sheppard East LRT line, also to be funded by MoveOntario 2020. Unfortunately, in a 2010 budget release, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty had chosen to postpone necessary funding for the project. Scarborough Malvern LRT The Scarborough Malvern LRT line, part of the TTC's Transit City plan, would run for 15 km, estimated to account for 14 million trips in 2021. The southern terminus of the line would be built at Kennedy Station at Kennedy Road and Eglinton Avenue, with a connection to the Bloor-Danforth subway, the Scarborough RT, and the Eglinton Crosstown LRT line. The whole line would be built within Scarborough. The line would run along Eglinton Avenue East until it reaches Kingston Road, then continues northeast until Morningside Avenue is reached, then continues north until Sheppard Avenue East, where it turns west, sharing the same tracks and stops as in the Sheppard East LRT line. Finally, the line turns north at Neilson Road, terminating at Malvern Town Centre. Newly elected Rob Ford cancelled the Malvern LRT shortly after he came to office in 2010. The Malvern LRT would cross the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. According to The Varsity, the paper for students at the University of Toronto, when students at the Scarborough campus were asked to contribute $30 million towards the construction of an Olympic class pool on their campus, which would first be used for competitions during the 2015 Pan American Games, they were promised two LRT lines would be brought to campus. The Varsity reported that the students had held up their part of the bargain and resented that the city dropped plans to build the LRT lines. Economy Although Scarborough Town Centre is a short drive away, Malvern Town Centre provides some retail options and amenities to local residents. Built in the late 1980s, the mall's primary tenant are Freshland Supermarket, an Asian grocery store; Planet Fitness, and Labels, a discount clothing store.

Some treat it as a classification identifying some structure of truth and reality that exists whether or not humans recognize it. Others treat it as a human classification of knowings that work instrumentally. Every \\"kind\\" is a generalization grouping certain characteristic traits. It consists of a general class and of individual examples of the class. As formulated by Aristotle, the essence of every thing humans can know exists as an unconditional abstract kind or species: (1) \\"all water [kind] is H_2 O [trait]\\"; (2) \\"All men are mortal\\"; (3) \\"All ravens are black.\\" Today, few scholars endorse Aristotle's formulation, but many continue to suppose that natural kinds are the structure of truth and reality. They may appear as units of scientific hypotheses, generalizations, and theories. Identification of their traits appears illogical, since it is practically impossible for inductive reasoning to rest on observation of \\"all\\" examples of characteristic traits. But it appears necessary to draw inductive inferences about kinds after observing a few examples. Inductive kinds often \\"work\\" as predicted‚Äîno exceptions to the classification are found‚Äîjustifying belief in immutable natural kinds This article presents conflicting meanings of natural kind. John Dewey held a minority view that belief in unconditional natural kinds is a mistake, a relic of obsolete scientific practices. W. V. O. Quine and Hilary Kornblith held the still-reigning view that natural kinds are the unchanging structure of truth and reality. Hilary Putnam rejects descriptivist approaches to natural kinds with semantic reasoning. Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther hold the emerging view that natural kinds are useful and evolving scientific facts. John Dewey In 1938, John Dewey published Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. He there explained how modern scientists create kinds through induction and deduction, and why they have no use for natural kinds. :The philosophical issue is how humans can dependably predict that unobserved examples of a kind will have the same traits as a few observed examples. The traditional answer grew out of Aristotle's assertion that humans describe things they know in two kinds of propositions. Existential kinds‚Äîknown by observing traits‚Äîare stated in \\"generic\\" propositions. Conceptual kinds‚Äîknown by intuitive recognition of groups of traits‚Äîare stated in \\"universal\\" propositions. Dewey argued that modern scientists do not follow Aristotle in treating inductive and deductive propositions as facts already known about nature's stable structure. Today, scientific propositions are intermediate steps in inquiry, hypotheses about processes displaying stable patterns. Aristotle's generic and universal propositions have become conceptual tools of inquiry warranted by inductive inclusion and exclusion of traits. They are provisional means rather than results of inquiry revealing the structure of reality. : Propositions as such are ... provisional, intermediate and instrumental. Since their subject- matter concerns two kinds of means, material and procedural, they are of two main categories: (1) Existential [generic means, known by induction], referring directly to actual conditions, as determined by experimental observation, and (2) ideational or conceptual [universal means, known by deduction], consisting of interrelated meanings, which are non-existential in content ... but which are applicable to existence through the operations they represent as possibilities. Modern induction starts with a question to be answered or a problem to be solved. It identifies problematic subject-matter and seeks potentially relevant traits and conditions. Generic existential data thus identified are reformulated‚Äîstated abstractly as if-then universal relations capable of serving as answers or solutions: If H_2 O, then water. For Dewey, induction creates warranted kinds by observing constant conjunction of relevant traits. : No grounded generic propositions can be formed save as they are the products of the performance of operations indicated as possible by universal propositions. The problem of inference is, accordingly, to discriminate and conjoin those qualities [kinds] of existential material that serve as distinguishing traits (inclusively and exclusively) of a determinate kind. Dewey used the example of \\"morning dew\\" to describe these abstract steps creating scientific kinds. From antiquity, the common-sense belief had been that all dew is a kind of rain, meaning dew drops fall. By the early 1800s the curious absence of rain before dew and the growth of understanding led scientists to examine new traits. Functional processes changing bodies [kinds] from solid to liquid to gas at different temperatures, and operational constants of conduction and radiation, led to new inductive hypotheses \\"directly suggested by this subject-matter, not by any data [kinds] previously observable. ... There were certain [existential] conditions postulated in the content of the new [non-existential] conception about dew, and it had to be determined whether these conditions were satisfied in the observable facts of the case.\\" After demonstrating that dew could be formed by these generic existential phenomena, and not by other phenomena, the universal hypothesis arose that dew forms following established laws of temperature and pressure. \\"The outstanding conclusion is that inductive procedures are those which prepare existential material so that it has convincing evidential weight with respect to an inferred generalization. Existential data are not pre-known natural kinds, but become conceptual statements of \\"natural\\" processes. : Objects and qualities [kinds] as they naturally present themselves or as they are \\"given,\\" are not only not the data of science but constitute the most direct and important obstacles to formation of those ideas and hypotheses that are genuinely relevant and effective. : We are brought to the conclusion that it is modes of active response which are the ground of generality of logical form, not the existential immediate qualities of that which is responded to. Dewey concluded that nature is not a collection of natural kinds, but rather of reliable processes discoverable by competent induction and deduction. He replaced the ambiguous label \\"natural kind\\" by \\"warranted assertion\\" to emphasize the conditional nature of all human knowings. Assuming kinds to be given unconditional knowings leads to the error of assuming that conceptual universal propositions can serve as evidence for generic propositions; observed consequences affirm unobservable imagined causes. \\"For an 'inference' that is not grounded in the evidential nature of the material from which it is drawn is not an inference. It is a more or less wild guess.\\" Modern induction is not a guess about natural kinds, but a means to create instrumental understanding. Willard Van Orman Quine In 1969, Willard Van Orman Quine brought the term \\"natural kind\\" into contemporary analytic philosophy with an essay bearing that title. His opening paragraph laid out his approach in three parts. First, it questioned the logical and scientific legitimacy of reasoning inductively by counting a few examples posting traits imputed to all members of a kind: \\"What tends to confirm an induction?\\" For Quine, induction reveals warranted kinds by repeated observation of visible similarities. Second, it assumed that color can be a characteristic trait of natural kinds, despite some logical puzzles: hypothetical colored kinds such as non-black non-ravens and green-blue emeralds. Finally, it suggested that human psychological structure can explain the illogical success of induction: \\"an innate flair that we have for natural kinds. He started with the logical hypothesis that, if all ravens are black‚Äîan observable natural kind‚Äîthen non- black non-ravens are equally a natural kind: \\"... each [observed] black raven tends to confirm the law [universal proposition] that all ravens are black ...\\" Observing shared generic traits warrants the inductive universal prediction that future experience will confirm the sharing: \\"And every reasonable [universal] expectation depends on resemblance of [generic] circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.\\" \\"The notion of a kind and the notion of similarity or resemblance seem to be variants or adaptations of a single [universal] notion. Similarity is immediately definable in terms of kind; for things are similar when they are two of a kind.\\" Quine posited an intuitive human capacity to recognize criteria for judging degrees of similarity among objects, an \\"innate flair for natural kinds.‚Äù These criteria work instrumentally when applied inductively: \\"... why does our innate subjective spacing [classification] of [existential] qualities accord so well with the functionally relevant [universal] groupings in nature as to make our inductions tend to come out right?\\" He admitted that generalizing after observing a few similarities is scientifically and logically unjustified. The numbers and degrees of similarities and differences humans experience are infinite. But the method is justified by its instrumental success in revealing natural kinds. The \\"problem of induction\\" is how humans \\"should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate, scientifically unjustified similarity standards.\\" : A standard of similarity is in some sense innate. This point is not against empiricism; it is a commonplace of behavioral psychology. A response to a red circle, if it is rewarded, will be elicited by a pink eclipse more readily than by a blue triangle; the red circle resembles the pink ellipse more than the blue triangle. Without some such prior spacing of qualities, we could never acquire a [classification] habit; all stimuli would be equally alike and equally different. Quine credited human ability to recognize colors as natural kinds to the evolutionary function of color in human survival‚Äîdistinguishing safe from poisonous kinds of food. He recognized that modern science often judges color similarities to be superficial, but denied that equating existential similarities with abstract universal similarities makes natural kinds any less permanent and important. The human brain's capacity to recognize abstract kinds joins the brain's capacity to recognize existential similarities. : Credit is due to man's inveterate ingenuity, or human sapience, for having worked around the blinding dazzle of color vision and found the more significant regularities elsewhere. Evidently natural selection has dealt with the conflict [between visible and invisible similarities] by endowing man doubly: with both a color-slanted quality space and the ingenuity to rise above it. He has risen above it by developing modified systems of kinds, hence modified similarity standards for scientific purposes. By the [inductive] trial-and-error process of theorizing he has regrouped things into new kinds which prove to lend themselves to many inductions better than the old. : A man's judgments of similarity do and should depend on his theory [universal propositions], on his beliefs; but similarity itself, what the man's judgments purport to be judgments of, [is] an objective relation in the world. It belongs in the [generic] subject matter not of our [universal] theory ... about the world, but of our [universal] theory of the [generic] world itself. Such would be the acceptable and reputable sort of similarity concept, if it could be defined. Quine argued that the success of innate and learned criteria for classifying kinds on the basis of similarities observed in small samples of kinds, constitutes evidence of the existence of natural kinds; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. His reasoning continues to provoke philosophical debates.  Hilary Putnam  In 1975, Hilary Putnam rejected descriptivist ideas about natural kind by elaborating on semantic concepts in language.Hilary Putnam (1975/1985): \\"The meaning of 'meaning'\\" . In: Philosophical Papers. Vol. 2: Mind, Language and Reality. Cambridge University Press. Putnam explains his rejection of descriptivist and traditionalist approaches to natural kinds with semantic reasoning, and insists that natural kinds can not be thought of via descriptive processes or creating endless lists of properties. In Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment, one is asked to consider the extension of \\"water\\" when confronted with an alternate version of \\"water\\" on an imagined \\"Twin Earth.\\" This \\"water\\" is composed of chemical XYZ, as opposed to H2O. However, in all other describable aspects, it is the same as Earth‚Äôs \\"water.\\" Putnam argues that the mere descriptions of an object, such as \\"water,\\" is insufficient in defining natural kind. There are underlying aspects, such as chemical composition, that may go unaccounted for unless experts are consulted. This information provided by experts is what Putnam argues will ultimately define natural kinds. Putnam calls the essential information used to define natural kind \\"core facts.\\" This discussion arises in part in response to what he refers to as \\"Quine‚Äôs pessimism\\" of theory of meaning. Putnam claims that a natural kind can be referred to via its associated stereotype. This stereotype must be a normal member of the category, and is itself defined by core facts as determined by experts,. By conveying these core facts, the essential and appropriate use of natural kind terms can be conveyed. The process of conveying core facts to communicate the essence and appropriate term of a natural kind term is shown in Putnams example of describing a lemon and a tiger. With a lemon, it is possible to communicate the stimulus-meaning of what a lemon is by simply showing someone a lemon. In the case of a tiger, on the other hand, it is considerably more complicated to show someone a tiger, but a speaker can just as readily explain what a tiger is by communicating its core facts. By conveying the core facts of a tiger (e.g. big cat, four legs, orange, black stripes, etc.), the listener can, in theory, go on to use the word \\"tiger\\" correctly and refer to its extension accurately. Hilary Kornblith In 1993, Hilary Kornblith published a review of debates about natural kinds since Quine had launched that epistemological project a quarter-century earlier. He evaluated Quine's \\"picture of natural knowledge\\" as natural kinds, along with subsequent refinements. He found still acceptable Quine's original assumption that discovering knowledge of mind-independent reality depends on inductive generalisations based on limited observations, despite its being illogical. Equally acceptable was Quine's further assumption that instrumental success of inductive reasoning confirms both the existence of natural kinds and the legitimacy of the method. : I argue that natural kinds make inductive knowledge of the world possible because the clustering of properties characteristic of natural kinds makes inferences from the presence of some of these properties to the presence of others reliable. Were it not for the existence of natural kinds and the causal structure they require, any attempt to infer the existence of some properties from the presence of others would be no more than quixotic; reliable inductive inference would be impossible. The [generic] causal structure of the world as exhibited in [universal] natural kinds thus provides the natural ground of inductive inference. Quine's assumption of an innate human psychological process‚Äî\\"standard of similarity,\\" \\"subjective spacing of qualities\\"‚Äîalso remained unquestioned. Kornbluth strengthened this assumption with new labels for the necessary cognitive qualities: \\"native processes of belief acquisition,\\" \\"the structure of human conceptual representation,\\" \\"native inferential processes,\\" \\"reasonably accurate detectors of covariation.\\" \\"To my mind, the primary case to be made for the view that our [universal] psychological processes dovetail with the [generic] causal structure of the world comes ... from the success of science. Kornblith denied that this logic makes human classifications the same as mind-independent classifications: \\"The categories of modern science, of course, are not innate.\\" But he offered no explanation of how kinds that work conditionally can be distinguished from mind-independent unchanging kinds. . : If the scientific categories of mature sciences did not correspond, at least approximately, to real kinds in nature, but instead merely grouped objects together on the basis of salient observable properties which somehow answer to our interests, it would be utterly miraculous that inductions using these scientific categories tend to issue in accurate predictions. Inductive inference can only work ... if there is something in nature binding together the [generic] properties which we use to identify kinds. ... Unobservables [universal propositions] are then postulated to explain the constant conjunction of observable properties. : We approach the world by presupposing that it contains natural kinds. Our inferences depend on this presupposition,... This presupposition thus gives us a built-in advantage in understanding what the world is like, and thereby makes inductive understanding of the world a real possibility. : When a population [kind] is uniform with respect to some [generic] property, [inductive] inferences from small samples, and indeed, from a single case, are perfectly reliable. If I note that a [generic] sample of [universal] copper conducts electricity and straightaway conclude that all copper conducts electricity, then I will do just as well as someone ... checking a very large number of copper samples for their conductivity. Kornblith didn't explain how tedious modern induction accurately generalizes from a few generic traits to all of some universal kind. He attributed such success to individual sensitivity that a single case is representative of all of a kind. : If we are sensitive to the situations in which a population is uniform with respect to some property, then making inferences on the basis of very small samples will be a reliable and efficient way to gain information about a population [natural kind].\\". He argued that even human infants are intuitively sensitive to natural classifications. : \\"From the beginning, children assume that the natural world is divided into kinds on the basis of underlying features which are responsible for their superficial similarities, and that these similarities are an uncertain guide to that real underlying structure.\\" Accepting intuition as a legitimate ground for inductive inferences from small samples, Kornblith criticized popular arguments by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that intuition is irrational. He continued to argue that traditional induction explains the success of modern science. : Our [universal] conceptual and inferential tendencies jointly conspire, at least roughly, to carve nature at its [generic] joints and project the features of a kind which are essential to it. This preestablished harmony between the [generic] causal structure of the world and the [universal] conceptual and inferential structure of our minds produces reliable inductive inference. Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther contributed essays to a collection entitled Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice, published in 2016. The editor of the collection, Catherine Kendig, argued for a modern meaning of natural kinds, rejecting Aristotelian classifications of objects according to their \\"essences, laws, sameness relations, fundamental properties ... and how these map out the ontological space of the world.\\" She thus dropped the traditional supposition that natural kinds exist permanently and independently of human reasoning. She collected original works examining results of discipline-specific classifications of kinds: \\"the empirical use of natural kinds and what I dub 'activities of natural kinding' and 'natural kinding practices'.\\" Her natural kinds include scientific disciplines themselves, each with its own methods of inquiry and classifications or taxonomies.. Chang's contribution displayed Kendig's \\"natural kinding activities\\" or \\"practice turn\\" by reporting classifications in the mature discipline of chemistry‚Äîa field renowned for examples of timeless natural kinds: \\"All water is H2O;\\" \\"All gold has atomic number 79.\\" He explicitly rejected Quine's basic assumption that natural kinds are real generic objects. \\"When I speak of a (natural) kind in this chapter, I am referring to a [universal] classificatory concept, rather than a collection of objects.\\" His kinds result from humanity's continuous knowledge-seeking activities called science and philosophy. \\"Putting these notions more unambiguously in terms of concepts rather than objects, I maintain: if we hit upon some stable and effective classificatory concepts in our inquiry, we should cherish them (calling them 'natural kinds' would be one clear way of doing so), but without presuming that we have thereby found some eternal essences. He also rejected the position taken by Bird and Tobin in our third quote above. \\"Alexander Bird and Emma Tobin‚Äôs succinct characterization of natural kinds is helpful here, as a foil: ‚Äòto say that a kind is natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping or ordering that does not depend on humans‚Äô. My view is precisely the opposite, to the extent that scientific inquiry does depend on humans.\\" For Chang, induction creates conditionally warranted kinds by \\"epistemic iteration\\"‚Äîrefining classifications developmentally to reveal how constant conjunctions of relevant traits work: \\"fundamental classificatory concepts become refined and corrected through our practical scientific engagement with nature. Any considerable and lasting [instrumental] success of such engagement generates confidence in the classificatory concepts used in it, and invites us to consider them as 'natural'.\\" Among other examples, Chang reported the inductive iterative process by which chemists gradually redefined the kind \\"element.\\" The original hypothesis was that anything that cannot be decomposed by fire or acids is an element. Learning that some chemical reactions are reversible led to the discovery of weight as a constant through reactions. And then it was discovered that some reactions involve definite and invariable weight ratios, refining understanding of constant traits. \\"Attempts to establish and explain the combining-weight regularities led to the development of the chemical atomic theory by John Dalton and others. ... Chemical elements were later redefined in terms of atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus).\\" Chang claimed his examples of classification practices in chemistry confirmed the fallacy of the traditional assumption that natural kinds exist as mind-independent reality. He attributed this belief more to imagining supernatural intervention in the world, than to illogical induction. He did not consider the popular belief that innate psychological capacities enable traditional induction to work. \\"Much natural-kind talk has been driven by an intuitive metaphysical essentialism that concerns itself with an objective [generic] order of nature whose [universal] knowledge could, ironically, only be obtained by a supernatural being. Let us renounce such an unnatural notion of natural kinds. Instead, natural kinds should be conceived as something we humans may succeed in inventing and improving through scientific practice.\\" Rasmus Winther's Contribution to Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice gave new meaning to natural objects and qualities in the nascent discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIS). This \\"inter-discipline\\" engages in discovering patterns in‚Äîand displaying spatial kinds of‚Äîdata, using methods that make its results unique natural kinds. But it still creates kinds using induction to identify instrumental traits. \\"Collecting and collating geographical data, building geographical data-bases, and engaging in spatial analysis, visualization, and map-making all require organizing, typologizing, and classifying geographic space, objects, relations, and processes. I focus on the use of natural kinds ..., showing how practices of making and using kinds are contextual, fallible, plural, and purposive. The rich family of kinds involved in these activities are here baptized mapping kinds.\\" He later identified sub-kinds of mapping kinds as \\"calibrating kinds,\\" \\"feature kinds,\\" and \\"object kinds\\" of \\"data model types.\\" Winther identified \\"inferential processes of abstraction and generalization\\" as methods used by GIS, and explained how they generate digital maps. He illustrated two kinds of inquiry procedures, with sub-procedures to organize data. They are reminiscent of Dewey's multiple steps in modern inductive and deductive inference. Methods for transforming generic phenomena into kinds involve reducing complexity, amplifying, joining, and separating. Methods for selecting among generic kinds involves elimination, classification, and collapse of data. He argued that these methods for mapping kinds can be practiced in other disciplines, and briefly considered how they might harmonize three conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds. Some philosophers believe there can be a \\"pluralism\\" of kinds and classifications. They prefer to speak of \\"relevant\\" and \\"interesting\\" kinds rather than eternal \\"natural\\" kinds. They may be called social constructivists whose kinds are human products. Chang's conclusions that natural kinds are human-created and instrumentally useful would appear to put him in this group. Other philosophers, including Quine, examine the role of kinds in scientific inference. Winther does not examine Quine's commitment to traditional induction generalizing from small samples of similar objects. But he does accept Quine's willingness to call human-identified kinds that work natural. \\"Quine holds that kinds are \\"functionally relevant groupings in nature\\" whose recognition permits our inductions to \\"tend to come out right.\\" That is, kinds ground fallible inductive inferences and predictions, so essential to scientific projects including those of GIS and cartography.\\" Finally, Winther identified a philosophical perspective seeking to reconstruct rather than reject belief in natural kinds. He placed Dewey in this group, ignoring Dewey's rejection of the traditional label in favor of \\"warranted assertions.\\" \\"Dewey resisted the standard view of natural kinds, inherited from the Greeks ... Instead, Dewey presents an analysis of kinds (and classes and universals) as fallible and context-specific hypotheses permitting us to address problematic situations effectively.\\" Winther concludes that classification practices used in Geographic Information Science are able to harmonize these conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds. \\"GIS and cartography suggest that kinds are simultaneously discovered [as pre-existing structures] and constructed [as human classifications]. Geographic features, processes, and objects are of course real. Yet we must structure them in our data models and, subsequently, select and transform them in our maps. Realism and (social) constructivism are hence not exclusive in this field.\\"  See also  * Fact‚Äìvalue distinction * Inductive reasoning * New riddle of induction * Instrumentalism * Instrumental and value rationality * Social constructivism  References  = Footnotes = = Sources = * Andreasen, Robin O. 2005.

The major part belongs to the Austrian federal state of Tyrol, while the adjacent area in the north is part of Bavaria, Germany. Four chains stretch from west to east; in addition, there are a number of fringe ranges and an extensive promontory (Vorkarwendel) in the north. Geography The term Karwendel describes the part of the Alps between the Isar river and the Seefeld Saddle mountain pass in the west and Achen Lake in the east. In the north it stretches to the Bavarian Prealps. In the south the Lower Inn Valley with the city of Innsbruck separates the Karwendel from the Central Eastern Alps. Other major settlements include Seefeld in Tirol and Mittenwald in the west, as well as Eben am Achensee in the east. Neighbouring ranges are the Wetterstein and Mieming Mountains in the west and the Brandenberg Alps in the east. The mountaineer Hermann von Barth created the tradition of naming the Karwendel chains ranges after the valleys limiting them in the south: Karwendel valley, Hinterau valley and Vomper Loch, Gleirsch valley, Hall valley, and Inn valley: *Northern Karwendel Chain *Hinterautal-Vomper Chain (a.k.a. main Karwendel Range), *Gleirsch-Halltal Chain *Nordkette (a.k.a.

They are native to tropical and subtropical South America. H. plecostomus is the popular freshwater aquarium fish formerly known as Plecostomus plecostomus. There is a lot of confusion as to the precise taxonomic structure of the Loricariidae. Taxonomy and phylogeny This genus is the type member of its tribe Hypostomini and subfamily Hypostominae. The type species of Hypostomus is H. guacari. With the inclusion of Aphanotorulus, Isorineloricaria and Squaliforma, the genus Hypostomus is by far the largest genus of Loricariidae and the second largest genus of catfish. However, a good way to split up the genus further is unclear. Species level taxonomy of Hypostomus is still poorly known as well as the phylogenetic relationships within and of the genus. It has been shown that the genus does not form a natural group. However, small monophyletic groups are known to exist within the genus Hypostomus, such as the H. cochliodon group. Aphanotorulus and Isorineloricaria are considered separate genera by some authors based on molecular information. Studies conducted with representatives of some genera of Hypostominae showed that within this group, the diploid number ranges from 2n = 52 to 2n = 80. However, the supposed wide karyotypic diversity that the family Loricariidae or the subfamily Hypostominae would present is almost exclusively restricted to the genus Hypostomus and the species from the other genera had a conserved diploid number. Distribution and habitat These species are originate from freshwater habitats of South America and the Caribbean island of Trinidad. They are found throughout most of the range of loricariids except for drainages west of the Atrato River (northwest Colombia). They are essentially ubiquitous throughout their range. Maximum diversity in number of species of Hypostomus occurs in rivers of the Paran√°-Paraguay system. Hypostomus species are found in almost all aquatic habitats, from large rivers to small rivulets. The typical habitat would be relatively fast moving water over a shallow gravel bed. Most species are lowland, sluggish stream- and lake-dwellers usually found associated with submerged wood; however, many species may be found among rocks in piedmont to mountain streams with moderate to swift flow. Members of this genus may be found over a range of substrates such mud, detritus, gravel, and sand. Many species spawn in hollows dug into mud banks or within hollow logs. Description and ecology As in all loricariids, these species have a suckermouth. They use their mouth as well as the pectoral, pelvic and caudal fin areas, to interact with the rocky river- bottom. The comb-toothed inferior mouth of Hypostomus is able to grasp green algae on the river bottom. With the help of the suckermouth, which anchor the fishes, in conjunction with the arched design of pectoral and pelvic fin spines, they are also able to remain upright while exploring this substratum. In addition, their large, concave caudal fin is associated with fast locomotion over short distances. Also like other loricariids, Hypostomus species exhibit plates of armor over their body. The colouration among Hypostomus species varies. They may have a white ground color and black spots, or brown and spotted, or even black with red, gold, or white spots. Abdomen also varies in color from white to black and may be spotted or not. The caudal fin is forked with the lower lobe longer than upper. Most species have stout bodies, but some do have thinner, elongate bodies. In most species, males develop hypertrophied odontodes on the leading edge of the pectoral fin spine and the end of the spine may become swollen. In some species, the males may also develop hypertrophied odontodes on the body during the breeding season. Hypostomus species are well known for the ability to breathe air. This is achieved through a slightly modified stomach that is larger and thinner than in non-air breathers. To breathe air, Hypostomus must orient itself vertically. Species of the H. cochliodon group are fairly large loricariids that reach about 30 centimetres (12 in) SL. Their colouration is typically dark brown with spots generally developed over most surfaces; however, most species of this group have been observed to have a well-developed ability to alter color according to substrate. Except for H. sculpodon, these species tend to have a deep body at the dorsal fin origin; this makes the body appear humped. Along with Panaque, species of the H. cochliodon group are unique among loricariids for xylophagy, or the ability to digest wood, accomplished through specialized spoon-shaped teeth. In H. hemicochliodon and H. sculpodon appear to be intermediate between other species of Hypostomus and the H. cochilodon group by feeding less on wood and lacking specialized teeth; many other Hypostomus will occasionally eat wood, but wood only amounts to a very small fraction of their diet.

A scientist, he first appeared in the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 (April 1985) and was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. Fictional biography In the 1985 12-issue comic book limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, Pariah (real name Kell Mossa) was one of the greatest scientists from his version of Earth (retconned as an alternate dimension rather than a parallel Earth). Pariah's unorthodox experiments to view the creation of the Universe result in the Anti-Monitor learning of his Earth's existence and destruction with waves of anti-matter. He survived through the intervention of the benevolent counterpart known as the Monitor, and acquired the ability to travel from one alternate Earth to another, forced to witness untold millions perish. During the Crisis, Lady Quark is saved by Pariah before the anti- matter destroys Lady Quark's universe, making the woman into the lone survivor of Earth-6. Pariah blames himself for his own world's destruction, the Anti- Monitor's release, and the subsequent destruction of universe after universe, until he finally learns he was essentially blameless. Pariah is told by the Anti-Monitor that his scientific investigation did not unleash forces great enough to destroy a universe. Pariah merely opened the antimatter portal to the dawn of time. Taking advantage of Pariah's experiment, the Anti-Monitor converted antimatter into energy, then focused it onto Pariah's universe. Those worlds' destruction allowed the gathering of more energy, which then made the Anti-Monitor strong enough to break free of the prison. After the Anti-Monitor's destruction, the reformed Earth is safe. Pariah and Lady Quark ask Harbinger to join in exploring the new Earth. Harbinger agrees to accompany the two on their journey. As the three disembark, Harbinger tells the two of being hopeful of the future and what it might bring. Pariah is seemingly indestructible and immortal. He displays few additional superhuman physical capabilities otherwise, except flight. He considers the powers he has a curse, dooming him to witness horrors he cannot stop.

The Tower was built in response to the Oregon Crisis, which was a tense dispute over the border between British North America and the United States in the 1840s. The Tower is one of five components of the Kingston Fortifications that defended Kingston Harbour, the Naval Dockyard, military supply depot and the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal. Murney Tower complements the fortifications of Fort Henry, Ontario, Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island, Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada. In addition to protecting the harbour and approaches to Kingston, these fortifications were designed to concentrate fire on Gardiners Island; it being the only place to effectively land artillery at the time.  History  = Background = When the tower was first constructed they planned to call it Murray Tower after the Master General of Ordnance. The land however, was owned by the Murney family and was called Murney Point by the locals. They thus began calling the tower, Murney Tower. This name stuck. The original inscription stone above the door read ‚ÄòMurray Tower.‚Äô An ‚ÄòN‚Äô was affixed over the first ‚ÄòR‚Äô so that the current sign reads ‚ÄòMURNAY TOWER‚Äô, a hybrid spelling of the two versions.Susanna McLeod, \\"Murney a towering figure of early Kingston,\\" Kingston Whig-Standard, March 19, 2013. Construction began on the tower on February 7th, 1846. On June 15th of the same year the Oregon treaty was resolved, reducing tensions with the Americans. On June 19th, the walls were built to their full height. Construction of the tower was finished on November 10th, 1846. = Life in the Tower = The Tower was occupied from 1848 until 1885. The main floor (ground level) was the barracks level where the soldiers and their families lived, ate, and slept. It was manned by the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment until 1870, then by Battery A until 1880, and Battery B until 1884. After 1885 it was watched by the PWOR (Princess of Wales Own Regiment). It could house a maximum of 24 soldiers and one officer or multiple soldiers and their families. There was a birth recorded in the tower in 1882. Sergeant Thomas Pugh and his wife Martha Mary lived in the tower with their seven children: William, Thomas, James, Murney May, Lillian, Bertha, and Sydney. Murney May Pugh was born in May while her family was living in the Tower. She eventually left Kingston to become a nurse and served overseas in the First World War. The Pugh family have had a significant impact on Kingston and Canada's history, serving over 470 years in the military.  Architecture and Defenses  The Tower stands surrounded by a dry-ditch and is accessible only by a bridge. When the tower was originally built, there was no bridge to cross the dry-ditch. It is likely that soldiers would have accessed the tower through two ladders placed in the ditch. Murney Tower was constructed with locally quarried limestone with special brickwork on the barracks and basement levels of the Tower's interior. On the thickest side the walls are about 15 ft. thick at the base and 13ft. thick up top. On the weaker side the walls are about 8 ft. thick. The walls are thicker on the south side because a naval attack from the Americans was the most likely form of attack and thus is what the tower is prepared for. Cannonballs from enemy ships should have theoretically bounced right off the walls. Currently, the barracks has two internal carronade cannons that would have fired 32-lb cannonballs directed out shuttered windows. These carronades had a range of 400 metres and would have been used for anti-personnel warfare in case of a land attack. These cannons could be moved about the interior embrasures, and so cover multiple approaches, including the bridge. The lower floor contained the ventilated gunpowder and artillery magazines and storage rooms, along with 4 capponieres, which acted as a defense system for the dry-ditch surrounding the Tower, allowing soldiers to fire through small loopholes at troops attacking the Towers base. Caponiers were unique to the Kingston Martello Towers, due to controversy surrounding them. The walls are much thinner in the caponiere than in the rest of the tower and are thus more vulnerable to attack. However, they also provided troops with the opportunity to protect the dry ditch through rifle loops, with strategic additional doors and rifle holes meant to keep out any enemy who successfully breached the caponier. The uppermost level is the artillery or gun platform, which supports a Blomefield cannon (which also fired 32-lb cannonballs) that could be rotated along an iron track, thus, providing full coverage around the Tower's entire circumference. The Blomefield cannon was redesigned by Thomas Blomefield, Inspector of Artillery and Superintendent of the Royal Brass Foundry in 1780. Blomefield redesigned the Armstrong cannon that had been previously used by the British forces, replacing it with a cannon that was simpler in design, lighter, and had more effective recoil restraint. The cannon weighs 6429 lbs, with a range of 2000 metres. Roofs are not original Mediterranean design of Martello towers, but a temporary snow roof was later added to the open gun platform two years after the Tower's construction protects the gun and keeps out the large amounts of snow. The addition of a roof is a common feature on Canadian Martellos. The original roof was installed in 1849. In 1921 a windstorm removed the original wooden and tin roof. Parts of the roof date to the reconstruction that followed in 1925, but the majority of the present roof dates from the 1970s and is not removable for safety reasons. Despite being one of the most sophisticated Martello towers designed and built by the British, Murney Tower quickly became obsolete due to improvements made in military weaponry and ship design.  Present Day  In 1925, the museum was opened as a museum for the public by the Kingston Historical Society. It continues to be operated by the Kingston Historical Society as the Murney Tower Museum through the summer months (May - Labour Day in September). Displays include three cannons (32-pounder), period uniforms, muskets, and other mid-19th century military artifacts. Although 14 Martello towers were built in Canada, only 9 are still standing, 4 of them in Kingston. Currently, only Murney Tower Museum is open to the public. Fort Henry has two towers that resemble Martello towers, however, they are branch ditch towers. = Designations = In 1930 the Murney Tower was designated a national historic site due to its sophisticated design. In 1989 the Kingston Fortifications were designated a National Historic Site of Canada. In 2007, the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications (including Murney Tower) were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was recognized as having played an important role in the defense of British North America and in enabling Canada to develop its own political and cultural identity  See also  * Kingston Fortifications National Historic Site Management Plan, Parks Canada, 2006 * Parks Canada, Murney Tower National Historic Site: Defending Our Past brochure, undated. * Lavell, W.S., A Story in Stone: Murney Redoubt, 1963, undated revision by Richard Arthur Preston, Kingston, Ontario.

The general idea that a class system includes a population under the working class has a long tradition in the social sciences (for example, lumpenproletariat). However, the specific term, underclass, was popularized during the last half of the 20th century, first by social scientists of American poverty, and then by American journalists. The underclass concept has been a point of controversy among social scientists. Definitions and explanations of the underclass, as well as proposed solutions for managing or fixing the underclass problem have been highly debated. Dennis Gilbert to describe the most disadvantaged socio-economic demographic with the least access to scarce resources. In this chart constructed by Gilbert, the American underclass is estimated to constitute roughly 12% of U.S. households. History Gunnar Myrdal is generally credited as the first proponent of the term underclass. Writing in the early 1960s on economic inequality in the U.S., Myrdal's underclass refers to a \\"class of unemployed, unemployables, and underemployed, who are more and more hopelessly set apart from the nation at large, and do not share in its life, its ambitions, and its achievements\\". However, this general conception of a class or category of people below the core of the working class has a long tradition in the social sciences, such as through the work of Henry Mayhew, whose London Labour and the London Poor sought to describe the hitherto invisible world of casual workers, prostitutes, and street-people. The specific concept of an underclass in the U.S. underwent several transformations during the decades following Myrdal's introduction of the term. According to sociologist Herbert Gans, while Myrdal's structural conceptualization of the underclass remained relatively intact through the writings of William Julius Wilson and others, in several respects the structural definition was abandoned by many journalists and academics, and replaced with a behavioral conception of the underclass, which fuses Myrdal's term with Oscar Lewis's and others' conception of a \\"culture of poverty\\". Definitions Various definitions of the underclass have been set forth since the term's initial conception; however, all of these definitions are basically different ways of imagining a category of people beneath the working class. The definitions vary by which particular dimensions of this group are highlighted. A few popular descriptions of the underclass are considered as follows. =Focus on economics= Marxian sociologist Erik Olin Wright sees the underclass as a \\"category of social agents who are economically oppressed but not consistently exploited within a given class system\\". The underclass occupies the lowest possible rung on a class ladder. According to Wright, the underclass are oppressed. He believes this is because they are generally denied access to the labor market, and thus they cannot rise above their status easily but also thus are \\"not consistently exploited\\" because the opportunity for their economic exploitation is minimal for the classes above. Unlike the working class, which he believes is routinely exploited for their labor power by higher classes, the underclass in Wright's view, do not hold the labor power worthy of exploitation. Wright argues his highly doctrinaire opinion of class malevolence that: This quote partly concerns the spaces and locations for the underclass and reflects the leftist view of the other classes as acting against the underclass in unison, as opposed to other sociological views seeing class actors behaving as individuals reacting to individual incentives within society. =Focus on space and place= The underclass generally occupies specific zones in the city. Thus, the notion of an underclass is popular in Urban Sociology, and particularly in accounts of urban poverty. The term, underclass, and the phrase, urban underclass, are, for the most part, used interchangeably. Studies concerning the post-civil rights African American ghetto often include a discussion of the urban underclass. Many writings concerning the underclass, particularly in the U.S., are urban-focused. William Julius Wilson's books, The Declining Significance of Race (1978) and The Truly Disadvantaged (1987), are popular accounts of the black urban underclass. Wilson defines the underclass as \\"a massive population at the very bottom of the social ladder plagued by poor education and low-paying jobs.\\" He generally limits his discussion to those trapped in the post-civil-rights ghetto in the American rust belt (see \\"Potential Causes and Proposed Solutions\\" section of this entry for a more detailed summary of Wilson on the underclass). Elijah Anderson's, Streetwise (1990), employs ethnographic methods to study a gentrifying neighborhood, \\"The Village\\" (pseudonym), bordering a black ghetto, \\"Northton\\" (pseudonym), in an American city. Anderson provides the following description of the underclass in this ghetto: =Focus on behavior= Lawrence M. Mead defines the underclass as a group that is poor and behaviorally deficient. He describes the underclass as dysfunctional. He provides the following definition in his 1986 book, Beyond Entitlement, Ken Auletta, often credited as the primary journalist who brought the underclass term to the forefront of the American consciousness, describes the American underclass as non- assimilated Americans, and he suggests that the underclass may be subcategorized into four distinct groups: =Controversies amongst definitions= Each of the above definitions are said to conceptualize the same general group ‚Äì the American underclass ‚Äì but they provide somewhat competing imagery. While Wright, Wilson, and Anderson each position the underclass in reference to the labor market, Auletta's definition is simply \\"non-assimilation\\" and his examples, along with Mead's definition, highlight underclass members' participation in deviant behavior and their adoption of an antisocial outlook on life. These controversies are elaborated further in the next section (\\"Characteristics of the Underclass\\"). As evident with Mead and Auletta's framing, some definitions of the underclass significantly diverge from the initial notion of an economic group beneath the working class. A few writings on the underclass distinguish between various types of underclass, such as the social underclass, the impoverished underclass, the reproductive underclass, the educational underclass, the violent underclass, and the criminal underclass, with some expected horizontal mobility between these groups. Even more divergent from the initial notion of an underclass are the recent journalistic accounts of a so-called \\"genetic underclass\\", referring to a genetic inheritance of a predisposition to addiction and other personality traits traditionally associated with behavioral definitions of the underclass. However, such distinctions between criminal, social, impoverished, and other specified underclass terms still refer to the same general group‚Äîthose beneath the working class. And, despite recent journalistic accounts of a \\"genetic underclass\\", the underclass concept is primarily, and has traditionally been, a social science term. Characteristics The underclass is located by a collection of identifying characteristics, such as high levels of joblessness, out-of-wedlock births, female-headed households, crime, violence, substance abuse, and high school dropout rates. The underclass harbors these traits to a greater degree than the general population, and other classes more specifically. Joel Rogers and James Wright identify four general themes by which these characteristics are organized within academic and journalistic accounts of the underclass: economic, social-psychological, behavioral, and ecological (spatial concentration). =Economic characteristics= The economic dimension is the most basic and least contested theme of the underclass ‚Äì the underclass is overwhelmingly poor. The underclass experiences high levels of joblessness, and what little employment its members hold in the formal economy is best described as precarious labor. However, it is important to note that simply being poor is not synonymous with being part of the underclass. The underclass is persistently poor and, for most definitions, the underclass live in areas of concentrated poverty. Some scholars, such as Ricketts and Sawhill, argue that being poor is not a requirement for underclass membership, and thus there are individuals who are non-poor members of the underclass because they live in \\"underclass areas\\" and embody other characteristics of the underclass, such as being violent, criminal, and anti- social (e.g., gang leaders). =Social-psychological characteristics= Many writers often highlight the social-psychological dimensions of the underclass. The underclass is often framed as holding beliefs, attitudes, opinions, and desires that are inconsistent with those held by society at large. The underclass is frequently described as a \\"discouraged\\" group with members who feel \\"cut off\\" from mainstream society. Linked to this discussion of the underclass being psychologically deviant, the underclass is also said to have low levels of cognition and literacy. Thus, the underclass is often seen as being mentally disconnected from the rest of society. Consider the following: =Behavioral characteristics= Not only is the underclass frequently said to think differently, they are also said to behave differently. Some believe that the underclass concept was meant to capture the coincidence of a number of social ills including poverty, joblessness, crime, welfare dependence, fatherless families, and low levels of education or work related skills. These behavioral characteristics, coupled with arguments that the underclass is psychologically disconnected from mainstream society, are occasionally highlighted as evidence that the underclass live in a subculture of poverty. From this point of view, members of the underclass embody a distinct set of thoughts, perceptions, and actions ‚Äì a \\"style of life\\" - that are transmitted across generations. However, just as the conceptualization of a \\"culture of poverty\\" in general is debated, so too are the attempts to frame the underclass as members of such a culture. =Ecological (spatial) characteristics= The ecological dimension, a fourth theme in the literature on the underclass, is often used as both a description and an explanation for the underclass. The underclass is concentrated in specific areas. Although there are some writings on the \\"rural underclass\\", in general the underclass is framed as an urban phenomenon and the phrases \\"ghetto poverty\\" and \\"inner- city poverty\\" are often used synonymously with the underclass term. However, many scholars are careful not to equate concentrated poverty with the underclass. Living in areas of concentrated poverty is more or less framed as a common (and often necessary) condition of the underclass, but it is generally not considered a sufficient condition since many conceptualizations of the underclass highlight behavioral and psychological deviancy that may not necessarily persist in high-poverty areas. In Wilson's writings on the underclass ‚Äì a term he eventually replaces with \\"ghetto poverty\\" (see section titled \\"Critiques of the Underclass Concept\\")‚Äì the underclass is described as a population that is physically and socially isolated from individuals and institutions of mainstream society, and this isolation is one of a collection of causes to concentrated poverty and why the \\"social dislocations\\" (e.g., crime, school dropouts, out of wed-lock pregnancy, etc.) of the underclass emerge. Thus, the underclass is defined and identified by multiple characteristics. Members are persistently poor and experience high levels of joblessness. However, these trends are generally not seen as sufficient identifiers of the underclass, because, for many, the underclass concept also captures dimensions of psychological and behavioral deviancy. Furthermore, the underclass is generally identified as an urban phenomenon with its members typically living in areas of concentrated poverty. Potential causes and proposed solutions Similar to issues of defining and identifying the underclass, the outlining of potential causes and proposed solutions for the \\"underclass problem\\" have also been points of contestation. Debates concerning the diagnosis of, and prescription for, the underclass often mirror debates concerning first world poverty more generally. However, in many writings on the specific notion of the underclass, some particular causes and solutions have been set forth. A few of these propositions are outlined below, including those developed by William Julius Wilson, Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, Lawrence M. Mead, and Ken Auletta. The work by these authors' certainly do not compile an exhaustive list of suggested causes or solutions for the underclass, but they are arguably the most read proposals among social scientists. The contrasting causes and solutions highlighted by Wilson and Mead in particular have been popular points for debate. However, because prescription is dependent on diagnosis, much of the debates between Wilson and Mead have been on the causes and conditions of the underclass. Wilson highlights social isolation and the disappearance of quality work (for example, via deindustrialization and offshore labor outsourcing) for ghetto residents, while Mead highlights an overgenerous and permissive welfare state. Massey and Denton link the creation of the underclass to racial residential segregation and advocate for policies encouraging desegregation. Auletta provides a different policy framework discussion by highlighting two extreme positions (the wholesale option and the laissez-faire option) and one middle- of-the-road position (the retail option), but these are more discussions concerning the amount of public resources that should be dedicated to fixing, or attempting to fix, the underclass problem, rather than specific strategies. Auletta seems to support the retail option, which would provide aid to underclass members deserving and hopeful and withhold aid to members undeserving and hopeless. =Wilson's diagnosis and prescription= For Wilson, the cause of the underclass is structural. In The Truly Disadvantaged, Wilson highlights a conglomerate of factors in the last half of the twentieth century leading to a growing urban underclass. The factors listed include but are not limited to the shift from a goods-producing economy to a service- producing economy (including deindustrialization) and the offshore outsourcing of labor not only in the industrial sector but also in substantial portions of the remaining service sector. These factors are aggravated by the exodus of the middle and upper classes from the inner city (first the well-known \\"white flight\\" but later the less-studied departure of the black middle class), which creates a \\"spatial mismatch\\" between where low-income people live (inner-city neighborhoods) and where low-skill service-sector jobs are available (the suburbs). The result is the transformation of the post-civil-rights-era inner city into a \\"ghetto\\" whose residents are isolated from mainstream institutions. Wilson proposes a comprehensive social and economic program that is primarily universal, but nevertheless includes targeted efforts to improve the life chances of the ghetto underclass and other disadvantaged groups. Wilson lists multiple examples of what this universal program would include, such as public funding of training, retraining, and transitional employment benefits that would be available to all members of society. With respect to the diagnosis of concentration and isolation, Wilson suggests the promotion of social mobility, through programs that will increase employment prospects for the underclass, will lead to geographic mobility. Wilson describes his proposed program as having a \\"hidden agenda\\" for policy makers \\"to improve the life chances of truly disadvantaged groups such as the ghetto underclass by emphasizing programs to which the more advantaged groups of all races and class backgrounds can positively relate\\". Universal programs are more easily accepted within the US' political climate than targeted programs, yet the underclass would likely experience the most benefit from universal programs. Wilson notes that some means-tested programs are still necessary, but recommends that they be framed as secondary to universal programming efforts. The following quote summarizes his policy call: =Massey and Denton's diagnosis and prescription= In their 1993 book, American Apartheid, sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton concur with much of Wilson's suggested causes and proposed solutions, but introduce racial residential segregation (as an outcome of both institutionalized and individual-level discrimination) as an explanatory factor. Massey and Denton argue that racial residential segregation is primarily an outcome of institutionalized racism in real estate and banking, coupled with, and significantly motivated by, individual-level prejudice and discrimination. They provide the following summary, Given the prominent role of segregation in the construction and maintenance of the urban underclass, Massey and Denton call for policies that promote desegregation. They provide a detailed list of policy suggestions in the closing of their book. They argue that policies aimed at desegregation need to target the private housing market, where an overwhelming majority of housing is allocated. In doing this, the authors call upon the federal government to dedicate more resources to the upholding of the Fair Housing Act, including speedy judicial action against violators (to strengthen deterrent effects of the legislation). =Mead's diagnosis and prescription= Mead argues that the core cause of the underclass problem (or at least the perpetuation of the underclass problem) is welfare. Mead argues that most welfare programs encourage social dysfunctions, including welfare dependency, illegitimate births, joblessness, and crime. For Mead, welfare is too permissive and provides benefits to the underclass without requirements for its members to change their behavior and lifestyle. Mead's diagnosis that permissive welfare is a primary cause of the underclass problem is followed by a prescription for a more authoritative welfare program that combines benefits with requirements. This proposal is often called \\"workfare\\", which requires welfare recipients to work in order to receive aid. For Mead, such a program design would evoke behavioral change since permissiveness is replaced with authority. Mead summarizes his call to replace permissive welfare with authoritative welfare: =Auletta's three typologies of solutions= Ken Auletta closes his book, The Underclass (1982), by highlighting three typologies of solutions: \\"the wholesale option\\", \\"the laissez-faire option\\", and \\"the retail option\\". The \\"wholesale option\\" includes both conservatives and liberals who are optimistic that government action can solve the underclass problem. According to Auletta, left-wing wholesale proponents call for increased public aid while right-wing wholesale proponents call for government to reduce taxes to increase jobs (inspired by trickle-down economic theory) and charge the government to \\"get tough\\" on underclass crime and welfare dependency. The \\"laissez-faire option\\" is pessimistic and its proponents are extremely wary of proposed solutions to a problem they see as unsolvable. Proponents of this perspective call for a drastic withdrawal of public aid for the underclass and are concerned with \\"quarantining the patient\\" instead of hunting for what they believe is an imaginary cure. In other words, the laissez-faire option assumes that the underclass is generally hopeless, and thus the only public effort given to them should be the bare minimum. The \\"retail option\\" includes those in between optimism and pessimism, what Auletta calls \\"skeptics\\". The retail option advocates for targeted efforts, recognizing the limits of government intervention, but is also aware of the positive impact social policy can have on efforts to fix specific problems of the underclass. This middle ground perspective requests that aid be given to members of the underclass considered to be deserving of aid, but withheld from members considered to be undeserving. However, proponents of the retail option often disagree on which members of the underclass are considered deserving and which are not. This appears to be the approach embraced by Auletta as he closes his book with reflections on some of the people he interviews throughout preceding pages. He says, \\"I have no difficulty giving up on violent criminals like the Bolden brothers or street hustlers like Henry Rivera. But knowing how a government helping hand made it possible for Pearl Dawson and William Mason to succeed, would you be willing to write them off?\\" Journalism Social scientists often point to journalism as a primary institution conceptualizing the underclass for a mass audience. Many suggest that the underclass terminology employed by American journalists in the last quarter of the twentieth-century were partial to behavioral and cultural‚Äîas opposed to a structural‚Äîdefinitions of the underclass. While journalists' use of the underclass term is vast, a few popular sources are frequently cited in the academic literature on the underclass and journalism. Ken Auletta employed the underclass term in three articles published in The New Yorker in 1981, and in book form a year later. Auletta is arguably the most read journalist of the underclass and many of his ideas, including his definition of the underclass, are included in this Wikipedia entry. Another notable journalist is Nicholas Lemann who published a handful of articles on the underclass in the Atlantic Monthly during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His 1986 writings on \\"The Origins of the Underclass\\" argue that the underclass was created by two migrations, the great migration of Southern blacks to the North and West during the early to mid twentieth century and the exodus of middle class blacks out of the ghetto during the 1970s through the early 90s. In 1991 Lemann also published an article titled \\"The Other Underclass\\", which details Puerto Ricans, and particularly Puerto Ricans residing in South Bronx, as members of the urban underclass in the US. Critiques of the concept Following the popularization of the underclass concept in both academic and journalistic writings, some academics began to overtly criticize underclass terminology. Those in opposition to the underclass concept generally argue that, on the one hand, \\"underclass\\" is a homogenizing term that simplifies a heterogeneous group, and on the other hand, the term is derogatory and demonizes the urban poor. =Derogatory and demonizing language= Many who refute the underclass concept suggest that the underclass term has been transformed into a codeword to refer to poor inner-city blacks. For example, Hilary Silver highlights a moment when David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the KKK, campaigned for Louisiana Governor by complaining about the \\"welfare underclass\\". The underclass concept has been politicized, with those from the political left arguing that joblessness and insufficient welfare provided are causes of underclass conditions while the political right employ the underclass term to refer to welfare dependency and moral decline. Many sociologists suggest that this latter rhetoric ‚Äì the right-wing perspective ‚Äì became dominant in mainstream accounts of the underclass during the later decades of the twentieth-century. Herbert Gans is one of the most vocal critics of the underclass concept. Gans suggests that American journalists, inspired partly by academic writings on the \\"culture of poverty\\", reframed underclass from a structural term (in other words, defining the underclass in reference to conditions of social/economic/political structure) to a behavioral term (in other words, defining the underclass in reference to rational choice and/or in reference to a subculture of poverty). Gans suggests that the word \\"underclass\\" has become synonymous with impoverished blacks that behave in criminal, deviant, or \\"just non-middle-class ways\\". Lo√Øc Wacquant deploys a relatively similar critique by arguing that underclass has become a blanket term that frames urban blacks as behaviorally and culturally deviant. Wacquant notes that underclass status is imposed on urban blacks from outside and above them (e.g., by journalists, politicians, and academics), stating that \\"underclass\\" is a derogatory and \\"negative label that nobody claims or invokes except to pin it on to others\\". And, although the underclass concepts is homogenizing, Wacquant argues that underclass imagery differentiates on gender lines, with the underclass male being depicted as a violent \\"gang banger\\", a physical threat to public safety, and the underclass female being generalized as \\"welfare mother\\" (also see welfare queen), a \\"moral assault on American values\\". =Homogenizing a heterogeneous group= The concept of 'the ghetto' and 'underclass' has also faced criticism empirically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time.Small, Mario. L., & McDermott, Monica. (2006). The presence of organizational resources in poor urban neighborhoods: An analysis of average and contextual effects. Social Forces, 84(3), 1697-1724. This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income and/or racial minority populations. The cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood.Logan, John, and Harvey Molotch. 1987. \\"Urban fortunes.\\" The Political Economy of Place. Berkeley, University of California To a large extent the problem with the 'ghetto' and 'underclass' concepts stem from the reliance on case studies (in particular case studies from Chicago), which confine social scientist understandings of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. =Proposed replacement terms= The charges against underclass terminology have motivated replacement terms. For example, William Julius Wilson, sympathetic to criticisms brought against underclass terminology (particularly those criticisms posited by Gans), begins to replace his use of the term underclass with \\"ghetto poor\\" during the early 1990s. For Wilson, this replacement terminology is simply an attempt to revamp the framing of inner-city poverty as being structurally rooted. He states, \\"I will substitute the term 'ghetto poor' for the term 'underclass' and hope that I will not lose any of the subtle theoretical meaning that the latter term has had in my writings.\\" See also References .

Fermin buoy in San Pedro, California and ending off Diamond Head in Hawaii, a distance of around . Started in 1906 by Clarence W. Macfarlane and hosted by Los Angeles Yacht Club, it is one of yachting's premier offshore races and attracts entrants from all over the world. The race is organized by the Transpacific Yacht Club. The race is famous for fast downwind sailing under spinnaker in the trade winds.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603027/Transpacific-Race Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Notable records Mighty Merloe *Fully Crewed Multihull Elapsed time: Mighty Merloe (ORMA 60 trimaran), 2017 of 4 days, 6 hours, 32 minutes, 30 seconds. *Comanche crossing the Diamond Head finish line in 2017Fully Crewed Monohull Elapsed time: Comanche, 2017 of 5 days, 1 hours, 55 minutes, 26 seconds. *Double Handed: Pegasus 50, 2009, sailed by Philippe Kahn and Mark Christensen, set a new record of 7 days, 19 hours, 38 minutes and 35 seconds. In 1969, French sailing legend Eric Tabarly shadowed the race with his Pen Duick IV, one of the world's first trimarans competitive in all wind conditions. He originally intended to enter the race but was unaware that multihulls were not invited. Having started with all other participants, Tabarly and his crew set an unofficial record of 8 days and 13 hours, almost a day ahead of official winner and record-setter Blackfin. In 2013, the fully crewed monohull, Dorade, won first overall, making it the oldest boat in the fleet to win and a 2-time winner, having won the Transpac in 1936, 77 years prior. The 2019 edition of the race, its fiftieth, saw the sinking of a yacht for the first time in its history, when the 68 foot mono-hulled sailboat Santa Cruz 70 OEX suffered rudder damage and an uncontrollable water intrusion. The crew was rescued by another racing boat. This edition also saw the greatest number of skippers dropping out of the race. Record history S/Y Ragtime, the 1973 & 1975 Transpac Winner Ragtime finished first in 1973 and again in 1975. Merlin approaching Diamond Head in 2017 In 1977, the yacht Merlin, designed by Bill Lee, set an elapsed time record of 8 days, 11 hours, 1 minute. This record would stand for 20 years. Ending Merlin's record, in the 1997 race a new monohull elapsed time record of 7 days, 11 hours, 41 minutes, and 27 seconds was set by Roy E. Disney's Pyewacket, a Santa Cruz 70 ultralight also designed by Bill Lee. The record fell once again in 2005, with Hasso Plattner's Morning Glory, a maxZ86 from Germany. Morning Glory was the scratch boat when it led a five-boat assault on the record for monohulls. She finished the race in 6 days, 16 hours, 4 minutes, and 11 seconds to win \\"the Barn Door\\" trophy, a slab of carved koa wood traditionally awarded to the monohull with the fastest elapsed time. In 1995, multihulls were invited to participate for the first time, but not eligible for the Barn Door trophy. Steve Fosset set a new race record in 1995 on his 60' trimaran Lakota, of 6 days 16 hours 7 minutes 16 seconds. Two years later in 1997, this record was broken by the 86' catamaran Explorer with a time of 5 days 9 hours 18 minutes 26 seconds. 2017 saw Howard Enloe and his boat the Mighty Merloe smash the record by over 25 hours making the trip in just over 4 days. Charley, the 1983 Transpac Winner On July 7, 2009, Alfa Romeo II beat the Morning Glory record for best day's run set in the 2005 race, by sailing in 24 hours. The next two days she broke her own best-day record by sailing Based on distance covered in preceding 24 hours as of 6AM on day of report. and . First to finish the 2009 Transpac, Alfa Romeo II set a Transpac race elapsed-time record of 5 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, 20 seconds. This represents a new race record for monohulls; the multihull record of 5 days, 9 hours, 18 minutes, set by Bruno Peyron in the 1997 race, remains. However, because she must use \\"stored power\\"Refer to the RRS 51 and 52 (a diesel engine) to move, Alfa Romeo II, sailing in the \\"unlimited\\" class, was not eligible for the traditional \\"Barn Door\\" trophy, but instead was the inaugural winner of a new trophy dedicated by Trisha Steele, called the \\"Merlin Trophy\\".

The term is defunct as of 1970, but still is occasionally used to refer to Highway Contract Routes or HCRs which replaced the Star routes.National Postal Museum. What is a Star Route?. Retrieved 2007-05-08. The term is mostly used in connection with a series of scandals in the 1870s involving bribes to postal officials.J. Martin Klotsche, \\"The Star Route Cases.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 22.3 (1935): 407-418. online Background Prior to 1845, transportation of inland mail, other than by railroad, was given to bidders who offered stage or coach service. This was abolished by act of Congress on March 3, 1845, which provided that the postmaster-general should lease all such contracts to the lowest bidder who tendered sufficient guarantee of faithful performance, without any conditions, except to provide for due celerity, certainty and security of transportation. These bids became known as \\"celerity, certainty and security bids\\" and were designated on the route registers by three stars (***), thus becoming known as \\"star routes.\\" Star Route Frauds The Star Route Frauds scandal involved a lucrative 19th century scheme whereby postal officials received bribes in exchange for awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas. An investigation into the Star Routes corruption took place under President James A. Garfield in 1881. Two previous congressional investigations into the Star Route frauds had occurred in 1872 and 1876 during the Grant Administration. The 1872 investigation results had been tainted by bribery, while the 1876 investigation managed to shut down the Star Route frauds temporarily. A resurgence of graft took place in 1878 in the Hayes Administration, continuing into the Garfield Administration. Among the major players involved were some of the large contractors, the ex-US Representative Bradley Barlow of Vermont, the Second Assistant Postmaster- General, some of the subordinates in the department, and Arkansas Senator Stephen W. Dorsey, who became Secretary of the Republican National Committee during James A. Garfield's 1880 presidential campaign. After Garfield's death by assassination, President Chester A. Arthur pursued the investigation. A federal prosecution and trial took place in 1882, that was finally able to shut down the postal ring. Although the fraudulent scheme was widespread, there were few convictions. Many of the defendants in the Star Routes trials were successfully defended by noted lawyer and orator, Robert Ingersoll.Ingersoll, Robert. Opening remarks to the jury in the second Star Routes trial December 21, 1882. Retrieved 2007-05-08. Public disgust over the Star Routes graft served as an impetus for civil service reform and the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883. Post-abolition Star Routes, now known as Highway Contract Routes (or HCRs) as of 1970, have become a mode of delivering mail directly to customers. Historically, Highway Contract Routes were used rarely for mail delivery to households. An exception was in rural areas with less than one customer per mile. In modern usage, HCRs can be used anywhere to deliver mail directly to customers. They are often used to deliver mail in growth areas such as new housing tracts. Some of these routes are being started in areas where there are as few as 20 deliveries per day. Since 2000, the US Postal Service has added the term \\"Contract Delivery Service\\" (CDS) as their newest version of the Star Route. These routes are established to serve newly-created urban communities. CDS carriers do not transport mail, and are being used in an attempt to find delivery drivers who will work for less than USPS carrier wages. As of 2007, several thousand of these CDS routes have been created, with plans for far more. Many contractors are no longer individuals wanting to transport mail between post offices, or to deliver mail in a remote community where they live. This new concentration of more urban contract routes has made it practical for businesses to bid on multiple contracts, and then seek workers who will work those routes for less money than the US Postal Service pays on each contract. The US Postal Service is still attempting to find an equilibrium between the dependability of career postal carriers and the cost savings of contractors acting as a temp agency. There is some debate as to how much control the Postal Service can exercise over these contract routes and have them remain contractors. Exactly where the line is that will mark the difference between an HCR being a contractor and an employee is not clear.Akerman Senterfitt Attorneys.

The Mitchells also held mining rights to the area and dug several prospect holes and tunnels, some of which are still visible. The area became a state park in 1956. The surrounding lands became a part of the National Park Service Mojave National Preserve in 1994, but the caves are still owned and operated by the state of California. Cavern tours The \\"Tecopa\\" and \\"El Pakiva\\" caves are connected by a man-made tunnel and are open to guided tours led by California State Park rangers. These caves are the only limestone caves in the California State Park system.http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=615. In January 2011, due to California's budget crisis, all tours were suspended and the Providence Mountains State Recreation Area closed. Vandalism plagued the caverns' visitor center and installations after their closure. Over a long period, major infrastructure upgrades took place. Mitchell Caverns and Providence Mountains SRA reopened, and the caverns resumed tours, on November 3, 2017, after being closed for nearly seven years.\\"Reopening\\" http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=615 See also *Providence Mountains State Recreation Area *Mojave National Preserve References * http://Desertusa.com - Mitchell Caverns article. * Robert P.

She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was notable for the actions of her captain in 1807, which were emblematic of the tensions that later erupted in the War of 1812 between Britain and America. She was wrecked in 1814. Construction and commissioning She was first ordered on 16 October 1775, named on 13 November 1775 and laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard in January 1776. She was reordered in May 1785, ten years after having first been laid down, and construction began at Sheerness Dockyard on 7 May 1785. Work was at first overseen by Master Shipwright Martin Ware until December 1785, and after that, by John Nelson until March 1786, when William Rule took over. She was launched from Sheerness on 24 April 1790, and was completed by 26 May 1790. She was commissioned for service in June that year under her first commander, Captain John Blankett.

On 22 August 1800 Leopard captured Clarice. Because Leopard served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March ‚Äì 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants. =Napoleonic Wars= Leopard left Britain on 30 March 1806 as escort to a convoy that included , , , , and .

In an attempt to recover the British deserters, Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, commanding Leopard, hailed Chesapeake and requested permission to search her. Commodore James Barron of Chesapeake refused and Leopard opened fire. Caught unprepared, Barron surrendered and Humphreys sent boarders to search for the deserters. The boarding party seized four deserters from the Royal Navy‚Äìthree Americans and one British-born sailor‚Äìand took them to Halifax, where the British sailor, Jenkin Ratford, was hanged for desertion. The Americans were initially sentenced to 500 lashes, but had their sentence commuted; Britain also offered to return them to America. The incident caused severe political repercussions in the United States, and nearly led to the two nations going to war.The Chesapeake / Leopard Affair of 1807 Leopard escorted a convoy from Portsmouth on 6 May 1808.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4290.

Fate In 1812, Leopard had her guns removed and was converted to a troopship. On 28 June 1814 she was en route from Britain to Quebec, carrying a contingent of 475 Royal Scots Guardsmen, when she grounded on Anticosti Island in heavy fog. Leopard was destroyed, but all on board survived. Leopard in fiction In Patrick O'Brian's novel Desolation Island, the fifth book of the Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series, Jack Aubrey commands Leopard on a cruise through the Atlantic and Indian oceans after the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, a voyage which included the sinking of the fictional Dutch ship of the line Waakzaamheid, and a disastrous collision with an iceberg. In the sixth book, The Fortune of War, the ship is left at a British station in the Dutch East Indies, unable to support her complement of guns. She is called the \\"horrible old Leopard\\" in the fourth book in the series The Mauritius Command, and in other books in the series, and ends its days as a store ship sailing from the English Channel to the Baltic.The Letter of Marque, O'Brian, Patrick (1988) Game developer Lucas Pope based the layout of the titular ship in his game Return of the Obra Dinn on the layout of HMS Leopard.

The following is a list of the messaging applications which were developed for Nintendo's consoles. PictoChat is a communication utility that comes pre-installed on the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi consoles. Up to sixteen people can paint and/or text chat with each other using it, connected wirelessly through a LAN-only, system-to-system wireless connection. It allows for simple input of keyboard text and written text/drawings. PictoChat received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival. = Functions = Interface The Nintendo DS touch screen is used to type in letters with an on- screen keyboard or to draw and send pictures. Text can also be manually placed on the screen, if the user drags the selected character onto the message area. Messages sent from the DS or DS Lite appear in black, while DSi systems feature an additional \\"rainbow\\" pen (see the last paragraph of functions). The pen tool offers small and large sizes. The keyboard provides enough Latin and kana glyphs to write in all languages supported by the system: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese, plus Hungarian, Finnish, Portuguese and Dutch. The PictoChat system can only send messages in a radius of 10 meters. PictoChat displays the name and message managed in System Settings to all the users in the same chat room. Four chat rooms (A, B, C & D) are available at one time, each with a capacity of sixteen people, for a maximum of sixty-four people in total of all the chat rooms. PictoChat is preloaded onto all Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo DSi, and Nintendo DSi XL units worldwide. On the DSi versions of PictoChat, a rainbow pen can be used by tapping on the pen icon again once it has been selected. Content created using the rainbow pen can be read by PictoChat users on Nintendo DS Lite and original Nintendo DS systems. Additionally, the DS and DS Lite play a special sound when receiving a message written by a DSi user. The console plays a special sound and displays a special message when a user joins on their birthday. =Super Smash Bros. appearances= A stage based on PictoChat appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Another stage called \\"PictoChat 2\\" appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, and is exclusive to the portable variant. An HD version of \\"PictoChat 2\\" returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. = PictoChat animation = Although not an official function, PictoChat has been used to create short animations by drawing individual pictures on the Nintendo DS's touch screen and sending them frame by frame to the message board on the top screen. By pressing and holding down the left shoulder button and right shoulder button respectively to scroll through the pictures, it shows them at a frame rate of 7.5 frames per second, creating the illusion of animation. Several online galleries are dedicated to sharing PictoChat animations. = Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten = The Nintendo DS kanji- English-Japanese dictionary contains an extension to PictoChat that allows users to input kanji characters in addition to the standard character set. This version of PictoChat also vocalized roman characters and kana when they are input. This software is only available in Japan and is the only type of PictoChat that can be used on Nintendo 3DS consoles without modification.  Wii Message Board  The Wii Message Board allows users to leave messages for friends, family members, or other users on a calendar-based message board. Users could also use WiiConnect24 to trade messages and pictures with other Wii owners, conventional email accounts (email pictures to console, but not pictures to email), and mobile phones (through text messages). Each Wii has an individual wii.com email account containing the Wii Number. Prior to trading messages it is necessary to add and approve contacts in the address book, although the person added will not get an automatic notification of the request, and must be notified by other means. The service also alerts all users of incoming game-related information. The Wii Message Board was available for users to post messages that are available to other Wii users by usage of Wii Numbers with WiiConnect24. In addition to writing text, players could also include images from an SD card in the body of messages, as well as attaching a Mii to the message. Announcements of software updates and video game news was posted by Nintendo. The Message Board can be used for posting memos for oneself or for family members without going online. These messages could then be put on any day of the calendar. The Wii Message Board could also be updated automatically by a real-time game like Animal Crossing: City Folk. Wii Sports, Wii Play, Mario Kart Wii, Wii Speak Channel, Wii Sports Resort, Super Mario Galaxy & Super Mario Galaxy 2 use the Message Board to update the player on any new high scores or gameplay advancements, such as medal placements in the former two titles, completions of races including a photo, audio messages, and letters from the Mailtoad via the Wii message board. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros Brawl, Elebits, Animal Crossing: City Folk, Dewy's Adventure and the Virtual Console game Pok√©mon Snap allow players to take screenshots and post them to the Message Board to edit later or send to friends via messages. Except for Nintendo GameCube games, the Message Board also records the play history in the form of \\"Today's Accomplishments\\". This feature automatically records details of what games or applications were played and for how long. It cannot be deleted or hidden without formatting the console itself. Subsequent system updates added a number of minor features to the Message Board, including minor aesthetic changes, USB keyboard support and the ability to receive Internet links from friends, which can be launched in the Internet Channel. The Wii Message Board is partially supported on Wii U via Wii Mode. Players can still receive internal messages from various Wii games that support this feature. Since the Wii U neither supports WiiConnect24, nor has its own Wii Friend Code, it cannot receive messages from or send messages to other sources or players. Consequently, the Wii U's Wii Message Board lacks an Address Book. Additionally, the WiiConnect24 service has no longer available as of June 28, 2013, completely ceasing data exchange functionality of the Wii Message Board for all Wii consoles themselves, whether as messages or game data. The Wii Message Board is partially succeeded by the Notifications app on both Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, albeit the app does not support sending messages. It is also partially succeeded by the Activity Log app on the same consoles in terms of recording and saving historic data based on the user's activity and game play.  Wii Speak Channel  Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box Swapdoodle On November 17, 2016, without any prior announcements, Nintendo released a Nintendo 3DS app, via Nintendo eShop in North America, Europe, and Australia, called Swapdoodle, a spiritual successor to 2011's Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box. It was eventually released in Japan on November 22, 2016 under the name . Swapdoodle is largely similar to Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box in many aspects, including the latter's discontinued online ability to share stereoscopic 3D handwritten or drawn messages with anyone listed on the Nintendo 3DS friends list, as well as receive special messages from Nintendo. Swapdoodle also features an online store where users can download mostly paid DLC, which include additional pen effects, message space, stationary, and simple drawing lessons of various Nintendo characters. The app itself is free to download. Unlike Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box, Swapdoodle only allows the exchange of native in-game screenshots, but not generic picture and audio files. Additionally, Swapdoodle does not support StreetPass or any ability for wireless LAN exchange of messages.  Wii U Chat  was Wii U's online chat solution, powered by the Nintendo Network.Wii U Chat Application Spotted On Packaging . Pure Nintendo. Retrieved on 2013-08-23. The service allowed users to use the Wii U GamePad's front-facing camera to video chat with registered friends. While video chatting, only the Wii U GamePad is needed, since on the TV, the same picture as in the GamePad's is shown. Users could have also drawn on the GamePad during a chat session.http://www.nintendo.com/wiiu/videos/waruwaruplazza-&-Wii-U-Chat If there is a game or another application already running, the Wii U GamePad's HOME button ring will flash indicating that there is an incoming call. The idea of the feature was originally seen in the introduction trailer of the Wii U in E3 2011. However, users won't also be able to use the service as a multitasking application, therefore not having the ability to make video calls without interrupting game play. Wii U Chat arrived in a \\"day one\\" update on the same day the Wii U launched. On August 29, 2017, Nintendo announced the worldwide discontinuation of the Wii U Chat service on November 8, 2017 at 3:00 pm JST, the same date Miiverse was discontinued.  Similar software  A DS game called Ping Pals is based on PictoChat, featuring an advanced range of options and capabilities. However, both users must own the game, making it less useful and widespread than PictoChat. Due to PictoChat being built into the system, Ping Pals received very negative reviews. Clubhouse Games (42-All Time Classics in Europe) has a chat function similar to PictoChat, with added colors and extra features. The game LOL has a similar interface to PictoChat but the gameplay itself is different. A voice and text chat messenger app known as Chat-A-Lot, known in Japan as , was originally released in Japan on July 24, 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS eShop, and was later released in North America on November 20, 2014, and in Europe on February 19, 2015. The app features many attributes from both PictoChat and Swapnote. It was developed by Japan-based WaiS Co. Ltd. and published by The Location Inc. in Japan and Teyon in North America and Europe, and costs ¬•1000/$7.99/‚Ç¨7.99/¬£7.19 to download. Despite its features and use of emojis, the app was poorly received due to consistent lag time for a paid app. (Official website) The games Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Animal Crossing: New Horizons have a messaging feature where if two players are online at the same time and are registered as best friends within each other's system, they can send messages to each other, even if they are not in the same town/island, respectively.

It is located in the eastern end of the city, in the suburb of Scarborough. It is roughly bounded by Scarborough Golf Club Road and a branch of Highland Creek on the west, the CNR railway tracks and Lake Ontario on the south, and Highland Creek on the north-east. The name comes from its elevated position on the west side of Highland Creek, a deep glacial ravine. The section east of Manse Road, which roughly splits this neighbourhood in half, is often now referred to as the Manse Valley neighbourhood. It has less commercial development and more industrial development than the western part of the neighbourhood. However, both parts were treated as part of West Hill prior to development. History Highland Creek. The building was erected in 1851. In the mid 19th century, what is now West Hill was part of the larger Highland Creek community, which extended from today's Galloway Rd over to the Pickering border. In 1862, Eli Shackleton took over as postmaster in Highland Creek and moved the post office from the east side of the Highland Creek valley to the west. Following Shackleton's tenure as postmaster, the post office was relocated back to the east side of the valley. In 1879, John Richardson opened a new post office on the west side of the valley officially known as \\"West Hill\\".Schofield, Richard, \\"Post offices sparked early rivalry\\", The Toronto Star (Scarborough Edition), October 6, 1980 From 1906 until the closing of the line in 1936, West Hill was the eastern terminus of the Toronto and Scarborough Electric Railway, a street-car line. West Hill Public School is one of the oldest in Toronto, a school having been built on the present site in the 1880s, although the original building was replaced by a modern facility in 1994. West Hill Collegiate Institute is also an older high school in Scarborough, having been opened in 1955. Until after World War II, West Hill was largely rural, although the stretch of Kingston Road (including what is now Old Kingston Road) running through it had some commercial development, some even dating back to the late 19th century. The neighbourhood's oldest remaining buildings tend to be along this stretch. In the 1950s the neighbourhood was still difficult to reach by road, except for access to the south-west towards the city because even at this point Kingston Road was a four-lane highway. However, access to the direct east and west had to navigate Highland Creek and required a steep descent and ascent. There was no access across the creek across Morningside. However, the main bus commuter bus route from downtown Toronto to Oshawa ran directly along Kingston Road as well. As such, early development in the neighbourhood clustered around Kingston Road starting in the 1950s. The first subdivisions stretched along the straight north-south roads running off Kingston Road, primarily those existing road allowances which were close together and allowed for back-to-back lots with minimum frontage and depth. Larger plots of land that were developed in the late 1950s through the 1970s tended to be laid out with curved roads, short connecting roads and dead end streets that made for quieter neighbourhoods but resulted in irregular lot sizes. =Development (1960‚Äìpresent)= Before the completion of Highway 401 in the 1960s, West Hill was one of the major shopping areas in the region. In the 1950s, it served communities as far away as Oshawa. However, as development spread east and north along the new highway, major commercial developments became less viable. A major regional shopping centre, Morningside Mall, built in the late 1970s, was left without a major tenant when Wal-Mart, Dominion, and Shoppers Drug Mart abandoned the mall. Morningside Mall was completely demolished as of late 2007, and has been replaced by Morningside Crossing, a plaza. Another change occasioned by the building of Highway 401 was a drop in business for the large number of motels lining Kingston Road. Most of the motel sites have been redeveloped as commercial sites, and many of the remaining motels serve as temporary housing for Toronto's homeless. The neighbourhood grew quickly and by the mid-1960s there were several new public schools to serve the new residents, who were generally young families drawn to the lower home prices in the area. The area's K-6 and K-8 public schools, Galloway Road, Eastview, Peter Secor, William G. Miller, and Heron Park, were all built in this period, as was the separate school, St. Martin de Porres. By the 1970s, two technical high schools, Sir Robert Borden and Maplewood, had joined West Hill C.I., as did Joseph Brant, a senior public school that accepted grades 7-8 from three feeder schools. At the times of the earliest developments, sanitary sewer service had not been extended this far east. House lots generally had to be large to accommodate septic tanks. Development was largely limited to single family homes and low rise apartment blocks. Guildwood GO Station was opened in 1967, allowing for direct commuter connections to Downtown Toronto. Road and traffic access to the neighbourhood quickly improved. During the 1960s, new bridges were built spanning the deep sections of Highland Creek on Lawrence, Morningside and Kingston. This allowed direct access to the new Highway 401 to the east and west. The introduction of the GO Train at Guildwood Station allowed direct commuter connections into the city. The completion of the Bloor-Danforth subway line to Warden Station allowed more frequent TTC bus service into the neighbourhood. Service improved again when the subway was extended to Kennedy Station Commercial development centered around the triangle where Kingston, Lawrence and Morningside met, and spread out along Kingston Road and parts of Morningside Avenue. In the south-eastern part of the neighbourhood, there was industrial development along Coronation Drive, mostly catering to the chemical industry. City services continued to improve and in the 1970s high rise apartment buildings were introduced. Most homes in the neighbourhood were upgraded to have both storm and sanitary sewers. This allowed redevelopment of many larger lots to allow more homes in existing space. By the late 1970s, almost all the land in the neighbourhood had been developed. Development peaked in the late 1970s with the building of Morningside Mall, an enclosed mall built on the site of a strip plaza, anchored by Woolco and Dominion. High-rise apartment buildings were erected in West Hill during the 1970s, largely along Kingston Road. However, although the development of the neighbourhood continued into the 1980s, its character started to change as many of the original residents started to age and residential patterns in Scarborough started to change. Commercial development in the Morningside and Malvern neighbourhoods improved, and residents who used to come to West Hill to shop now no longer had to do so. It was clear that Toronto was overbuilt with shopping centers and Morningside Mall started only to draw from the immediate neighbourhood as larger nearby malls such as Cedarbrae Mall and Scarborough Town Centre had better road access. As such, recent re-development in the neighbourhood has been centred along the commercial areas surrounding Kingston Road. Disused commercial properties are often redeveloped as high density residential townhouses. Home prices in the neighbourhood generally remain below average for the City of Toronto as a whole despite the average size of homes (predominately two-bedroom bungalows) and larger lot sizes. In addition, the neighbourhood's population is slowly shrinking as the resident per home average continues to drop. Newcomers to the neighbourhood tend to be younger families looking for inexpensive housing in the city with convenient commuting connections. Education West Hill Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school situated in West Hill. Maplewood High School is a public vocational high school. Sir Robert L. Borden Business and Technical Institute uses to be served as a technical school in the area. Three public school boards operate in West Hill, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TCDSB are separate public school boards, whereas CSV, and TDSB are secular public school boards, with the former being French first language school board, and the latter being English first language school board. TDSB operates two active secondary school in the neighbourhood, West Hill Collegiate Institute. It was constructed in 1954 and opened to 376 students on September 6, 1955. Schools in West Hill that are operated by public school boards include: *Acad√©mie Alexandre-Dumas (CSV) *Eastview Public School *Galloway Public School *Jack Miner Senior Public School *Poplar Road Junior Public school *St. Malachy Catholic School *St. Martin de Porres Catholic School *William G. Miller Public School (TDSB) *Joseph Brant Public School was opened in 1969 as a senior school named after Joseph Brant the Mohawk leader. Since 2012, the school operates from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 after the closure of two feeder schools: the adjacent Heron Park Junior Public School and Peter Secor Junior Public School. *Maplewood High School is a junior vocational secondary school opened in 1967 modeled after Tabor Park Vocational School. It is a specialized school providing students with special needs. *Sir Robert L. Borden Business and Technical Institute was built in 1965 and opened in 1966. This school, like Bendale, offered many business-oriented and technical courses in addition to academic programs. After the school closed in 2016, the TDSB retained ownership of the building pending its sale. Recreation Morningside Park is one of three municipal parks that surrounds West Hill along its northern boundaries. West Hill is bordered on three sides by the Highland Creek, the community is surrounded by a system of parks. Morningside Park, and Colonel Danforth Park are located along the creek, while East Point Park is located along Lake Ontario at the eastern end of the Scarborough Bluffs. Parks in West Hill are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The area has numerous sports facilities, including an indoor arena and a baseball diamond at Heron Park, and two swimming pools, one of which is indoor. There are tennis facilities at nearby University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. Other public amenities includes the Morningside branch of the Toronto Public Library, built further east of the former site at Morningside Mall, roughly at the geographical centre of the neighbourhood, on Lawrence Avenue, just west of Manse Road. West Hill has a good mix of commercial establishments far more typical of an older neighbourhood than a new suburb. Fast food establishments do not dominate and there are many sit-down restaurants featuring a variety of cuisines including, Canadian Chinese, Caribbean and Middle Eastern, echoing the ethnic diversity of the neighbourhood. There are two supermarkets and numerous smaller food outlets. The area is well served by physicians, dentists and lawyers and features three pharmacies, including both major chains. Transportation The main routes through West Hill are Kingston Road (part of the former Highway 2), Morningside Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East. The Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) bus service provides public transportation through the neighbourhood, operating on all the major streets in the area, allowing access to TTC's Line 2 Bloor-Danforth subway at Kennedy station and the Line 3 Scarborough at Lawrence East station. Located along the boundary of Guildwood and West Hill is Guildwood GO Station. The station provides access to GO Transit's commuter rail and bus services, as well as Via Rail's intercity rail routes.

As the Governor-General is bound by convention to follow the advice of the Executive Council on almost all occasions, the Executive Council has de jure executive power. This power is used to legally enact the decisions of the Cabinet (the de facto body of executive power), which under conventions of the Westminster system has no de jure authority. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. The Federal Executive Council is the Australian equivalent of executive councils in other Commonwealth realms, and is similar to the privy councils of Canada and the United Kingdom (although unlike the UK privy council, the Leader of the Opposition is not typically a member). Composition The Australian Federal Executive Council consists of all current and former Commonwealth Ministers and Assistant Ministers (previously called parliamentary secretaries). Members of the Executive Council are referred to as Councillors and are entitled to the style 'The Honourable'. Section 64 of the Constitution stipulates that when a Minister is appointed, that Minister shall also become a member of the Executive Council. There is no provision for such membership to come to an end, but only those Ministers in the current ministry who are invited to take part in meetings are in practice actually involved in Council activities. The Governor-General presides over meetings of the Executive Council, but is not a member. A Member of the Cabinet is appointed to hold the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council to act as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General, at no additional salary or allowance. The appointment of Sir James Killen to this post in 1982 was controversial because the office was seen as a sinecure given that he held no Ministerial portfolio. He was nevertheless considered a member of the Ministry by virtue of this office, and he even administered a small, short-lived department (the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council; such a department also existed for two months in 1971 under Sir Alan Hulme, who was simultaneously Postmaster- General). The Governor-General has the power to dismiss any member of the Executive Council, but that power is rarely exercised in practice. It might be exercised if, hypothetically, a minister or former minister were convicted of a serious criminal offence. One notable case was that of the Queensland Senator Glen Sheil. Malcolm Fraser's government was re-elected at the 1977 election on 10 December, and on 19 December he publicly announced the ministry he would be recommending to the Governor-General, which included Senator Sheil as the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Sheil was sworn in as an Executive Councillor but, prior to the scheduled swearing-in of the Ministry, he made public statements about apartheid that were at odds with the government's attitude to the issue. Fraser then advised Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen not to include Sheil in the ministry‚Äîadvice that Cowen was required by convention to follow. Sheil's appointment as an Executive Councillor without portfolio was terminated on 22 December.Gavin Souter, Acts of Parliament, p. 624 Meetings Meetings of the Executive Council do not require the Governor-General's attendance, but the Governor-General must be notified of the meeting in order for it to be valid. A quorum for meetings is the Governor-General and two serving ministers or assistant ministers. If the Governor-General is not in attendance, quorum is the Vice-President and two serving ministers or assistant ministers. In the absence of the Vice- President, quorum is three ministers, one of whom, a senior minister, will preside. In practice, meetings will only be attended by a small number of Councillors rather than the full Cabinet. Most of the powers vested in the Governor-General, such as appointments and the authorisation of budgets, are exercisable only by \\"the Governor-General in Council\\" ‚Äì that is, under advice from the Federal Executive Council. The Council acts as a formal ratification body for decisions of the Cabinet. In a parallel manner to the Royal Assent given to legislative Acts by the Governor-General after they have passed both Houses of Parliament, proposed executive actions will receive the approval of the Governor-General in Council after they have been agreed to by the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

The costs of the original design, and controversy over the decision to change its structure from concrete to steel, have led to a legal battle, in an attempt to recover some of the costs. It was later moved to a plot of land adjacent to the harbour, on the site of a boarding house where Turner once stayed. The building was designed by David Chipperfield, whose design for the 3 storey, high gallery has been criticized for being \\"alien, brutal and bleak\\". It was built on the raised promenade following a flood risk analysis. Construction started in 2008, and was completed for opening in April 2011, at a cost of ¬£17.5 million. The gallery opened on 16 April 2011. 14,000 people visited in the first weekend and 500,000 in its first year.Beached and hard to reach In August 2013 the gallery received its millionth visitor. The scheme has been supported by the artist Tracey Emin, who was brought up in Margate and opened it, and various funding bodies including Kent County Council, with a ¬£6.4 million contribution, Thanet District Council, who provided the land, South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), who provided ¬£4 million, the Arts Council England with support to the value of ¬£4.1 million and the European Union. It is the largest dedicated visual arts venue in Kent. It is a registered charity under English law. In November 2011, the venue received an award from the British Guild of Travel Writers, for an outstanding tourism project. Queen Elizabeth II visited Turner Contemporary on 11 November 2011, as part of a wider trip to Margate. The gallery has been criticised for emphasising cultural consumption and economic regeneration to the detriment of local residents. In particular, research points out that, despite claims to anchor creative production, Turner Contemporary has failed to engage with local artists, and that the gallery underpins the erosion of the town's local peculiarity leading to concerns that \\"the features of the ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô seaside were threatened by regeneration, and that the town may become a highly gentrified locale like, for example, parts of Brighton or Whitstable.\\"  Gallery  Turner Contemporary gallery.jpgTurner Contemporary Turner Contemporary front.jpgTurner Contemporary Turner Contemporary- seafront.jpgTurner Contemporary Turner contemporary April 2010 from north.jpgConstruction April 2010 from the north Turner contemporary April 2010 from south.jpgConstruction April 2010 from the harbour Turner Contemporary construction.JPGUnder construction in 2009 Turner Contemporary roofscape.jpgClose up of the roof References External links * Turner Contemporary * Detailed description of the project Category:2001 establishments in England Category:Art museums established in 2001 Category:Art museums and galleries in Kent Category:Arts centres in England Category:Charities based in England Category:Contemporary art galleries in England Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 2011 Category:David Chipperfield buildings Category:J.

This species was first described by Hugh Edwin Strickland.  Range  It breeds in southern Turkey and southern Iran, and winters around the Red Sea in north-eastern Africa and Yemen. A few isolated populations just about maintain a foothold within European borders, on islands in the Aegean Sea.  Habitat  The cinereous bunting breeds on dry stony mountain slopes.  Description  The cinereous bunting is a large (16‚Äì17 cm), slim bunting with a long, white-cornered tail. The term cinereous describes its colouration. It is less streaked than many buntings and has a thick pale bill. It has a greyish back with only subdued dark markings, and a browner tint to the wings. The adult male's head is dull yellow, with a brighter moustachial line and throat. In the nominate race of south-west Turkey, the rest of the underparts are grey, but the eastern form E. c. semenowi has yellow underparts. Females are brownish grey above with a whitish throat and yellow only in the moustachial stripe. Young birds have a plain pale belly and streaking on the breast.  Foraging and breeding  Like other buntings, the cinereous bunting feeds principally on seeds. It takes insects especially when feeding its young. Its normal clutch is three eggs.  Song  The call is a harsh tschrip, and the song is a hoarse zru- zru-zru-zru.

Geography  Gracemere is approximately west of the city of Rockhampton. Because of the proximity of the town to Rockhampton, Gracemere has become a dormitory town, with many residents commuting the short distance to work in the city. History Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1853, when the Archer brothers arrived looking for pastures for their sheep. They settled by a small lake, originally called \\"Farris\\" or Padgole lagoon which was named Gracemere in 1855. The name Gracemere comes from \\"Grace\\", the name of Thomas Archer's wife and \\"mere\\" which is a Scottish term for lake. They also located a suitable landing point for supplies on the nearby Fitzroy River, which later became Rockhampton. In July 1855, Charles and Thomas Archer with around 30 other people including four Native Police troopers, four Aboriginal men from the Burnett River and their wives, left the Archer's Eidsvold pastoral station in order to construct the Gracemere run. The Commissioner for Crown Lands in the Leichhardt region, William Wiseman, joined them to help locate the most appropriate area, and in August 1855 they determined the area next to the current Gracemere lagoon was best. The local Aboriginals led by \\"King Harold\\" wished to obtain peaceful conditions with the Archer brothers and in return for allowing the indigenous people to live in the area, the Archer brothers utilised Harold's people to aid in forcibly \\"restraining the outside blacks\\" who were resisting British occupation. Gracemere State School opened on 20 February 1871. As Gracemere developed as a dormitory town, further schools were needed with Waraburra State School opening on 27 January 1987 and St Paul's Catholic Primary School opening on 27 January 1988. At the 2011 census, Gracemere had a population of 8,401. Heritage listings Gracemere has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 234 Gracemere Road: Gracemere Homestead Construction and industry Gracemere, as a commuter town, has a relatively low level of industry compared to Rockhampton. Grazing, particularly of beef cattle, has long been the significant industry of the area. The Central Queensland Livestock Exchange, located on the western side of the town, is the largest cattle sales facility in the Southern Hemisphere and commenced a multimillion- dollar upgrade in 2010. A new shopping centre, Gracemere Shoppingworld, located just off the Capricorn Highway opened in December 2014 with Woolworths and Best & Less operating as the anchor stores along with up to 20 speciality stores. Gracemere is rapidly expanding with around 10 new housing estates under construction. Education There are three schools servicing Gracemere. They are all primary, one Catholic and two public. Gracemere State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at O'Shanesy Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 302 students with 23 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 16 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Waraburra State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 55 Johnson Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 492 students with 34 teachers (33 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (16 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. St Paul's Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Breakspear Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 310 students with 19 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent). There are no secondary schools in Gracemere, the nearest is Rockhampton State High School in Wandal, Rockhampton. Currently, all high school students travel by a free bus service into Rockhampton to continue their senior education.  Amenities  The Rockhampton Regional Council operate a public library in Gracemere at 1 Ranger Street. This library opened in August 2017. It was welcomed by local residents as Gracemere was formerly in the Shire of Fitzroy which had no public libraries. The Gracemere branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the Guide Hut in James Street. Transport As a dormitory town, most Gracemerians either drive a private vehicle or catch a bus to the city. The bus service, Young's Bus Service, operates hourly between the town centre and South Gracemere. Traffic can peak at around 8:00 in the morning, with traffic being banked up for around 1-1.5 kilometers on weekdays. Infrastructure problems are now becoming a reality for the small town and surrounding Capricorn Highway towns. This has resulted in constant roadworks and upgrades of the highway road quality. This mass influx of vehicles has resulted in a proposal for a new western bypass for Rockhampton, to send vehicles right to the northern suburbs, avoiding inner city congestion and delay, as this is where many Gracemerians work.

It is currently owned and managed by the family of Albert R. Broccoli, the co-initiator of the popular film franchise. Eon Productions, the production company responsible for producing the James Bond films, is a subsidiary of Danjaq. History =Founding= Danjaq S.A. was founded by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman after the release of the first James Bond film Dr. No, in 1962, to ensure all future films in the series. The new company was to be called Danjaq, a combination of Broccoli and Saltzman's respective wives' names (Dana Broccoli and Jacqueline Saltzman). The company was originally domiciled in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland, hence the appearance of \\"S.A.\\" letters in first legal name of company. In 1962, Danjaq began its association with United Artists. =Ownership= Due to a series of failed business interests, Harry Saltzman's personal financial difficulties forced him to sell his 50% share of Danjaq to United Artists in 1975. In 1986, Albert and Dana Broccoli acquired United Artists' 50% stake in the company and so assumed complete control of Danjaq.Danjaq, S.A. v. Pathe Communications Corporation, No. 91-55878. (Oct 6 1992) United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. John Cork claims that in exchange for the sale, MGM/UA received an exclusive distribution deal with Danjaq that is far more lucrative than when the shares were originally owned by Broccoli and Saltzman. Danjaq's legal domicile was changed from Switzerland to Delaware in October 1992. Since then, its legal name was Danjaq, Inc. The company was converted to a limited liability company in January 1997. Following the death of Albert Broccoli in 1996 and Dana Broccoli in 2004, control of Danjaq was passed to Michael G. Wilson.Danjaq LLC v.

The copyrights to Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre, are shared between Danjaq LLC, MGM, and Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. =Films made outside the control of Danjaq= Two Bond films have been made outside the control of Danjaq, the first was the 1967 film Casino Royale, with David Niven as Bond; the second was the 1983 film Never Say Never Again, a remake of Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result of a legal dispute involving Kevin McClory, one of the credited co-writers of the story used for the novel Thunderball, who was awarded the film rights to the novel in a 1963 settlement with Ian Fleming.

It was established on November 22, 1995 by BC Parks and the Lytton First Nation to protect the ecological and cultural significance of the Stein River valley. Etymology The name \\"Stein\\" comes from the Nlaka'pamux word \\"stagyn\\", which means \\"hidden place\\". This land is an important spiritual land for the First Nations in the area. History In the 1980s there was a plan to log the valley. This was protested by the environmentalists who argued that this was the last untouched watershed in the southern Coast Mountains. In 1988 Fletcher Challenge announced a moratorium on logging the Stein. After strong public support, and an annual music festival that raised awareness, the Stein Valley was finally protected as a park on July 12, 1995. In June 2017, the park board suspended kayaking and rafting activities in order to better determine their long-term impacts on the ecological integrity of the park. At the same time, the park board decided that campfires were now forbidden in the park year-round. In 2018, the park was added to UNESCO's tentative list of World Heritage Sites. Geography View of Blowdown Lake, from the slopes of Gott Peak. The park protects the complete Stein River watershed as it flows down from the eastern Pacific Ranges into the Fraser River. =Ecology= The park protects over 50 species of mammals, including mountain goat, cougar, wolverine, black bear and grizzly bear. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp shinned hawks, barred owls, pygmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and rufous hummingbirds, as well as several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. The Stein River contains Dolly Varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, as well as steelhead trout, coho, pink and Chinook salmon. Culture The park features a number of pictographs in the park. Some are easily visible, others must be sought out, and some are closely guarded secrets of the local people. Recreation This park has 150 km of backpacking trails and a number of wilderness camping areas. There are four cable crossings and a suspension bridge across the river. The Lower Stein Valley from the Lytton trailhead to the Suspension Bridge Camp has become increasingly popular for school outdoor education groups.

It developed from three postal villages: Newtonbrook, Willowdale and Lansing. Willowdale began as a postal village (orig. Willow Dale) which covered the area from Finch Avenue at the north to Elmwood Ave at the south and Bathurst Street at the west to Bayview Avenue at the east. The postal village of Lansing was from Elmwood Ave. at the north to approx. Hwy. 401 at the south and Bathurst St. at the west to Bayview Ave. at the east. (East of Bayview Ave. was the postal village of Oriole.) The north‚Äìsouth centreline of both Lansing & Willowdale was Yonge Street. The postal village of Lansing remained in existence until the post office at Lansing corner (northwest corner of Yonge St. & Sheppard Ave.) was closed. When a new post office was built in Willowdale, the postal villages of Lansing and Willowdale were combined as the new postal village of Willowdale, within the Township of North York. North York City Centre is centred at the intersection of Yonge St. and Empress Avenue/Park Home Avenue and is commonly thought to be the core of Willowdale, as well as North York itself, though its high-rise residential and commercial development sets it apart from much of the rest of Willowdale. The Willowdale neighbourhood consists of single-family homes, condominium townhouses and high-rise condominium towers. High density development is restricted along Yonge Street. History Willowdale was first settled by Jacob Cummer (Jacob Kummer), who immigrated to Canada from the United States in 1797. Cummer was a mill owner on the nearby Don River, a proprietor of a tinsmith shop on Yonge Street and a self-trained doctor and veterinarian. Cummer was held in such high esteem by his neighbours they called the area \\"Kummer's Settlement\\". Cummer Avenue is named for Cummer. David Gibson, a distinguished land surveyor, was another leader in this community. Like most of his neighbours, Gibson participated in the ill-fated Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. He was thus charged with high treason and escaped to the United States, where he found employment as the First Assistant Engineer on the building of the Erie Canal. The Gibson family built the Gibson House in Willowdale in 1851. Gibson returned to his Yonge Street farm in 1851, after being pardoned for his role in the Rebellion. He then helped to establish the \\"Willow Dale\\" post office, named after the many willow trees that once graced this district. Members of the Gibson family were still living in Gibson House in the 1920s when the residential subdivision of Willowdale began to take place. The Gibson House, built in 1851 in the Georgian Rival style, still stands in its original location at 5172 Yonge Street, and is now a historic house museum. Opened in 1948, York Cemetery was located in the southwest of the neighbourhood. Several notable individuals are interred there, including the Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, and Tim Horton. The single-family homes range in age from the original 1910 to 1950s construction (one- and two-storey pre-war houses and modest one-and-a-half- storey postwar houses). Large two-storey luxury homes emerged in the neighbourhood in the early-1990s. Beginning on a large scale in the 1990s, very large replacement two-storey luxury homes were constructed on lots originally occupied by smaller houses. It is in this neighbourhood that the term \\"monster homes\\" was first applied by Torontonians. In 2018, the Toronto van attack, the deadliest vehicle ramming attack in Canadian history, occurred in Willowdale. = Willowdale United Church = This church (Cummer Chapel) was built on the northeast corner at Church and Yonge St.In the early 1950s I played in the abandoned Methodist church before Yonge St was widened. In at least the early 1920s, the northwest corner was occupied by St George's Anglican Church. The first church in Willowdale was called the Cummer Chapel, located at the northwest corner of what is now Yonge and Churchill. This log meeting house was built in 1816 by Jacob Cummer on part of his farm. He and other early members of the church are buried in the cemetery which remains on the site, now on the east side of Yonge Street. The Cummers, who were the first German loyalists and farmers from Pennsylvania, had Lutheran roots. However, they readily mixed in with and married people with Methodist and other roots. Thus the chapel was designated as non-denominational. The current building for Willowdale United Church was erected in 1954. A large, yellow, brick and stucco church with a tall spire replaced the log building in 1856. It was called the Methodist Episcopal Church, and became part of the new United Church of Canada in 1925. Between 1931 and 1932, Yonge Street was widened and the front end of the church, facing west, was removed. The front door was relocated to the south side of the building. Following World War II, many veterans and their families began to settle in Willowdale. In 1946, the Rev. Welburn Jones became the minister of Willowdale United Church (WUC) and initiated a building program. In 1954 a substantial building was built on nearby Kenneth Avenue. In 1966, his successor, the Rev. Lindsay G. King, completed the program. The Rev. King spent the rest of his ministry, 27 years, at WUC. While he was the minister of WUC, the Rev. King wrote a regular column for the community paper and he was frequently heard on radio and television, including the CTV and the CBC. Because of his lifelong interest in bringing psychology, religion and health together, in 1973 he initiated the founding of the Family Life Foundation (FLF) of Willowdale, a registered charity encouraging the development of healthy community and family life. Demographics Home to 79,440 people, Willowdale is an ethnically diverse community, with 66% of all Willowdale residents being immigrants as of 2011. Major ethnic groups in Willowdale include: Chinese: 17.3%, Korean: 8.0%, and Iranian: 7.8%. While English is the mother tongue for 33.7% of the population, other languages with large numbers of speakers include: Chinese: 18.4%, Persian: 9.7%, and Korean: 9.2%. In 2006, census tract 0300.00 in Willowdale was 82.15% Canadian citizens and 17.85% Non-Canadian citizens. However, in the Canada 2011 Census, it changed to 76.89% Canadian citizens and 23.11% Non- Canadians. Education Earl Haig Secondary School is a public secondary school located in Willowdale. Two public school boards operate schools in Willowdale, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

J. Bassett (then known as Michael J. Bassett) and starring Jamie Bell, Laurence Fox, Kris Marshall, Matthew Rhys, and Andy Serkis. A lost squad of British soldiers in World War I take shelter in an abandoned enemy trench, but it proves to be no refuge as the men find themselves hunted by unseen evils.  Plot  During World War I, soldiers of the British White Company 5th Battalion under Captain Jennings charge a German trench as part of a larger assault. The young Private Shakespeare initially refuses to join the attack but is coaxed along by Sergeant Tate. Many soldiers fall to machine-gun fire, artillery strikes, and the unit becomes utterly lost in the fog. After walking for hours, carrying Private Chevasse who has been left paraplegic, the unit comes across a complex, maze-like network of German trenches. There they find three terrified enemy soldiers, who ignore Private McNess's cries for surrender in apparent fear of something further down the trenches. Private Quinn shoots one, but McNess stops him while the second German stumbles down the trench and the third, Friedrich, surrenders. Convinced they have broken through the enemy lines, the soldiers decide to secure the trenches. They explore and find ominous signs that something has gone very wrong: rotting bodies with protruding barbed wire and German bayonets litter the ground. Compasses and watches also have stopped working. While detonating charges to close off some passages, they hear a demon-like growl and fail to notice vast amounts of blood pouring from the mud. Later, Private Hawkstone discovers a body covered in mud, which turns out to be the second German. The German attacks him and although Hawkstone is forced to shoot, wounding him and resulting in a muddy fistfight. During the skirmish, Private Starinski also shoots and wounds the German, who falls to his knees. Quinn taunts and then scalps the man after executing him with a pistol shot to the head. Attempts to contact Allied support via a crystal radio reveal White Company was thought to have been obliterated during the assault before communications are lost. Their first night in the trench starts off uneventfully and Corporal Fairweather treats the wounded. Starinski secludes himself to masturbate over photographs of naked women he found earlier but is distracted by strange sounds. Deeper into the trenches, he finds three German corpses wrapped in barbed wire in a standing position. As he shouts to alert the others, one of the corpses suddenly comes to life and ambushes him. Shakespeare and Tate then find Starinski's corpse lashed to the wall with barbed wire. Suspecting that hidden German troops are responsible, the men violently interrogate Fredriech (who can also speak French, which Shakespeare understands) explains the other Germans turned on each other and that there's \\"evil\\" in the trenches. The next morning, White Company piles up the German dead and clears the dugouts with grenades in case of any more hiding in the tunnels and caves. Phantom sounds of artillery and infantry are then heard, causing Jennings to crack under the pressure and mistakenly shoot Hawkstone in the head when he hears him coming from behind. Morale and discipline deteriorate even further, with McNess thinking of deserting. That night he is chased by an eerie red mist, hears voices, and is drenched in blood. Possessed by fear, McNess flees into no man's land only to be shot by Private Bradford. Fairweather attempts a rescue, but McNess, only able to crawl, is pursued by a moving mud mound that drags him underground. Meanwhile, Bradford, who has been found by Shakespeare in a cave, is convinced that both he and the trenches are possessed by death. He asks Shakespeare to shoot him so he will not kill others, but when the latter refuses Bradford runs off. In the morning, Quinn crucifies Friedrich on a wooden beam in no man's land and beats him with his spiked club. In the trench, Jennings, also having gone mad, orders an inspection but hears Friedrich screaming and investigates. Oblivious to Quinn's madness, Jennings demands that he fall in, but Quinn subdues the officer and stabs him to death. Tate attacks Quinn, but during the fight gets tangled in barbed wire. Shakespeare rushes out of the trench to try and save Tate but Quinn kills him with the club. Shakespeare confronts him with a submachine gun but Quinn taunts him when he refuses to shoot. Quinn approaches the boy but is stopped by living strands of barbed wire that rise up from the mud and begin to wrap around and impale him, forcing Shakespeare to fatally shoot him. Back in the trench, Shakespeare arms Friedrich, who has been crippled by Quinn's torture, with a rifle to defend himself and runs off to find Fairweather. He finds Chevasse who, though pale and covered in flies, appears to be able to move his legs again. However, when Shakespeare lifts up the blanket, he finds that, to his horror, rats have eaten Chevasse's legs. Shakespeare shoots him in the head to put him out of his misery. He runs off again and finds Bradford, who has tied Fairweather up with barbed wire and both men plead Shakespeare to kill Bradford. Shakespeare refuses, and Bradford shoots Fairweather in the head. Shakespeare finally gives in and bayonets him in the stomach before shooting him. The soil under the German dead starts to cave in, while barbed wire blocks off every passage. Shakespeare tries to escape, but stumbles and is sucked down into the pit. He wakes up in the cave from earlier, now full of corpses, and finds living versions of his unit eating together just as they were the first night, including himself. He flees, reaching the trenches. Friedrich, now in perfect health, appears and points his rifle at him. Shakespeare, exasperated by the apparent betrayal, shouts in both English and French that he tried to help him. Friedrich acknowledges this in perfect English, and that this is why he is free to go, pointing to a ladder leading up into no man's land before seemingly vanishing. Shakespeare climbs out of the trench and leaves to an unknown fate, disappearing into the fog. Some time later, another team of British soldiers arrives at the trench. Seeing Friedrich sitting idly, they shout at him to surrender, to which he complies, lifting his hands. He then gives an ominous stare before the screen fades, implying that this will all happen again.  Cast  * Jamie Bell as Private Charlie Shakespeare.

Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Deathwatch received an approval rating of 25% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. Critics mostly praised the film's creative premise and atmosphere, but criticized its story execution and editing. Alan Jones of The Radio Times rated the film one out of five stars, writing, \\"There's little to set the pulse racing, apart from some ghostly noises and a few gory effects, and Bassett's lumbering direction blasts any artistry, horror or suspense clean out of the target area.\\" Allmovie gave the film a positive review calling it \\"a highly crafted atmospheric creep-out that knows when to go for the jugular and when to slather on the paranoia\\". TV Guide awarded the film 2.5/4 stars stating: \\"Bassett deserves half a salute for Twilight Zone-ish wallow in WWI misery, which works up some creepy atmosphere between scenes of dehumanizing combat. But the spook show element ultimately seems simultaneously ghoulish and hokey, and the pacifist moral is hammered home with blunt obviousness\\". Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's premise and direction but panned the film's dull script. Nev Pierce from BBC awarded the film three out of five stars, while noting the film had its faults, Pierce called it \\"A creepy, authentically nasty little horror film\\".

These account balances are usually considered money and form the greater part of the narrowly defined money supply of a country.Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. Economics. New York: Worth, 2006. Print. Simply put, these would be funds like those held in a checking account. History U.S. demand deposits at commercial banks, 1995-2012 In the United States, demand deposits arose following the 1865 tax of 10% on the issuance of state bank notes; see history of banking in the USA. In the U.S., demand deposits only refer to funds held in checking accounts (or cheque offering accounts) other than NOW accounts; however, in a 1970s and 1980s response to the 1933 promulgation of Regulation Q in the U.S., demand deposits in some cases came to allow easier access to funds from other types of accounts (e.g. savings accounts and money market accounts). For the historical basis of the distinction between demand deposits and NOW accounts in the U.S., see Negotiable order of withdrawal account#History. Money supply Demand deposits are usually considered part of the narrowly defined money supply, as they can be used, via checks and drafts, as a means of payment for goods and services and to settle debts. The money supply of a country is usually defined to consist of currency plus demand deposits. In most countries, demand deposits account for a majority of the money supply. During times of financial crisis, bank customers will withdraw their funds in cash, leading to a drop in demand deposits and a shrinking of the money supply. Economists have speculated that this effect contributed to the severity of the Great Depression. This did not happen, however, in the financial crisis that began in 2008. In fact, demand deposits in the U.S. increased dramatically, from around $310bn in August 2008 to a peak of around $460bn in December 2008.

It was one of the earliest settlements in the former township of Scarborough with the distinction of being the site of the township's first post office. Today, the neighbourhood is composed of private and public housing, apartment complexes, schools, a few condominiums, and strip mall plazas. The neighbourhood lies along the Scarborough Bluffs escarpment. History Scarborough Village established as a settlement in the 1800s by Cornell and Secor as a crossroads village. It was centered on Markham Road between Kingston Road to the south and Eglinton Avenue to the north. The area provided settlers with access to the lakeshore and partially served as a through-way for soldiers during the War of 1812. In 1832, it became the first community in the former Township of Scarborough to have its own post office. By 1856, Scarborough Village became a subdivision and by 1860, the area of Scarborough Village had its first completed brick schoolhouse.Village By the 1890s, a general store, a blacksmith shop, a store that sold farm accessories, and a large railway hotel were built in the area. The area only contained about a dozen dwellings. A Via Rail train passed through the rail lines at the northern boundary of the neighbourhood, 1981. The opening of the rail line in 1930 saw a drop in traffic on Kingston Road. During the 1930s, Kingston Road had become a major route connecting Old Toronto with the rest of eastern Ontario communities, as well as Montreal. After the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway tracks north of Eglinton Avenue, Kingston Road had decreased in traffic and few businesses began to close.  Demographics  According to the 2006 Canadian Census (0331.01 census tract) approximately 80% of the population is first generation Canadian. Meaning that 80% of the population was born outside of Canada compared to the 9% who are second generation and 11% who are third generation.Census 2006 Second generation refers to persons who were born in Canada, but have at least one parent who was born outside of Canada, and third generation refers to persons who were born in Canada with both parents born in Canada. However, in the 2011 National Household Survey the number of first generation Canadian's shrunk to 68%, while the second generation percentage increased to 26%. Additionally, the percentage of third generation Canadian's decreased to 6%.Census 2011 The average income among individual incomes between 2006 and 2011 has increased by 10.95% (Statistics Canada, 2011). However, individuals under the $10,000 and $19,999 category showed a dropped significantly in income levels in 2011, 185 individual are making less money under this category (Statistics Canada, 2011).. The most significant increase occurs in the 20,000 to 29,999 category, which reveals an increase of 300 individuals (Statistics Canada, 2011).

A career soldier, Abboud served in World War II in Egypt and Iraq. In 1949, Abboud became the deputy Commander in Chief of the Sudanese military. Upon independence, Abboud became the Commander in Chief of the Military of Sudan. He served as the head of state of Sudan between 1958 and 1964 and as president of Sudan in 1964; however, he soon resigned, ending Sudan's first period of military rule.Biography of El Ferik Ibrahim Abboud at bookrags.com Ibrahim Abboud was born 26 October 1900 in Mohammed-Gol, near the old port city of Suakin on the Red Sea. He trained as an engineer at the Gordon Memorial College and at the Military College in Khartoum. He received a commission in the Egyptian Army in 1918 and transferred to the Sudan Defence Force in 1925, after its creation separate from the Egyptian army. During World War II he served in Eritrea, in Ethiopia, with the Sudan Defence Force, and with the British army in North Africa. After the war, Abboud commanded the Camel Corps,O'Ballance, Secret War. and then rose rapidly to commander of the Sudan Defence Force in 1949 and assistant commander in chief in 1954. With the declaration of independence for the Sudan in 1956, he was made commander in chief of the Sudanese military forces. After the Sudanese army staged a coup d'√©tat in November 1958, overthrowing the civilian government of Abdullah Khalil, Gen. Abboud led the new military government. Philip Agee alleged that CIA engineered the 1958 coup in In the Company. Between 1956 and 1958, Sudanese nationalist leaders from both major parties sought to find solutions to the seemingly intractable problems of building a nation, developing the economy and creating a permanent constitution. Neither Ismail al-Azhari, leader of the Nationalist Unionist party and the first prime minister of the Sudan, nor his rival, Abdullah Khalil, the Umma party leader and successor to al-Azhari as prime minister, was able to overcome the weaknesses of the political system or to grapple with the country's problems. Parliamentary government was so discredited that Gen. Abboud, who formerly had remained studiously aloof from politics, led a coup d'√©tat on 17 November 1958, to end, in his words, \\"the state of degeneration, chaos, and instability of the country.\\" The Council of State and cabinet were dismissed, parliament and all political parties were declared dissolved, and the constitution was suspended. Chief of the Military Government At first Abboud and his ruling Supreme Council of Twelve had the tacit support of the Sudanese politicians and people. The country was tired of the intrigues of the politicians and was prepared to permit the military to inaugurate an efficient and incorruptible administration. There was opposition only within the military in the first few months of the military government. This was the result of disagreements among the senior military leaders. But within a year many younger officers, and even cadets, rose to challenge Abboud's position. All of them were quickly suppressed. Abboud's Regime Ibrahim Abboud during his visit to Yugoslavia, July 1960 Abboud moved swiftly to deal with the Sudan's problems. The provisional constitution was suspended and all political parties dissolved. The price of Sudanese cotton was lowered, and the surplus from the crop of 1958 and the bumper crop of 1959 was sold, easing the financial crisis. An agreement was reached with Egypt concerning the division of the Nile waters, and although the Sudan did not receive as great an allotment as many Sudanese thought equitable, Egypt recognized the independence of the Sudan, and frontier conflicts ceased. Finally, in 1961, an ambitious 10-year development plan was launched, designed to end the Sudan's dependence on cotton exports and many foreign manufactured imports. Although Abboud dealt with the important economic problems and improved foreign relations, he made little attempt to capitalize on his successes to forge a political following outside the army. His political independence certainly enabled him to act decisively, but his actions frequently alienated large segments of the population, which his government ultimately needed to remain in power without resort to force. He sought to meet demands of the population for increased participation in government by instituting a system of local representative government and the \\"erection of a central council ... in a pyramid with the local councils as a base.\\" The creation of such councils clearly shifted increased power to the rural areas, whose conservatism would counter complaints from the more liberal urban critics who were becoming increasingly frustrated by increasingly arbitrary administration. \\"Southern Problem\\" Ibrahim Abboud with President Kennedy at the White House, 1961 In spite of its weaknesses, Abboud's government might have lasted longer if not for the \\"southern problem.\\" Abboud was personally popular or, at least, respected. He was even invited to the White House in 1961, where President John F. Kennedy praised the Sudan for having set a good example for living in peace with its neighbours.Welcoming Remarks to President Abboud of the Republic of the Sudan at Andrews Air Force Base, 4 October 1961, http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHA-051-002.aspx In the non-Arab, non-Muslim southern Sudan, however, the arbitrary rule of the military government produced a more negative reaction than in the north. Thus, the government's vigorous program of Arabization and Islamization in the south provoked strikes in the schools and open revolt in the countryside. Opposition to the government was met by force, and many southerners fled as refugees into the neighbouring countries. By 1963 the conflict had escalated to a civil war in which the northern troops held the towns while the southern guerrillas roamed the countryside. Abboud's forces were responsible for large numbers of deaths in Kodok, Yei and Maridi, and overall his government was responsible for the deaths of more Sudanese people than any other head of state until Omar al Bashir. Finally, in August 1964, in a desperate attempt to find a solution to the enervating campaign in the south, Abboud established a 25-man commission to study the problem and make recommendations for its solution. When the commission, in turn, asked for public debate on the \\"southern question,\\" the students of Khartoum University initiated a series of debates that soon turned into a forum for open criticism of all aspects of the administration. The government banned these debates, precipitating student demonstrations in which one student was killed. The situation rapidly deteriorated, and within two days the civil service and the transport workers were on strike. Demonstrations followed in the provinces. Rather than suppress the opposition by armed force and bloodshed, Abboud dissolved his government on 26 October 1964, and allowed the formation of a provisional cabinet under Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa to replace the Supreme Council. Abboud himself was forced to resign on 15 November in favor of a civilian provisional government, and he retreated into retirement, thus ending the Republic of the Sudan's first period of military rule. Abboud lived in Britain for several years, but died in Khartoum on 8 September 1983, at the age of 82.

It is located north-west of central Toronto, in the district of North York. The neighbourhood is roughly bounded by Lawrence Avenue to the south, Yorkdale Road to the north, Varna Drive to the east and Dufferin Street to the west. It is part of the greater Yorkdale-Glen Park official Toronto neighbourhood. The area is divided into two distinct subsections. One half of the neighbourhood is a post World War II development of bungalows and storey-and-a-half dwellings. As the frontage of these homes average 45 feet, the area has had significant changes as older houses are torn down and replaced by \\"Monster Homes\\" as the area's proximity to major city arteries and the downtown core make it lucrative to builders. The other housing area, which is east of Flemington Road, is short-term public housing. Because of the area's proximity to Downsview Airport, high-rise buildings were not originally permitted to be constructed in this area, and the majority of the housing is in low to mid- rise buildings. History Lawrence Heights was the first large public housing project built by Metropolitan Toronto outside of the then-City of Toronto and is now managed under Toronto Community Housing. By 1955, had been assembled by Metro. The project would have approximately 6,000 residents in 1,081 family units at a density of 12 families per acre, the largest public housing project to that date in Canada. When the project was announced, it sparked a strong opposition from the then North York Township. Citizens and elected officials threatened legal action to block the development. A compromise was worked out between Metro and North York whereby some of the units would be rented at market rates so that the project would not be exclusively very poor families.Rose, pp. 69-72 Construction was completed by 1962. It consisted mainly of row houses and maisonettes with some small apartment buildings of less than 30 units each. A buffer of single-family dwellings was built between the project and the private sub-division to the east. An elementary school was part of the project. The elementary school filled up immediately and senior elementary students were sent to a neighbouring junior high. A controversy erupted over the use of the swimming pool at a neighbouring secondary school, whereby project students could only use the pool on one or two evenings per week. A community center was built in the mid-1960s, its $100,000 cost shared by North York and Metro without any support from the Ontario or the federal housing agency Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.Rose, pp. 72-73 Lawrence Heights has been referred to as the \\"Jungle\\" by residents and police alike soon after its completion in 1962. The Globe and Mail article \\"Toronto's new murder capital\\" gives insight into the crime in the area: \\"It's like you're in the jungle. It is like a war,\\" says Linkx, a 20-year-old hip hop producer from nearby Rexdale who wears Crip colours and spoke on condition of anonymity. In 2007, then city councillor Howard Moscoe unveiled a plan to revitalize Lawrence Heights. The plan proposes a demolition of all 1,208 units in the neighbourhood, as well as Lawrence Square, and they would be replaced by modern affordable units, market housing and retail/commercial streets, including a northward extension of Marlee Avenue. The plan was objected by nearly all surrounding neighbourhood residents due to overcrowding and the added traffic congestion it would bring.'Massive' plan to revamp troubled Lawrence HeightsPlan to re-create Lawrence Heights unveiled As of late 2015, the low rise housing units at Ranee Avenue and Flemington Road (along with a vacant lot) are being demolished for a new condo project (Yorkdale Condos). In 2015, the city kicked off a large redevelopment project in the area. The aim is to transform one of the city‚Äôs largest public housing communities into a mixed-income neighbourhood.http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2015/10/lawrence-heights-demolition- kicks-largest-redevelopment-project-tchc-history Education John Polanyi Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school in Lawrence Heights. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular English first language public school board that operates schools in the neighbourhood. TDSB operates two institutions that offer primary education, Flemington Public School, and Lawrence Heights Middle School; as well as one secondary school, John Polanyi Collegiate Institute. The secondary school is situated in the former building of Bathurst Heights Secondary School, before it was shut down by TDSB. The building was also the temporary site for the public secondary separate school, Brebeuf College School, when Brebeuf underwent restorations. The present secondary school was reopened in 2011. In addition to TDSB, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) also offer schooling to applicable residents of Lawrence Heights, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. Applicable students residing in Lawrence Heights attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. CSCM and TCDSB are separate school boards, the former being a French first language school board, the latter being an English first language school board; whereas CSV is a secular French first language school board.

The Walter Carsen Centre for The National Ballet of CanadaThe National Ballet of Canada: Contact Us is a building at 470 Queens Quay West on the waterfront in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The lower levels house the headquarters of the National Ballet of Canada and the ballet's rehearsal space. The facility has 8,825 square metres of space, more than the Four Seasons Centre where the ballet performs. Previously the ballet had been based at St. Lawrence Hall and scattered other buildings through the downtown core. Built in 1995, it was named to honour patron of the arts Walter Carsen who donated towards its construction. The centre is inside the King's Landing luxury condominium building. This structure was completed in 1984, and designed by Arthur Erickson. The 320 unit building was one of the first condominiums to be built in the former industrial region along the lake shore. The lower levels were always intended to be arts space, linked to the Harbourfront facility. Various proposals, including locating the Bata Shoe Museum in the space fell through, and the vast space remained empty and unfinished until the ballet moved there.

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space; let \\\\phi be a linear map in , the set of all linear maps from V into itself; and let A be the matrix representation of \\\\phi with respect to some ordered basis. There may not always exist a full set of n linearly independent eigenvectors of A that form a complete basis for V. That is, the matrix A may not be diagonalizable. This happens when the algebraic multiplicity of at least one eigenvalue \\\\lambda_i is greater than its geometric multiplicity (the nullity of the matrix (A-\\\\lambda_i I), or the dimension of its nullspace). In this case, \\\\lambda_i is called a defective eigenvalue and A is called a defective matrix. A generalized eigenvector x_i corresponding to \\\\lambda_i, together with the matrix (A-\\\\lambda_i I) generate a Jordan chain of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors which form a basis for an invariant subspace of V. Using generalized eigenvectors, a set of linearly independent eigenvectors of A can be extended, if necessary, to a complete basis for V. This basis can be used to determine an \\"almost diagonal matrix\\" J in Jordan normal form, similar to A, which is useful in computing certain matrix functions of A. The matrix J is also useful in solving the system of linear differential equations \\\\mathbf x' = A \\\\mathbf x, where A need not be diagonalizable. The dimension of the generalized eigenspace corresponding to a given eigenvalue \\\\lambda is the algebraic multiplicity of \\\\lambda.  Overview and definition  There are several equivalent ways to define an ordinary eigenvector. For our purposes, an eigenvector \\\\mathbf u associated with an eigenvalue \\\\lambda of an n √ó n matrix A is a nonzero vector for which (A - \\\\lambda I) \\\\mathbf u = \\\\mathbf 0, where I is the n √ó n identity matrix and \\\\mathbf 0 is the zero vector of length n. That is, \\\\mathbf u is in the kernel of the transformation (A - \\\\lambda I). If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, then A is similar to a diagonal matrix D. That is, there exists an invertible matrix M such that A is diagonalizable through the similarity transformation D = M^{-1}AM. The matrix D is called a spectral matrix for A. The matrix M is called a modal matrix for A. Diagonalizable matrices are of particular interest since matrix functions of them can be computed easily. On the other hand, if A does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it, then A is not diagonalizable. Definition: A vector \\\\mathbf x_m is a generalized eigenvector of rank m of the matrix A and corresponding to the eigenvalue \\\\lambda if :(A - \\\\lambda I)^m \\\\mathbf x_m = \\\\mathbf 0 but :(A - \\\\lambda I)^{m-1} \\\\mathbf x_m e \\\\mathbf 0. Clearly, a generalized eigenvector of rank 1 is an ordinary eigenvector. Every n √ó n matrix A has n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors associated with it and can be shown to be similar to an \\"almost diagonal\\" matrix J in Jordan normal form. That is, there exists an invertible matrix M such that J = M^{-1}AM. The matrix M in this case is called a generalized modal matrix for A. If \\\\lambda is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity \\\\mu, then A will have \\\\mu linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to \\\\lambda. These results, in turn, provide a straightforward method for computing certain matrix functions of A. Note: For an n \\\\times n matrix A over a field F to be expressed in Jordan normal form, all eigenvalues of A must be in F. That is, the characteristic polynomial f(x) must factor completely into linear factors. For example, if A has real-valued elements, then it may be necessary for the eigenvalues and the components of the eigenvectors to have complex values. The set spanned by all generalized eigenvectors for a given \\\\lambda , forms the generalized eigenspace for \\\\lambda . Examples Here are some examples to illustrate the concept of generalized eigenvectors. Some of the details will be described later. =Example 1= This example is simple but clearly illustrates the point. This type of matrix is used frequently in textbooks. Suppose : A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Then there is only one eigenvalue, \\\\lambda = 1, and its algebraic multiplicity is m = 2. Notice that this matrix is in Jordan normal form but is not diagonal. Hence, this matrix is not diagonalizable. Since there is one superdiagonal entry, there will be one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1 (or one could note that the vector space V is of dimension 2, so there can be at most one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1). Alternatively, one could compute the dimension of the nullspace of A - \\\\lambda I to be p = 1, and thus there are m ‚Äì p = 1 generalized eigenvectors of rank greater than 1. The ordinary eigenvector \\\\mathbf v_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} is computed as usual (see the eigenvector page for examples). Using this eigenvector, we compute the generalized eigenvector \\\\mathbf v_2 by solving : (A-\\\\lambda I) \\\\mathbf v_2 = \\\\mathbf v_1. Writing out the values: : \\\\left(\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right)\\\\begin{pmatrix}v_{21} v_{22} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}v_{21} v_{22} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. This simplifies to : v_{22}= 1. The element v_{21} has no restrictions. The generalized eigenvector of rank 2 is then \\\\mathbf v_2=\\\\begin{pmatrix}a 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, where a can have any scalar value. The choice of a = 0 is usually the simplest. Note that : (A-\\\\lambda I) \\\\mathbf v_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}a 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf v_1, so that \\\\mathbf v_2 is a generalized eigenvector, : (A-\\\\lambda I) \\\\mathbf v_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf 0, so that \\\\mathbf v_1 is an ordinary eigenvector, and that \\\\mathbf v_1 and \\\\mathbf v_2 are linearly independent and hence constitute a basis for the vector space V . =Example 2= This example is more complex than Example 1. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order. The matrix :A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 2 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix} has eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1 = 1 and \\\\lambda_2 = 2 with algebraic multiplicities \\\\mu_1 = 2 and \\\\mu_2 = 3 , but geometric multiplicities \\\\gamma_1 = 1 and \\\\gamma_2 = 1. The generalized eigenspaces of A are calculated below. \\\\mathbf x_1 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with \\\\lambda_1 . \\\\mathbf x_2 is a generalized eigenvector associated with \\\\lambda_1 . \\\\mathbf y_1 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with \\\\lambda_2 . \\\\mathbf y_2 and \\\\mathbf y_3 are generalized eigenvectors associated with \\\\lambda_2 . :(A-1 I) \\\\mathbf x_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  3  -9  9  -3 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf 0 , :(A - 1 I) \\\\mathbf x_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -15  30  -1  -45 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  3  -9  9  -3 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf x_1 , :(A - 2 I) \\\\mathbf y_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 0 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0  9 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf 0 , :(A - 2 I) \\\\mathbf y_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 0 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  3  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0  9 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf y_1 , :(A - 2 I) \\\\mathbf y_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  3 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0  6 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0  10 & 6 & 3 & 0 & 0  15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  -2  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  3  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf y_2 . This results in a basis for each of the generalized eigenspaces of A. Together the two chains of generalized eigenvectors span the space of all 5-dimensional column vectors. : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf x_1, \\\\mathbf x_2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  3  -9  9  -3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -15  30  -1  -45 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf y_1, \\\\mathbf y_2, \\\\mathbf y_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0  9 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  3  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  -2  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. An \\"almost diagonal\\" matrix J in Jordan normal form, similar to A is obtained as follows: : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf x_1 & \\\\mathbf x_2 & \\\\mathbf y_1 & \\\\mathbf y_2 & \\\\mathbf y_3 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0& 0  3 & -15 & 0 &0& 0  -9 & 30 & 0 &0& 1  9 & -1 & 0 &3& -2  -3 & -45 & 9 &0& 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, :J = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 1  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix}, where M is a generalized modal matrix for A, the columns of M are a canonical basis for A, and AM = MJ.  Jordan chains  Definition: Let \\\\mathbf x_m be a generalized eigenvector of rank m corresponding to the matrix A and the eigenvalue \\\\lambda. The chain generated by \\\\mathbf x_m is a set of vectors \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf x_m, \\\\mathbf x_{m-1}, \\\\dots , \\\\mathbf x_1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} given by Thus, in general, The vector \\\\mathbf x_j , given by (), is a generalized eigenvector of rank j corresponding to the eigenvalue \\\\lambda. A chain is a linearly independent set of vectors.  Canonical basis  Definition: A set of n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a canonical basis if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains. Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of rank m is in a canonical basis, it follows that the m ‚àí 1 vectors \\\\mathbf x_{m-1}, \\\\mathbf x_{m-2}, \\\\ldots , \\\\mathbf x_1 that are in the Jordan chain generated by \\\\mathbf x_m are also in the canonical basis. Let \\\\lambda_i be an eigenvalue of A of algebraic multiplicity \\\\mu_i . First, find the ranks (matrix ranks) of the matrices (A - \\\\lambda_i I), (A - \\\\lambda_i I)^2, \\\\ldots , (A - \\\\lambda_i I)^{m_i} . The integer m_i is determined to be the first integer for which (A - \\\\lambda_i I)^{m_i} has rank n - \\\\mu_i (n being the number of rows or columns of A, that is, A is n √ó n). Now define : \\\\rho_k = \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - \\\\lambda_i I)^{k-1} - \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - \\\\lambda_i I)^k \\\\qquad (k = 1, 2, \\\\ldots , m_i). The variable \\\\rho_k designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank k corresponding to the eigenvalue \\\\lambda_i that will appear in a canonical basis for A. Note that : \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - \\\\lambda_i I)^0 = \\\\operatorname{rank}(I) = n .  Computation of generalized eigenvectors  In the preceding sections we have seen techniques for obtaining the n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of a canonical basis for the vector space V associated with an n \\\\times n matrix A. These techniques can be combined into a procedure: :Solve the characteristic equation of A for eigenvalues \\\\lambda_i and their algebraic multiplicities \\\\mu_i ; :For each \\\\lambda_i : ::Determine n - \\\\mu_i; ::Determine m_i; ::Determine \\\\rho_k for (k = 1, \\\\ldots , m_i); ::Determine each Jordan chain for \\\\lambda_i; = Example 3 = The matrix : A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 1 & -2 & 4  0 & 5 & 2 & 2  0 & 0 & 5 & 3  0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\\\end{pmatrix} has an eigenvalue \\\\lambda_1 = 5 of algebraic multiplicity \\\\mu_1 = 3 and an eigenvalue \\\\lambda_2 = 4 of algebraic multiplicity \\\\mu_2 = 1. We also have n=4. For \\\\lambda_1 we have n - \\\\mu_1 = 4 - 3 = 1. : (A - 5I) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -2 & 4  0 & 0 & 2 & 2  0 & 0 & 0 & 3  0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I) = 3. : (A - 5I)^2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 2 & -8  0 & 0 & 0 & 4  0 & 0 & 0 & -3  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^2 = 2. : (A - 5I)^3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 14  0 & 0 & 0 & -4  0 & 0 & 0 & 3  0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^3 = 1. The first integer m_1 for which (A - 5I)^{m_1} has rank n - \\\\mu_1 = 1 is m_1 = 3. We now define : \\\\rho_3 = \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^2 - \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^3 = 2 - 1 = 1 , : \\\\rho_2 = \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^1 - \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^2 = 3 - 2 = 1 , : \\\\rho_1 = \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^0 - \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 5I)^1 = 4 - 3 = 1 . Consequently, there will be three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors; one each of ranks 3, 2 and 1. Since \\\\lambda_1 corresponds to a single chain of three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors, we know that there is a generalized eigenvector \\\\mathbf x_3 of rank 3 corresponding to \\\\lambda_1 such that but Equations () and () represent linear systems that can be solved for \\\\mathbf x_3 . Let : \\\\mathbf x_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_{31}  x_{32}  x_{33}  x_{34} \\\\end{pmatrix}. Then : (A - 5I)^3 \\\\mathbf x_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 14  0 & 0 & 0 & -4  0 & 0 & 0 & 3  0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_{31}  x_{32}  x_{33}  x_{34} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 14 x_{34}  -4 x_{34}  3 x_{34}  \\\\- x_{34} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} and : (A - 5I)^2 \\\\mathbf x_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 2 & -8  0 & 0 & 0 & 4  0 & 0 & 0 & -3  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_{31}  x_{32}  x_{33}  x_{34} \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 x_{33} - 8 x_{34}  4 x_{34}  -3 x_{34}  x_{34} \\\\end{pmatrix} e \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Thus, in order to satisfy the conditions () and (), we must have x_{34} = 0 and x_{33} e 0. No restrictions are placed on x_{31} and x_{32}. By choosing x_{31} = x_{32} = x_{34} = 0, x_{33} = 1, we obtain : \\\\mathbf x_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} as a generalized eigenvector of rank 3 corresponding to \\\\lambda_1 = 5 . Note that it is possible to obtain infinitely many other generalized eigenvectors of rank 3 by choosing different values of x_{31}, x_{32} and x_{33}, with x_{33} e 0. Our first choice, however, is the simplest. Now using equations (), we obtain \\\\mathbf x_2 and \\\\mathbf x_1 as generalized eigenvectors of rank 2 and 1, respectively, where : \\\\mathbf x_2 = (A - 5I) \\\\mathbf x_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -2  2  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, and : \\\\mathbf x_1 = (A - 5I) \\\\mathbf x_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The simple eigenvalue \\\\lambda_2 = 4 can be dealt with using standard techniques and has an ordinary eigenvector : \\\\mathbf y_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -14  4  -3  1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. A canonical basis for A is : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf x_3, \\\\mathbf x_2, \\\\mathbf x_1, \\\\mathbf y_1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} -2  2  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2  0  0  0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} -14  4  -3  1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. \\\\mathbf x_1, \\\\mathbf x_2 and \\\\mathbf x_3 are generalized eigenvectors associated with \\\\lambda_1 , while \\\\mathbf y_1 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with \\\\lambda_2 . This is a fairly simple example. In general, the numbers \\\\rho_k of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank k will not always be equal. That is, there may be several chains of different lengths corresponding to a particular eigenvalue.  Generalized modal matrix  Let A be an n √ó n matrix. A generalized modal matrix M for A is an n √ó n matrix whose columns, considered as vectors, form a canonical basis for A and appear in M according to the following rules: * All Jordan chains consisting of one vector (that is, one vector in length) appear in the first columns of M. * All vectors of one chain appear together in adjacent columns of M. * Each chain appears in M in order of increasing rank (that is, the generalized eigenvector of rank 1 appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 2 of the same chain, which appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 3 of the same chain, etc.).  Jordan normal form  An example of a matrix in Jordan normal form. The grey blocks are called Jordan blocks. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space; let \\\\phi be a linear map in , the set of all linear maps from V into itself; and let A be the matrix representation of \\\\phi with respect to some ordered basis. It can be shown that if the characteristic polynomial f(\\\\lambda) of A factors into linear factors, so that f(\\\\lambda) has the form : f(\\\\lambda) = \\\\pm (\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_1)^{\\\\mu_1}(\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_2)^{\\\\mu_2} \\\\cdots (\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_r)^{\\\\mu_r} , where \\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots , \\\\lambda_r are the distinct eigenvalues of A, then each \\\\mu_i is the algebraic multiplicity of its corresponding eigenvalue \\\\lambda_i and A is similar to a matrix J in Jordan normal form, where each \\\\lambda_i appears \\\\mu_i consecutive times on the diagonal, and the entry directly above each \\\\lambda_i (that is, on the superdiagonal) is either 0 or 1: the entry above the first occurrence of each \\\\lambda_i is always 0; all other entries on the superdiagonal are 1. All other entries (that is, off the diagonal and superdiagonal) are 0. The matrix J is as close as one can come to a diagonalization of A. If A is diagonalizable, then all entries above the diagonal are zero. Note that some textbooks have the ones on the subdiagonal, that is, immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal. The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal. Every n √ó n matrix A is similar to a matrix J in Jordan normal form, obtained through the similarity transformation J = M^{-1}AM , where M is a generalized modal matrix for A. (See Note above.) = Example 4 = Find a matrix in Jordan normal form that is similar to : A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 4 & 2  -3 & 8 & 3  4 & -8 & -2 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Solution: The characteristic equation of A is (\\\\lambda - 2)^3 = 0, hence, \\\\lambda = 2 is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity three. Following the procedures of the previous sections, we find that : \\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 2I) = 1 and :\\\\operatorname{rank}(A - 2I)^2 = 0 = n - \\\\mu . Thus, \\\\rho_2 = 1 and \\\\rho_1 = 2, which implies that a canonical basis for A will contain one linearly independent generalized eigenvector of rank 2 and two linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank 1, or equivalently, one chain of two vectors \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf x_2, \\\\mathbf x_1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and one chain of one vector \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf y_1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Designating M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf y_1 & \\\\mathbf x_1 & \\\\mathbf x_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} , we find that : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 0  1 & 3 & 0  0 & -4 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, and : J = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0  0 & 2 & 1  0 & 0 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix}, where M is a generalized modal matrix for A, the columns of M are a canonical basis for A, and AM = MJ. Note that since generalized eigenvectors themselves are not unique, and since some of the columns of both M and J may be interchanged, it follows that both M and J are not unique. = Example 5 = In Example 3, we found a canonical basis of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors for a matrix A. A generalized modal matrix for A is : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf y_1 & \\\\mathbf x_1 & \\\\mathbf x_2 & \\\\mathbf x_3 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -14 & 2 & -2 & 0  4 & 0 & 2 & 0  -3 & 0 & 0 & 1  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. A matrix in Jordan normal form, similar to A is :J = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 5 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 5 & 1  0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\\\end{pmatrix}, so that AM = MJ.  Applications  = Matrix functions = Three of the most fundamental operations which can be performed on square matrices are matrix addition, multiplication by a scalar, and matrix multiplication. These are exactly those operations necessary for defining a polynomial function of an n √ó n matrix A. If we recall from basic calculus that many functions can be written as a Maclaurin series, then we can define more general functions of matrices quite easily. If A is diagonalizable, that is : D = M^{-1}AM , with : D = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda_1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  0 & \\\\lambda_2 & \\\\cdots & 0  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda_n \\\\end{pmatrix}, then : D^k = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda_1^k & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  0 & \\\\lambda_2^k & \\\\cdots & 0  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda_n^k \\\\end{pmatrix} and the evaluation of the Maclaurin series for functions of A is greatly simplified. For example, to obtain any power k of A, we need only compute D^k, premultiply D^k by M, and postmultiply the result by M^{-1}. Using generalized eigenvectors, we can obtain the Jordan normal form for A and these results can be generalized to a straightforward method for computing functions of nondiagonalizable matrices. (See Matrix function#Jordan decomposition.) = Differential equations = Consider the problem of solving the system of linear ordinary differential equations where : \\\\mathbf x = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t)  x_2(t)  \\\\vdots  x_n(t) \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf x' = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1'(t)  x_2'(t)  \\\\vdots  x_n'(t) \\\\end{pmatrix}, and A = (a_{ij}) . If the matrix A is a diagonal matrix so that a_{ij} = 0 for i e j, then the system () reduces to a system of n equations which take the form In this case, the general solution is given by : x_1 = k_1 e^{a_{11}t} : x_2 = k_2 e^{a_{22}t} :: \\\\vdots : x_n = k_n e^{a_{nn}t} . In the general case, we try to diagonalize A and reduce the system () to a system like () as follows. If A is diagonalizable, we have D = M^{-1}AM , where M is a modal matrix for A. Substituting A = MDM^{-1} , equation () takes the form M^{-1} \\\\mathbf x' = D(M^{-1} \\\\mathbf x) , or where The solution of () is : y_1 = k_1 e^{\\\\lambda_1 t} : y_2 = k_2 e^{\\\\lambda_2 t} :: \\\\vdots : y_n = k_n e^{\\\\lambda_n t} . The solution \\\\mathbf x of () is then obtained using the relation (). On the other hand, if A is not diagonalizable, we choose M to be a generalized modal matrix for A, such that J = M^{-1}AM is the Jordan normal form of A. The system \\\\mathbf y' = J \\\\mathbf y has the form where the \\\\lambda_i are the eigenvalues from the main diagonal of J and the \\\\epsilon_i are the ones and zeros from the superdiagonal of J. The system () is often more easily solved than (). We may solve the last equation in () for y_n, obtaining y_n = k_n e^{\\\\lambda_n t} . We then substitute this solution for y_n into the next to last equation in () and solve for y_{n-1}. Continuing this procedure, we work through () from the last equation to the first, solving the entire system for \\\\mathbf y . The solution \\\\mathbf x is then obtained using the relation ().

The name is derived from the Greek word 'akinetos' (immobile), referring to the rigid labellum (lip). These epiphytic orchids occur in tropical mountainous forests from Mexico to western South America, at altitudes up to 2,000 m. They are sometimes lithophytic when found on steep embankments. The large, plicate leaves are parallel-nerved and resemble those of Peristeria and Lycaste, while the structure of the flowers bears a closer resemblance to Stanhopea. The species produce a pendent inflorescence, bearing racemes of many fragrant cup- shaped, pale yellow to reddish brown flowers. The sidelobes of the labellum (lip) come together in a central callus. The basal part of the lip (hypochile) is at least as long as the sidelobes. The column is pubescent. The column of these orchids bears two pollinia, except in Acineta dalessandroi, which has four (making its classification in this genus doubtful). These orchids are insect pollinated by male bees in the genus Eulaema or Eufriesia. Some regard these as being among of the most splendid looking of all orchids.

The idea was born out of an Australian Bicentenary event, \\"Clean-Up Lake Macquarie\\", which was instigated in 1987 by Ivan Welsh as Mayor of Lake Macquarie. Then followed the local \\"Clean Up Sydney Harbour\\" event in 1989 with more than 40,000 volunteers who collected some 5,000 tonnes of rubbish.

Built between 1856 and 1939, these stumpy little steamboats achieved an almost mythical status thanks largely to the short stories Neil Munro wrote about the Vital Spark and her captain Para Handy, which produced three television series. Characteristics Eilean Eisdeal visiting Glasgow Clyde puffers characteristically had bluff bows, crew's quarters with table and cooking stove in the focsle, and a single mast with derrick in front of the large hold. The funnel and ship's wheel stood aft above the engine room, followed by a small captain's cabin in the stern. When publication of the Vital Spark stories began in 1905 the ship's wheel was still in the open, but later a wheelhouse was added aft of the funnel giving the puffers their distinctive image. Their flat bottom allowed them to beach and unload at low tide, essential to supply remote settlements without suitable piers. Typical cargoes could include coal and furniture, with farm produce and gravel sometimes being brought back. History The puffers developed from the gabbert, small single masted sailing barges which took most of the coasting trade. The original puffer was the Thomas, an iron canal boat of 1856, less than 66 ft (20 m) long to fit in the Forth and Clyde Canal locks, powered by a simple steam engine without a condenser, since as it drew fresh water from the canal there was no need to economise on water use. Once steam had been used by the engine, it was simply exhausted up the funnel in a series of puffs as the piston stroked. As well as the visual sight of a series of steam puffs following the boat, the simple engines made a characteristic puffing sound. By the 1870s similar boats were being adapted for use beyond the canal and fitted with condensers so that they no longer puffed, but the name stuck. Some non- condensing puffers (included those with compound engines) were built until the 1920s when purely canal traffic decreased and the vast majority of coasters had to operate in sea water. A derrick was added to the single mast to lift cargo. From this basic type of puffer three varieties developed: inside boats continued in use on the Forth and Clyde canal, while shorehead boats extended their range eastwards into the Firth of Forth and westwards as far as the Isle of Bute and from there up the length of Loch Fyne, their length kept at 66 ft (20 m) to use the canal locks. Both these types had a crew of three. Puffers of a third type, the outside boats, were built for the rougher sea routes to the Hebrides islands with a crew of four and the length increased to 88 ft (27 m) still allowing use of the larger locks on the Crinan Canal which cuts across the Kintyre peninsula. There were more than 20 builders in Scotland, mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal at Kirkintilloch and Maryhill, Glasgow. During World War I these handy little ships showed their worth in servicing warships, and were used at Scapa Flow, and for World War II the Admiralty placed an order in 1939 for steamships on the same design, mostly built in England, with the class name of VIC, standing for \\"Victualling Inshore Craft\\". After the war a number of VICs came into the coasting trade. The Innisgara was fitted with an internal combustion engine in 1912, and while puffers generally were steam-powered, after World War II new ships began to be diesel engined, and a number of VICs were converted to diesel. The coasting trade to serve the islands was kept up by the Glenlight Shipping Company of Greenock until in 1993 the government withdrew subsidies and, unable to compete with road transport using subsidised ferries, the service ended. In fiction Eilean Eisdeal named as the fictional Vital Spark The short stories which Neil Munro first published in the Glasgow Evening News in 1905 appeared in the newspaper over twenty years and achieved widespread fame, with collections issued in book form from 1931 still in print today. With the continuing popularity of these tales, the puffers became film stars in The Maggie, and Para Handy with his Vital Spark was the subject of three popular BBC television series dating from 1959 to 1995. Surviving craft Crinan A small number of puffers survive as conservation projects, though most have diesel engines, VIC 32 is one of the last few surviving coal-fired steam-powered puffers and is based at The Change House, Crinan. She was built by Dunston‚Äôs of Thorne, Yorkshire in November 1943 ‚Äì a busy time for the Clyde Ship building yards. As the wartime Admiralty needed 50, (later 100) victualling boats in a hurry, they were built in groups of three by various yards in England. No new designs were needed as the perfect boat existed in a Clyde Puffer. Steam sailings on VIC 32 have been available to the public from 1979, latterly as cruises on the Caledonian Canal. From 2004 she underwent extensive refitting at Corpach Boatyard at the west end of the canal near Fort William, funded by donations and lottery funds. After fitting of a new boiler by Pridham‚Äôs Engineering and Corpach Boatbuilders, she steamed down from Fort William to Crinan, from where cruises on the Caledonian Canal have now re-commenced. Vic 56 was built by Pollock, of Faversham in 1945. She is preserved in working order at Chatham Historic Dockyard, regularly steaming in the Thames and Medway estuaries. Irvine Vic 96 was built by Dunstons of Thorne, South Yorkshire, in 1945, and after disposal was restored at Maryport. The restoration was completed in 2009, retaining its steam engine, boiler and winch. On 8 August 2009, VIC 96 arrived at her new home, Chatham No. 1 Basin, after an epic 1,000 miles voyage from Elizabeth Dock, Maryport, which took five weeks. VIC 27 was built at Rowhedge Ironworks. She was renamed Auld Reekie, and starred as the Vital Spark in the third BBC TV Para Handy series, was berthed at Crinan Basin for 14 years deteriorating. She was purchased (Oct 2006) by the owner of the Inveraray Maritime Museum who carried out some work on her but she has since been resold to a new owner who has already started on her major restoration work. As she is the oldest surviving steam-powered puffer in existence she must be restored and preserved as part of Scotland's heritage afloat. VIC 72, renamed Eilean Eisdeal, continued in operation as the last of the true working \\"puffers\\" into the mid 1990s. In 2006 she was again renamed as Vital Spark of Glasgow after the Inveraray writer Neil Munro's Para Handy stories. She is now accessible to the public, alongside the Arctic Penguin at the Inveraray Maritime Museum, and continues to make sailings. \\"Pibroch\\" at Letterfrack, now scrapped The Spartan, another diesel-engined \\"puffer\\", is on display at the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine. \\"Spartan\\" has recently undergone restoration work on her hull, and is still being refitted. The museum also features the diesel- powered motor coaster MV Kyles at Irvine (an early Clyde built coaster, not a puffer). The Pibroch, built at Bowling, West Dunbartonshire in 1957 as a diesel-engined boat for the Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd, had been lying at Letterfrack, County Galway, Ireland, in desperate need of restoration, since 2002. The Pibroch deteriorated further as time passed, and her bulkheads began to give way. In 2010 she was sold and was subsequently scrapped. A sister- ship, the Julia T., Lies in 30 m of water in Killary Bay some 300 yards off Lettergesh. There have also been reproduction puffers built to a smaller size, most recently the MV Mary Hill for tourist traffic on the Forth and Clyde canal. Notes  References  *Donald, Stuart (1994).

The system can exchange energy with the heat bath, so that the states of the system will differ in total energy. The principal thermodynamic variable of the canonical ensemble, determining the probability distribution of states, is the absolute temperature (symbol: ). The ensemble typically also depends on mechanical variables such as the number of particles in the system (symbol: ) and the system's volume (symbol: ), each of which influence the nature of the system's internal states. An ensemble with these three parameters is sometimes called the ensemble. The canonical ensemble assigns a probability to each distinct microstate given by the following exponential: :P = e^{(F - E)/(k T)}, where is the total energy of the microstate, and is Boltzmann's constant. The number is the free energy (specifically, the Helmholtz free energy) and is a constant for the ensemble. However, the probabilities and will vary if different N, V, T are selected. The free energy serves two roles: first, it provides a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); second, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function . An alternative but equivalent formulation for the same concept writes the probability as :\\\\textstyle P = \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-E/(k T)}, using the canonical partition function :\\\\textstyle Z = e^{-F/(k T)} rather than the free energy. The equations below (in terms of free energy) may be restated in terms of the canonical partition function by simple mathematical manipulations. Historically, the canonical ensemble was first described by Boltzmann (who called it a holode) in 1884 in a relatively unknown paper. It was later reformulated and extensively investigated by Gibbs in 1902. Applicability of canonical ensemble The canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of a system that is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath (the derivation of this fact can be found in Gibbs). The canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size; while it is necessary to assume that the heat bath is very large (i. e., take a macroscopic limit), the system itself may be small or large. The condition that the system is mechanically isolated is necessary in order to ensure it does not exchange energy with any external object besides the heat bath. In general, it is desirable to apply the canonical ensemble to systems that are in direct contact with the heat bath, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. In practical situations, the use of the canonical ensemble is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is mechanically weak, or 2) by incorporating a suitable part of the heat bath connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection's mechanical influence on the system is modeled within the system. When the total energy is fixed but the internal state of the system is otherwise unknown, the appropriate description is not the canonical ensemble but the microcanonical ensemble. For systems where the particle number is variable (due to contact with a particle reservoir), the correct description is the grand canonical ensemble. In statistical physics textbooks for interacting particle systems the three ensembles are assumed to be thermodynamically equivalent: the fluctuations of macroscopic quantities around their average value become small and, as the number of particles tends to infinity, they tend to vanish. In the latter limit, called the thermodynamic limit, the average constraints effectively become hard constraints. The assumption of ensemble equivalence dates back to Gibbs and has been verified for some models of physical systems with short-range interactions and subject to a small number of macroscopic constraints. Despite the fact that many textbooks still convey the message that ensemble equivalence holds for all physical systems, over the last decades various examples of physical systems have been found for which breaking of ensemble equivalence occurs. Properties Free energy, ensemble averages, and exact differentials Example ensembles = Boltzmann distribution (separable system) = If a system described by a canonical ensemble can be separated into independent parts (this happens if the different parts do not interact), and each of those parts has a fixed material composition, then each part can be seen as a system unto itself and is described by a canonical ensemble having the same temperature as the whole. Moreover, if the system is made up of multiple similar parts, then each part has exactly the same distribution as the other parts. In this way, the canonical ensemble provides exactly the Boltzmann distribution (also known as Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics) for systems of any number of particles. In comparison, the justification of the Boltzmann distribution from the microcanonical ensemble only applies for systems with a large number of parts (that is, in the thermodynamic limit). The Boltzmann distribution itself is one of the most important tools in applying statistical mechanics to real systems, as it massively simplifies the study of systems that can be separated into independent parts (e. g., particles in a gas, electromagnetic modes in a cavity, molecular bonds in a polymer). = Ising model (strongly interacting system) = In a system composed of pieces that interact with each other, it is usually not possible to find a way to separate the system into independent subsystems as done in the Boltzmann distribution. In these systems it is necessary to resort to using the full expression of the canonical ensemble in order to describe the thermodynamics of the system when it is thermostatted to a heat bath. The canonical ensemble is generally the most straightforward framework for studies of statistical mechanics and even allows one to obtain exact solutions in some interacting model systems. A classic example of this is the Ising model, which is a widely discussed toy model for the phenomena of ferromagnetism and of self-assembled monolayer formation, and is one of the simplest models that shows a phase transition. Lars Onsager famously calculated exactly the free energy of an infinite-sized square-lattice Ising model at zero magnetic field, in the canonical ensemble. Precise expressions for the ensemble The precise mathematical expression for a statistical ensemble depends on the kind of mechanics under consideration‚Äîquantum or classical‚Äîsince the notion of a \\"microstate\\" is considerably different in these two cases. In quantum mechanics, the canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a discrete set of microstates with specific energies. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves instead an integral over canonical phase space, and the size of microstates in phase space can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily. = Quantum mechanical = A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by \\\\hat \\\\rho. In basis-free notation, the canonical ensemble is the density matrix :\\\\hat \\\\rho = \\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{1}{kT}(F - \\\\hat H)\\\\big), where is the system's total energy operator (Hamiltonian), and is the matrix exponential operator. The free energy is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a trace of one, \\\\hat \\\\rho=1: :e^{-\\\\frac{F}{k T}} = \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\exp\\\\big(-\\\\tfrac{1}{kT} \\\\hat H\\\\big). The canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using bra‚Äìket notation, if the system's energy eigenstates and energy eigenvalues are known. Given a complete basis of energy eigenstates , indexed by , the canonical ensemble is: :\\\\hat \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i e^{\\\\frac{F - E_i}{k T}} \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_i  :e^{-\\\\frac{F}{k T}} = \\\\sum_i e^{\\\\frac{- E_i}{k T}}. where the are the energy eigenvalues determined by . In other words, a set of microstates in quantum mechanics is given by a complete set of stationary states. The density matrix is diagonal in this basis, with the diagonal entries each directly giving a probability. =Classical mechanical= In classical mechanics, a statistical ensemble is instead represented by a joint probability density function in the system's phase space, , where the and are the canonical coordinates (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system's internal degrees of freedom. In a system of particles, the number of degrees of freedom depends on the number of particles in a way that depends on the physical situation. For a three- dimensional gas of monoatoms (not molecules), . In diatomic gases there will also be rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. The probability density function for the canonical ensemble is: :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} e^{\\\\frac{F - E}{k T}}, where * is the energy of the system, a function of the phase , * is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to .(Historical note) Gibbs' original ensemble effectively set , leading to unit-dependence in the values of some thermodynamic quantities like entropy and chemical potential. Since the advent of quantum mechanics, is often taken to be equal to Planck's constant in order to obtain a semiclassical correspondence with quantum mechanics. * is an overcounting correction factor, often used for particle systems where identical particles are able to change place with each other.In a system of identical particles, (factorial of ). This factor corrects the overcounting in phase space due to identical physical states being found in multiple locations. See the statistical ensemble article for more information on this overcounting. * provides a normalizing factor and is also the characteristic state function, the free energy. Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function: :e^{-\\\\frac{F}{k T}} = \\\\int \\\\ldots \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} e^{\\\\frac{- E}{k T}} \\\\, dp_1 \\\\ldots dq_n This integral is taken over the entire phase space. In other words, a microstate in classical mechanics is a phase space region, and this region has volume . This means that each microstate spans a range of energy, however this range can be made arbitrarily narrow by choosing to be very small. The phase space integral can be converted into a summation over microstates, once phase space has been finely divided to a sufficient degree.  Surrounding surface  Canonical ensemble is a closed system, so its free energy contains surface terms. Therefore, strictly speaking, CE should be called the ensemble, where A is the area of the surrounding surface. If the partition function has no special surface potential terms, this is the surface of a hard solid.

Drum served as the Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister in the Second Turnbull Ministry between 20 December 2017 and 5 March 2018. Drum is a former member for the North Western Province, and later the Northern Victoria Region, in the Legislative Council of Victoria between 2002 and 2016. Drum served as the Victorian Minister for Sports and Veterans Affairs in the Napthine Ministry from March to December 2014. He is also a former Australian rules footballer and coach, most notably as senior coach of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League from 1999 to 2001. He turned to a life in politics after being sacked as Fremantle's coach during the 2001 season. Early life Drum was born in Shepparton. After graduating from high school, he became a carpenter and joiner, running his own shed construction business for several years. At the same time, he embarked on a football career and was drafted to the then-VFL's Geelong Football Club in 1981. Over the next nine years, he played 63 games for Geelong. While playing football, he also operated his own business selling sheds and garages. He retired from the VFL at the end of 1990, and joined Victorian Football Association club Werribee in 1991. Coaching career In 1993, he quit his business and took up a coaching position with Port Melbourne in the VFA, leading the club to a grand final loss against his former club, Werribee. In 1994, he moved to Sydney, taking up a position as the assistant coach of the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL), under head coach Ron Barassi. After five years in this role, Drum was approached by Fremantle, which had not renewed the contract of their first coach, Gerard Neesham. Drum had been one of the most highly anticipated coaching recruits of the season, and some were surprised that he signed with the struggling Dockers. He had been expected to sign with the Collingwood Football Club the previous year, but the deal had fallen through. Drum coached Fremantle for three seasons, during which the side suffered from a lack of success. In his first season, the club finished 15th (second-last). There was a slight improvement in his second season, in which Fremantle won several high-profile games; still, the club struggled, finishing twelfth. However, it was the 2001 season, in which Fremantle lost their first nine games of the season, that sealed Drum's fate. He was dismissed after the club's round-nine loss to the Sydney Swans, and was replaced by former Fremantle player and inaugural club captain Ben Allan, who did not fare much better, with the Dockers still winless after Round 17 in a 22-round season. After losing the Fremantle job, Drum moved back to Victoria and took up a position as coach of the Bendigo Diggers in the Victorian Football League. The situation was similar to Fremantle ‚Äì the Diggers finished the season winless, with a single draw against the Murray Kangaroos. At the end of the season, Drum decided to retire from football and move into politics, successfully seeking Nationals pre-selection for the Victorian Legislative Council seat of North Western Province at the 2002 state election. Political career =Victorian parliament= Drum was first elected to parliament in 2002 during the Labor Party landslide, in which many seats across the state fell to the minority government, and numerous shadow ministers lost their seats. Drum was elected despite the losses sustained by the conservative parties, with the Liberal Party losing a net total of 26 seats while the Nationals suffered a net loss of only one seat. Despite being a newly elected member with no previous political experience, Drum advanced quickly in the Nationals' ranks. The Liberal and National parties had broken off their Coalition in 2000, and hence fought the 2002 election separately. As a result, the Nationals had to organise a shadow cabinet of their own. Drum soon found himself Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council, party Whip, and Shadow Minister for Youth Affairs, Education Services, Sport, Recreation, Racing, Consumer Affairs and the Commonwealth Games. From 2003 onward, he was a member of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. For the 2006 election the Legislative Council underwent major structural changes. Drum's previous seat of North-West Region was replaced by the much larger Northern Victoria Region and preferential-proportional (multi-seat) rather than majority-preferential (one seat per election) voting. Drum was easily elected with a quota in his own right and was the only National Party member for the region. In March 2014, Drum was appointed Minister for Sports and Veterans Affairs in the Napthine coalition government, serving until the government was defeated at the 2014 state election. =Federal parliament= On 11 April 2016, the Nationals announced that Drum had been preselected to contest the federal seat of Murray at the 2016 federal election. He resigned from the Victorian Legislative Council on 26 May, prior to the closing date for the nomination of candidates for the federal election. The seat had been held by the Liberal's Sharman Stone, who announced her retirement on 26 March 2016. Because there was no sitting Coalition member, a three-cornered-contest for the seat ensued, in which Drum defeated his Liberal opponent, Duncan McGauchie, son of Donald McGauchie. Drum ultimately prevailed with 55 percent of the two-party vote to McGauchie's 44 percent. This, however, did not make Murray a marginal seat. It had been held by either the Liberals or Nationals since its creation in 1949; the Coalition would have won it with well over 70 percent of the vote in a \\"traditional\\" two-party matchup with Labor. Indeed, much of the region had been held by a conservative party without interruption since Federation. Drum became a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Nationals leader Michael McCormack during 2018, even going so far as to publicly call for former prime minister Tony Abbott to retire from parliament.https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-politics/damian-drum-says- tony-abbott-should-quit-parliament-as-speculation-mounts-on-malcolm-turnbulls- leadership-ng-b88934392z After an unsuccessful leadership challenge against McCormack in February 2020, it was reported that McCormack has made an unprecedented intervention to attempt to forestall the closure of a 40-bed aged care facility in Drum's electorate by procuring a grant within four days that raised questions about due process. Murray was abolished ahead of the 2019 election, and was essentially replaced by the Division of Nicholls. This seat was as comfortably safe as its predecessor, and Drum won the new seat at that election with 70 percent of the two-party vote. Drum was nominated in 2020 by the government as the new Deputy Speaker but was defeated in a secret vote by Llew O'Brien, a fellow National Party member who had quit the party that morning and was nominated by the ALP. The surprise defeat was attributed to ongoing leadership tension in the wake of Barnaby Joyce's unsuccessful challenge against Michael McCormack for the Nationals leadership.https://www.theguardian.com/australia- news/live/2020/feb/10/nationals-coalition-liberals-queensland-morrison- politics-live In May 2020, Drum made headlines when he was public quoted attacking NSW Deputy Premier and state Nationals leader John Barilaro in the wake of Barilaro's decision not to contest the Eden-Monaro by-election. In response to some commentary suggesting that a switch to federal politics would enable Barilaro to succeed McCormack as federal party leader, Drum strongly defended McCormack and described the latter as a \\"trojan\\". It emerged in the fallout from Barilaro's decision that Barilaro had sent text messages to McCormack criticising his leadership and failure to support Barilaro's planned switch to federal politics, with Drum accusing Barilaro of leaking the exchanges to the media. Having condemned Barilaro for alleged leaking, later the same day Drum would express shock that copies of misogynistic text messages about Barilaro's wife that Drum had exchanged in a WhatsApp group with party colleagues Darren Chester and Kevin Hogan had been leaked to the media.https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6154546327001 References External links * *Official website - Victorian Nationals *The Nationals ‚Äì Victoria *Rural & Regional Committee ‚Äì Parliament of Victoria * - Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Fremantle Football Club coaches Category:Geelong Football Club players Category:Werribee Football Club players Category:Port Melbourne Football Club coaches Category:People from Shepparton Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Council Category:Australian sportsperson-politicians Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Murray Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Nicholls Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:Turnbull Government Category:Former government ministers of Australia ","title":"Damian Drum"},{"id":"1137727","text":"Galashiels Academy is the high school in Galashiels, Scotland, that serves the surrounding area as well as Stow (which does not have its own high school).

Daoud Tawil had business both in the West Bank and Jordan. Suha's mother, Raymonda Hawa Tawil, born in Acre, is a member of the Hawa family of Acre, prominent property owners in the Haifa area. She was a poet and writer. She became a Palestinian political activist after 1967 and was arrested several times by the Israelis, making her a media star. She was also a high-profile Palestinian journalist. Suha was raised Catholic. Suha, growing up in Ramallah, was influenced by the political activism of her mother conducted in the 1970s from her PLO-influenced news bureau in East Jerusalem. Suha attended a convent school, Rosary Sisters' School, in Beit Hanina, Jerusalem. At age 18, she went to Paris to study, where she lived with her older sister, who was married to Ibrahim Souss, the PLO's then-ambassador to France. As a student, Suha was a leader in the General Union of Palestine Students (GUPS) in France, where she organized demonstrations for the Palestinian cause. Marriage to Arafat Suha, with her mother and sisters, met Arafat for the first time in 1985. When he visited France in 1989, she acted as an interpreter at the meetings with visitors and French government officials. It is argued that through her mother Suha met her husband. However, it is also argued that Suha met Arafat in 1987 and 1988, and helped organize his visit to Paris in 1989. Soon after his departure from Paris, Arafat asked Suha to come and work with him in Tunisia (where the Palestinian Liberation Organization had set up a haven). Suha secretly married Arafat on 17 July 1990, when she was aged 27 and he was 61. Their only child, daughter Zahwa, was born on 24 July 1995 in Neuilly-sur- Seine, France. Zahwa was named after Arafat's mother. Suha converted to Sunni Islam at the time of her marriage. Many Palestinians believe her conversion to be false, however; and allege that Suha has had millions of dollars channeled into secret bank accounts by her late husband, both of which she denies. During her marriage, she tried to leave Arafat on many occasions to escape the gossip aimed at her, but was not permitted to. After Arafat's death Suha and Zahwa lived in Tunisia from 2004 to 2007. Suha had also lived in Tunisia before marrying Arafat. They obtained Tunisian citizenship in September 2006. Zahwa went to the American Cooperative School of Tunisia. From 1998 onward she lived in Tunisia and France on and off. =Controversies in Tunisia= On 7 August 2007, Tunisia, without warning Suha, revoked her citizenship but not her daughter's. Suha claimed her Tunisian property was also frozen. On 31 October 2011, the Tunis Court of First Instance issued an international arrest warrant for Suha, relating to corruption in a business deal that involved the former Tunisian first lady, Leila Ben Ali, in 2006. Initially, Suha proclaimed her complete cooperation with the Tunisian prosecutors. But shortly thereafter she denounced the prosecution as a Tunisian scheme to defame her and the Palestinian cause. She was, at the time, living in Malta. She also denied reports that she had any money or property belonging to the Palestinian national cause, and she said that she opposed normalization of relations with Israel. =Other activities= On 27 November 2012, at the behest of Suha, Arafat's body was exhumed in the West Bank, in order to have samples taken from his remains. The purpose of the exhumation, according to Suha, was to determine whether he was poisoned with Polonium. As of 2011, she was living with her daughter in Malta.

The modernFrom Hamilton 1860:67\\" In modern times, the attention of philosophers was called to this law of Leibnitz, who, on the two principles of Reason and of Contradiction, founded the whole edifice of his philosophy.3 3 See Th√©odic√©e, ¬ß 44. Monadologie, ¬ß¬ß 81, 82. ‚ÄîED.\\" formulation of the principle is usually attributed to Gottfried Leibniz,There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in Anselm of Canterbury: his phrase quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit and the formulation of the ontological argument for the existence of God. A clearer connection is with the cosmological argument for the existence of God. The principle can be seen in both Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in A. O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being. although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including Anaximander, Parmenides, Archimedes, Plato and Aristotle,Hamilton 1860:66 Cicero, Avicenna, Thomas Aquinas, and Spinoza.. Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with \\"ex nihilo nihil fit\\".Alexander R. Pruss (2007) \\"Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason\\" in Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy Ch. 14Hamilton attributes this expression to Cicero; Hamilton 1860:66 Hamilton identified the laws of inference modus ponens with the \\"law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent\\" and modus tollens with its contrapositive expression.From Hamilton 1860:241‚Äì242: ‚Äú2¬∞, \\"If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, ‚Äì that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, ‚Äì If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent.\\" 1 The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio. Or, otherwise, a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of modus ponens, the other of the modus tollens. 2 1 Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. ‚ÄîED. 2 See Kant, Logik ¬ß¬ß 75‚Äì76 . Krug, Logik, ¬ß 82. ‚ÄîED.\\" See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff. Formulation The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following: *For every entity X, if X exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why X exists. *For every event E, if E occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why E occurs. *For every proposition P, if P is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why P is true. A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of reasons or causes, for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different, however, depending on which interpretation is given. It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to axioms within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system. The principle declares that all propositions considered to be should be deducible from the set axioms at the base of the construction. However, G√∂del has shown that for every sufficiently expressive deductive system a proposition exists that can neither be proved nor disproved (see G√∂del's incompleteness theorems). Leibniz's view Leibniz identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the law of identity (and the principle of non-contradiction): \\"Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction.\\" Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction. Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of infinitary reasons, to which God had access but humans did not: > In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can > never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality > or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone > seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but > the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the > subject, since he sees whatever is in the series., p. 94, On Freedom > (1689?). Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of closed system, in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of Buridan's ass. Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying: > In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, > impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the > universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the > middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all > is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor > the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides > of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the > ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will > determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is > free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true > that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is > impossible. (Theodicy, pg. 150) Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of absolute space: > I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for > which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is > against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely > uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not > absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space. Now > from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside > the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there > should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among > themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, > and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for > instance, by changing East into West. As a law of thought The principle was one of the four recognised laws of thought, that held a place in European pedagogy of logic and reasoning (and, to some extent, philosophy in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of Leo Tolstoy, amongst others, in the elevated form that history could not be accepted as random. A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called necessary conditions).See e.g. T. Hobbes, Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum, 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, On the Freedom of the Will, c. 4. See also: John Bramhall Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions. =Hamilton's fourth law: \\"Infer nothing without ground or reason\\"= Here is how Hamilton, circa 1837‚Äì1838,From the Preface: \\"The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837‚Äì8).\\" The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by \\"‚ÄîED.\\" by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860. expressed his \\"fourth law\\" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60‚Äì61: :\\"I now go on to the fourth law. :\\"Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent: :\\"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding ‚Äì the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason (principium Rationis Sufficientis); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent (principium Rationis et Consecutionis). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the logical reason ground, or antecedent; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the logical consequent; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the logical connection or consequence. This law is expressed in the formula ‚Äì Infer nothing without a ground or reason.1 :\\"Relations between Reason and Consequent: The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following: :1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¬∂ exist a consequent; and, vice versa, when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason. ::1 See Schulze, Logik, ¬ß19, and Krug, Logik, ¬ß20, ‚Äì ED.From the index: \\"SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T.\\" These are philosophers Gottlob Ernst Schulze (23 August 1761 ‚Äì 14 January 1833) and Wilhelm Traugott Krug (22 June 1770 ‚Äì 12 January 1842). :\\"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, vice versa, where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other. :\\"The logical significance of this law: The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, ‚Äì That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science.\\" Schopenhauer's Four Forms According to Schopenhauer's On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, there are four distinct forms of the principle. First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4. Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5. Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6. Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; \\"I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four.\\"Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7. > \\"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of > representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of > reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective > correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally > self-consciousness.\\"Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the > Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court > Publishing Company, 1997), 8. Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9. \\"Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason\\" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings \\"must be produced by an act of will which has a motive.\\" As his proposition in 43 states, \\"Motivation is causality seen from within.\\"Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10. Proposed proofs of universal validity Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least in general, in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. A famous argument or proof as proposed by Immanuel Kant from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and \\"directionality\\" of time. Arthur Schopenhauer provides a proof of the a priori nature of the concept of causality by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect. However, he also claims that \\"to seek a proof for the principle of sufficient reason in particular is especially absurd and is evidence of a want of reflection,\\" and that he who does this \\"finds himself involved in that circle of demanding a proof for the right to demand a proof.\\" Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 14, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1974) Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an \\"arrow of time\\") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), backwards causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the paradox of free will (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work).Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.

It was the successor to the M1 and M1A1 flamethrowers. Although its burn time was only around 7 seconds and the flame was only effective out to around 20‚Äì40 meters, it was still a useful weapon. However, with the arrival of flamethrower tanks, the need for flamethrower-carrying infantrymen to expose themselves to enemy fire was greatly reduced. Though some M2s were sold off, the majority were scrapped when they were declared obsolete. Variants of the M2 The M2 was the WWII model had hexagonal gas caps and hourglass frames. It was also called the M2-2, M2 for the tank groups and -2 for the wand type. The M2A1-2 is the variation of the M2 devised during the Korean War. These had straight sided backpack frames, vented gas caps, a cylinder sized regulator and a safety valve. These are much more common today than WWII models. M2A1-7 was a flamethrower used by the American troops during the Vietnam War. It is the updated version of the M2A1-2 unit used during The Korean War. It has four controls: * Back of the rear grip: firing safety catch. * Front of the rear grip: firing trigger. * On top of the front part: igniter safety catch * Under the front part: igniter trigger. The M9A1-7 was the most common model used in Vietnam and is much lighter and easier to use. Tanks for this weapon are commonly found, but most wands were destroyed after the Vietnam war. Some U.S. Army flamethrowers have a front handgrip with the same shape as the rear handgrip. In these models the igniter controls are on the front handgrip, arranged in the same way as the rear handgrip controls. The M2 was replaced by the M9A1-7 flamethrower which was used in Vietnam.

It belongs to a group of four diseases characterized under the name neuroacanthocytosis.\\"Chorea Acanthocytosis.\\" Genetics Home Reference. Genetics Home Reference, ::May 2008. Web. 07 Feb. 2010. When a patient's blood is viewed under a microscope, some of the red blood cells appear thorny. These thorny cells are called acanthocytes. Other effects of the disease may include epilepsy, behaviour changes, muscle degeneration, and neuronal degradation similar to Huntington's disease. The average age of onset of symptoms is 35 years. The disease is incurable and inevitably leads to premature death. Chorea-acanthocytosis is a very complex autosomal recessive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. It often shows itself as a mixed movement disorder, in which chorea, tics, dystonia and even parkinsonism may appear as a symptom. This disease is also characterized by the presence of a few different movement disorders including chorea, dystonia etc. Chorea-acanthocytosis is considered an autosomal recessive disorder, although a few cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been noted.  Signs and symptoms  There are multiple symptoms that can help this disease to be diagnosed, this disease is marked by the presence of acanthocytes in blood (these acanthocytes can sometimes be absent or even make a late appearance in the course of the disease.) and neurodegeneration causing a choreiform movement disorder. Another one of them would be that this disease should be considered in patients who have elevated levels of acanthocytes in a peripheral blood film. The serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease. People afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration. There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia, one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms.  Cause  Choreoacanthocytosis is caused by a mutation in both copies of the gene VPS13A, which codes for vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A.  Diagnosis  Protein function tests that demonstrate a reduce in chorein levels and also genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis given to a patient. For a disease like this it is often necessary to sample the blood of the patient on multiple occasions with a specific request given to the haematologist to examine the film for acanthocytes. Another point is that the diagnosis of the disease can be confirmed by the absence of chorein in the western blot of the erythrocyte membranes.  Treatment  The treatment to battle the disease chorea-acanthocytosis is completely symptomatic. For example, Botulinum toxin injections can help to control orolingual dystonia. Deep Brain Stimulation is a treatment that has varied effects on the people suffering from the symptoms of this disease, for some it has helped in a large way and for other people it did not help whatsoever, it is more effective on specific symptoms of the disease. Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis should undergo a cardiac evaluation every 5 years to look for cardiomyopathy.

It maintains a website but no publicly visible formal organisation. The organisation was linked with the 2000‚Äì2008 Greater London mayoral administrations of Ken Livingstone, although Livingstone was never a member. Four of Livingstone's key advisers were Socialist Action members; all made the \\"top 25\\" in the Evening Standard's 2007 list of the most influential people in London.Ross Lydall \\"Ken and his cronies top new London power list\\" , Evening Standard, 5 October 2007Matthew Taylor \\"From maverick outsider to establishment candidate. But can Livingstone win again?\\", The Guardian, 24 April 2008  History  The group was founded in 1982 when the International Marxist Group entered the Labour Party and changed its name to the Socialist League. It became generally known by the name of its publication, Socialist Action, which first appeared on 16 March 1983. The group organised around the newspaper, but also had a bookshop The Other Bookshop, in Islington, as well as a printing press, Lithoprint Ltd, in Stoke Newington, which it still owns. In September 1983, assuming that the Labour Party's actions against the Militant group would extend to Socialist Action as well, the group decided to disappear from public view, closing down the bookshop, and taking other measures to guarantee invisibility. Members were assigned pen names, and after the closure of the bookshop met in an assortment of pubs.Andrew Hosken (2008), Ken: The Ups and Downs of Ken Livingstone, Arcadia Books The group adopted an entryist strategy \\"to protect members from any potential Militant-style purge\\". By the mid-1980s, the group had around 500 members. Working with increasing secrecy in the Labour Party, often under the auspices of other apparently independent organisations, its members became supporters of Ken Livingstone and the Campaign Group of Labour MPs. The group's character changed in a wave of splits in the mid-1980s, beginning in 1985 when a minority, led by Phil Hearse, Dave Packer, Davy Jones, and Jane Kelly formed the International Group, whose members were recognised by the International as remaining individual members. In 1987 the International Group merged with the Socialist Group to form the International Socialist Group and publish Socialist Outlook. The remaining majority of the Socialist League consisted of two currents. One, led by Brian Grogan, was part of the Pathfinder tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party (United States). The Grogan current was expelled by the Central Committee led by John Ross, and became the Communist League (UK, 1988). The remainder of the group drew pessimistic conclusions from the fall of the Stalinist regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It continued to define itself as a Trotskyist group. It considers the Soviet model to have been preferable to capitalism for the working class, but it has always criticised that model for its bureaucratic and undemocratic features, accepting Trotsky's definition of the USSR as a degenerated workers' state. Socialist Action participated in the 1989 and 1990 Fourth International Youth Summer Camps but suffered another split after the 1991 World Congress. Small groups of Socialist Action members regularly resigned and joined the International Group, and its successor, the International Socialist Group, between the original split in 1985 and the 1991. At the 1991 World Congress of the Fourth International, the group was given equal status within the International with the International Socialist Group. At the 1995 world congress the ISG replaced Socialist Action as the British section. =Ken Livingstone= The group's association with Ken Livingstone goes back to 1985, when the group's leader, John Ross, became Livingstone's economic advisor. In the mid-1980s the group adopted Livingstone as something of a figurehead, regarding Arthur Scargill and Tony Benn as spent forces, and according to Atma Singh was \\"instrumental\\" in getting Livingstone elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee in 1987 and 1988. Running as an independent candidate for Mayor in 2000, Livingstone's decision to appoint members of Socialist Action to his administration during his first term drew criticism in the media. When Livingstone re-appointed his administration in 2004, members of Socialist Action were described as his \\"stooges\\". In a January 2008 article that was subsequently spun as revealing a \\"secret Marxist cell\\" at the GLA, Atma Singh, a former member of SA who had been Policy Advisor on Asian Affairs to Ken Livingstone from 2001 to 2007, detailed some of the history and activities of Socialist Action, accusing members of planning a \\"bourgeois democratic revolution\\", trying to accumulate power and manipulating the Mayor.Atma Singh, The Times, 19 January 2008 Atma Singh's full article on Ken Livingstone A subsequent episode of the Channel 4 documentary series Dispatches, \\"The Court of Ken\\", presented by journalist Martin Bright, featured Singh and others making these same allegations.\\"The Court of Ken\\" Part 1 of 5, YouTube The advisers named, including chief of staff Simon Fletcher, deputy chief of staff and director of public affairs and transport Redmond O'Neill, economic adviser John Ross, green adviser Mark Watts and culture adviser Jude Woodward, refused to state whether or not they are still active as Socialist Action, and a spokesman for Livingstone responded to the charges by referring to Singh's removal from his job for \\"failure to discharge his duties\\" and calling Singh \\"an embittered ex- employee\\". Livingstone referred to the claims in the Dispatches documentary as a hatchet job.http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=84746‚àà_page_id=7‚àà_a_source In 2007 Livingstone changed the GLA rules so that his eight key advisers, four associated with SA (including John Ross and the late Redmond O'Neill), who as temporary appointments would not normally have been entitled to severance pay, received an average of ¬£200,000 each.  Other activity  Socialist Action was heavily involved in the publication and editorial control of Socialist Campaign Group News. Its members have maintained leading positions in many campaigns - the National Abortion Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, National Assembly Against Racism and various coalitions against the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, for example. As a result, Socialist Action exert an influence beyond that which might be expected from so small a grouping. In 2001 it stopped publishing its journal, also named Socialist Action, but continue to organise as a faction, for instance as the Student Broad Left. Some of its activists played leading roles in organising the 2004 European Social Forum.Marianne Maeckelbergh, (2009), Will of the Many: How the Alterglobalisation Movement Is Changing the Face of Democracy, Pluto Press, p. 76 Additionally its members continue to publish occasional pamphlets and leaflets. It has relaunched its website, with an indepth analysis of the world economic situation following the economic crisis. The article applies the Marxist concept of the organic composition of capital to understand how the US economy is in a long-term decline and in turn how the non-capitalist character of China is helping it to emerge from the crisis.Socialist Action Socialist Action also participated in Respect - The Unity Coalition after the 2007 split in that party.Workers' Liberty Several of its supporters became members of the party and one served as its national treasurer.  Jeremy Corbyn  Following Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour Party leader and Leader of the Opposition in 2015, it was claimed (by former member Atma Singh) that Socialist Action were building \\"a real power base\\" around Corbyn.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy- Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html Simon Fletcher - who according to Singh had been on the SA central committee - was appointed Corbyn's Chief of Staffhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/simon-fletcher-from- communism-to-jeremy-corbyns-consigliere-10508673.html while John Ross has been linked to Corbyn's inner circle.http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1641943.ece References  External links  * Socialist Action * 2008 article by Nick Cohen, The Observer * 2008 article by ex-member Atma Singh, Sunday Times *The Guardian, 22 January 2008, report on Channel 4 Dispatches documentary Category:Political parties established in 1982 Category:Far-left political parties Category:Trotskyist organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Fourth International (post-reunification) Category:International Marxist Group Category:1982 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Political organisations based in London Category:Organisations associated with the Labour Party (UK) Category:Entryists ","title":"Socialist Action (UK)"},{"id":"1137754","text":"Subconjunctival bleeding, also known as subconjunctival hemorrhage, is bleeding from a small blood vessel over the whites of the eye. It results in a red spot in the white of the eye. There is generally little to no pain and vision is not affected. Generally only one eye is affected. Causes can include coughing, vomiting, heavy lifting, and direct injury including that from wearing contact lenses. Risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, older age, blood thinners, and trauma including that from wearing contact lenses. They occur in about 2% of newborns following a vaginal delivery. The blood occurs between the conjunctiva and the episclera. Diagnosis is generally based on the appearance. Generally no specific treatment is required and the condition improves in two to three weeks. Artificial tears may be used to help with any irritation. They occur relatively commonly. Both sexes are affected equally. Spontaneous bleeding occurs more commonly over the age of 50 while the traumatic type occurs more often in young males. Signs and symptoms A subconjunctival bleeding usually does not result in pain, although occasionally the affected eye may feel dry, rough, or scratchy. A subconjunctival bleeding initially appears bright-red underneath the transparent conjunctiva. Later, the bleeding may spread and become green or yellow as the hemoglobin is metabolized. It usually disappears within 2 weeks.

Eye surgery such as LASIK, and atmospheric pressure changes such as those from diving deeply in water and aircraft altitude changes. Diagnosis Diagnosis is by visual inspection, by noting the typical finding of bright red discoloration confined to the white portion (sclera) of the eye. Management A subconjunctival bleeding is typically a self-limiting condition that requires no treatment unless there is evidence of an eye infection or there has been significant eye trauma. Artificial tears may be applied four to six times a day if the eye feels dry or scratchy. The elective use of aspirin is typically discouraged.

A sail may be classified in a variety of ways, including by its orientation to the vessel (e.g. fore-and-aft) and its shape, (e.g. (a)symmetrical, triangular, quadrilateral, etc.). Sails are typically constructed out of flexible material that is shaped by various means, while in use, to offer an appropriate airfoil, according to the strength and apparent direction of the wind. A variety of features and fittings allow the sail to be attached to lines and spars. Whereas conventional sails form an airfoil with one layer of fabric, wingsails comprise a structure that has material on both sides to form an airfoil‚Äîmuch like a wing placed vertically on the vessel‚Äîand are beyond the scope of this article. Classifications Sails may be classified as either triangular, which describes sails that either come to one point of suspension at the top or where the sail comes to a point at the forward end, or quadrilateral, which includes sails that are attached to a spar at the top and have three other sides, or as square. They also may be classified as symmetrical (square sails and symmetric spinnakers) or asymmetrical (most other sails). Typically, asymmetrical sails perform better on points of sail closer to the wind than symmetrical sails and are designed for fore-and-aft rigs. Symmetrical sails perform best on points of sail that are further from the wind direction. =Triangular= Triangular sails have names for each of three edges and three corners, explained below. Rigs with such sails include Bermuda, cutter, lateen and vessels with mixed sail plans that include jibs and other staysails. Most triangular sails are classified as asymmetrical and fore and aft; symmetric spinnakers are symmetrical triangular sails that are designed for off-the-wind use. =Quadrilateral= Gaff, gunter, lug, junk and some sprit sails have four sides and are set fore and aft so that one edge is leading into the wind, forming an asymmetric quadrilateral shape. Naming conventions are consistent with triangular sails, except for the top edge and corners, as explained below. = Square = A square rig is a type of sail and rigging arrangement in which the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal spars which are perpendicular, or square, to the keel of the vessel and to the masts‚Äîthe sails themselves are not square but are symmetrically quadrilateral. These spars are called yards and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the yardarmsOxford English Dictionary. A ship mainly so rigged is called a square-rigger. Shape Square sail edges and corners (top), running rigging (bottom) The shape of a sail is defined by its edges and corners in the plane of the sail, laid out on a flat surface. The edges may be curved, either to extend the sail's shape as an airfoil or to define its shape in use. In use, the sail becomes a curved shape, adding the dimension of depth or draft. =Edges= The top of all sails is called the head, the leading edge is called the luff, the trailing edge is the leech, and the bottom edge is the foot. *Head ‚Äì The head is the upper edge of the sail, and is attached at the throat and peak to a gaff, yard, or sprit. For a triangular sail the head refers to the topmost corner. *Leech ‚Äì The aft (back) edge of a fore-and-aft sail is called the leech (also spelled leach). The leech is either side edge of a symmetrical sail‚Äîtriangular or square. However, once a symmetrical sail has wind blowing along its surface, whether on a reach or close-hauled, the windward leech may be called a luff (see below). *Luff ‚Äì The forward (leading) edge of a fore-and-aft sail is called the luff, and may be attached along a mast or a stay. When on a reach, the windward leech of a spinnaker (symmetrical or not) is called the luff and, when on a reach or close-hauled, the windward leech of a square sail may be called the luff or the weather leech. *Foot ‚Äì The foot of a sail is its bottom edge. On a fore- and-aft mainsail, the foot is often attached, at the tack and clew, to a boom; on a square sail to a spar by clews on both ends; if no boom or spar is present, the sail is said to be \\"loose-footed\\". Roach A fore-and-aft triangular mainsail achieves a better approximation of a wing form by extending the leech aft, beyond the line between the head and clew in an arc called the roach, rather than having a triangular shape. This added area would flutter in the wind and not contribute to the efficient airfoil shape of the sail without the presence of battens. Offshore cruising mainsails sometimes have a hollow leech (the inverse of a roach) to obviate the need for battens and their ensuing likelihood of chafing the sail. Roach is a term also applied to square sail design‚Äîit is the arc of a circle above a straight line from clew to clew at the foot of a square sail, from which sail material is omitted. The roach allows the foot of the sail to clear stays coming up the mast, as the sails are rotated from side to side. =Corners= Genoa jib, showing reinforcement and attachment points: 1\\\\. Head 2.

Foot 15\\\\. Furling marks The names of corners of sails vary, depending on shape and symmetry. *Head ‚Äì In a triangular sail, the corner where the luff and the leech connect is called the head. On a square sail, the top corners are head cringles, where there are grommets, called cringles. *Peak ‚Äì On a quadrilateral sail, the peak is the upper aft corner of the sail, at the top end of a gaff, a sprit or other spar. *Throat ‚Äì On a quadrilateral sail, the throat is the upper forward corner of the sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two halyards to raise the sails: the throat halyard raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the peak halyard raises the aft, peak end. *Clew ‚Äì The corner where the leech and foot connect is called the clew on a fore-and-aft sail. On a jib, the sheet is connected to the clew; on a mainsail, the sheet is connected to the boom (if present) near the clew. Clews are the lower two corners of a square sail. Square sails have sheets attached to their clews like triangular sails, but the sheets are used to pull the sail down to the yard below rather than to adjust the angle it makes with the wind. The corner where the leech and the foot connect is called the clew. In the case of a symmetrical spinnaker, each of the lower corners of the sail is a clew. However, under sail on a given tack, the corner to which the spinnaker sheet is attached is called the clew, and the corner attached to the spinnaker pole is referred to as the tack. *Tack ‚Äì The tack is the corner on a fore-and-aft sail where the luff and foot connect and, on a mainsail, is located where the boom and mast connect. On a square sail underway, the tack is the windward clew and also the line holding down that corner. =Draft= Those triangular sails that are attached to both a mast along the luff and a boom along the foot have depth, known as draft or draught, which results from the luff and foot being curved, rather than straight as they are attached to those spars. Draft creates a more efficient airfoil shape for the sail. Draft can also be induced in triangular staysails by adjustment of the sheets and the angle from which they reach the sails. Construction Laminated sail with Kevlar and Carbon fibers. Catamaran with full-length battens in a laminated sail. Sails are constructed of fabrics that may be woven or manufactured as films. The sail are often assembled of multiple panels that are arrayed in a manner that transfers the load from the wind to the sail's attachment points‚Äîa combination of corners and edges‚Äîthat transmits the load into the mast and powers the boat. Construction of such sails requires stitching, bonding, reinforcements and other features to achieve this. Other sails are constructed directly from fibers, filaments and films. =Materials= The characteristics of a sail are due to design, construction and the attributes of the fibers, which are woven together to make the sail cloth. There are several key factors in evaluating a fiber for suitability in weaving a sail-cloth: *Initial modulus ‚Äì The ability to resist stretching. Higher resistance is better for upwind sails. *Breaking strength (tenacity) ‚Äì Measured as a force per cross sectional area of fiber. Higher is better for sails. *Creep ‚Äì Describes the long term stretch of a fiber or fabric. A material with creep may have a superior modulus, but lose its shape over time. *Resistance to ultraviolet light ‚Äì Strength loss from exposure to the Sun‚Äôs UV rays measured by a standardized exposure test. *Flex strength ‚Äì Strength lost due to bending, folding, or flogging, which is frequently measured with an industry standard 50 fold test. *Cost- effectiveness ‚Äì Both the initial cost and its durability of the material define its cost-effectiveness over time. Traditionally, sails were made from flax or cotton canvas. Materials used in sails, as of the 21st Century, include nylon for spinnakers‚Äîwhere light weight and elastic resistance to shock load are valued‚Äîand a range of fibers, used for triangular sails, that includes Dacron, aramid fibers‚Äîincluding Kevlar, and other liquid crystal polymer fibers‚Äîincluding Vectran. Woven materials, like Dacron, may be specified as either high or low tenacity, as indicated, in part by their denier count (a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers). High- tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 220, 350 and 570 deniers, whereas low- tenacity Dacron comes in multiples of 150, 250, and 400 deniers. Sailcloth is typically heat-shrunk to tighten the weave and then receives a chemical bonding finish of melamine. Such cloth is typically specified by deniers for warp and fill (weft), e.g. 220/570. =Panels and laminations= Sail detail at the tack of a mainsail, showing various types of seam stitches where panels join, bolt ropes in the luff and foot, and two cringles. Conventional sails comprise panels, which are most often stitched together, at other times adhered. There are two basic configurations, cross-cut and radial. Cross-cut sails have the panels sewn parallel to one another, often parallel to the foot of the sail, and are the less expensive of the two sail constructions. Triangular cross-cut sail panels are designed to meet the mast and stay at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the bias) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail. Radial sails have panels that \\"radiate\\" from corners in order to efficiently transmit stress and are typically higher- performance than cross-cut sails. A bi-radial sail has panels radiating from two of three corners; a tri-radial sail has panels radiating from all three corners. Mainsails are more likely to be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) are more likely to be tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners. Higher- performance sails may be laminated, constructed directly from multiple plies of filaments, fibers, taffetas, and films‚Äîinstead of woven textiles‚Äîand adhered together. Molded sails are laminated sails formed over a curved mold and adhered together into a shape that does not lie flat. Where a sail may rub against a spreader on the mast, a spreader patch may be placed on a jib, when it overlaps with the mast, or on the mainsail, where it may interfere when furled or when the sail is backwinded against the mast. Zagiel horyzont.svgCross-cut panels Zagiel birad.svgBi-radial panels Zagiel gwiazda.svgTri-radial panels =Stitching and bonding= Conventional sail panels are sewn together. Sails are tensile structures, so the role of a seam is to transmit a tensile load from panel to panel. For a sewn, textile sail this is done through thread and is limited by the strength of the thread and the strength of the hole in the textile through which it passes. Sail seams are often overlapped between panels and sewn with zig-zag stitches that create many connections per unit of seam length. Measures for seam structural attributes‚Äîshown with a typical value for a sewn seam‚Äîinclude: *Breaking force (newtons) ‚Äì *Elongation (percent) ‚Äì 22% *Strength (newtons/millimetre) ‚Äì *Modulus of elasticity (newtons/millimetre) ‚Äì Whereas textiles are typically sewn together, other sail materials may be ultrasonically welded‚Äîa technique whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld. It is commonly used for plastics, and especially for joining dissimilar materials. =Edge construction= Leech line with jam cleat to control the tension on the leach of a foresail. Sails have a variety of treatments at their edges, either to attach the sail to a stay, spar or mast or to prevent a free edge from fluttering or fraying. *Bolt ropes are sewn onto the edges of the sail to reinforce them, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller-furling jib. *Leech lines are found on mainsails and large jibs to tighten the leech and prevent fluttering. They run through a sleeve on the leech from the head to the clew, where there is usually a clam cleat to tighten it. Occasionally, foot lines perform an analogous function on a loose-footed sail. *UV protection panels are usually affixed to the leech and foot of roller furling jibs to prevent ultraviolet rays from reaching the sailcloth while the sail is not in use. These are typically a dark color to absorb the harmful rays. =Reinforcements at attachment points= Headboard on a mainsail. The corners of triangular sails are typically areas of high stress and consequently often have reinforced layers and tape radiating from, whether cross-cut or radial in construction. Their corners are always attached to a shackle, attached to a line or spar‚Äîthe halyard at the head, a shackle at the tack, and the outhaul at the clew. The connecting shackle runs through a grommet at each of these points. There are additional points where reinforcing and grommets may occur: at the cunningham, a downhaul used to flatten a mainsail (jibs may have a similar feature), and along the foot of a Genoa jib to allow a line to lift it out of the waves. The head of a triangular sail may have a rigid headboard riveted to it in order to transfer load from the sail to the halyard. Square sails and gaff-rigged sails also have grommets at corners. Only the clews on a square sail take a comparatively large amount of stress, because the head is supported along the spar. Three sides of gaff-rigged sails are attached to a mast or spar. =Battens= Sail battens made from a variety of materials. A sail batten is a flexible insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail's airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail battens is in the roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have full-length battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section. Junk rigs feature full-length battens that facilitate short-handed sail handling, including reefing. The battens are attached loosely to the mast with lines called batten parrels that allow fore-and-aft motion as the sail is controlled by individual sheets leading to multiple battens. Fittings Sails usually have fittings attached to them that transmit force through a small area. These include grommets, which reinforce fabric at an attachment points and connections to lines; hoops and slides, which attach sails to spars; and reefing features, which may include reefing lines attached to the sail or grommets that have reefing lines running through them. Additional features include tell-tales, windows‚Äîused on dinghy sails ‚Äîand lettering and other graphics that include sail numbers and manufacturers logos, etc. =Hardware= Where sails are attached to a mast, spar, or stay there is some kind of connection‚Äîoften it's the bolt rope running through a groove in the mast, boom, or head foil‚Äîotherwise, there is a piece of hardware involved, e.g.: *Gaff sails usually have hoops that slide up and down the mast. *Bermuda mainsails may have slides attached to the luff that match tracks on the mast and boom. These may be attached to the luff through grommets with webbing or a nylon shackle or with webbing sewn directly on the sail. *Jibs that are not roller-furling usually have hanks, clips that attach to the stay. This applies to other staysails, as well. Other hardware includes cam cleats, used to tension luff and foot lines. =Reefing points= thumbGaff sail, showing reefing points (20) and other features. 1\\\\. Luff 2. Foot 3. Leech 4. Head 5\\\\.

Reefing line Different categories of sails are reefed (reduced in size) in different manners and therefore have different fixtures that achieve shortening of sail. Traditional canvas square and gaff-rigged sails have one or more rows of reefing lines that pass through the sail, which reach around the sail that has been gathered in to reduce its size and secure the remaining unreefed sail to the spar (square rig) or boom (gaff rig). Gaff-rigged sails require an extra set of lines to secure the part of the leech that becomes the new clew. These are called reef pendents that drop through a comb on the boom, where they are secured, as needed. Mainsails on Bermuda rigs typically have paired grommets that secure the luff and leech to the boom, as the sail is lowered to reduce its area. These become the new tack and clew. A reefing line typically runs through the reef point on the luff to quickly secure the new clew. The grommet that becomes the new tack is typically hooked onto the boom. There may be grommets along the line between the new tack and clew that allow ties to pass through around the boom. =Tell-tales= Tell-tales are pieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails to help visualize airflow over their surfaces. Typically, they are mounted near the luff of sails, but they are also found on the leach on some sails. To windward, a sagging tell- tale indicates still air, either from stalling (indicated on the leeward side, when the sail is sheeted in too far, compared to the apparent wind) or pinching (indicated on the windward side, when the sail isn't sheeted in far enough, compared to the apparent wind).

He played between 1982 and 1985 in the rock band Status Quo. Highlights of this period included playing at Live Aid and the National Bowl, and meeting the Prince of Wales at a benefit gig for The Prince's Trust at the Birmingham NEC, an event preserved on the 1982 album Live at the N.E.C.. Life and career Kircher's style is rhythmic, and much of his work carries a distinctively low- tuned snare drum sound which could be considered his signature trait. He has also shown himself to be a talented vocalist, though his excursions into singing on record were generally limited to backing vocals, notably with Honeybus, Colin Hare, Shanghai and Status Quo. However, test pressings of a 1973 solo single, \\"Rockin' Lady\\", are known to exist and are collectable. In the early 1960s, Kircher toured Germany doing club gigs as the drummer for The Burnettes, a band featuring Neil Landon as singer and Noel Redding playing guitar. His earliest documented recordings are with Redding, who later played bass with Jimi Hendrix. More session work followed, before Kircher was recruited in April 1967 to join Honeybus, who although often written off as one-hit wonders, produced work which culminated in a critically acclaimed 1970 album, Story, released after the eventual dissolution of the band. Less commercially successful work with Honeybus survives in the form of two albums, March Hare (credited to Colin Hare, the rhythm guitarist with Honeybus) and Into Your Ears, a solo album by Pete Dello, which were both released in 1971. Comparisons with Honeybus were inevitably drawn; the sessions bled into each other causing a reunion in all but name, and record company executives were impressed by this new work that they commissioned an album, Recital, to be released under the Honeybus name. Only test pressings of this exist, as a change in management at the label aborted the planned release. The next excursion for Kircher's drumming was as a member of the band Shanghai, where he joined Mick Green from Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The band produced two albums, released in 1974 and 1976, when the band supported Status Quo on the Blue for You tour. This, in turn, directly led to Kircher's induction into a group of session musicians for John Du Cann's The World's Not Big Enough album in 1977, which was produced by Quo's guitarist Francis Rossi. After spending most of 1979 as the drummer in Liverpool Express and contributing to their third album LEX, Kircher was invited in 1979 to join Original Mirrors, a new wave band featuring Ian Broudie (later of the bands Care and Lightning Seeds) on guitar. His time in this band took him up to 1981, taking in a session playing drums on the Nolan Sisters single \\"Who's Gonna Rock You\\", before being invited to join Status Quo following the resignation of John Coghlan. Kircher's membership was announced in a press conference in January 1982. Aside from recording some tracks with Rossi and Bernard Frost for their unreleased solo album Flying Debris in 1985, little has been heard from Kircher since, although Honeybus were briefly reunited for a Dutch TV show in 2003. Kircher stated during an interview in this programme that he is now working as a signwriter, a profession he first started as a school leaver.\\"Single Luck: I Can't Let Maggie Go\\", an NPS production for NOS TV, 2002 References Category:Status Quo (band) members Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:English rock drummers Category:People from Folkestone Category:Musicians from Kent Category:People educated at The Harvey Grammar School Category:Beat musicians ","title":"Pete Kircher"},{"id":"1137766","text":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the oral cavity, head and neck, mouth, and jaws, as well as facial cosmetic surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are trained to recognize and treat a wide spectrum of diseases, injuries and defects in the head, neck, face, jaws and the hard and soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region. They are trained to treat problems such as facial deformity and misaligned jaws, tumors and cysts of the jaw, head and neck cancer, skin cancer, trauma surgery and some perform dental implant surgery and the extraction of wisdom teeth. In the United States, oral and maxillofacial surgeons are trained to administer general anesthesia and deep sedation and are licensed to do so in a hospital or office setting.Detailed Description of Recognized Surgical Specialties in the US  Specialty  An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a regional specialist surgeon who treats the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, and skull, head and neck as well as associated structures. Depending upon the national jurisdiction, oral and maxillofacial surgery may require a degree in medicine, dentistry or both. = Subspecialties = In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether possessing a single or dual degree, may further specialize after residency, undergoing additional one or two year sub-specialty oral and maxillofacial surgery fellowship training in the following areas: *Cosmetic facial surgery, including eyelid (blepharoplasty), nose (rhinoplasty), facial lift, brow lift, and laser resurfacing * Cranio-maxillofacial trauma, including zygomatic (cheek bone), orbital (eye socket), mandibular and nasal fractures as well as facial soft tissue lacerations and penetrating neck injuries *Craniofacial surgery/pediatric maxillofacial surgery, including cleft lip and palate surgery and trans-cranial craniofacial surgery including Fronto-Orbital Advancement and Remodelling (FOAR) and total vault remodelling *Head and neck cancer and microvascular reconstruction free flap surgery * Maxillofacial regeneration, which is re-formation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique  Regulation  Oral and Maxillofacial surgery is an internationally recognized surgical specialty. Whether oral and maxillofacial surgery is formally designated as a medical specialty or dental specialty is a function of the specialty's history in the respective national jurisdiction, not the scope or substance of the surgical specialty. =United Kingdom and Europe= In countries such as the UK and most of Europe, it is recognised as a specialty of medicine with a degree in dentistry and medicine being compulsory.https://www.iaoms.org/about-us/affiliated-associations/ The scope of practice is mainly head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma, skin cancer, facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial surgery, TMJ surgery and cosmetic facial surgery. In the UK and Europe Maxillofacial surgery is a specialty of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Intercollegiate Board Certification is provided through the JCIE, and is the same as Plastic Surgery, ENT, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Paediatric Surgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery. = United States of America= In the United States, oral and maxillofacial surgery is a recognized surgical specialty, formally designated as a dental specialty. A professional dental degree is required,ABOMS Criterion for Board Eligibility and Certification a qualification in medicine may be undertaken optionally during residency training. In this respect, oral and maxillofacial surgery is sui generis among surgical specialties. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires an extensive 4-6 year surgical residency training covering the U.S. specialty's scope of practice: surgery of the oral cavity, dental implant surgery, dentoalveolar surgery, surgery of the temporomandibular joint, general surgery, reconstructive surgery of the face, head and neck, mouth, and jaws, facial cosmetic surgery, facial deformity, craniofacial surgery, facial skin cancer, head and neck cancer, microsurgery free flap reconstruction, facial trauma, facial trauma surgery and, uniquely, the administration of general anesthesia and deep sedation.AAOMS Statement on administration of general anesthesia As is the norm among surgical specialists, oral and maxillofacial surgery residents typically serve as Chief Resident in their final year. Following residency training, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether single or dual degree, have the option of undergoing 1-2 year surgical sub-specialty fellowship for further training in head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, cosmetic facial surgery, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma.  Board Certification  Board certification in the U.S. is governed by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (ABOMS).American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (ABOMS) * American College of Surgeons Oral and maxillofacial surgery is among the fourteen surgical specialties recognized by the American College of Surgeons: cardiothoracic surgery, colon and rectal surgery, general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, gynecologic oncology, neurological surgery, ophthalmic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopaedic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, pediatric surgery, plastic and maxillofacial surgery, urology, and vascular surgery.American College of Surgeons Recognized Surgical Specialties Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the United States, whether single or dual degree, may become Fellows of the American College of Surgeons, \\"FACS\\" (Fellow, American College of Surgeons).American College of Surgeons Eligibility OMFS  Professional Organizations  The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) is the chief professional organization representing the roughly 9,000 oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the United States.American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons publishes the peer reviewed Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The American College of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons is a voluntary professional organization of board certified oral and maxillofacial surgeons.  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Anesthesia: Training, Licensure and the History & Innovation of Anesthesia  In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons are required to undergo five months of intensive general anesthesia training. An additional month of pediatric anesthesia training is also required. The American Society of Anesthesiologists published a Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team which specifies qualified anesthesia personnel and practitioners as anesthesiologists, anesthesiology fellows, anesthesiology residents, and oral and maxillofacial surgery residents.Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team Unique among surgical specialists in the U.S.,Statement from American Society of Anesthesiologists oral and maxillofacial surgeons are trained to administer general anesthesia and deep sedation are licensed to do so in both hospital and office settings.Florida State Sedation Permits for General Anesthesia In the specialty's infancy, dental and oral surgeons were plenary in the introduction of anesthesia to modern medicine and the development of modern surgery. In 1844, at Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts General Hospital, dentist, Dr. Horace Wells was the first to use anesthesia, but with limited success. On 16 October 1846, Boston oral surgeon, Dr. William Thomas Green Morton gave a successful demonstration using diethyl ether to Harvard medical students at the same venue. In one of the most important and well documented events in American medical history, Morton was invited to Massachusetts General Hospital to demonstrate his technique for painless surgery. After Morton had induced anesthesia, Dr. John Collins Warren, a founding member of Massachusetts General Hospital, the hospital's first surgeon, and the first Dean of Harvard Medical School, removed a tumor from the neck of patient, Edward Gilbert Abbott. The demonstration was performed in the surgical amphitheater now called the Ether Dome at Harvard. Massachusetts General Hospital views the demonstration as among the institution's most significant claims to fame. Upon the successful completion of Dr. Morton's demonstration, Dr. Warren famously proclaimed to the crowded, astonished and elated amphitheater, what would become likely the most famous words in modern medicine, \\"Gentlemen, this is no humbug.\\" Indeed, the event marked the beginning of modern anesthesia and surgical practice. Immediately following the demonstration, in a congratulatory letter to Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, polymath and later Harvard Medical School Dean, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., father of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. of the Supreme Court of the United States, proposed naming the state produced \\"anesthesia\\", and the procedure an \\"anesthetic.\\" Holmes wrote to Morton, \\"Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names‚Äîor the name‚Äîto be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called 'Anaesthesia.' This signifies insensibility‚Äîmore particularly ... to objects of touch.\\" Holmes added poetically that the new term \\"will be repeated by the tongues of every civilized [member] of mankind.\\" Dr. Ferdinand Hasbrouck, a New York oral surgeon and an 1870 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine was among the first practitioners to succeed in the regular and commercial use of anesthesia in private surgical practice.Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology, Schaumburg, Illinois. An historic rendering including the notation of Yale chemistry professor, Benjamin Silliman, Sr., regarding nitrous oxide and Dr. Hasbrouck's, then, famous New York City advertisement predicated upon Silliman, Sr.'s remarks concerning anesthesia. Benjamin Silliman, Sr. was a significant influence on his son, Benjamin Silliman Jr. Both Sillimans were eminent chemists and professors of the subject at Yale University. Silliman, Jr. was a member of the founding faculty Yale College's Sheffield Scientific School. Silliman, Sr., a lawyer by training and initially a Tutor in Law at Yale, was ironically the first professor of chemistry at Yale in 1802. He studied chemistry at the Medical College of the University of Pennsylvania with James Woodhouse. Yale's Silliman College is named after him. In 1893, U.S. President Grover Cleveland was diagnosed with an intraoral tumor. The President chose Dr. Hasbrouck to serve among his team of surgeons and simultaneously as the anesthesiologist for the procedure. For political reasons, Cleveland did not want the public to know about his condition. The operation was performed in secret on the yacht Oneida in the Long Island Sound, NY. Dr. Hasbrouck, induced President Cleveland with nitrous oxide and extracted teeth from the corpus of the tumor. As Cleveland recovered from nitrous oxide, Dr. Hasbrouck began the administration of ether for the remainder of the procedure as he and the team performed the tumor surgery Atlas and diagrams of the surgical procedure and photographs of the tumor, p.26.. The procedure was a milestone for the practice of anesthesia.Cleveland Museum Documents Ferdinand Hasbrouck's son, James F. Hasbrouck, discussed below, was among the founders of the Columbia University College of Dental and Oral Surgeons in 1916. In 1945, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Niels Jorgensen was first to develop intravenous moderate sedation. His technique, administering pentobarbital, meperidine and scopolamine intravenously, was widely accepted and first taught at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, beginning in 1945. In the United States, a close educational and professional relationship between oral and maxillofacial surgery and anesthesiology persists to the present day.  Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Plastic Surgery: The Founding of Plastic Surgery and the History & Early Development of Craniofacial Surgery  Oral and maxillofacial surgery stands as a pillar of the modern practice of plastic surgery and plastic surgery's recognition in 1941 as a surgical specialty in the United States. In the early 1900s, plastic surgery was founded by a professional organization of oral surgeons with elite training and an interest in plastic and reconstructive surgery, the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgery. Also published as: Over time, the exclusive organization began to elect a small number of non-oral surgeon members, the first of which was legendary general surgeon Dr. Vilray Blair of Washington University in St. Louis. The organization became the American Association of Plastic Surgeons in 1921.History of the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgery, presently the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) At Harvard University, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Kazanjian pioneered plastic surgery and is considered to be a founder, if not, the founder of the modern practice of plastic surgery. He graduated from Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1905. Dr. Kazanjian was Professor of Clinical Oral Surgery at Harvard from 1922 to 1941 when he was named Harvard's first Professor of Plastic Surgery. Dr. Kazanjian was instrumental in plastic surgery's formal recognition as an independent surgical specialty in 1941. Dr. Kazanjian joined the First Harvard Unit, serving with the British Forces in WWI, establishing the first dental and maxillofacial clinic in France, handling more than 3,000 cases of severe wounds to the face and jaws. He was honored for his surgical advances by British monarch George V, who invested him Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George.Harvard discussing the Work of Kazanjian Kazanjian served as an early president of American Association of Plastic Surgeons. Another founder and god-father of plastic surgery was University of Pennsylvania oral surgeon, Dr. Robert H. Ivy, an 1898 University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine graduate, developed the surgical treatment of cleft lip and cleft palate. The inter-maxillary fixation technique, the Ivy Loop is named after him. Ivy is considered a pioneer and father of the modern practice of plastic surgery. Ivy was influenced by Dr. Vilray Blair of Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Ivy founded the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, plastic surgery's premier peer reviewed academic journal and the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgeons and served as its president. In 1919, New York City oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Armin Wald, an 1896 graduate of New York University College of Dentistry, was among the first in the United States to successfully demonstrate and publish a procedure for alveolectomy and alveoloplasty, the surgical resection and smoothing of the ridge of the mandible and maxilla for cosmetic and prosthetic purposes.Index to Literature: Plastic Operations on the Mouth and Face, Bone Tranplants, (p.230), \\"Aveolectomy\\" Digest XXV, 1919. Once mastered, the innovative procedure was remarkably simple; to the present, the procedure is commonplace among oral, plastic and ENT surgeons performing alveolar ridge reconstruction and bone grafting. Wald was influenced by his father, Henry Wald, M.D.,Uncle of Lillian Wald, founder of the Henry Street Settlement and among the founders of the NAACP and the Columbia University School of Nursing. an 1872 University of Vienna Faculty of Medicine gradutate and preceptor in surgery at Columbia College School of Medicine; their nephew, Charles A. Reich, became a law professor at Yale. Wald's partner,(Failed 1924 law suit against Drs. James F. Hasbrouck and Armin Wald before famed New York State Justice Joseph M. Proskauer, founder Proskauer Rose. New York University oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. James F. Hasbrouck, interested in the development of the surgical specialty in New York, was among the founders of the Columbia University College of Dental and Oral Surgery in 1916. In keeping with the ideals of the American Association of Oral and Plastic Surgeons, the first two years of coursework at the new college were fully unified with Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons, of which Hasbrouck was an 1894 graduate. Students devoted their entire second two years to specialization in surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, which provided extraordinary preparation for the possibility of post-graduate residency training in oral surgery. Hasbrouck was notable in the specialty for having received both a dental and medical degree prior to 1895. His father, oral surgeon, Ferdinand Hasbrouck, discussed above, was a pioneer in anesthesiology. Hasbrouck's and Wald's sons, Theodore F. Hasbrouck and Arthur H. Wald both graduated from Columbia's College of Dental and Oral Surgery in 1937.

He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and owned a cosmetic practice in midtown Manhattan. Globally, the role of oral and maxillofacial surgery was also profound in the founding of plastic surgery: outside the United States, fathers of plastic surgery include London based otolaryngologist Sir Harold Gillies and his French mentor, the renowned oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Hippolyte Morestin. Oral and maxillofacial surgery's stature and clout in university hospitals can be traced to its plenary role in the development of modern medicine and surgery.  State Licensure  While a professional dental degree, i.e., D.D.S. or D.M.D. is mandatory in the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons may possess various doctoral degree combinations, e.g., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.D.S./M.D., D.M.D./M.D., D.M.D./Ph.D. or D.D.S./Ph.D. Still, it is the completion of an oral and maxillofacial residency training program and corresponding certificate of specialty training that confers surgical specialty status and board eligibility,California Surgical Specialty License not the surgeon's professional degree or degree combination.California Facial Cosmetic Surgery License Analogously, it is a certificate of specialty training and board eligibility that satisfies state licensure requirements to administer general anesthesiaNew York State General Anesthesia and Deep Sedation Certificate and deep sedation, not the surgeon's professional degree or degree combination.Florida Sedation Permits for General Anesthesia D.D.S.

The Canadian model is the same as the model used in the United States of America.Statement of the Canadian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. =Globally= In other countries, oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty exists but under different forms, as the work is sometimes performed by a single or dual qualified specialist depending on each country's regulations and training opportunities available. In several countries oral and maxillofacial surgery is a specialty recognized by a professional association, as is the case with the Dental Council of India, American Dental Association, Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Brazilian Federal Council of Odontology (CFO).  Surgical procedures  In the United States and globally, treatments may be performed on the craniomaxillofacial complex: mouth, jaws, face, neck, and skull, and include: * Cosmetic surgery of the head and neck: (rhytidectomy/facelift, browlift, blepharoplasty/Asian blepharoplasty, otoplasty, rhinoplasty, septoplasty, cheek augmentation, chin augmentation, genioplasty, oculoplastics, neck liposuction, hair transplantation, lip enhancement, injectable cosmetic treatments like botox, fillers, platelet rich plasma, stem cells, chemical peel, mesotherapy. * Orthognathic surgery, surgical treatment/correction of dentofacial deformity as well as management of facial trauma, and sleep apnea * Oncology head and neck surgery with free flap microvascular reconstruction * Cutanous malignancy/skin cancer surgery of head and neck surgery skin grafts and local flaps * Diagnosis and treatment of: * benign pathology (cysts, tumors etc.) * malignant pathology (oral & head and neck cancer) with (ablative and reconstructive surgery, microsurgery) * cutaneous malignancy (skin cancer), lip reconstruction * congenital craniofacial malformations such as cleft lip and palate and cranial vault malformations such as craniosynostosis, (craniofacial surgery) * chronic facial pain disorders * temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders * Orthognathic (literally \\"straight bite\\") reconstructive surgery, orthognathic surgery, maxillomandibular advancement, surgical correction of facial asymmetry. * soft and hard tissue trauma of the oral and maxillofacial region (jaw fractures, cheek bone fractures, nasal fractures, LeFort fracture, skull fractures and eye socket fractures). * Dentoalveolar surgery (surgery to remove impacted teeth, difficult tooth extractions, extractions on medically compromised patients, bone grafting or preprosthetic surgery to provide better anatomy for the placement of implants, dentures, or other dental prostheses) * Surgery to insert osseointegrated (bone fused) dental implants and maxillofacial implants for attaching craniofacial prostheses and bone anchored hearing aids.  Occupation  Oral and maxillofacial surgery is intellectually and physically demanding and is among the most highly compensated surgical specialties in the United States with a 2008 average annual income of $568,968. The popularity of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a career for persons whose first degree was medicine, not dentistry, seems to be increasing. At least one program exists that allows highly qualified candidates whose first degree is in medicine, to earn the required dental degree, so as to qualify for entrance into oral and maxillofacial residency training programs and ultimately achieve board eligibility and certification in the surgical specialty.University of Alabama at Birmingham  Education and training Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the ten dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, and the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires four to six years of further formal university training after dental school (i.e., DDS, BDent, DMD or BDS). Residency training programs are either four or six years in duration. In the United States, four-year residency programs grant a certificate of specialty training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Six year programs granting an optional MD degree emerged in the early 1990s in the United States. Typically, Six-year residency programs grant the specialty certificate and an additional degree such as a medical degree (e.g., MD, MBBS, MBChB) or research degree (e.g., MS, MSc, MPhil, MDS, MSD, MDSc, DClinDent, DSc, DMSc, PhD). Both four‚Äì and six‚Äìyear graduates are designated US \\"Board Eligible\\" and those who earn \\"Board Certification\\" are Diplomats. Approximately 50% of the training programs in the US and 66%J.

Beyond these years, some sub-specialize, adding an additional 1-2 year fellowship. The typical training program for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is: * 2‚Äì4 years undergraduate study (BS, BA, or equivalent degrees) * 4 years dental study (DMD, BDent, DDS or BDS) * 4‚Äì6 years residency trainingSome programs integrate an additional degree such as: a master's degree (MS, MDS, MSc, MClinDent, MScDent, MDent), doctoral degree (PhD, DMSc, DClinDent, DSc), or medical degree (MBBS, MD, DO, MBChB, MDCM) * After completion of surgical training most undertake final specialty examinations: US: \\"Board Certified (ABOMS)\\", Australia/NZ: FRACDS, or Canada: \\"FRCDC\\" * Some colleges offer membership or fellowships in oral/maxillofacial surgery: MOralSurg RCS, M(OMS) RCPS, FFD RCSI, FEBOS, FACOMS, FFD RCS, FAMS, FCDSHK, FCMFOS (SA) * Both single and dual qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeons may obtain fellowship with the American College of Surgeons (FACS). =Surgical sub- specialty fellowship training= In addition, single and dual qualified graduates of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs can pursue post- residency sub-specialty fellowships, typically 1‚Äì2 years in length, in the following areas: * Head and neck cancermicrovascular reconstruction * Cosmetic facial surgery (facelift, rhinoplasty, etc.) * Craniofacial surgery and pediatric maxillofacial surgery (cleft lip and palate repair, surgery for craniosynostosis, etc.) * Cranio-maxillofacial trauma (soft tissue and skeletal injuries to the face, head and neck)  Charities  A number of notable philanthropic organizations provide humanitarian oral and maxillofacial surgery around the globe. Smile Train was created in 1998 by Charles Wang focusing on childhood facial deformity. Operation Smile focuses on correcting cleft lips and palates in children. AboutFace, created by Paul Stanley, of the rock band KISS, who was born with a facial deformity, focuses on craniofacial disfiguration.

The master and mistress (here the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough) lived their everyday lives in the similarly arranged but smaller suites either side of the smaller dining room marked \\"O\\" A state room in a large European mansion is usually one of a suite of very grand rooms which were designed to impress. The term was most widely used in the 17th and 18th centuries. They were the most lavishly decorated in the house and contained the finest works of art. State rooms were usually only found in the houses of the upper echelons of the aristocracy, those who were likely to entertain a head of state. They were generally to accommodate and entertain distinguished guests, especially a monarch and/or a royal consort, or other high-ranking aristocrats and state officials, hence the name. In their original form a set of state rooms made up a state apartment, which always included a bedroom.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom in particular, state rooms in country houses were seldom used. The owner of the house and his family actually lived in the \\"second best\\" apartments in the house. There was usually an odd number of state rooms for the following reason: at the centre of the facade, the largest and most lavish room, (for example at Wilton House the famed Double Cube Room), or as at Blenheim Palace (right) this was a gathering place for the court of the honoured guest. Leading symmetrically from the centre room on either side were often one or two suites of smaller, but still very grand state rooms, often in enfilade, for the sole use of the occupant of the final room at each end of the facade ‚Äì the state bedroom. Unlike the main reception rooms of later houses, state apartments were not freely open to all the guests in the house. Admittance to the state apartment was a privilege, and the further one penetrated (there were many variations, but an apartment might include for example an anteroom; withdrawing room; bedroom; dressing room; and closet) the greater the honour.  Changes from the early 18th century  From the early 18th century, as aristocratic lifestyles slowly became less formal, there was a move on the one hand to increase the number of shared living rooms in a large house and to give them more specialised functions (music rooms and billiard rooms for example) and on the other hand to make bedroom suites more private. In houses from earlier than around 1720 which survived without major structural alteration, the state rooms sometimes became a meaningless succession of drawing rooms and the original intention was lost. This is certainly true at Wilton House, Blenheim Palace, and Castle Howard. On the other hand, there were a few houses, and royal palaces, most of them exceptionally large, which were laid out in such a way that the state rooms could be left in their original form, while other rooms were converted to meet the new needs of the 18th and 19th centuries, or where funds were available to simply add on extra wings to meet the new requirements. Examples of such residences with surviving state suites which have never really changed their function include Chatsworth House and Boughton House. The term \\"state\\" continued to be used in the names of individual rooms in some post 1720 houses (e.g. state dining room; state bedroom), but by then the original concept of a self-contained state apartment for an honoured personage was lost, and the term \\"state\\" can be taken more accurately to mean \\"best\\".

The novel derives its title from the protagonist, a twenty-year-old short-order cook named Odd Thomas. The book, which was well received and lauded by critics, went on to become a New York Times Bestseller. Following the success of the novel, six sequels, Forever Odd (2005), Brother Odd (2006), Odd Hours (2008), Odd Apocalypse (2012), and Deeply Odd (2013), were also written by Koontz. The final novel in the series Saint Odd (2015) was released on Jan 13, 2015. Three graphic-novel prequels, In Odd We Trust, Odd Is On Our Side and House of Odd have also been released. In the postscript to the graphic novel, Koontz states that \\"God willing, there will be six Odd Thomas novels.\\" A Special Odd Thomas Adventure (short novel), Odd Interlude, was released on December 26, 2012. Plot summary In the beginning of the book, Odd Thomas is silently approached by the ghost of a young girl brutally raped and murdered, and through his unique ability to understand the dead, is psychically led to her killer, a former schoolmate named Harlo Landerson. Koontz discloses how Odd was named and begins, layer by layer, to show how Odd's dysfunctional upbringing has shaped his life, and as those details are uncovered, his supernatural abilities begin to make more sense. While working as a short order cook in a California desert town, Odd meets a suspicious- looking man in the diner followed by bodachs, shadowy spirit creatures who appear only during times of death and disaster. This man, who Odd nicknames \\"Fungus Man\\" (due to his waxy complexion and blond hair that resembles mold), has an unusually large swarm of bodachs following him, and Odd is convinced that this man is connected to some terrible catastrophe that is about to occur. To gather more information about him, Odd uses his gift of supernatural intuition, which his soulmate Bronwen (a.k.a. Stormy) Llewellyn calls \\"psychic magnetism,\\" to track him down. Odd's sixth sense leads him to Fungus Man's home, and Odd begins to uncover more details about the man and a mysterious other-worldly link to the dark forces about to be unleashed on the town of Pico Mundo. Accompanied sometimes by the ghost of Elvis Presley and encountering other memorable spirits, including a murdered prostitute, Odd is soon deeply involved in an attempt to prevent the disastrous bloodshed he knows will happen the next day. Characters =Odd Thomas= \\"I see dead people. But then, by God, I do something about it.\\" ‚Äì Odd Thomas pg. 32 Odd could see the dead and also see shadowy figures that normally lurk around people that will cause deaths or will die. They are called bodachs and feed on the pain of others. Odd is a 20 year old short-order cook at a breakfast joint in Pico Mundo. His girlfriend is Stormy. Little Ozzie is his best friend. Odd leads a simple life because he has to, since he finds the job of speaking to the lingering dead complicated enough. Odd is an optimist seeing the good in most individuals despite his troubling life; he fears going anywhere with a large population because it would interfere with his \\"simple life\\"--he would be overwhelmed by the volume of dead in a large city like Los Angeles. He never told his father or mother because he thought that his father would use his son's powers to make himself rich. He once met a boy who also saw bodachs but when the bodachs realized this, they seemed to cause a fatal accident, killing the little boy instantly, so Odd keeps this ability a secret. =Stormy Llewellyn= \\"Loop me in, Odd One.\\" ‚Äì Stormy Llewellyn Odd's destiny. Stormy's real name is Bronwen, but she prefers to be called Stormy because she thinks this makes her sound less like an elf. She is the manager of an ice cream shop and hopes to own a shop of her own some day. Stormy's parents died when she was very young. She was adopted by a couple when she was 7. Her foster father sexually molested her for almost 3 months. She reported him to a social worker and was moved to an orphanage where she lived until seventeen, at which point she was cared for by her uncle, Father Sean Llewellyn, rector of St. Bartholomew's church. She remained under his legal guardianship until she could become independent. She is a strong believer in delayed gratification, that this life is a \\"boot camp\\" for the next, which she calls \\"service,\\" and that finally in the third life are the rewards. She insists on waiting for sex with Odd until marriage, hoping to make their first time together a meaningful experience and to not bring the memories of her abuse on their bed. She also is the only person who knows everything about Odd seeing the dead. =Chief Wyatt Porter= The Chief helps Odd many times, acting almost as a surrogate father. He is one of the few people who knows Odd sees the dead but he does not know all of Odd's secrets. He is shot 4 times by one of the antagonists who would later shoot people at the mall, but survives. =Robert Thomas \\"Fungus Man\\" Robertson= Fungus Man or Robert Thomas Robertson is initially portrayed as the main antagonist. He comes to Pico Mundo surrounded by bodachs and immediately Odd is suspicious of him. Little is explained about Robertson directly. Odd finds that he is obsessed with serial killers as evidenced by the files he keeps on them. Robertson was approached by Eckles, Varner, and Gosset a few months before the incident at the Green Moon Mall, having met them at a satanic cult gathering. They were interested only in his mother's money. Eckles, Varner, and Gosset killed Robertson's mother (with his permission) and gave him her ears as a trophy. Robertson is murdered by one of his conspirators when they find out that Odd's attention is being drawn towards them and their plans. Robertson then becomes one of the lingering dead and stalks Odd for a short time as a poltergeist. When Robertson's ghost confronts Odd at his home, he goes into an uncontrollable rage, destroying much of the kitchen. Odd leaves him there in the house where he is assumed to still be haunting. =Bern Eckles, Simon Varner, and Kevin Gosset= These three had conspired with Robert Thomas Robertson to have a mass killing at the mall. The three had gotten involved in ritualistic satanism as teenagers and first killed when they were 15 on a \\"dare.\\" They pledged their loyalty to their \\"dark god,\\" vowing to go into careers in which they could promote satanism and chaos. Varner and Eckles became cops, while Gosset became a school teacher. Varner had killed Robert Thomas Robertson after he found out that Odd had been in Robertson's house and suspected him, he then tried to frame Odd for the murder. Eckles and Varner were the two gunmen that Odd subdued; Eckles first with the bat then Varner with a shot to the shoulder and head. Gosset had shot Odd twice in the back, Odd managed to pull the wires out of the bomb, thereby disarming it as he fell to the ground. Gosset later told everything that had happened between all the conspirators. They called the atrocity \\"just another way of worshipping.\\" =Little Ozzie= Nicknamed 'little' despite being larger than his father, Ozzie has a 6th finger on his left hand and has published many very successful detective novels. He has a pet cat named Terrible Chester who Ozzie claims is over 50 years old, and has pictures to prove it. Terrible Chester does not like Odd and Little Ozzie is one of the few people who knows about Odd's 'Gifts'.

Most noaidi practices died out during the 17th century, most likely because they resisted Christianisation and the king's authority. Their actions were referred to in courts as \\"magic\\" or \\"sorcery\\" (cf. witchcraft). Several S√°mi shamanistic beliefs and practices were similar to those of some Siberian cultures.Voigt 1966: 296 Description and history Noaidis, S√°mi shamans, were traditionally the healers and protectors. Noaidis are said to have the role of mediator between humans and the spirits. To undertake this mediation, the noaidi communicated with the spirit world, asking what sacrifice needed to be made by a person so that they might return to good health, be successful in their hunt for food, and even for good weather. Sacrifices were designed by the noaidi to reestablish the balance between the mortal and immortal worlds. Using a traditional drum, which is the most important symbol and tool of the S√°mi shaman, the noaide invoked assistance from benevolent spirits and conducted out-of-body travel via the ‚Äúfree soul‚Äù with the help of other siida members. The S√°mi distinguish between the ‚Äúfree soul‚Äù versus the more mundane ‚Äúbody soul‚Äù; the ‚Äúbody soul‚Äù is unable to traverse the divide separating the spiritual netherworld from the more mundane, corporeal, real world. A noaidi could engage in any kind of affair that demanded wisdom; it is said they took payments for their services. The activities included healing people, helping children, making decisions and protecting reindeer, which represented the most important source of food and were also used as tribute payment. The sources from which we learn about noaidi are court protocols, tales, excavated tools (such as belts), and missionary reports. That noaidis were punished and in some cases sentenced to death for their \\"sorcery\\" should perhaps rather be interpreted as an attempt to obliterate opposition to the crown. There was by law no freedom of religion during most of the 19th century and before, as the Lutheran Swedish church was the only allowed religion (except for some foreign temporary residents). Swedish priests supported conviction of noaidis for sorcery. Remnants in music tradition In the Sami shamanistic form of worship drumming and traditional chanting (joiking) were of singular importance. Some of joiks were sung on shamanistic rites;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76 this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).Voigt 1966: 145 Recently, joiks have been sung in two different styles, one of which is sung only by young people. The other joik may be identified with the ‚Äúmumbling‚Äù joik, resembling chants or magic spells.Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64 Several surprising characteristics of joiks can be explained by comparing the music ideals, as observed in joiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. In some instances, joiks mimic natural sounds. This can be contrasted to other goals, namely overtone singing and bel canto, both of which exploit human speech organs to achieve ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù sounds.Szomjas- Schiffert 1996: 74 Overtone singing and the imitation of sounds in shamanism are present in many other cultures as well.Hopp√°l 2006: 143 Di√≥szegi 1960: 203 Sound imitation may serve other purposes such as games and other entertainmentNattiez: 5Desch√™nes 2002 as well as important practical purposes such as luring animals during hunts.

It is located in the province of Papua in Indonesia near Puncak Jaya, the highest mountain in Papua. It has 19,500 employees. It is mostly owned by Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which owns 48.74% of PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), the principal operating subsidiary in Indonesia, including 9.36% owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama. The government of Indonesia owns 51.23% of PT Freeport Indonesia through Indonesia Asahan Aluminium and PT Indonesia Papua Metal & Mineral, a company co-owned with Papua Province government. FCX operates under a Contract of Work (CoW) agreement with the government of Indonesia, which allows Freeport to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in a area (Block A). It also conducts exploration activities in a area (Block B). All of Freeport's proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in Block A. The mine has three mining operations: the open pit, the Deep Ore Zone underground mine, and the Big Gossan underground mine. A fourth, the Deep Mill Level Zone, is being developed. The 2016 production was of copper, of gold; and in 2016 sales of of silver. The concentrate is delivered by pipeline to Amamapare. In August 2017, FCX announced that it will divest its ownership in PT-FI so that Indonesia owns 51%. In return the CoW will be replaced by a special license (IUPK) with mining rights to 2041 and FCX will build a new smelter by 2022.  History  600px In 1936, Dutch geologist Jean Jacques Dozy was a member of an expedition that scaled Mount Carstensz, the highest mountain in the Dutch East Indies. While there, he made notes of a peculiar black rock with greenish coloring, and spent several weeks estimating the extent of the gold and copper deposits. In 1939, he filed a report about the Ertsberg (Dutch for \\"ore mountain\\"). He was working for Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM), an exploration company formed by Shell in 1935, with 40% Standard Vacuum Oil Company interest and 20% Far Pacific investments (Chevron subsidiary). Dozy's Ertsberg report came to light again in 1959 when Jan van Gruisen, managing director of the Dutch company Oost Borneo Maatschappij N.V, or East Borneo Company, searched for geological studies on nickel deposits in Western New Guinea. Although the Dozy report did not mention nickel mineralization, Van Gruisen applied to the Netherlands government for an exploration concession covering 100 sq. miles surrounding Ertsberg. In March 1959, the New York Times published an article revealing the Dutch were searching for the mountain source of alluvial gold which had been flowing into the Arafura Sea. Van Gruisen casually mentioned the Dozy report to Forbes Wilson, geologist and vice president of Freeport Minerals Co.,Forbes Kingsbury Wilson Mining Foundation of the Southwest. Retrieved 27 April 2020. who immediately recognized the mining potential of Ertsberg. Wilson convinced Freeport to back an expedition to explore the Ertsberg site, and in 1960 led an exploration party on an arduous, 6 week long trek to Ertsberg that confirmed the presence of an immense amount of copper mineralization. The directors of Freeport Sulphur at the time included Godfrey Rockefeller, Texaco chairman Augustus Long, George Mealey, and Robert Lovett. In 1963 the administration of Dutch New Guinea was transferred to Indonesia, and the mine was the first under the new Suharto administration's 1967 foreign investment laws intended to attract foreign investment to Indonesia's then ruined economy. Built at 4,100 metres (14,000 ft) above sea level in one of Papua's most remote areas, it involved a capital and technology input well beyond Indonesia's resources at the time. Construction cost was $175 million, $55 million above the original budget. A 116 km road and pipeline, port, airstrip, power plant and a new town called Tembagapura (literally: copper town) were built. It officially opened in 1973 (although the first ore shipment was in December 1972), and was expanded by Ertsberg East, which opened in 1981. Steep aerial tramways are used to transport equipment and people. Ore is dropped 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the mine, concentrated and mixed with water to form a 60:40 slurry. The slurry is then pumped through a 166 km pipeline through mountains, jungle and swamp to the port at Amamapare, dried and shipped. Each tonne of dry concentrate contains 317 kilograms of copper, 30 grams of gold and 30 grams of silver. In 1977 the rebel group Free Papua Movement attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, killing at least 800 people. By the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at Grasberg (Dutch, \\"Grass Mountain\\"), just from the Ertsberg mine. The winding road to Grasberg, the H.E.A.T. (Heavy Equipment Access Trail), was estimated to require $12 million to $15 million to be built. An Indonesian road-builder, Ilyas Hamid, who had contributed to the Ertsberg road took a bulldozer and drove it downhill sketching the path. The road cost just $2 million when completed. The 2003‚Äì2006 boom in copper prices increased the profitability of the mine. The extra consumption of copper for Asian electrical infrastructure overwhelmed copper supply and caused prices to increase from around $1500/ton to $8100/ton ($0.70/lb to $4.00/lb). In 2005, the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004 Freeport had given senior military and police officers and military units nearly $20 million.  Mine workings  The Grasberg Mine complex from space in 2005. Puncak Jaya is the high point of the snow-covered ridge to the east of the mine. The peak is at above sea level. The rim of the open pit is at about . The workings include a very large open pit mine, an underground mine and four concentrators. The open pit mine ‚Äì which forms a mile-wide crater at the surface ‚Äì is a high-volume, low-cost operation, producing more than 67 million tonnes of ore and providing over 75% of the mill feed in 2006. Ore undergoes primary crushing at the mine, before being delivered by ore passes to the mill complex for further crushing, grinding and flotation. Grasberg's milling and concentrating complex is the largest in the world, with four crushers and two giant semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) units processing a daily average of 240,000 tonnes of ore in 2006. A flotation reagent is used to separate a copper-gold concentrate from the ore. Slurry containing the copper- gold concentrate is delivered by three pipelines to the seaport of Amamapare, over 70 miles away, where it is dewatered. Once filtered and dried, the concentrate ‚Äì containing copper, gold and silver ‚Äì is shipped to smelters around the world. The facilities at the port also include a coal-fired power station, which supplies the Grasberg operations.  Environment  Freeport's Contract of Work Area. Deep purple in the river is mine tailings (2003). The concentrator's tailings, generated at a rate of 700,000 tonnes per day, are the subject of considerable environmental concern, as they wash into the Aikwa riverine system and Arafura Sea. Some (eventually ) of lowland areas along the Aikwa River, are covered by braided sedimentary channels indicative of high sediment load (similar to glacial runoff). Native fish have nearly disappeared from now-turbid waters of the Aikwa River which are unsuitable for aquatic life. The overburden (700 kt/d) remains in the highlands, up to 480 m deep and covering . Its acidic runoff, dissolved copper, and the finer material gets washed into the headwaters of the Wanagon River. It settles out along the river course and then into the ocean, and will continue to do so indefinitely. Freeport's official response is that overburden is placed in the highlands as part of its Overburden Management Plan, at \\"sites capped with limestone and constantly monitored. Tailings are transported to the lowlands in a designated river system. Once reaching the lowlands, they are captured in an engineered system of levees built for that purpose.\\" An Indonesian Environment Ministry's field report in 2004, found levels of sediment 37,500 milligrams per litre as the river entered the lowlands and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea, while the maximum under Indonesian law is not to exceed 400 milligrams per litre. In 1995, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) revoked Freeport's insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US. It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them. Freeport said an environmental report reached inaccurate conclusions, the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg. The company later underwent an independent environmental audit by Dames & Moore and passed. In April 1996, Freeport canceled its policy with the OPIC, stating that their corporate activities had outgrown the policy's limits. However, the OPIC report was later publicly released. = Environmental damage = The mine is located within what used to be a small equatorial mountain glacier. Steepening of slopes related to mining activities, as well as earthquakes and frequent heavy rainfall, have resulted in landslides within the open pit mine. While landscape reclamation projects have begun at the mine, environmental groups and local citizens are concerned with the potential for copper contamination and acid mine drainage from the mine tailings into surrounding river systems, land surfaces, and groundwater. Freeport argues that its actions meet industry standards and have been approved by the requisite authorities. It was reported in 2005 that since 1997 Freeport had been breaching Indonesian environmental laws. Freeport estimates it will generate six billion tons of waste. Both Freeport and its partner Rio Tinto have been excluded from the investment portfolio of The Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world's second-largest pension fund, due to criticism over the environmental damages caused by the Grasberg mine. Stocks at a value of ca. US$870 million were divested from the fund as a result of the decisions.  Attacks on the mine  Violent ambushes near the Grasberg mine have occurred as early as August 2002, when three contract school teachers were killed. Kopassus, the Indonesian Special Forces, allegedly instigated the incident. A series of attacks started on 11 July 2009, and continued for more than five days. A Freeport employee, 29-year-old Australian Drew Grant was shot and killed while sitting in the back of a car on the way to a game of golf. Indonesian police indicated that Grant was killed by five shots he sustained to the neck, chest and stomach by unknown assailants using military-issue weapons. The attack also killed Freeport security guard Markus Ratealo and a number of police officers. On 7 April 2011, two Freeport employees were killed when the company car they were traveling in caught fire. Bullets were found inside the car, giving weight to the suspicion that the car was fired on by unknown gunmen. This incident sparked a protest by hundreds of Freeport employees concerned about the security along the jungle road leading up to the mine. The Grasberg mine has been a frequent source of friction in Papua. Possible causes of friction are the mine's environmental impact on Papua, the perceived low share of profits going to local Papuans (Freeport's annual report shows it made $4.1billion in operating profit on revenue of $6.4billion in 2010) and the questionable legality of the payments made to Indonesian security forces for their services to guard the site. Accidents and incidents On May 14, 2013, a training facility tunnel collapsed trapping at least 33 workers underground. A mine official at the mine said three workers were killed, but the main office in Arizona said there were no fatalities. As of 20 May, 10 miners were rescued and 14 bodies were recovered bringing the total deaths to 17. Eleven other men are believed to be buried under the rubble. =Strikes= Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes: On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places. In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike. In 2017, 5,000 workers at the mine participated in a labor strike that lasted over 4 months.

He held several cabinet portfolios during the 1950s, and served as a member of parliament between 1947 and 1949. Amini was widely regarded as \\"a prot√©g√© of the United States\\" and a \\"pro-American liberal reformer\\". Early life Amini was born on 12 September 1905 in Tehran. He was a grandson of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar through his mother, Fakhr ol dowleh. He completed his studies first in Darolfonoon and then in France where he graduated with a degree in law from Grenoble University, followed by his Ph.D in economics from Paris. Uporn his return to Iran, he was employed at the Ministry of Justice by Ali Akbar Davar. Career Amini was a founding member of the Democrat Party of Iran, and entered the 15th term of parliament with the party's ticket. His first ministerial portfolio was in the cabinet of Ali Mansur. He served as a minister in the cabinet of Mohammad Mosaddegh, but broke away from Mosaddegh in July 1952. He was later regarded as a \\"traitor\\" by the National Front, because of his collaboration with the post-1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat government. He became minister of economic affairs in the cabinet of Fazlollah Zahedi and remained in office until 1955. He was then appointed as the justice minister under Hossein Ala. After a few months, he was named the ambassador to the US. His tendencies were pro- American to the extent that made the Shah uncomfortable. Mohammad Reza Shah in particular distrusted Amini's popularity and friendship with then-senator John F. Kennedy. Therefore, his tenure ended in 1958. In the 1950s, Amini was a candidate for the premiership. He was appointed prime minister in 1961. In July 1962, however, he was replaced by the Shah's close friend and a major Birjand landowner Asadollah Alam. In the late 1970s, Amini attempted a comeback into Iranian politics at the age of 70.

Background He was the eldest son of the 5th king Chogo.Park, Hyun Sook, ¬´Î∞±Ï†úÏùòÏ§ëÏïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÎ∞©¬ª(Central area and regions of Baekje), p. 71, Juryuseong, 2005, He became king upon Chogo's death in 214 which was the 49th year of his reign. The Samguk Sagi records that \\"he was seven feet tall and unusually exceptional in his power\\".Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Reign Even assuming that the dates given in the Samguk Sagi are accurate, Baekje through Gusu's reign was probably a confederacy, not yet a kingdom. In 216, he prevailed against the Mohe forces at Sado Castle, and in 222, he destroyed a 5,000-strong force of Silla, the rival Korean kingdom. However, the Samguk Sagi records many Baekje defeats against the Mohe and Silla, as well as natural disasters towards the end of Gusu's reign. Samguk Sagi: * 216 AD, autumn, eighth month. The Mohe came and surrounded Jeokhyeon Fortress. The lord of the fortress repelled them, and the bandits retreated. The King led 800 choice cavalry in pursuit of them, and fought them near Sado Fortress, and broke them. Many of them were killed or captured. * 217 AD, spring, second month. Twin palisades were constructed alongside Sado Fortress, and from east to west they ran in parallel for 10 ri. The people of Jeokhyeon were divided and some made to defend the palisade. * 218 AD, the king led soldiers to surround Jangsan Fortress of Silla. The king of Silla (Naehae of Silla) himself led and army out to attack them, and the Baekje army was defeated. * 221 AD, summer, fifth month. In the east of the country there was great rainfall, and the mountains collapsed in more than 40 places. Sixth month, last day of the month. There was a solar eclipse. Autumn, eighth month. There was a great examination of the area to the west of the Han River. * 222 AD, spring, second month. Commissioners were ordered to repair the dikes and embankments. Third month. The king made a proclamation encouraging production of agriculture. Summer, sixth month. It rained fish in the capital. Winter, tenth month. Soldiers were dispatched to Udujin in Silla, and the inhabitants were robbed and kidnapped. The Sillan general Chunghwon led 5,000 soldiers to counter-attack, and at Ungok Fortress they made a great rout of the Baekje forces. Only the cavalry escaped. 11th month, last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. * 224 AD, autumn, seventh month. The Sillan Ilgil XYeonchin came and invaded. Our army counter-attacked near Mt. Bongsan but could not overcome them. Winter, tenth month. Venus was seen. * 227 AD, spring, third month. It hailed. Summer, fourth month. There was a great drought. The king prayed in the eastern court, and it rained. * 229 AD, winter, tenth month. The king hunted at a cold spring. 11th month. There was a great pestilence. The Mohe came to the borders of Ugok Fortress and kidnapped the people there. The King led 300 spirited soldiers to repel them. The bandits hid themselves, then came to attack, the Baekje army suffered a great defeat. * 231 AD, summer, fourth month. There was hail the size of chestnuts. Some of the birds that were struck died. * 234 AD, the king died. Legacy Upon Gusu's death, his eldest son Saban briefly became the 7th king. Saban was dethroned by Goi, reported as Chogo's brother in the Samguk Sagi, but believed to be of a rival royal line by modern scholars. Indicating continuing rivalry between the two lines, Gusu's second son became the 11th king Biryu, and the name of the 14th king Geungusu indicates descent from the Gusu line.

Among his polymathic scholarly specialties were history, literary bibliography, and astronomy. He is particularly well known for his bibliographic work in cataloging and editing the extensive imperial library. Life Liu Gengsheng was born in Xuzhou. Being a distant relative of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, he was thus a member of the ruling dynastic clan (the Liu family). Liu Xiang's father ranked as a marquess.Hawkes, 330 Liu Xiang's son, Liu Xin, would continue the scholarly tradition of his father and his relative Liu An (the Prince of Huainan). By the beginning of Han Yuandi's reign, Liu Xiang was a member of a group of Confucian officials, including Xiao Wangzhi, who wished to limit the power of the emperor's female family member's relatives' clans, the Shi and the Xu. He ended up on the losing side of a power struggle between the powerful eunuchs Hong Gong and Shi Xian. Briefly imprisoned, Liu Xiang was terminated from official position, and he received no new appointments to office for the next fifteen years.Hawkes, 281 The succession of Emperor Cheng to the imperial throne was accompanied by a realignment of power among the various factions involved in government, and Liu Xiang was able to revive his official prospects. In 26 BCE, at the command of the emperor, Liu Xiang spent much of the rest of the 20-odd years of his life engaged in the massive bibliographic work of organizing the imperial library. This work was assisted by his son, Liu Xin, who finally completed the task after his father's death. Works Liu compiled the first catalogue of the imperial library, the Abstracts Bielu), and is the first known editor of the Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijing), which was finished by his son.E.L. Shaughnessy, Rewriting Early Chinese Texts, pp. 2-3. Liu also edited collections of stories and biographies, including the Strategies of the Warring States (Zhanguoce), the New Prefaces (, Xinxu), the Garden of Stories (, Shuoyuan), and the Biographies of Exemplary Women (Lien√ºzhuan). He has long erroneously been credited with compiling the Biographies of the Immortals (Liexian Zhuan), a collection of Taoist hagiographies and hymns.. Liu Xiang was also a poet.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. The name of the town comes from Latin roca cavardi, which roughly translates as the rock of Cavardus, the lord who had the fortified place built at the beginning of the 11th century. More often than not, natives pronounce it , not as is its pronunciation in Standard French. History Aymeric I, who lived around 990, was the first viscount and established the Rochechouartais dynasty. Aymeric IV took part in the First Crusade at the end of the 11th century at the side of Godfrey of Bouillon, and it was Aymeric VI (1170‚Äì1230) who built the present castle, the Ch√¢teau de Rochechouart, the keep and gatehouse of which remain standing. At the end of the 13th century, Aimeric XI renounced a large part of his privileges and promulgated a charter of enfranchisement which transformed Rochechouart into a democratic city, and turned its inhabitants from slaves to the state into citizens. The city was from then on governed by four consuls who chose their own successors, without their lord's intervention. At the same time the viscount suppressed all direct taxes such as the \\"taille\\" and the \\"qu√™te\\" and abolished duties of service to the feudal lord. He also accorded the inhabitants of Rochechouart the essential conditions for total liberty ‚Äì they could dispose of their goods, buy or sell, import and export whatever they wanted, build, move about freely within the viscountcy, all without intervention from their lord. This Charter was very advanced for its times, and despite pressure from the other lords in the region, it remained in force until 1789. Fran√ßois de Rochechouart in the late 15th century is known for his study on the Dialogues of Pierre Salmon, the secretary of Charles VI of France. Before the French Revolution, Rochechouart administratively depended on the Province of Poitou, the viscounts of Rochechouart being vassals of the Count of Poitiers, and religiously, it was under the control of the diocese of Limoges. Geography Rochechouart is situated at the confluence of the rivers Gr√™ne and Vayres on the Plateau of Limousin, about above sea level. It is about south of Saint-Junien, the second largest town in the department of Haute-Vienne, and west of Limoges, the largest town and capital of the department. To the west lie the communes of Pressignac and Chassenon in the department of Charente, to the north lie the communes of Saillat-sur-Vienne and Chaillac-sur-Vienne, to the east lies Saint-Auvent and to the south Vayres. The walled town of Rochechouart is overlooked by the ch√¢teau and houses a museum, the \\"Espace Meteorite Paul Pellas\\" which commemorates the meteorite crater. The ch√¢teau was taken over by the community in 1832 and now houses the town hall as well as a modern art collection, the \\"Mus√©e D√©partmental d'Art Contemporain\\". Rochechouart crater Rochechouart is situated in the Rochechouart crater, an impact crater caused by an asteroid that crashed into the earth's surface about 205 million years ago, in the Rhaetian period, shortly before the Triassic Jurassic boundary characterized by a massive extinction event in which 80% of the world's species were obliterated.

It is situated on the A607, and approximately south from the city and county town of Lincoln. Village Coleby, a documented settlement in Domesday, is set on the Lincoln Cliff escarpment with views over the River Witham valley from its western side. The Viking Way, the long- distance footpath from the Humber Bridge to Oakham, passes through the village. Coleby's population is approximately 600, falling to 410 at the 2011 census. Coleby has two village public houses, The Bell situated close to the church, and the Tempest Arms which stands at the top of the road that leads up the hill from the valley. The village has small school typically consisting of below 100 pupils. Landmarks =Church of All Saints= Coleby Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. The original church was built by the Anglo-Saxons, extended by the Normans and had a new spire built on top of the Saxon tower in the Middle Ages. There is a lack of symmetry to the chancel, the arches on the north and south walls do not match and half of an arch has been stopped off. The pews inside the church are not original, they come from a former church at Hackthorn, a village about to the north, as do two of the windows in the north aisle. The church was extensively restored in 1900. On the church steeple are landing lights for the nearby RAF Waddington airbase. =Coleby Hall= Coleby Hall is a Grade II* listed country house which stands near the church in a park of around . It is a gabled house constructed in coursed rubble and ashlar with a red-tiled ridge roof, built in 1628 for Sir William Lister of Rippingale, the father of Thomas Lister. The hall descended via Thomas Lister, MP, who extended the hall and then to his great niece Frances Lister in 1734, who had married Thomas Scrope. Thomas altered and further extended the hall and in 1762 built in the grounds a folly of a Temple to Romulus and Remus (now grade I listed) and a gateway to the Hall as an imitation ruined Roman arch based on Newport Arch in Lincoln. Ownership passed to the Tempest family in 1856 who made major alterations to the hall and estate before selling it on. It was later bought by the Fowkes family, and apart from being requisitioned by the military during the Second World War, remained in their possession until 1981, when it was sold to property developers. =RAF Coleby Grange= The derelict control tower at RAF Coleby Grange During the Second World War, the Ministry of Defence constructed an airfield at RAF Coleby Grange to the east of the village on open heathland, immediately west of the A15 road. It opened in 1939 with grass runways as a relief landing ground for RAF Cranwell. In May 1941 it was transferred to 12 Group, RAF Fighter Command and became a satellite station for RAF Digby. The station re-opened in 1959 as a Thor IRBM launching base, it closed again in 1963. Today the airfield is in private hands and used for agriculture with only the Control Tower, which still stands although in a ruined state, as a visible sign of the station's existence.\\"Coleby Grange airfield\\", controltowers.co.uk: RAF Coleby Grange References Further reading * Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore, Action Stations: Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands v. 2.

The series premiered on SBS on 24 April 2000 where it aired for its first five seasons between 2000 and 2007 before moving to 7mate for its sixth season in 2019. The series has a spin-off feature length movie, Fat Pizza, released in 2003, and a best-of highlights video and DVD that featured previously unreleased footage and a schoolies expos√©, released in 2004. In addition to this, a theatre show entitled \\"Fat Pizza\\", starring several characters from the show, toured the Australian east coast. In 2014, the storyline of the series was combined with that of Housos to create the motion picture Fat Pizza vs. Housos. The film was shown in Australian cinemas from 27 November 2014. Through some ironic and self-conscious references, Pizza involves themes of ethnicity and stereotypes (similar to Acropolis Now), cars, sex, illicit drugs and violence to produce its dark humour. The television program is noted for its frequent cameo appearances of numerous Australian celebrities of all varieties, including actors, comedians, professional athletes and other public figures. History and development Pizza began in the early 1990s as a black-and-white short film entitled Pizza Man created by Paul Fenech, in which he starred as the eponymous pizza man. In 1995, the short film won third place in the Tropfest film festival. The subsequent television series Pizza is written and directed by Paul Fenech, who portrays the protagonist of the series, pizza deliveryman Pauly. In a few of the episodes, Pauly breaks the fourth wall and as Paul Fenech, the self-described \\"fil-um maker\\",[sic] presents featurettes that reveal the history of the series, often in a tongue-in-cheek or parody manner. It was first broadcast on the SBS network in 2000 until the fifth season in 2007. The half-hour program was part of the SBS Monday comedy slot, noted for its offbeat comedy shows including South Park and John Safran. The Fat Pizza feature film was released in 2003 and the second Fat Pizza vs. Housos in 2014, also featured characters from another Paul Fenech comedy series Housos. In August 2019, it was announced the series would be returning for a new season on Seven Network‚Äôs multichannel 7mate, titled Fat Pizza: Back In Business. The season premiered on 5 November 2019. On 29 January 2020, it was announced that Fat Pizza: Back in Business had been renewed for another season. Synopsis In the series, long time pizza man Pauly, teaches new employee Sleek Paul Nakad that pizza delivery is dangerous. This fact is reiterated by a news report. The show focuses on the activities of Pauly and his fellow co-workers, as they deliver pizzas for \\"Fat Pizza\\", the Sydney-based pizzeria of Bobo Gigliotti, whose slogan is \\"they're big and they're cheesy\\". Throughout the series, the dangers of pizza delivery are exemplified by encounters with aliens, killer kangaroos, bikies, bogans, petty criminals, muggers, drug dealers and/or addicts, dominatrices, celebrities, the CIA, ASIO, Australian Border Force, the Australian Tax Office, the New South Wales Police Force, the NRL, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Army, Arab and Asian terrorists, organised crime gangs and even evil Satanic forces that conspire to bring about the end of the world. In spite of this, the characters remain unfazed and unsurprised, and they persist in their dead-end, below-minimum- wage job, which pays A$2.00 per hour. Cast =Fat Pizza employees (2000 - 2007)= *Paul Fenech as Pauly Falzoni ‚Äì main protagonist, pizza delivery man, boxer, aspiring \\"fil-um maker\\", and (since the sixth season) the owner/manager of Fat Pizza. His favourite derogatory comment for people is \\"stooge\\", originating from a comment a teacher once made to him. Pauly has been one of Bobo's longest-serving employees at Fat Pizza and has provided Bobo with some good ideas over the years. During the 2005 series of Pizza, Pauly's parents, relatives, and Pauly were shown with a cousin named Luigi, who lives in Italy. In one episode, it is shown that Pauly's dad was a Maltese spy for British Intelligence and his mother was a Mexican woman whom Pauly's father had met on a boat from Hong Kong to Australia. Pauly's ethnic background consists of Maltese, Italian, and Spanish roots. He makes an appearance in Housos telling his cousin Franky that their uncle Fred has died. In the sixth season; after receiving a large payout from his injuries sustained from being hit with a \\"coward punch\\", Pauly reopens the shop and becomes the manager after Bobo is imprisoned. *Paul Nakad as Sleek the Elite ‚Äì so named because he is \\"slicker than slick\\", an aspiring rapper, ladies' man and a pizza delivery man who self-titled himself the \\"Lebanese Lover\\" or \\"Lebanese Legend\\". He was the main co-star in the first two series and the movie. He is a lady killer, hence the name \\"Lebanese lover\\". In the third series (2003, after the movie) it was revealed Sleek had been kidnapped by Islamic terrorists while holidaying in his homeland of Lebanon for \\"rooting all their women\\". In several episodes, Sleek was portrayed as the closeted bisexual male. He was replaced by Rocky's other cousin, Slick, who is killed off by Bobo in season three, episode one. Sleek returns in the \\"Fat Pizza vs. Housos\\" movie, where he returns to working for Bobo after spending time in Guantanamo Bay for being mistaken for a terrorist due to his rapping. In the opening episode of the sixth season, Sleek is seen running his own kebab shop. *Tahir Bilgi√ß as Habib Halal Habib ‚Äì meaning \\"Friend\\" in Arabic. Habib featured as a supporting character in the earlier series of Pizza; a friend of Sleek's, he is a stereotypical young Lebanese (Bilgi√ß is actually Turkish) drug-dealer and fence of stolen goods (typically mobile phones). He played a larger role in the theatrical version of Pizza. In 2003 after the loss of Sleek, he was employed at the shop as a deliveryman, a position he regularly uses as a front for his illegal activities. He is socially inept, and used to be moderately successful with attractive women (which played a part in developing his fetish for \\"fat chicks\\" due to him being unable to get the kind of girls Sleek and Rocky picked up on a regular basis as well as Sleek and Rocky regularly cockblocking Habib from getting the attractive girls (as seen in the Fat Pizza movie)), but has hitched up with Toula. *Jabba as David \\"Davo\\" Dinkum ‚Äì a stereotypical bong-smoking Aussie bogan. Being the only non-\\"choco\\" at Fat Pizza sometimes leaves him at the end of discrimination, but he gets on well with the drug- dealing Habib. Introduced in the movie, he has appeared since. Since 2005, Davo was sacked from Fat Pizza and now he is unemployed, spending most of his time smoking his bong, getting drunk and looking for chicks (the vast majority of them pot-smoking bogan chicks that reside in Hashfield). He wears thongs as training footwear. *John Boxer as Bobo Gigliotti ‚Äì the psychotic, pizza chef and (prior to the sixth season) the owner/manager of Fat Pizza. He has little patience and those that cross him usually end up on the wrong end of his chainsaw. He is a stingy, crooked boss, imposing dreadful working conditions and abuse. Additionally, he is consistently docking the delivery-boys' $3/hour pay for any deviation from schedule. The few things that he likes are his mother, referred to by him as Mama; his mail-order bride, Lin Chow; and making pizzas. Since Lin Chow was deported to Vietnam, Bobo has been single and, during the 2007 series of Pizza, he has recently met a former erotic film actress named Ruby a.k.a. \\"Mama Jugs\\" (Angela White) and the two have since gotten engaged, much to the disgust of Bobo's mother. Bobo makes a cameo in the Housos episode \\"Uncle Fred\\" with his trademark chainsaw. In the sixth season, Bobo is imprisoned for 25 years after the events that transpired at the end of the \\"Fat Pizza vs. Housos\\" movie. However, he gives Pauly advice about how to run the shop when he takes over from Bobo. In the second episode of the sixth season, Bobo escaped from prison. = Supporting cast = *Annalise Braakensiek as supermodel Claudia MacPherson ‚Äì pronounced \\"Clow- dia\\", the name is an obvious play on models Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson. She is dimwitted, rich, blonde, bulimic, and attractive. She is a regular customer at Fat Pizza and often has run-ins with both Pauly and Sleek. *Rob Shehadie as Robert \\"Rocky\\" Shekazbah ‚Äì self-stylised \\"Lebanese Rambo\\". A tall, muscular, homophobic egotistical Lebanese friend/second cousin of Habib (often role of enforcer), seems to be able to score with any number of young (and likely underage) women. *Maria Venuti as Mama Gigliotti ‚Äì Bobo's overbearing Italian mother who actually owned Fat Pizza. Despite her being quite physically abusive, Bobo still loves his Mama and lived with her prior to the sixth season when he was sent to prison. Since Bobo's imprisonment, Mama has been in a state of shock and has had to be looked after by a carer. However, her aggressive demeanour remains unchanged. *Tuyen Le as Lin Chow Bang ‚Äì Bobo's diminutive mail-order bride from Vietnam. The Fat Pizza movie partly dealt with the arrival of Lin Chow (and her family), and as such she only appears since 2003. She has not been seen since 2003 after the Department of Immigration deported her back to Vietnam due to Habib and Rocky informing both the police and Immigration so they could avoid drug dealing charges and time in jail. *Rebel Wilson as Toula Maccalopolous ‚Äì an obese Greek-Australian girl who was Habib's girlfriend and now wife, whom she refers to as her \\"Habibi\\". She is a voracious eater. She accompanied Pauly and Rocky in the \\"Pizza World\\" mockumentary. In Los Angeles she asks a tourist centre if they have star map, but one that marks all the fast food places rather than celebrity residences. In the fourth series of Pizza, it is revealed that Toula has a gang of obese girls called the \\"Fat Chick 12\\" (because although there are only 6 girls in the gang, they are as large as two people). It is also revealed that Toula is an obsessive control freak, domineering and controlling over every aspect of Habib's life, especially in the later stages of their engagement and after Habib married her. Before the wedding, Toula used the members of the Fat Chick 12 to spy and stop Habib from enjoying his last days of bachelorhood by preventing erotic dancers from going to Habib's buck's night. After the wedding, Toula's control over Habib has become more extreme with Toula preventing Habib from returning to work and forcing Habib to wear pink tracksuit pants. In the 2007 series of Pizza, Habib has returned to work and has successfully been avoiding Toula by saying that he is \\"really busy\\" with work. *Anthony Salame as Omar, Habib's cousin and best friend of his cousin Mohammed. He was introduced in Pizza in 2007, when he helped Habib do an insurance job on the old Fat Pizza premises. He is often shown to be with Habib and Rocky in most episodes. He was shown to be friends with Pauly when they went to the fireworks factory in Canberra to pick up fireworks for Habib. *Katrina SpadoneSpadone as Katrina, or Kat for short ‚Äì a best friend of the obese Toula, and girlfriend to Rocky. In the recent series of Pizza, Katrina started to develop a crush on Pauly since Rocky was not treating her right. She has broken up and re-united with Rocky several times (much to the torture and torment of Pauly who is keen on having Katrina as his girlfriend). In World Record Pizza, she joined Pauly, Habib and Kev in their trip around the globe, much to Rocky's disgust, so that Pauly can try to get Katrina. However, before they left Brazil to return to Australia, Katrina decided to stay in Brazil with her new boyfriend. She has since re-appeared, featuring in the Season 5 episode 'Doctor Pizza'. *Murray Harman as Murray the Cop ‚Äì A hot headed cop who did not like too much paper work. He seems to have many run ins with Pauly. *John Mangos as the Newsreader. =New employees at Fat Pizza= In the 2005 series of Pizza, new characters were introduced to accompany Pauly and Habib in delivering pizzas, after Bobo decided to turn Fat Pizza into a franchise. The new employees at Fat Pizza are: *Kevin Taumata as Kev the Kiwi ‚Äì A stereotypical MƒÅori-Australian, who is obsessed with alcohol. Whenever on/off duty, he will sneak to a local pub to \\"git on thuh puhss.\\" Kev often uses New Zealand slang including \\"choice!\\" and \\"bro'\\". He also has a small rivalry with Junior. He is always seen with his sunglasses on. *Andrew Ausage as Junior ‚Äì Bobo's apprentice chef, who, like Bobo, abuses the other employees. He and Kev have a small rivalry, and sometimes fight each other for reasons unknown. Sometimes Junior would add Samoan-inspired ingredients on pizzas, such as pig snouts and turtle meat and cooked meat in a HƒÅngi. *Alex Romano as DJ BJ (\\"BJ\\" standing for Big Jams) ‚Äì A young employee, who is more abused and yelled at from Bobo and Junior more than the others. He enjoys playing his turn-table but is also clumsy and a weakling, resulting in occasional accidents and injuries (e.g., a snake chasing him at Uluru, being electrocuted by fiddling with plugs on Melbourne Cup Day). *Anh Do as Chen Chong Fat (a.k.a. Keith) ‚Äì A stereotypical Asian, who tries to get into Australian culture, eating pies and sausage rolls and talking in outdated slang. In Season 5, he was framed for eating a police dog (Davo Dinkum, Habib and Rocky were the ones responsible for stealing the police dog) and was sent to jail, and was not seen after that episode. *Hollie Meyer as \\"Baby\\" and \\"Toula's gang\\". A stereotypical \\"fat chick\\" who is one of Toula's girls. She forces herself on DJ BJ who becomes her boyfriend and she is not shy to push her weight around. She is the butt of the fat jokes and happy to retaliate violently when ridiculed. Hollie also played a variety of other roles including Toula's double in series 5, the Ghost, and \\"Voula\\" in the 'Italy' episode, season 4. *Khalid Malik as Indian doctor. =Fat Pizza employees (2019)= In the 2019 series of Pizza, new characters were introduced to accompany Pauly. *Paul Fenech ...

Bolgatanga has over 2012 settlement and a population of about 66,685 people. Bolgatanga is 161 km (about 100 miles) to the north of Tamale. Bolgatanga lies in the Red Volta River Valley (which serves as a major migration route of elephants), with the White Volta River and the cliffs of the Gambaga Escarpment to the south of the town forming the southern boundary of the Upper East region. History of Bolgatanga Ancient style painted bungalow house in the suburb of Bolgatanga Bolgatanga's name derives from the Frafra words bolga \\"rock\\" and t·∫Ω≈ãa \\"city.\\" Historically Bolgatanga was situated at the southern terminus of the ancient Trans-Saharan trade route. The eastern route converged with the Sahelian route, near Bolgatanga. Along the route, handicrafts‚Äîespecially straw baskets, hats and fans, as well as leather goods, metal jewellery, and indigenous attires ‚Äî were exchanged for kola nuts and salt. The Upper East Region, where Bolgatanga lies, is part of what used to be known as the Upper Region. Between 1902 and 1960 the Northern Territory was a British protectorate; it was separated into the Northern and Upper Region on July 1, 1960. The Upper Region was apportioned into Upper East and Upper west region in 1983. Life in Bolgatanga Street in Bolgatanga Bolgatanga is known as the crafts centre of Upper East region, with a large central market. Apart from items found elsewhere in Upper East region, the so- called \\"Bolga hats\\" are made and sold in Bolgatanga. Bolgatanga and its surrounding suburbs also comprise the largest producers of leather works, straw baskets and smocks. The artists sell their works at the Bolgatanga Market, which is open every third day. There is also a museum in the town which houses objects of historical importance of the Upper East region. Climate Bolgatanga has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh).  Occupation & food  Farming is the Main occupation of the people of Bolga. They engage in subsistence farming of millet, maize, guinea-corn, rice, beans, groundnuts and sweet potatoes during the raining season and irrigation farming of onions, tomatoes, and pepper during the dry season. almost every farmer rears at least a bird or animal. the main food of the people of Bolga is Tuo Zaafi (TZ) Tourism =Architecture and sights of Bolgatanga= = Schools in Bolgatanga = * Bolgatanga Senior High School * Bolgatanga Nursing Training College * Bolgatanga Midwifery College * Bolgatanga Technical Institute * Bolgatanga Girls' Senior High School * Zamse Senior High School * Zuarungu Senior High School * Zuarungu Nursing Training College * Bolgatanga Polytechnic =Bolgatanga Library= The Bolgatanga library is a notable design of award-winning American architect J. Max Bond, Jr., who was influenced by Le Corbusier. Bond lived in Ghana for four years in the 1960s, escaping racism in the United States. The Bolgatanga library was his first major project while working for the national construction company. The design features perforated walls and an \\"umbrella\\" shaped roof, so the structure remains cool and well ventilated. =Paga crocodile ponds= Forty kilometres (about 25 miles) from Bolgatanga, is Paga, home to the sacred crocodile ponds. These are purportedly the \\"friendliest\\" crocodiles in Ghana, and it is said that the souls of the royal family reside in them. The crocodiles roam freely throughout the ponds and it is unthinkable that anyone should harm them.

This terminology is not typically used for any of the wild species or subspecies of wild wolves, foxes, coyotes, dholes, jackals or the basal caninae. Dog terminology is often specific to each breed or type of dog. Breed standards use this terminology in the description of the ideal external appearance of each breed, although similar characteristics may be described with different terms in different breeds. Dog coats 180px 180px Coat colors range from pure white to solid black and many other variations. Above is a white American Eskimo dog and a black Belgian Shepherd (Groenendael). A Stanford University School of Medicine study published in Science in October, 2007 found the genetics that explain coat colors in other mammals such as in horse coats and in cat coats, did not apply to dogs. The project took samples from 38 different breeds to find the gene (a beta defensin gene) responsible for dog coat color. One version produces yellow dogs, and a mutation produces black. All dog coat colors are modifications of black or yellow.Stanford University Medical Center, Greg Barsh et al. (2007, October 31). Genetics Of Coat Color In Dogs May Help Explain Human Stress And Weight. ScienceDaily. Retrieved September 29, 2008 For example, the white in white miniature schnauzers is a cream color, not albinism (a genotype of e/e at MC1R.) Today, dogs exhibit a diverse array of fur coats, including dogs without fur, such as the Mexican Hairless Dog. Dog coats vary in texture, color, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has evolved to describe each characteristic. =Color= One often refers to a specific dog first by coat color rather than by breed; for example, \\"a blue merle Aussie\\" or \\"a chocolate Lab\\". Coat colors include: *Black *Brown: From mahogany through liver (dark brown). *Red: Reminiscent of reddish woods such as cherry or mahogany; also tawny, chestnut, orange, rusty, and red-gold. *Yellow: From pale cream to a deep yellowish-gold tan. *Gold: From pale apricot to rich reddish-yellow. *Gray: Pale to dark gray, including silver; can be mixed with other colors or various shades to create sandy pepper, pepper, grizzle, blue-black gray, or silver-fawn. *Blue: A dark metallic gray, otherwise known as slate; diluted black pigment. Blue merle is genetically black, not blue. *Sable: Black-tipped hairs; the background color can be gold, silver, gray, or tan. *White: Distinct from albino dogs. *Buff: Such as the buff Cocker spaniel. All these colors can also be dilute, meaning they become a paler shade of the original color. Blue and cream are both dilute colors. =Pattern= Dalmatian's coat is one of the more widely recognized markings. Coat patterns include: *Bicolor: such as black and tan, red and white. The coat has both colors but in clearly defined and separated areas; usually the top and sides are darker and lower legs and underside are the lighter color. *Tricolor: Consisting of three colors, usually black, tan, and white or liver, tan, and white. *Brindle: A mixture of black with brown, tan, or gold, usually in a \\"tiger stripe\\" pattern. Sometimes called grizzle when the pattern is not in lines. *Roan: A kind of ticking on the hair where half the fur is one color and the other half is a different color. In English Setters, this color pattern is called a Belton pattern. *Harlequin: \\"Torn\\" patches of black on white. *Merle: Marbled coat with darker patches and spots of the specified color. *Particolor: Two-colored coat with the colors appearing in patches in roughly equal quantities. *Tuxedo: Solid (usually black) with a white patch (shirt front) on the chest, and white on some or all of the feet (spats.) This pattern is sometimes called Irish Spotting, Flashy, or Boston. *Blenheim: A red and white pattern found in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. *Domino: A specific facial and body pattern in Afghan Hounds caused by a certain genotype. =Texture= Coat textures vary tremendously. Some coats make the dogs more cuddly and others make them impervious to cold water. Densely furred breeds such as most sled dogs and Spitz types can have up to 600 hairs per inch, while fine-haired breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier can have as few as 100, and the \\"hairless\\" breeds such as the Mexican Hairless Dog and the Peruvian Inca Orchid have none on parts of their bodies. The texture of the coat often depends on the distribution and the length of the two parts of a dog's coat, its thick, warm undercoat (or down) and its rougher, somewhat weather-resistant outer coat (topcoat, also referred to as guard hairs). Breeds with soft coats often have more or longer undercoat hairs than guard hairs; rough-textured coats often have more or longer guard hairs. Textures include: The German Wirehaired Pointer's coat demonstrates a rough texture. *Double-coated: Having a thick, warm, short undercoat (or down) that is usually dense enough to resist penetration by water and a stronger, rougher weather-resistant outer coat (topcoat), also referred to as guard hairs. Most other coat types are also double-coated. *Single-coated: Lacking an undercoat. *Smooth-coated: \\"Smooth\\" to the eye and touch. *Wire-haired: Also called broken-coated. The harsh outer guard hairs are prominent, providing excellent weather protection for hunting dogs such as the Border Terrier or Wirehaired Pointing Griffon. *Long-haired: Hair longer than an inch or so. *Short-haired: Hair around an inch or so long. *Corded coat: for example, see Puli Parts of the body A special vocabulary has been developed to describe the characteristics of various body parts of the dog. Terms are often specific to each breed or type of dog. =Head= Golden RetrieverThe parts of the head are the nose, muzzle, stop, forehead or braincase, occiput (highest point of the skull at the back of the head), ears, eyes, eyebrows or brows, whiskers, flews (lips, which may hang down), and cheeks. Dog heads are of three basic shapes: *Apple-headed refers to a dog's head that is round on top, not flat. *Brachycephalic, or shortened muzzled, sometimes so short that it can lead to breathing problems, such as in the Pug. *Dish-faced refers to a dog whose nasal bone is higher at the nose than at the stop. *Dolichocephalic, or long and narrow, as seen in most \\"hounds\\" like a Borzoi or other breeds such as the Rough Collie and the grey wolf. *Down-faced, a convex facial structure where the muzzle is turned slightly downward when looked at from the dogs profile, such as a Bull Terrier. *Mesocephalic, or wedge shaped (broad skull with a narrower muzzle). Nose *Butterfly nose is of two colors. *Dudley nose is a flesh-colored nose. Muzzle A snipey muzzle is one that is too pointed for good breed type. Stop The stop is the degree of angle change between the skull and the nasal bone near the eyes. Also the indentation between the eyes where the nose and skull meet. Forehead or braincase Occiput The occiput in dog terms is the bump or protuberance clearly seen at the back of the skull in some breeds like the English Setter and Bloodhound. However, in other breeds it is barely perceptible. Myths in dog folklore believed that size of the occiputal protuberance was somehow a measure of the dog's sense of smell. So to this day it is prominent in most Scent Hounds. However, technically the occipital bone extends right down the back of the head to where it articulates with the neck. So when breed standards refer to the length of a dog's skull, they rarely include the occiput in this measurement. The occiput has many nerve endings and stimulates calming effects to do with the flight or fight system. It is used in canine therapeutic massage to calm the dogs. Ears The Basset Hound's ears are extremely long drop ears. Dogs' ears come in a variety of sizes, shapes, lengths, positions on the head, and amounts and types of droop. Every variation has a term, including: *Bat ear: Erect, broad next to the head and rounded at the tip, such as the ears on a Chihuahua or a French Bulldog. *Button ear: A smaller ear where the tip folds forward nearly to the skull, forming a V, as in the Jack Russell Terrier. *Cropped ear: Shaped by cutting; see cropping. *Drop ear: An ear that folds and droops close to the head, such as the little known Blue Lacy. Also called a pendant ear. *Natural: Like a wolf's. *Prick ear: Erect and pointed; also called pricked or erect. *Rose ear: A very small drop ear that folds back; as in the greyhound or bulldog. *Semiprick ear: A prick ear where the tip just begins to fold forward, as in the Rough Collie. *Hound ear: Floppy ear that is long and droopy enough to collect air around the nostrils, as in scent hounds and spaniels. Eyes A dog's vision is actually equivalent to a human with red-green color blindness. Different breeds have different shapes of eyes. It all depends on the purpose. If a dog is a hunter, they most definitely need good eyesight. Therefore, those breeds have a wider range of vision than others. As a rule of thumb, breeds with short heads have a narrower field of vision, whereas breeds with longer heads have a wider field of vision - such as wolf, sighthound. Eyebrows or brows Whiskers Flews Flews are a dog's upper lips, or the canine equivalent of upper lips. Cheeks Cheeky refers to a dog with strongly defined cheeks. Mouth and teeth Bite describes how the dog's teeth meet when its mouth is closed. =Body= The body may be described as \\"cobby\\" (short and square) or sometimes by a ratio of height to length. =Withers= The ridge between the shoulder blades; often it is the tallest point of the body. =Skin= =Legs and gait= Legs Gait *Single suspension gallop: The dog supports its weight with its feet in the unsymmetrical sequence RF, LF, RH, LH. *Double suspension gallop: The front legs are in full extension forward while the rear legs are in full extension rearward. =Feet= One way a dog releases heat from its body is from in between its paws. Some dogs have a seemingly superfluous claw at the base of their foot. This is known as a dewclaw. =Tails= The Basenji's tail is tightly curled. Like ears, tails come in a tremendous variety of shapes, lengths, amounts of fur, and tailsets (positions). Among them: *Bob: Short or non-existent tail, such as an Australian Shepherd or Pembroke Welsh Corgi. *Corkscrew: Short and twisted, such as a Pug's *Docked: Shortened by surgery or other method, usually two or three days after birth; see docking *Odd: Twisted, but not short. Uncommon. Tibetan Terriers have odd tails. *Saber: Carried in a slight curve like a saber *Sickle: Carried out and up in a semicircle like a sickle *Squirrel: Carried high and towards the head, often with the tip curving even further towards the head. *Wheel: Carried up and over the back in a broad curve, resembling a wheel.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox (1961‚Äì62), Pittsburgh Pirates (1963‚Äì66) and Atlanta Braves (1966‚Äì67). Baseball career Schwall was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He was selected an All-Big Eight basketball star at the University of Oklahoma in 1957. A year later, he signed with the Red Sox. In 1961, Schwall posted a 15‚Äì7 record with 91 strikeouts and a 3.22 earned run average, for a Boston team that finished 33 games out of first place and ten games under .500. He won his first six decisions, extended the dazzling first- year stats to 13‚Äì2, and won Rookie of the Year honors, beating out Hall of Fame-bound teammate Carl Yastrzemski. At Fenway Park, on July 31, he pitched three innings in the first All-Star Game tie in major league baseball history (1‚Äì1), occurred when the game was stopped in the 9th inning due to rain. After a sub-par 1962 season (9‚Äì15), Schwall was sent to Pittsburgh. He and catcher Jim Pagliaroni were traded to the Pirates for first baseman Dick Stuart and pitcher Jack Lamabe. He went 6‚Äì12 in 1963, and later switched to a reliever, recording a career-best 2.92 ERA while winning nine games in 1965. The Pirates traded him to the Braves on June 15, 1966 for left-handed pitcher Billy O'Dell. Schwall finished his career with Atlanta early in the next season. In seven seasons, Schwall compiled a 49‚Äì48 record with 408 strikeouts, a 3.72 ERA, 18 complete games, five shutouts, four saves, and 743 innings pitched in 172 games (103 as a starter). Don Schwall was the second Red Sox player to be named the AL Rookie of the Year, joining Walter Dropo (1950), and later joined by Carlton Fisk (1972), Fred Lynn (1975), Nomar Garciaparra (1997), and Dustin Pedroia (2007). Post-baseball career After leaving baseball, Schwall pursued a career as an investment banker. A friend of Bob Prince, after Prince's death Schwall managed Prince's charitable endeavors for several years. Schwall continued to pursue his college education after becoming a professional baseball player, but never received his degree. In early 2018, he contacted the University of Oklahoma and was informed that he had completed his graduation requirements in 1961. He attended the school's May 2018 graduation ceremonies and received his diploma.

The International Standard Music Number or ISMN (ISO 10957) is a thirteen-character alphanumeric identifier for printed music developed by ISO. Overview The original proposal for an ISMN was made by the UK Branch of IAML (International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres), put forward by Alan Pope (Blackwell's Music Department, Oxford), Malcolm Lewis (music librarian in Nottingham) and Malcolm Jones (music librarian in Birmingham). A draft ISMN structure and application was presented at the 1987 IAML conference in Amsterdam, then after further discussions at the 1989 IAML conference in Oxford it was decided that the UK, French and German branches should, through their respective national standards bodies (BSI, AFNOR and DIN) file ISMN as an ISO work project. After meetings in Ottawa and Paris in 1993 the draft was finalized and published by ISO. The original format comprised four elements: a distinguishing prefix M, a publisher ID, an item ID, and a check digit, typically looking like M-2306-7118-7. From 1 January 2008 the ISMN was defined as a thirteen digit identifier beginning 979-0 where the zero replaced M in the old-style number. The resulting number is identical with its EAN-13 number as encoded in the item's barcode. The 979 Unique Country Code prefix is known as \\"Musicland\\". The current format comprises four blocks: the prefix 979-0 reserved for ISMNs ‚Äî at some future date they are expected to occupy the remainder of the 979 space which is shared with ISBNs, a block to identify the publisher, another to identify the item and one final check digit. The TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for the standard. A publication may be assigned both an ISBN and an ISMN. Unlike the ISBN, the ISMN does not segregate publishers by country. Check digit To calculate the check digit, each digit of the ISMN is multiplied by a weight, alternating 1 and 3 left to right. These weighted digits are added together. The check digit is the integer between 0 and 9 that makes the sum a multiple of 10. =Examples= For instance, for the item with ISMN beginning 979-0-060-11561: : 1x9 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x0 + 3x6 + 1x0 + 3x1 + 1x1 + 3x5 + 1x6 + 3x1 : = 9 + 21 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 18 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 : = 85 As 85 mod 10 = 5, the check digit is 10 - 5 = 5 and the full number is 979-0-060-11561-5. For another example, Robert Fripp's collection of Guitar Craft scores has the ISMN 979-0-9016791-7-7. Given first 12 digits 979-0-9016791-7, the ISMN algorithm evaluates : 1x9 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x9 + 3x0 + 1x1 + 3x1 + 1x6 + 3x7 + 1x9 + 3x1 : = 9 + 21 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 21 + 9 + 3 : = 123 which implies that the check digit is indeed 7 (because 123+7=130=13x10).

The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the Earth, including Diplodocus and Supersaurus, some of which may have reached lengths of up to . Description Diplodocus, depicted with spines limited to the mid-line of the back While the diplodocids were massive sauropods, they were relatively slender when compared to the titanosaurs and brachiosaurids, although they were also extremely long. They had short legs, making them the \\"dachshund\\" of giant dinosaurs, and their rear legs were longer than front legs, giving their back a distinctive downward slope towards the neck. Their necks were also extremely long. According to recent computer simulations, they may not have been able to lift their necks like other sauropods. However, these simulations do not take vertebral cartilage into account, which would likely allow a greater range of motion. Instead of reaching up into trees, they may have used their necks to graze over a broad area. They may also have used their necks to reach into dense stands of conifers, or over marshy ground. Their heads, like those of other sauropods, were tiny with the nasal openings on the top of the head (though in life the nostrils themselves would have been close to the tip of the snoutScience, 03 Aug 2001: Vol. 293, Issue 5531, pp. 850-853, DOI: 10.1126/science.1062681, Nostril Position in Dinosaurs and Other Vertebrates and Its Significance for Nasal Function, Lawrence M. Witmer). The heads of diplodocids have been widely depicted with the nostrils on top due to the position of the nasal openings at the apex of the skull. There has been speculation over whether such a configuration meant that diplodocids may have had a trunk.Bakker, Robert T. (1986) The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and their Extinction. New York: Morrow. A 2006 study surmised there was no paleoneuroanatomical evidence for a trunk. It noted that the facial nerve in an animal with a trunk, such as an elephant, is large as it innervates the trunk. The evidence suggests that the facial nerve is very small in diplodocids. Studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) indicated that, while the nasal openings were high on the head, the actual, fleshy nostrils were situated much lower down on the snout. Diplodocids also had long, whip-like tails, which were thick at the base and tapered off to be very thin at the end. Computer simulations have shown that the diplodocids could have easily snapped their tails, like a bullwhip. This could generate a sonic boom in excess of 200 decibels, and may have been used in mating displays, or to drive off predators. There is some circumstantial evidence supporting this as well: a number of diplodocids have been found with fused or damaged tail vertebrae, which may be a symptom of cracking their tails. Diet and feeding Their teeth were only present in the front of the mouth, and looked like pencils or pegs. They probably used their teeth to crop off food, without chewing, and relied on gastroliths (gizzard stones) to break down tough plant fibers (similar to modern birds). Diplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross- section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both the upper and lower teeth. Sesimosaurus This implies that the feeding mechanism of Diplodocus and other diplodocids was radically different from that of other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus,Norman, D.B. (1985). The illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. London: Salamander Books Ltd as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth‚Äìfood contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action. Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical modelling to examine the performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition. =Skin= Skin impression of a diplodocid, specimen CMC VP 10659 Few skin impressions of diplodocids have been found. However, at least one significant find was reported by Stephen Czerkas in 1992. Fossils from the Howe Quarry in Shell, Wyoming preserved portions of the skin from around the tip of the tail, or \\"whiplash\\". Czerkas noted that the skin preserved a sequence of conical spines, and that other, larger spines were found scattered around larger tail vertebrae. The spines appeared to be oriented in a single row along the mid-line of the tail, and Czerkas speculated that this midline row may have continued over the animal's entire back and neck. =Growth= Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Griebeler et al. (2013) examined long bone histological data and concluded that the diplodocid MfN.R.2625 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 23 years and died at age 24. The same growth model indicated that the diplodocid MfN.R.NW4 weighed , and died at age 23, before reaching sexual maturity. Classification Holotype specimens of Diplodocus carnegii and Apatosaurus louisae at Carnegie Museum of Natural History Diplodocidae was the third name given to what is now recognized as the single family of long-necked, whip- tailed sauropods. Edward Drinker Cope named the family Amphicoeliidae in 1878 for his genus Amphicoelias, sometimes considered a diplodocid.Carpenter, K. (2006). \\"Biggest of the big: a critical re-evaluation of the mega-sauropod Amphicoelias fragillimus.\\" In Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S.G., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36: 131-138. However, the name Amphicoeliidae did not come into wider use and was not used in the scientific literature after 1899, making it a nomen oblitum (\\"forgotten name\\") according to the ICZN, preventing it from displacing the name Diplodocidae as a senior synonym. More recent studies have also shown that Amphicoelias itself does not belong to this family, but is instead a more primitive diplodocoid. A similar situation occurred for the family name Atlantosauridae, named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, and which Hay argued had priority over Amphicoelidae. George Olshevsky declared Atlantosauridae a nomen oblitum in 1991, though scientists such as Steel and Nowinski had treated Atlantosauridae as a valid name as late as 1971, and the former even added a subfamily, Atlantosaurinae.Olshevsky, G. (1991). \\"A Revision of the Parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, Excluding the Advanced Crocodylia.\\" Mesozoic Meanderings, 2. Some dinosaurs have been considered diplodocids in the past but have not been found to be members of that group in later, larger analyses of the family's relationships. Australodocus, for example, was initially described as a diplodocid, but may actually have been a Macronarian. Amphicoelias was traditionally considered a diplodocid due to its similar anatomy, but phylogenetic studies showed it to be a more basal member of the Diplodocoidea. The relationships of species within Diplodocidae has also been subject to frequent revision. A study by Lovelace, Hartman and Wahl in 2008 found that Suuwassea and Supersaurus were relatives of Apatosaurus, within the subfamily Apatosaurinae. However, a subsequent analysis by Whitlock in 2011 showed that Supersaurus is slightly closer to Diplodocus than to Apatosaurus, and that Suuwassea is actually a primitive dicraeosaurid. Cast skeleton of Brontosaurus parvus based on the University of Wyoming specimen produced by Triebold Paleontology Incorporated The subfamily Diplodocinae, was erected to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, including Barosaurus. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors.

Born in Hemer, Westphalia, he studied art history and philosophy at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1908. He then went to England to receive voice training, as he planned to become a professional singer. He later received training in medicine and psychiatry, serving as an Army surgeon during World War I. In 1919 he became assistant to Karl Wilmanns at the psychiatric hospital of the University of Heidelberg. His task was to expand an earlier collection of art created by the mentally ill and started by Emil Kraepelin. When he left in 1921 the collection was extended to more than 5,000 works by about 450 \\"cases\\". In 1922 he published his first and most influential book, Bildnerei der Geisteskranken. Ein Beitrag zur Psychologie und Psychopatologie der Gestaltung (The plastic activity of the mentally ill. A contribution to the psychology and psychopathology of formal configuration), richly illustrated with examples from the collection. While his colleagues were reserved in their reaction, the art scene was enthusiastic. Jean Dubuffet was highly inspired by the works, and the term Art Brut was coined. The book is mainly concerned with the borderline between psychiatry and art, illness and self-expression. It represents one of the first attempts to analyse the work of the mentally ill. After short stays at sanatoriums in Zurich, Dresden and Wiesbaden, he began a psychotherapy practice in Frankfurt in 1925, but without much success. He continued to write books, and a half dozen were published in his lifetime. His hopes to find a permanent position at a university were never fulfilled. Disillusioned by professional failures, and after three failed marriages, he moved in with an aunt in Munich and retreated from public life, making a living from giving lectures and writing essays. He died in 1933 in Munich of typhus. Shortly after his death the Prinzhorn Collection was stowed away in the attics of the university. In 1938 a few items were displayed in the Nazi propaganda exhibition Entartete Kunst (\\"Degenerate Art\\"). Since 2001 the collection has been on display in a former oratory of the University of Heidelberg.

It followed the format of It's a Knockout (the British version of Jeux sans fronti√®res), a slapstick TV gameshow which was broadcast in the UK until 1982. The event was staged on the lakeside lawn of the Alton Towers stately home-cum-theme park. However, the event used its own specially created immersing set, meaning that the location was not very recognisable in the TV broadcast. Although regarded as a failure, a similar show (without royal involvement) was made the following year at Walt Disney World in Florida, featuring teams of celebrities representing the United Kingdom, USA, and Australia.

The show featured Prince Edward, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of York as non-participating team captains, each of whom supported a different charity. The show was hosted by Stuart Hall, Les Dawson and Su Pollard, with Hal Linden providing commentary for the U.S. telecast. Paul Daniels and Geoff Capes were timekeepers. Aled Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Barbara Windsor were heralds of the tournament. The Duke of Abercorn, the Duke of Westminster, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Roxburghe acted as impartial judges for each of the four teams. The contestants competed in ridiculous and somewhat humiliating games; for example, in one round, the players dressed up as giant vegetables and threw fake hams at each other. Live coverage was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 on 15 June 1987, and was presented by Steve Wright (The Radio 1 Roadshow). The tournament was won by The Princess Royal's team, with the Duke of York's team second, Prince Edward's team third, and the Duchess of York's team finishing last.  Aftermath  Immediately after the event, Prince Edward asked the assembled journalists, \\"Well, what did you think?\\" The journalists, unbeknownst to Prince Edward, hadn't seen the event as they remained in the press tent, separate from the celebrities and members of the Royal Family who had taken part, and apparently unhappy at such an arrangement. They responded with nervous laughter and Prince Edward stormed out of the press conference, sarcastically thanking the journalists for their enthusiasm. Reportedly the Queen disapproved of the event and all of her courtiers had advised against it.Ben Pimlott \\"Polishing Their Image\\", extract from The Queen, HarperCollins (1996) reprinted on the PBS Frontline webpage Neither she, nor the Duke of Edinburgh, nor the Prince and Princess of Wales agreed to take part but, Edward persevered and the project went to completion.

Qingxi has an area of . History a Hakka tower in QingXi Town Qingxi has a deep cultural foundation based in part on its long history of Hakka culture. Qingxi was at first a desolate and uninhabited mountainous place. 800 years ago, during the Hongwu period of the Ming dynasty, Hakka people began moving into Qingxi from the Central Plain. They were touched by the overlapping steep peaks surrounding the place, and the crystal clear stream coming out of the mouth of the Yinping Mountain. Deer drank water from the stream, and the place was given the name Qingxi, also known as Deer City. At first, Hakka people opened up wasteland in the remote mountainous regions where they lived in thatched shacks. Later, they gradually moved to plain areas down the hills. Struggling with nature for hundreds of years, they survived and multiplied until today. 30 years of construction and development after reform and opening-up rapidly transformed Qingxi from a remote village based on agriculture into a modern industrialized town. The town has convenient access to traffic, with over of high-grade highway. It has 4 transformer substations of 110 kV supplying 2 billion KW-hours yearly. It has four water works supplying 200,000 tons of water daily. The city boasts modern telecommunication buildings, post offices, public hospitals, schools, cable broadcasting and TV stations, and cultural centers. Recent improvements include Qingxi Forest Park, featuring hiking trails along Qingxi mountain streams up to an 818-meter peak, and Qingxi Culture Park, a mid-town green- space along a stream featuring sports courts, walking paths and footbridges, and carnival rides. Economy Economically, Qingxi has specialized in the electronics industry, particularly in high-tech areas such as the manufacture of computer monitors, motherboards, other computer peripherals, and children's products. According to the town's official website, foreign direct investment currently totals over US $2 billion, with some 800 foreign-funded enterprises investing in the area. Notable brands and factories in the town are LiteON, Kenwood & De'Longhi, Omron, Chicony, Phihong, FoxLink, and Ablelink. As of 2009, Qingxi's GDP amounted to 14.9 billion RMB. Recent additions in the city include several hotels, supermarkets along with many new high-rise apartment buildings.

Lamsa in 1933. It was derived, both Old and New Testaments, from the Syriac Peshitta, the Bible used by the Assyrian Church of the East and other Syriac Christian traditions. Lamsa, following the tradition of his church, claimed that the Aramaic New Testament was written before the Greek version, a view known as Aramaic primacy. This contrasts with the academic consensus that the language of the New Testament was Greek. Lamsa thus claimed his translation was superior to versions based on later Greek manuscripts. While Lamsa's claims are rejected by the academic community his translation remains the best known of Aramaic to English translations of the New Testament.William E.

Lamsa's testament is named on the title page as \\"The Lamsa Bible,\\" and makes the claim that it was directly translated from the \\"original Aramaic sources.\\" He holds that the Peshitta is .. Textual differences between Peshitta and Greek manuscripts Some places in Lamsa's translation differ from the Greek texts used as the basis of other English-language Bibles. =Matthew 27:46= An example is found in Matthew , where Lamsa has \\"My God, my God, for this I was spared!\\" where the Greek text has \\"My God, my God why have you forsaken me.\\" > And about the ninth hour > Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, > Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? > that is to say, > My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? This is rendered in Lamsa's translation: > And about the ninth hour, > Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, > Eli, Eli lemana shabakthan! > My God, my God, for this I was spared! Though in fact the Peshitta does not have four lines in this verse. The 1905 United Bible Societies edition by George Gwilliam of the Peshitta in Syriac contains only three lines, the Aramaic \\"Eli, Eli,.. \\" (‹ê‹ù‹† ‹ê‹ù‹†) etc. not being given twice: > This verse in Greek manuscripts states that from the Cross, Jesus (quoting > Psalm 22:1) cried out, 'My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?'

He was one of the sons of Robert Wood Johnson I, the co- founder of Johnson & Johnson. He turned the family business into one of the world's largest healthcare corporations. Early life Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on April 4, 1893. His father was Robert Wood Johnson I, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, and his mother was Evangeline Brewster Armstrong Johnson. Johnson grew up with three siblings: Roberta Johnson, John Seward Johnson I, and Evangeline Johnson. When he was sixteen, their father died, leaving him an estate of $2,000,000. He attended the prestigious Rutgers Preparatory School before dropping out to start working full-time at Johnson & Johnson. This gave him an insight into the workings of the company for the rest of his life. Career Johnson became vice president at J&J; in 1918. Johnson also had an abiding interest in politics, and served a term as the mayor of Highland Park, New Jersey from 1920 to 1922. He was elected president of Johnson & Johnson from 1932‚Äì1938, and became chairman of the board of J&J; in 1938. Johnson also held a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II, Johnson's work in identifying products needed by the war effort resulted in the Permacell division of J&J; inventing duct tape for sealing ammunition boxes. J&J; plant managers simply took their existing cloth medical adhesive tape, added a waterproof plastic layer with a more aggressive adhesive, and produced it in olive drab (OD) green to match the ammunition cans. During the war, J&J; would become a major supplier for combat first aid kits and other military supplies. In 1941, Johnson started the Ethicon subsidiary. In 1942, Johnson's reserve Army commission was activated, and he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and assigned to the Ordnance Department. That same year he was nominated by the Roosevelt administration to be vice-chairman of the board of the War Plants Corporation (WPC). When the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) was established as a division of the WPC in June 1942, Johnson was named chairman of the board of the SWPC., which regulated wartime production of military goods and defense items in smaller defense plants and businesses (500 or fewer employees) dispersed throughout the U.S. economy. The SWPC made direct loans, encouraged commercial lenders to make credit available to small businesses, and advocated for small businesses with federal agencies and larger corporate enterprises. During his tenure as chairman of the SWPC, Johnson personally oversaw war contracts assigned to more than 6,000 companies. His tenure was a troubled one, and was marked by complaints from small businesses that they were not being awarded a significant portion of the most valuable wartime defense contracts.Heath, Jim F., American War Mobilization and the Use of Small Manufacturers, 1939-1943, Harvard, MA: Harvard College, The Business History Review, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Autumn, 1972), pp. 295-31 During 1943, firms with under 100 employees were awarded 86,000 contracts, about 35% of the total number awarded (241,531), but worth only 3.5% of the total value ($35.3 million) of all contracts awarded by the SWPC. Johnson responded by increasing the number of contracts to small businesses; however, instead of examining each company to determine what contribution each could make to the war effort, the SWPC began distributing contracts as a form of relief to prevent setbacks to small concerns with unused factory plant capacity. As Chairman of the SWPC and an Army general in the Ordnance Branch, Johnson had a tendency to overrule service branch requests for approval for production of specific military armament and ordnance items in favor of competing but less capable designs that could be made more rapidly or with lower material costs, freeing scarce but non-critical materials to small companies so that they could begin the transition to peacetime goods production.Trzaska, Frank, U.S. Fighting Knives of World War II, Chapter VII: M3 Trench Knife, OKCA (May 1996)Cassidy, William L., The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting; , (1997), p. 47Foster, Lawrence G., Robert Wood Johnson: The Gentleman Rebel, (1st ed.), Lillian Press, , (1999), p. 256, 263-264 This infuriated Johnson's military superiors in the War Department, who realized that the diversion of materials to peacetime production meant less factory capacity for new weapons and increased production of war materiel just as victory seemed to be within the grasp of Allied forces. Unfazed, Johnson lost no opportunity in annoying his military superiors, frequently citing his business experience in support of his decisions. Matters came to a head in the fall of 1943, when the entire Michigan regional division of the SWPC resigned in protest over the actions of the parent board, stating that the SWPC was \\"nothing more than a glorified publicity agency\\". Thomas W. Moss, regional director, announced in a press release that the resignations of the entire Michigan regional division board were included in a resolution sent to Johnson on September 29, 1943. Two days later, on October 1, 1943, Johnson resigned his chairmanship of the SWPC, citing ill health as the reason for his sudden departure. Johnson returned to his chairmanship at J&J; in 1943. He was responsible for writing the Johnson & Johnson Credo, a statement of business principles which is carved into the wall of the company's New Jersey headquarters. The Credo states that the company's first responsibility is to ‚Äúthe doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and all others who use our products‚Äù, and also sets out responsibilities to customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, communities and stockholders. In 1962, Johnson, as chairman of the board of J&J;, fired his nephew, John Seward Johnson II. In 1965, he fired his own son, Robert Wood Johnson III. Personal life In 1916, Johnson married Elizabeth Dixon Ross. They had one child: Robert Wood Johnson III. Their marriage lasted until 1928, when they began a two-year trial separation, ending in divorce. In 1930, Johnson married Margaret (Maggi) Shea. They divorced in 1943 after Bob met Evelyn Vernon. Maggi and Bob loved each other, but Maggi, a wise and kind woman who understood Bob's adulterous personality, did not want to hold him back from any new happiness. In 1944, Johnson married Evelyn Vernon (n√©e Paynter), a former ballet dancer and a dance instructor who, like Johnson, was married when they met. This caused great difficulties, particularly for Evelyn, who came from a very upright middle-class background and was a strict Roman Catholic. Nevertheless, both divorced their spouses, and they married; Johnson's connections kept the matter out of the gossip columns. Johnson bought her clothes, jewels and a Rolls-Royce which sat outside Claridges in London. If she went out walking, the Rolls-Royce would follow her, until she tired and wanted to get in to rest her feet. In latter years, Evelyn and Bob's union was blessed by the Catholic Church. This was arranged by Father Martin D'Arcy, a Jesuit at Farm Street Church in Mayfair, London. On his deathbed in 1968, Johnson would admit nobody to see him except \\"his Evie\\", who stayed by his bed and to whom he was devoted. In 1928, Johnson had taken up residence at Morven in Princeton, New Jersey, the historic home of the Stockton family. It was converted into the New Jersey Governor's mansion after Johnson's lease on the property ended in 1945. In 1946, Evie Johnson had an idea for a new showcase mansion in Princeton, and built 'Longleat' on sprawling grounds entered through grand gates with a one-mile drive up to the house. Evie was a bit of a social climber and had met the Marquess of Bath, who owned the Longleat \\"stately home\\" in Wiltshire, England, from which she borrowed the name. Johnson died in 1968 at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City; he left the bulk of his $400,000,000 estate to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. His children already had been provided for, in a series of trusts. Johnson was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in North Brunswick, New Jersey.Johnson, Robert Wood, Jr., The Political Graveyard. Accessed August 16, 2007, Wednesday. Recognition In 2008, Johnson was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

It currently runs for from Dorchester, South Carolina, at U.S. Highway 78 to Rosman, North Carolina, at U.S. Highway 64. It passes through the states of South Carolina and North Carolina. It goes through the cities of Pickens, Anderson, North, Orangeburg, Harleyville, South Carolina and Bowman, South Carolina. Route description US 178 has a length of in North Carolina and spans in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System from I-85 near Anderson to US 378 in Saluda. US 178 begins at an intersection with US 64 just west of the town of Rosman within Pisgah National Forest in southern Transylvania County, North Carolina. The two-lane road, which is named Pickens Highway, heads east into the town parallel to the French Broad River. US 178 turns south onto Chestnut Street, crosses the river to leave the town, and turns east again to parallel the river. The highway veers away from the mainstem of the French Broad to follow its Middle Fork south then east, then turns south and climbs to the Eastern Continental Divide at Eastatoe Gap between Burnt Mountain and Indian Camp Mountain. US 178 enters Pickens County, South Carolina, and its name changes to Moorefield Memorial Highway shortly after it begins its curvaceous and steep descent along Eastatoe Creek to Rocky Bottom. There, the U.S. Highway meets the western end of F. Van Clayton Memorial Highway, which leads to the highest point in South Carolina, Sassafras Mountain. US 178 crosses another ridge into the valley of Reedy Cove Creek, then climbs again to Beasley Gap between Rich Mountain and Horse Mountain. From there, the highway has a sharp and curvy descent to the valley of the Oolenoy River, which it follows east to near its junction with SC 11 (Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway) at the hamlet of Holly Springs. US 178 curves south at its intersection with SC 288 (Table Rock Road), has a short climb to Mosley Gap between Mosley Mountain and Walnut Cove Mountain, and follows several different creeks through the foothills, which the highway exits as it enters the town of Pickens. The highway expands to four lanes and enters the town on Ann Street and has a very brief concurrency with SC 183 (Main Street) in the center of town; SC 183 connects US 178 with SC 8. US 178 leaves the town along Pendleton Street and drops to two lanes again south of town. The highway passes Pickens County Airport on its way to Liberty. The U.S. Highway, which enters the town along Pickens Drive, intersects SC 93 (Main Street) in the center of the town and has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's Greenville District as it leaves town along Anderson Drive. Just south of the town limits, US 178 has a diamond interchange with US 123 (Calhoun Memorial Highway). US 178 meets the southern end of SC 135 shortly before entering Anderson County, where the highway becomes Liberty Highway and intersects SC 88 (Old Greenville Highway). The highway crosses the Six and Twenty Creek arm of Lake Hartwell and temporarily expands to four lanes around its intersection with US 176 Connector, which feeds into SC 28's western bypass of Anderson, Pearman Dairy Road. US 178 gradually approaches US 76 and SC 28 Business (Clemson Boulevard) as it enters a commercial area before meeting and joining those highways at an oblique intersection. The three highways follow an undivided highway with three southbound lanes, two northbound lanes, and a center turn lane into the city of Anderson, where the road's name changes to Main Street and passes to the east of the Civic Center of Anderson. South of Anderson Mall, SC 28 Business continues on Main Street while US 178 and US 76 veer onto four-lane North Avenue, which parallels Main Street on the west. Shortly after North Avenue splits into one-way carriageways split by a wide parked median, the avenue veers east toward Main Street and the U.S. Highways continue along Club Drive and Park Drive, which have several sports field in their wide median. US 178 and US 76 enter downtown Anderson along four-lane Murray Avenue, which runs one block to the west of Main Street. US 178 is signed north-south in North Carolina and east-west in South Carolina; which is why it is listed as having a northern and eastern terminus. Future NCDOT plans to modernize a section of US 178, between Rosman and the South Carolina state line. The project includes widening lanes to , from the current , adjust its alignment and add a climbing lane. At an estimated cost of $14.1 million, it is currently unfunded.

While the computer will set aside the appropriate amount of space for the stack frame, it usually does so simply by adjusting the value of the stack pointer, and does not set the memory itself to any new state (typically out of efficiency concerns). Therefore, whatever contents of that memory at the time will appear as initial values of the variables which occupy those addresses. Here's a simple example in C: void count( void ) { int k, i; for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { k = k + 1; } printf(\\"%d\\", k); } The final value of \`k\` is undefined. The answer that it must be 10 assumes that it started at zero, which may or may not be true. Note that in the example, the variable \`i\` is initialized to zero by the first clause of the \`for\` statement. Another example can be when dealing with structs. In the code snippet below, we have a \`struct student\` which contains some variables describing the information about a student. The function \`register_student\` leaks memory because it fails to fully initialize the members of \`struct student new_student\`. If we take a closer look, in the beginning, \`age\`, \`semester\` and \`student_number\` are initialized. But the initialization of the \`first_name\` and \`last_name\` members are incorrect. This is because if the length of \`first_name\` and \`last_name\` character arrays are less than 16 bytes, during the \`strcpy\`, we fail to fully initialize the entire 16 bytes of memory reserved for each of these members. Hence after \`memcpy()\`'ing the resulted struct to \`output\`, we leak some stack memory to the caller. struct student { unsigned int age; unsigned int semester; char first_name[16]; char last_name[16]; unsigned int student_number; }; int register_student(struct student *output, int age, char *first_name, char *last_name) { // If any of these pointers are Null, we fail. if (!output  !first_name  !last_name) { printf(\\"Error! \\"); return -1; } // We make sure the length of the strings are less than 16 bytes (including the null-byte) // in order to avoid overflows if (strlen(first_name) > 15  strlen(last_name) > 15) { printf(\\"first_name and last_name cannot be longer that 16 characters! \\"); return -1; } // Initializing the members struct student new_student; new_student.age = age; new_student.semester = 1; new_student.student_number = get_new_student_number(); strcpy(new_student.first_name, first_name); strcpy(new_student.last_name, last_name); //copying the result to output memcpy(output, &new;_student, sizeof(struct student)); return 0; } In any case, even when a variable is implicitly initialised to a default value like 0, this is typically not the correct value. Initialised does not mean correct if the value is a default one. (However, default initialisation to 0 is a right practice for pointers and arrays of pointers, since it makes them invalid before they are actually initialised to their correct value.) In C, variables with static storage duration that are not initialized explicitly are initialized to zero (or null, for pointers). Section 6.7.8, paragraph 10. Not only are uninitialized variables a frequent cause of bugs, but this kind of bug is particularly serious because it may not be reproducible: for instance, a variable may remain uninitialised only in some branch of the program. In some cases, programs with uninitialized variables may even pass software tests.  Impacts  Uninitialized variables are powerful bugs since they can be exploited to leak arbitrary memory or to achieve arbitrary memory overwrite or to gain code execution, depending on the case. When exploiting a software which utilizes address space layout randomization, it is often required to know the base address of the software in memory. Exploiting an uninitialized variable in a way to force the software to leak a pointer from its address space can be used to bypass ASLR. Use in languages Uninitialized variables are a particular problem in languages such as assembly language, C, and C++, which were designed for systems programming. The development of these languages involved a design philosophy in which conflicts between performance and safety were generally resolved in favor of performance. The programmer was given the burden of being aware of dangerous issues such as uninitialized variables. In other languages, variables are often initialized to known values when created. Examples include: * VHDL initializes all standard variables into special 'U' value. It is used in simulation, for debugging, to let the user to know when the don't care initial values, through the multivalued logic, affect the output. * Java does not have uninitialized variables. Fields of classes and objects that do not have an explicit initializer and elements of arrays are automatically initialized with the default value for their type (false for boolean, 0 for all numerical types, null for all reference types). Local variables in Java must be definitely assigned to before they are accessed, or it is a compile error. *Python initializes local variables to \`NULL\` (distinct from \`None\`) and raises an \`UnboundLocalError\` when such a variable is accessed before being (re)initialized to a valid value. *D initializes all variables unless explicitly specified by the programmer not to. Even in languages where uninitialized variables are allowed, many compilers will attempt to identify the use of uninitialized variables and report them as compile-time errors.

The original full title was A House-Boat on the Styx: Being Some Account of the Divers Doings of the Associated Shades. The novel was first published by Harper Brothers in 1896 with illustrations by Peter Newell (24 plates).Catalog record (New York: Harper, 1896). HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved 2016-08-04. Contents and Illustrations, pp. v-viii, list 12 chapters and 24 plates. The illustrations are not credited but they are clearly signed by Peter Newell, the credited illustrator of the sequels. Plot summary The premise of the book is that everyone who has ever died (up to the time in which the book is set, which seems to be about the time of its publication) has gone to Styx, the river that circles the underworld. The book begins with Charon, ferryman of the Styx being startled--and annoyed--by the arrival of a houseboat on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat's janitor. What follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary thought experiment to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology. In the twelfth chapter the house boat disappears, leading into the sequel, The Pursuit of the House-Boat. Notes A House-Boat on the Styx appears to have no original fictional characters in it. All are borrowed--with varying degrees of licence --from either history or mythology. Throughout the book, there is a running joke that Shakespeare didn't actually write any of his own plays, that they were actually ghostwritten by Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other contemporaries.

A part of the traditional region of Ciociaria, it is known for its megalithic acropolis. History The area of the modern city was settled as early as the 2nd millennium BC. Aletrium was a town of the Hernici which, together with Veroli, Anagni and Ferentino, formed a defensive league against the Volsci and the Samnites around 550 BC. In 530 they allied with Tarquinius Superbus' Rome, confirming the Etruscan influence in the area attested also by archaeological findings. Alatri was defeated by Rome in 306 BC and forced to accept the citizenship. In Cicero's time it was a municipium (an ancient coat of arms can be seen with the write \\"S.P.Q.A.\\"), and continued in this position throughout the imperial period. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city decayed, the only respected authority being represented by the Christian bishop. During the reign of Theodoric the Great (5th century AD) the patrician Liberius promoted the construction of a monastic community, one of the most ancient in the West, where in 528 St. Benedict sojourned briefly. In 543, during the Gothic Wars, Alatri was sacked and destroyed by Totila's troops. The Porta Maggiore. Reconstruction of Etruscan-style temple of Alatri in National Etruscan Museum, Rome. In the 12th century the city became an important stronghold of the popes when they were obliged to leave the then unsafe Rome. In the following century it became a free commune, although under the authority of the bishops and the pope, governed by consuls until 1241, when a podest√† was introduced. In the following centuries it flourished economically and expanded, conquering Collepardo, Guarcino, Trivigliano, Vico and Frosinone, though often hampered by inner strifes. In the 15th century Alatri started to lose its freedom, due to the involvements of Ladislaus of Naples and Pope Martin V. After the short seigniory of Filippo Maria Visconti in 1434, the city had to accept the Papal suzerainty. Struggles with the neighbouring communes continued, and in 1556 it was occupied by Spanish soldiers. During the Roman Republic, it remained loyal to the Pope. During the Napoleonic occupation (1809‚Äì1814) numerous members of the papal administration, as well as bishop Giuseppe della Casa, were deported to France. It became part of Italy in 1870. During World War II it suffered heavy destructions and human victims. Main sights =Ancient remains= Alatri has well-preserved fortifications constructed of tetrahedral and polygonal blocks of local limestone well jointed. It is almost entirely an embanking wall, as is the rule in the cities of this part of Italy, with a maximum height, probably, of about . Two of the gates (of the perhaps five once existing) are still to some extent preserved, and three posterns are to be found. In the centre of the city rises a hill which was adopted as the citadel. Remains of the fortifications of three successive periods can be traced, of which the last, perhaps a little more recent than that of the city wall, is the best preserved. In the first two periods the construction is rough, while in the third the blocks are very well jointed, and the faces smoothed; they are mostly polygonal in form and are much larger (the maximum about 3 by 2 m) than those of the city wall. A flat surface was formed partly by smoothing off the rock and partly by the erection of huge terrace walls which rise to a height of over , enclosing a roughly rectangular area of . Two approaches to the citadel were constructed, both passing through the wall; the openings of both are rectangular. The architrave of the larger, known as Porta Maggiore, measures about in length, in height, in thickness; while that of the smaller is decorated with three phalli in relief. Later, though probably in ancient times, a ramp was added on the northern side. In the centre of the arx was a building on the site of the present cathedral, of which only a small portion is preserved. Remains of a high-pressure aqueduct, which supplied the town with water and was constructed with other public buildings by L. Betilienus Varus, may still be traced. A temple was excavated in 1889 a few miles to the north of the town, and many fragments of the painted terracottas with which it was decorated were found.

It is a medium-sized, intelligent, short- haired dog, of a solid build, whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of in height and in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size. Males normally are about 18‚Äì21 inches (45‚Äì53 cm) in height and around 35‚Äì60 pounds (15‚Äì27 kg) in weight. Females are normally around 17‚Äì20 inches (43‚Äì50 cm) in height and 30‚Äì50 pounds (13‚Äì22 kg) in weight. According to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is prescribed to be medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears are to be small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Many colors, color patterns, and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA, except that both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo. Despite the colloquial use of the term \\"pit bull\\" to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of the term to include several breeds in legislation, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true \\"pit bull\\" and the only breed that should be denominated as such. Twelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull‚Äìtype dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. The breed is banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.  History  A bull and terrier type. Paris, 1863. \\"Watchful- Waiting\\". World War I poster featuring a pit bull as a representation of the U.S Until the mid-19th century the now extinct Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs were bred together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. This type of dog, which was bred in the British Isles, became known as the bull and terrier. They arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth century where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting and bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 when Britain introduced animal welfare laws. Since dog fightings are cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain. These dogs arrived in America around 1845 to 1860, where the dog fighting practice had continuity and a new American dog breed arrived. On February 10, 1898, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) named as American Pit Bull Terrier. For some time in the early part of the 20th century the UKC began to register the breed name with the word \\"pit\\" in parentheses (American (Pit) Bull Terrier), to facilitate public acceptance as American Bull Terrier. But this lasted a short time and returned to the previous form. In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt hogs, and drive livestock, and as family companions. But the dog fighting remained the main use of the breed until 1976 when it was outlawed in all states. Pit Bull Terriers successfully fill the role of companion dogs, working dogs, athletic sport dogs (Weight pulling, French Ring Sport, Top Dog), and police dogs, and therapy dog. Pit Bull Terriers also constitute the majority of dogs used for illegal dog fighting in America In addition, law enforcement organizations report these dogs are used for other nefarious purposes, such as guarding illegal narcotics operations, use against police, and as attack dogs. In an effort to counter the fighting reputation of pit bull‚Äìtype dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers \\"St. Francis Terriers\\", hoping that people would be more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as \\"New Yorkies\\", but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.  Temperament  The UKC gives this description of the characteristic of the American Pit Bull dog: \\"The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of [inter]dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed's natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work. A buckskin female black nose American Pit Bull Terrier The standard imposed by the ADBA and Old Family Red Nose Registry ( OFRNR) considers the human aggression a disqualification factor. The American Preservation Dog Registry (APDR) standard points out that \\"the temperament MUST be totally reliable with people\\". Red nose female In September 2000, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study that examined dog- bite‚Äìrelated fatalities (human death caused by dog-bite injuries) to \\"summarize breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks during a 20-year period and to assess policy implications.\\" The study examined 238 fatalities between 1979 and 1998 in which the breed of dog was known. It found that \\"the data indicates that Rottweilers and pit bull‚Äìtype dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF [dog bite-related fatality] in the United States between 1979 and 1998\\" and that it was \\"extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.\\" However, the article continued, saying that care should be taken in drawing conclusions based on these data because: * first, the study likely covered only about 74% of actual DBRF cases; * second, records of DBRF may have been biased by the propensity of media to report attacks by certain breeds over others; * third, it is not always straightforward to identify a dog's breed, and records may be biased towards reporting \\"known\\" aggressive breeds; and * fourth, it was not clear how to count mixed breeds. * Sleeping Pitbull Terrierfifth, such breeds have traditionally been used in dogfighting at a far higher percentage than others. The authors concluded by noting that \\"breeds responsible for human DBRF have varied over time\\" (for example, Great Danes caused the most reported DBRF between 1979 and 1980). In the face of this inconclusive data, the study authors recommended that breed should not be the \\"primary factor driving public policy\\", instead making the following policy recommendations: \\"adequate funding for animal control agencies, enforcement of existing animal control laws, and educational and policy strategies to reduce inappropriate dog and owner behaviors\\" as likely to be beneficial and specifically to decrease the occurrence of dog bites. In a peer-reviewed literature review of 66 dog-bite risk studies, the American Veterinary Medical Association determined that \\"breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites. Controlled studies reveal no increased risk for the group blamed most often for dog bites, ‚Äòpit bull‚Äìtype‚Äô dogs. Accordingly, targeting this breed or any other as a basis for dog-bite prevention is unfounded.\\" As stated by the National Animal Control Association: \\"Dangerous and/or vicious animals should be labeled as such as a result of their actions or behavior and not because of their breed.\\" In 2014, new statistical evidence emerged regarding the province-wide ban on \\"pit bulls\\", more specifically the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier, in the Canadian province of Ontario. Since the ban had been implemented, dog bites involving pit bull types had dropped considerably as their populations decreased in the province's largest city Toronto,Jonathan Kay, \\"Vindication for Ontario's pit bull ban\\", The National Post, October 6, 2014 yet overall dog bites hit their highest levels this century in 2013 and 2014. Statistical evidence published in Global News implicates several other dog breeds had contributed to the rise, stating that \\"Toronto's reported dog bites have been rising since 2012, and in 2013 and 2014 reached their highest levels this century, even as pit bulls and similar dogs neared local extinction.\\"  Health  American Pit Bull Terrier standing. The breed tends to have a higher than average incidence of hip dysplasia. Culling for performance has helped eliminate this problem and others such as patella problems, thyroid dysfunction and congenital heart defects. American Pit Bull Terriers with dilute coat colors have not had a higher occurrence of skin allergies as other breeds. As a breed they are more susceptible to parvovirus than others if not vaccinated, especially as puppies, so vaccination is imperative beginning at 39 days old and continuing every 2 weeks until 4 months old. Then again at 8 months. Once a year after that, as recommend for all breeds. They are very prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two different types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A simple skin scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, Ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.  Strains  The APBT has several bloodlines (strains), many originated in \\"professional\\" dog fighting throughout the 20th century, and others developed for the conformation shows of the United Kennel Club at the 80s. = Colby pit bulls = Pincher, a great-grandson of the famous Lloyd's Pilot. Weight 56 pounds. US, 1896. The Colby dogs are an ancient black-nosed bloodline that served as one of the pillars of the APBT breed. Considered one of the most important and one of the most famous bloodlines the Colby dogs were started by John Pritchard Colby in 1889, who acquired the best fighting dogs (bull and terriers) imported from Ireland and England. One of the most famous dogs of his bloodline was Colby's Pincher. Pincher was known as an invincible fighting dog and was widely used as a stud dog. For this reason Pincher is present in the pedigree of the vast majority of APBT specimens. Today, the Colby dogs bloodline remains preserved by the family of John P. Colby. = Old Family Red Nose = Old Family Red Nose (OFRN) is an old strain or a family of bloodlines originating in Ireland, and known for their specific and unique reddish coloration. Many dogs of the OFRN strain has a copper-red nose and coat, red lips, red toe nails, and red or amber eyes.Red Nose History, The Encyclopedia of the American Pit Bull Terrier But not every American Pit Bull Terrier with these characteristics is necessarily an OFRN, since for this the dog must have a high percentage of the recognized bloodlines of this family in its pedigree.A regular male red nose Pitbull (APBT), not OFRN dog.In the middle of the 19th century, there was a strain of pit dogs in Ireland that were known as \\"Old Family.\\" At that time, all the bloodlines were closely inbred with each family clan. Since red is recessive to all colors but white, the strain was known as \\"Irish Old Family Reds.\\" When the dogs began coming to America, they were already showing the red nose. The \\"Old Family Reds\\" dogs found their way to America in the 19th century mainly via Irish immigrants though many in the United States did import the breed. Many strains have been crossed with the Old Family Reds at some time in their existence. Consequently, nearly any strain will occasionally throw a red-nosed pup. This means that not every red-nose dog is a true OFRN. The Old Family Reds produced more than their share of good ones unlike other strains are known. Old Family Reds were sought after for their high percentage in ability to produce deep gameness. The strain in its purest form continues to be preserved by remaining breeders specializing in this bloodline. It was once renowned for its gameness, but now it is bred to maintain its unique reddish color. Some of the most reputable breeders of the past, such as Lightner, McClintock, Hemphill, Williams, Menefee, Norrod and Wallace have contributed to the preservation and development of the strain. Finally, as McNolty said in his 30-30 Journal (1967) \\"Regardless of one's historical perspective, these old amber-eyed, red-nosed, red-toe-nailed, red- coated dogs represent some of the most significant pit bull history and tradition that stands on four legs today.\\" = Jeep bloodline = The Jeep bloodline was started by the dog Crenshaw's Jeep, a male black-nosed buckskin APBT bred by James Crenshaw in 1976. Crenshaw's Jeep was considered one of the best fighting dogs of his time and produced a large number of champion dogs.  American Staffordshire Terrier  In 1935 in England a Cradley Heath bull and terrier strain was accepted and registered as a purebred breed by The Kennel Club as Staffordshire Bull Terrier. One year later in America the American Kennel Club (AKC) noted the growing popularity and acceptance of a similar breed already registered years earlier by the United Kennel Club (UKC), the American Pit Bull Terrier. The AKC finally decided to accept to register and recognize the American breed, but would rename the breed with the commitment that the associate breeders would not breed dogs for dogfighting. American Pit Bull Terrier American Staffordshire Terrier American Bull Terrier without the \\"pit\\" (a word that referred to dogfighting arenas) was the first name considered by the AKC, but quickly dismissed due to protests by English Bull Terrier's breeders. Yankee Terrier was another option, also dismissed. The name \\"Staffordshire Terrier\\" was chosen with the claim that the breed originally came from Staffordshire in England. On June 10, 1936, around 50 UKC dogs entered the AKC stud book under the name Staffordshire Terrier. Wilfred Truman Brandon founded the AKC Staffordshire Terrier Club of America (STCA). The Colby dog named Colby's Primo was one of the first to be regarded as an ideal model of the breed standard in the AKC. The AKC stud book was opened a few more times until it was last closed around the 1970s. In 1972 the AKC changed the name of the breed to American Staffordshire Terrier as it already intended to recognize the British Staffordshire Bull Terrier as a separate breed in subsequent years. Today a discussion persists whether the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier are two separate breeds or still the same breed. The fact is that Pit Bull and AmStaff breeders have distanced themselves from each other by pursuing different goals over than 30 years, producing dogs with physical and temperament differences. Since 2015, the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), which has registered the American Pit Bull Terrier since 1909, considers the American Staffordshire Terrier to be a different separated breed. The UKC is the only kennel club at the moment to accept to register American Staffordshire Terriers as American Pit Bull Terriers.UKC Application for American Pit Bull Terrier Single Registration United Kennel Club. The UKC conformation champions are very similar to those of the AKC, as both clubs share many judges. The AKC has not accepted to register American Pit Bull Terrier as American Staffordshire Terriers since the late 20th century. To this day there are dogs called dual registered, dogs registered at the same time as American Staffordshire Terrier in the AKC and American Pit Bull Terrier in the UKC, due to past breeders who decided to keep the two pedigree registers parallel. Since 2015 the ADBA classifies most (or all) of these dual registered (AKC-UKC) dogs as American Staffordshire Terriers. The ADBA conformation champion dogs differ greatly from UKC and AKC champion dogs. The AKC standard does not accept red nose dogs. The UKC dogs and the AmStaff are generally heavier and more robust and bulky than the ADBA American Pit Bull Terrier dogs.  Activities  American Pit Bull Terrier overcoming an obstacle at a dog sport event American Pit Bull Terriers excel in many dog sports, including weight pulling, dog agility, flyball, lure coursing, and advanced obedience competition. Out of the 115 dogs who have earned UKC \\"superdog\\" status (by gaining championship titles in conformation, obedience, agility, and weightpull), 34 have been American Pit Bull Terriers, and another 13 were American Staffordshire Terriers. The American Pit Bull Terrier is a working dog, and is suitable for a wide range of working disciplines due to their intelligence, high energy, and endurance. In the United States they have been used as search and rescue dogs, police dogs performing narcotics and explosives detection, Border Patrol dogs, hearing dogs to provide services to the deaf, as well as general service dogs. In the South they are often a favorite dog for catching feral pigs.  Law  Young APBT Australia, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, the territory of Puerto Rico, Singapore,AVA.gov.sg Venezuela Trinidad and Tobago Denmark, Israel, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Switzerland have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull‚Äìtype dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions on import and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. Certain states and cities in the United States have banned ownership of the American Pit Bull Terrier, as well as the province of Ontario in Canada. American Pit Bull Terriers are regulated in the United Kingdom.

Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474 (1827). river, stream, pond or source of groundwater. In areas with plentiful water and few users, such systems are generally not complicated or contentious. In other areas, especially arid areas where irrigation is practiced, such systems are often the source of conflict, both legal and physical. Some systems treat surface water and ground water in the same manner, while others use different principles for each. Types of water right Understanding ‚ÄòWater Rights‚Äô first requires consideration of the context and origin of the ‚Äòright‚Äô being discussed, or asserted. Traditionally, a water rights refers to the utilization of water as an element supporting basic human needs like drinking or irrigation. Water Rights could also include the physical occupancy of waterways for purposes of travel, commerce and even recreational pursuits. The legal principles and doctrines that forms the basis of each type of water rights are not interchangeable and vary according to local and national laws. Therefore, variations among countries, and within national subdivisions, exist in discussing and acknowledging these rights. =The Right to the Utilization of Water as an Element= Water Rights based on ownership of the land Often, water rights are based on ownership of the land upon which the water rests or flows. Under English Common law, any rights asserted to 'moveable and wandering' water must be based upon rights to the 'permanent and immovable' land below.Blackstone Commentaries Vol.2, p.18; 3 Kent's Comm. p. 428, et seq. {ninth Report}; Carter v Murcot 4 Burr. 2126 (All Rights \\"accrue by reason of possession of the ground upon which water lies\\") On streams and rivers these are referred to as riparian rights, or littoral rights, which are protected by property law. Legal principles long recognized under Riparian principles, involve the right to remove the water ‚Äì for drinking or irrigation- or to add more water into the channel ‚Äì for drainage or effluence. Under riparian law, rights the water is subject to the test of ‚Äòreasonable use‚Äô. The judiciary has defined ‚Äòreasonable use‚Äô principle as follows: ‚Äúthe true test of the principle and extent of the use is, whether it is to the injury of the other proprietors or not.‚ÄùTyler v. Wilkinson, 4 Mason 397 - 1827, and cited in PPL MONTANA v. MONTANA, 132 S.Ct. 1215 (2012)  Water Rights Based on Previous Use or Prior Appropriation  Where water is more scarce (like in the Western United States), allocation of the flowing water is premised upon prior appropriation. ‚ÄúThe appropriation doctrine confers upon one who actually diverts and uses water the right to continue to do so provided that the water is used for reasonable and beneficial uses,‚Äù regardless of whether that person owns land contiguous to the watercourse.United States v. State Water Res. Control Bd., 182 Cal.App.3d 82 (1986) \\"[A]s between appropriators, the rule of priority is 'first in time, first in right.'\\"United States v. State Water Res. Control Bd., 182 Cal.App.3d 82 (1986) (citing Irwin v. Phillips, 5 Cal. 140, 147 (1855)). The modern system of prior appropriation water rights is characterized by five principles: # Exclusive right is given to the original appropriator, and all following privileges are conditional upon precedent rights. # All privileges are conditional upon beneficial use. # Water may be used on riparian lands or non-riparian lands (i.e. water may be used on the land next to the water source, or on land removed from the water source) # Diversion is permitted, regardless of the shrinkage of the river or stream. # The privilege may be lost through non-use. Beneficial use is defined as agricultural, industrial, or urban use. Environmental uses, such as maintaining a body of water and the wildlife that use it, were not initially regarded as beneficial uses in some states but have been accepted in some areas.Western States Water Laws Western States Instream Flow Summary. Every water right is parameterized by an annual yield and an appropriation date. When a water right is sold, it maintains its original appropriation date.  Community-based allocation of water  In some jurisdictions appropriative water rights can be granted directly to communities. Here, water is reserved to provide sufficient capacity for the future growth of that particular community. For example, California provides communities and other water users within watersheds senior status over appropriative (use-based) water rights solely because they are located where the water originates and naturally flows. A second example of community-based water rights is pueblo water rights. As recognized by California, pueblo water rights are grants to individual settlements (i.e. pueblos) over all streams and rivers flowing through the city and to all groundwater aquifers underlying that particular city. The pueblo's claim expands with the needs of the city and may be used to supply the needs of areas that are later annexed to the city.City of Los Angeles v. Pomeroy, 124 Cal. 597, 640-41 (1899)Hooker v. City of Los Angeles, 188 U.S. 314, 319-320 (1903)City of Los Angeles v. City of San Fernando, 14 Cal.3d 199 (Cal 1978) While California recognizes pueblo water rights, pueblo water rights are controversial. Some modern scholars and courts argue that the pueblo water rights doctrine lacks a historical basis in Spanish or Mexican water law.  Right to Clean Water  Due to the dependence upon clean water, many nations, states and municipalities have enacted regulations to preemptively protect water quality and quantity. This right of a Government to regulate water quality is premised upon protecting downstream navigable waters from contamination which are publicly owned and include the right to receive these waters undiminished under both the riparian and appropriation doctrines.Clean Water Act =The Right to Access and Physically Occupy Water= The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate and occupy Navigable Waters; this is referred to as a Navigable Servitude. The US Congress has exercised this power in a variety of ways, including the construction of dams, diverting water from a stream and blocking and restricting use of waterways. The servitude is a Federal power, not an individual right. Public Trust Rights to access and recreate upon navigable- in-fact waters may also exist. These rights are often based on local laws over property held in trust for the public. In the United States, each States holds the land submerged by navigable waters in trust for the public and can establish a public right to access or recreate within these public waterways. Again, this 'water right' is not an individual right, but rather a public right and individual privilege which may include restrictions and limitations based on local laws. The Fifth and Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution limits the power of state or federal governments to impinge upon any exclusive use of water by prohibiting the enactment of any laws or regulations that amount to a \\"taking\\" of private property. Laws and regulations that deprive a riparian owner of legally cognizable water rights constitute an illegal governmental taking of private property for which just compensation is owed to the water right holder.Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 US 164 - Supreme Court 1979 Finnish water rights In Finland, waterbodies are generally privately owned, but Finland also applies the Roman law principle of aqua profluens (flowing water), according to which the freely flowing water in waterbodies cannot be owned or possessed. This means that the owners of waterbodies cannot prohibit diversion of water for agricultural, industrial, municipal, or domestic use according to the provisions of the Finnish Water Law.Available online only in Finnish; available in English from email address listed here There also exists public easement over rivers. History of water rights In Roman times, the law was that people could obtain temporary usufructuary rights for running water. These rights were independent of land ownership, and lasted as long as use continued. Under Roman law, no land was \\"owned\\" by citizens, it was all owned by the \\"republic\\" and controlled by politicians. Under English common law all tidal waters were held by the crown and all freshwater streams were included with title to the lands, with full accompanying rights. However, under the riparian doctrine, Landowners had the right to receive water undiminished by upstream landowners. Over time, rights evolved from being strictly land-based to also include use based, allowing non-landowners to hold enforceable rights to receive clean water. A reasonable use rule evolved in some countries. See also * California State Water Resources Control Board * Clean Water Report * Colorado River Water Conservation District v.

She was a popular radio personality in China with a call-in program named \\"Words on the Night Breeze\\" from 1989 to 1997. The program focused on women's issues and life stories. She was well known for travelling extensively in China to interview women for her work. In 1997, she moved to London and began writing stories of the women she met along her journeys. Her first book, The Good Women of China, was published in 2002, becoming an international bestseller. She frequently contributes to The Guardian and the BBC. Education First Military University of People's Liberation Army, 1983‚Äì1987; English and International Relations Personal life Xinran was born into a wealthy and privileged family on 19 July 1958. She was raised by her grandparents due to her parents' imprisonment during China's cultural revolution. She has said that her first memory was of the Red Guards setting her home on fire when she was 6 years old. Xinran was married, while working as an army administrator, and has one son, Panpan, who was born in 1988. She later divorced.Societies, Networks, and Transitions, Volume 3 By Craig A. Lockard (Wadsworth, 2008) She moved to London in 1997 and married British literary agent Toby Eady (son of Mary Wesley) in 2002. Books In London, she began work on her seminal book about Chinese women's lives The Good Women of China, a memoir relating many of the stories she heard while hosting her radio show (\\"Words on the Night Breeze\\") in China. The book is a candid revelation of many Chinese women's thoughts and experiences that took place both during and after the Cultural Revolution when Chairman Mao and Communism ruled the land. The book was published in 2002 and has been translated into over thirty languages. Sky Burial, her second book, was published in 2004. This is the story of Shu Wen, whose husband, only a few months after their marriage in the 1950s, joined the Chinese army and was sent to Tibet for the purpose of unification of the two cultures. A collection of Xinran‚Äôs Guardian columns from 2003 to 2005, What the Chinese Don't Eat, was published in 2006. It covers a vast range of topics from food to sex education, and from the experiences of British mothers who have adopted Chinese daughters, to whether Chinese people do Christmas shopping or have swimming pools. Xinran‚Äòs first novel Miss Chopsticks was published in July 2007. It explores the uneasy relationship between Chinese \\"migrant workers\\" and the cities they flock to. China's economic reform is changing the role of its chopstick girls. Once a disposable burden, they can now take city jobs as waitresses, masseuses, factory line workers and cleaners, They bring bundles of cash home, earning them unprecedented respect in patriarchal villages, as well as winning the respect and hearts of city dwellers. Xinran‚Äôs fifth book, China Witness: Voices from a Silent Generation was published in the UK in October 2008. It is based on twenty years worth of interviews conducted by Xinran with the last two generations in China. She hopes it will, ‚Äòrestore a real modern history of China, from real people after most historical evidence was destroyed in the Culture Revolution‚Äô . She followed this in February 2010, with the publication of Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother, a collection of heartbreaking stories from Chinese mothers who have lost or had to abandon children. In 2015 she published Buy Me the Sky, which contains stories of the children brought up under China's One- child policy and the effect that has had on their lives, families and ability to deal with life's challenges. Her most recent book,'The Promise: Tales of Love and Loss in Modern China, was published by I.B.Tauris/Bloomsbury in 2019. Kirkus Reviews called it a 'graceful work that restores a lost generation to history' and Robert O'Brien in the Tablet said, 'As our curiosity about the Chinese grows, she will surely become essential reading'. Other In August 2004 Xinran set up ‚ÄòThe Mothers‚Äô Bridge of Love‚Äô (MBL). MBL reaches out to Chinese children in all corners of the world; by creating a bridge of understanding between China and the West and between adoptive culture and birth culture, MBL ultimately wants to help bridge the huge poverty gap which still exists in many parts of China. The MBL book for adoptive families, Mother's Bridge of Love, came third in TIME magazine‚Äôs list of the top ten children‚Äôs books of 2007. Xinran often advises western media (including BBC and Sky) about western relations with China, and makes frequent television and radio appearances.

Early years Yusuf Lule was born on 10 April 1912 in Kampala.\\"Lule, K. Yusufu\\", Africa Who's Who, London: Africa Journal for Africa Books Ltd, 1981, p. 636. He was educated at King's College Budo (1929‚Äì34), Makerere University College, Kampala (1934‚Äì36), Fort Hare University at Alice, South Africa (1936‚Äì39) and the University of Edinburgh. He was initially a Muslim but later converted to Christianity while at King's College Budo.https://allafrica.com/stories/201201130085.html In 1947 Lule married Hannah Namuli Wamala at Kings College Budo's church, where he was a teacher and she was head girl. He was principal of Makerere University College from 1964 to 1970, and was assistant secretary-general of the Association of African Universities, in Accra, Ghana, between 1973 and 1978. Lule served as a minister in the pre-independence British colonial government and later as an assistant secretary-general of the Commonwealth Secretariat. He went into exile after Idi Amin came to power.  Chairman of the Uganda National Liberation Front  Following the outbreak of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, Ugandan rebels and exiles began making preparations for the establishment of a new government to follow Idi Amin's regime. After the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) had captured substantial territory, President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania ordered it to halt to give time for the Ugandan rebels to convene and reorganise. The Ugandan rebels made due preparations, primarily led by former president Milton Obote and leftist intellectual Dani Wadada Nabudere in their own respective circles. As the Tanzanians began organising a conference for the rebels and exiles, Nyerere was reconsidering Obote's role in the movement. He did not want to give the impression that Tanzania was going to install a government of its own choice in Uganda by facilitating Obote's assumption of leadership of the rebel movement, and there was hostility to Obote from the Baganda people in southern Uganda as well as other countries such as Kenya. Nyerere also feared that Obote would stifle cooperation at the meeting and cause it to break up without success. He ultimately convinced Obote to refrain from attending. In place of Obote, many Ugandan exiles began favouring Lule, who was a Muganda and had the reputation of being a political moderate as well as a civil servant who was not tarnished by scandal or corrupt service in a past Ugandan regime. The Moshi Conference opened on 24 March 1979 in the Tanzanian town of Moshi, following an intense debate over which factions and persons could be admitted. That afternoon the delegates announced the formation of the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF), which was to be governed by a 30-strong National Consultative Committee (NCC) and an 11-strong National Executive Committee, the latter including three special commissions‚ÄîFinance and Administration, Political and Diplomatic Affairs, and Military Affairs. The next two days were spent debating the balance of power among the governing bodies and the selection of a chairman for the organisation, which was hotly contested between Lule and Paulo Muwanga, an Obote supporter. After heated argument a consensus was reached whereby Lule would be given the chair and Muwanga would be made head of the Military Affairs Commission. President of Uganda = Inauguration = Caught unprepared by the fall of Kampala, Lule hurriedly compiled a list of ministers meant to represent the ethnic balances of Uganda's population. On 12 April 1979 Lule and his cabinet boarded a flight from Dar es Salaam to Entebbe to fly in for his inauguration. While the plane was stopped in Mwanza, Tanzanian officials decided to delay it there until they could ensure better security for a ceremony in Kampala. The next day Lule and his ministers reached Entebbe and were brought into Kampala in a TPDF motorcade in the late afternoon. Lule was then sworn-in as President of Uganda in front of the Parliament building and gave a brief speech pledging to bring a return of law and order. Lule concluded by saying in Luganda, \\"Now it is our turn.\\" Still feeling that Kampala was unsafe, Tanzanian officials quickly took Lule from Parliament and installed him in the Entebbe State House. = Tenure = Lule assumed office at a time when Uganda's national institutions were dysfunctional and the country was plagued by lawlessness and violence; he presided over a failed state. Lule disregarded the Moshi Conference agreements stipulating a weak presidential authority and attempted to assert his ability to operate under stronger powers provided by the constitution operative in Uganda before Amin's coup. Within days of assuming office Lule and his advisers began taking major decisions without consulting the NCC. He also snubbed the committee members by first missing their formal inauguration and, when the ceremony was rescheduled so he could be present, he gave a speech and departed before swearing them in, much to their displeasure. Lule then appointed ministers and deputy ministers to his cabinet without the NCC's approval. The members of the cabinet joined the NCC ex officio, and he ultimately appointed 24 ministers and 20 deputies, which then outnumbered the original councilors. Despite complaints from the NCC, Lule carried on making appointments and revising the structure of his cabinet. He also declared a reorganization of Ugandan's administration, dividing the country into four regions each subject to the authority of a regional commissioner. Lule further infuriated the NCC when his cabinet awarded its own members $5,000 worth of foreign exchange as a \\"rehabilitation allowance\\" despite the treasury having very little money. Lule responded to the councilors' anger by offering them the same allowance, which they rejected. He also distrusted the UNLA, which he considered to be made up of loyal Obote and Museveni partisans. Lule's government withheld money to the army for this reason, and it played no role in overseeing the defeat of the remnants of Amin's forces. He planned on disbanding the UNLA and replacing it with a new \\"National Army\\", which angered the leaders of the former. The army was to be proportionately representative of all of Uganda's regions and stipulate education requirements for applicants. Lule secured a ¬£100 million aid programme from Western countries, alienating leftists who feared he would sellout the county to international business interests. His government's efforts to stifle inflation and curb the black market were minimal and unsuccessful, and during his tenure the economic situation of Ugandan continued its decline from Amin's rule. Many Baganda were elated by Lule's elevation to the presidency, hoping that he would preserve the Buganda region's interests and keep Obote from returning to power. Lule ultimately did take measures that pleased the Baganda, such as restoring administrative unity to Buganda, conferring more powers upon Buganda's government, frequently delivering public statements in Luganda, appointing prominent Baganda monarchists to high office, and granting some state contracts to Baganda businessmen. In redistributing properties and enterprises seized from Amin's associates, Lule's government allocated a disproportionate amount to Baganda and his close associates. Members of other ethnic groups in Uganda did not trust Lule or accord him much respect, since they felt he would promote Buganda at other regions' expense. Some Ugandans feared that his army plan would lead to the creation of a force dominated by Baganda, since Buganda had a larger population than any other region in the country. His critics denounced him as a \\"monarchist\\" and a \\"feudalist\\". = Demise and removal from office = Lule's handling of his cabinet provoked outrage in the NCC, especially when he dismissed Muwanga from office. President Nyerere of Tanzania informed Lule that Tanzania would uphold the agreements regarding powers among Ugandan authorities made at Moshi. Lule felt that Tanzania afforded key support to his political opponents, and thus sought to reduce its influence in the country by deprecating the standing of the TPDF, which remained after the elimination of Amin's forces to provide order. He encouraged Ugandan publications to criticise the Tanzanian army, angering some Ugandan circles and the UNLA which thought it was unfair to attack the army which had \\"liberated\\" the country. On 8 June disgruntled members of the NCC convened in Kampala and passed a resolution demanding Lule present all of his political appointments to the committee for review. Lule did not respond, so on 12 June the NCC reconvened and declared that he had seven days to comply with their demands. The President once again failed to reply, so on the afternoon of 19 June the NCC met at the Entebbe State House in Lule's presence. NCC Chairman Edward Rugumayo opened the meeting by reviewing the body's unsuccessful entreaties to the President to submit his appointments for its ratification. Lule responded by stating that he was not prepared to take a stance involving such \\"important constitutional matters\\" by agreeing to submit the appointments to the NCC. He also said that his cabinet appointments were publicly known and that the committee could \\"treat the appointments as you wish\\". Lule's statement was followed by hours of debate by the NCC concerning the division of powers agreed upon in Moshi. Later, Lule rose to say that he had not contravened the agreements made in Moshi and said that he had not received key directives supposedly dispatched to him from the NCC. Rugumayo retorted that the communications in question had been personally given to the President's secretary. Shortly after the exchange councilor Paulo Wangoola rose and delivered a long speech. He declared that Lule was not willing to accept the supremacy of UNLF governance and concluded by formally tabling a motion of no confidence in the President. This was followed by an intense debate in which different councilors gave impassioned defences and criticisms of Lule. At 1:00 on 20 June the NCC voted on the motion via secret ballot. The results were announced 35 minutes later with 18 councilors voting in favour and 14 against. Lule was thus removed from the presidency, and he walked out of the room with nine other councilors when Rugumayo said that his dismissal also triggered the removal of his cabinet. Lule held the Ugandan Presidency for just 68 days, the shortest tenure of any President of Uganda. Godfrey Binaisa, the former Attorney General of Uganda under Obote who had come to oppose both him and Amin and had no prior role in the committee, was then elected President. Binaisa retained some of Lule's ministers but removed his key supporters from the cabinet and reversed his administrative changes in Buganda. Many Baganda felt that Lule had been removed from power because he had preserved legitimate interests of Buganda. His ouster instigated large protests in Kampala and clashes between demonstrators and Tanzanian troops attempting to maintain order. Buganda protesters blocked streets and destroyed trucks while transportation workers went on strike and merchants deliberately gouged prices of basic commodities. Some armed Baganda groups formed after Lule's departure and attacked police and soldiers, rendering Buganda ungovernable. On 21 October 1980 the Ugandan Court of Appeal ruled that Lule's removal had been unlawful, stating that Lule had the authority to appoint ministers without the NCC's approval. Though the ruling technically meant Lule could still claim to be President of Uganda, most nationals chose to ignore the decision, since the political situation in the country had rapidly developed since Lule's removal. Final years Out of office, he led the Uganda Freedom Fighters (UFF), a resistance group which joined with Yoweri Museveni's Popular Resistance Army (PRA) in 1981. The combined National Resistance Army (NRA) eventually succeeded in overthrowing Tito Lutwa Okello and taking power in 1986. Lule died on 21 January 1985 at Hammersmith Hospital in London of kidney failure. Lule was initially buried in London, but at the request of Museveni's government his remains were disinterred and flown to Entebbe on 22 January 1986. Greeted at the airport by large crowds, Lule's body was taken to Kampala where it lay in state for two days before being reburied in Kampala where Uganda's first national flag had been raised on its independence day.

Biography  = Early life = Zhang Jiuling was born in 678, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His family was from Qujiang () in Shao Prefecture (, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong) in the region called Lingnan ), which was at the time a relatively remote area of the Tang empire. His family traced its ancestry to the Jin Dynasty (265-420) chancellor Zhang Hua, and his First Son (). His great-grandfather Zhang Junzheng () served as the secretary general of Shao Prefecture, and therefore settled there. His grandfather Zhang Zizhou () served as a county magistrate, and his father Zhang Hongyu () served as a county secretary general.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Zhang Jiuling was said to be intelligent in his childhood and capable in literary skills. In 685, when he was 12, he had an occasion to write a letter to Wang Fangqing, then the prefect of Guang Prefecture (, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). Wang was impressed and commented, \\"This child will do great things in the future.\\" When the official Zhang Yue was exiled to the region,Zhang Yue was exiled in 703 and recalled in 705, so this must have occurred during that period. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 97 and New Book of Tang, vol. 125 . he met Zhang Jiuling and was impressed, and treated Zhang Jiuling with kindness. Zhang Jiuling later passed the jinshi imperial examinations under poet Shen Quanqi and scored the highest on that occasion. After passing several more exams, in 712 he was appointed zuo shiyi (). He was made a Xiaoshu Lang (), a clerk at the imperial institute Hongwen Pavilion (). Later, while Li Longji was crown prince under his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710-712), he summoned those in the empire known for their literary talent and personally examined them. Zhang scored the highest on this occasion as well, and was made You Shiyi (), a consultant at the legislative bureau of government (, Zhongshu Sheng).That Zhang was a consultant at the legislative bureau was per his biography in the Old Book of Tang. HIs biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that he was a Zuo Shiyi () -- a consultant at the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 99 with New Book of Tang, vol. 126 . = During Emperor Xuanzong's reign = In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. For some time, though, Emperor Xuanzong did not sacrifice to heaven and earth outside of the capital Chang'an, as was customary for emperors. Zhang Jiuling submitted a petition asking him to carry out such sacrifices, and Emperor Xuanzong, following his advice, did so. In or around 713, he submitted a petition to the chancellor Yao Chong, pointing out the importance of a clean and fair civil service system, and Yao was impressed. Zhang became known for his talent in understanding people's talents. At that time, Emperor Xuanzong had him and his colleague Zhao Dongxi () decide the postings for the people selected for official service by the ministry of civil service affairs, and he and Zhao were considered fair and capable in finding the right posts for people. In 722, he became Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low level official at the ministry of civil service affairs. At that time, Zhang Yue was a chancellor as Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§, the head of the legislative bureau), and he considered Zhang Jiuling, as they had the same family name, like a brother, often stating, \\"He will surely be the most distinguished poet.\\" Zhang Jiuling was also happy that Zhang Shuo appreciated his talent, and therefore became a follower of Zhang Yue's. In 723, he was made a Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau, serving under Zhang Yue. In 725, at Zhang Yue's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong sacrificed to heaven and earth at Mount Tai. After the ceremony, many of the officials that Zhang Shuo favored were to be promoted to high positions. Zhang Yue had Zhang Jiuling draft the edict for the promotions. Knowing that such promotions would draw resentment from others, Zhang Jiuling tried to dissuade Zhang Yue, but Zhang Yue insisted, causing much resentment against Zhang Shuo. In particular, Zhang Jiuling warned Zhang Yue about the minister Yuwen Rong, whom Zhang Shuo did not respect but whom Emperor Xuanzong favored for his talent in gathering money for the imperial treasury. Zhang Yue did not believe Yuwen Rong could do him harm, but in 726 found himself removed after accusations by Yuwen. In the aftermath, Zhang Jiuling was made the deputy minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Â∞ëÂçø, Taichang Shaoqing) -- an honored post without much actual authority‚Äîand soon was made the prefect of Ji Prefecture (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei). Zhang, because his mother was then old and at home in Shao Prefecture, requested to be posted to a prefecture south of the Yangtze River, so that he could better communicate with her. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict praising him for his filial piety, and made him the commandant at Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, roughly modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). Zhang was later made the commandant at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi) and the examiner of Lingnan Circuit. Emperor Xuanzong further made his brothers Zhang Jiuzhang () and Zhang Jiugao () prefects in the region as well, so that the brothers could all visit their mother on holidays. Meanwhile, Zhang Yue was no longer chancellor, but was still the head of the imperial institute Jixian Institute (). He often recommended Zhang Jiuling for his talent. After Zhang Yue died near the new year 731, Emperor Xuanzong remembered Zhang Yue's recommendations and recalled Zhang Jiuling to serve as Mishu Shaojian (), the deputy head of the Palace Library, as well as a scholar at Jixian Institute, acting as its head. At that time, it happened that an edict needed to be issued to the vassal kingdom Balhae, but no one could write one well. Emperor Xuanzong had Zhang draft one, and it was written quickly. Soon thereafter, Zhang was made the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang) but was put in charge of drafting edicts. He was then made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau. In 732, his mother died, and he returned to Shao Prefecture to observe a period of mourning for her. Around the new year 733, Emperor Xuanzong removed then-chancellors Xiao Song and Han Xiu from their chancellor positions, and named Pei Yaoqing and Zhang to replace them‚Äîordering Zhang to end his period of mourning, which was to last for three years, early, making him Zhongshu Shilang but with the chancellor de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhanshi (). After Zhang subsequently arrived at the eastern capital Luoyang, where Emperor Xuanzong was at the time, he requested that he be allowed to return to mourning. Emperor Xuanzong rejected the request. Later in 733, Zhang proposed that private citizens be allowed to mint money. With opposition from Pei and Liu Zhi, however, Emperor Xuanzong rejected the proposal. Later that year, Zhang was made Zhongshu Ling and continued to serve as chancellor. Other projects that Zhang proposed included reestablishing the offices of examiners of the 10 circuits and also rice farming in the prefectures just south of the Yellow River, which ended in failure. Zhang was further said to be impatient and easily angered, damaging his reputation. However, Zhang was also said to be honest and always seeking to correct the emperor's behavior, even if it offended the emperor. For example, in 735, after the general Zhang Shougui () scored a major victory over the Khitan, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to reward Zhang Shougui by making him a chancellor, but Zhang Jiuling pointed out that it was inappropriate to use the chancellorship as a reward, even with just the honorable title and no actual authority (as Emperor Xuanzong considered as well) and that giving Zhang Shougui the chancellorship for defeating the Khitan meant that there would be no other available awards if he were to defeat the Xi and the Eastern Tujue as well. Emperor Xuanzong agreed and did not give Zhang Shougui the chancellorship. Also in 735, Zhang Jiuling was given the honorific title Jinzi Guanglu Daifu () and created the Count of Shixing. Zhang was also known for his firm friendships with the officials Yan Tingzhi (), Yuan Renjing (), Liang Shengqing () and Lu Yi (), despite his later taking higher positions than they did, drawing much praise for his commitment to friends. In 736, after Zhang Shougui suffered a loss because his subordinate An Lushan failed to follow orders, Zhang Shougui, not wanting to kill An but not wanting to release him for fear of losing authority, sent An to Chang'an, asking the emperor to decide the punishment. Zhang Jiuling submitted the suggestion to have An executed, stating: He also argued that he believed that An had the temperament to commit treason and would surely do so in the future, but Emperor Xuanzong did not agree. Emperor Xuanzong was impressed by An's military talent and ordered that he be reduced to commoner rank and be allowed to stay in the army. September 14, 736, was Emperor Xuanzong's birthday, and the princes and the dukes all offered jeweled mirrors as gifts. Zhang Jiuling, believing that the best way to reflect on oneself was to look at others, wrote a five-volume work, calling it the Golden Mirror Records for a Thousand Years (ÂçÉÁßãÈáëÈëëÈåÑ -- \\"a thousand years\\" being an oblique reference to wishing the Emperor a long life, on his birthday), discussing historical examples of rulership, and offered it to Emperor Xuanzong as his gift. Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict thanking and praising him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 214. By 736, however, fellow chancellor Li Linfu was beginning to gain favor at the expense of Pei and Zhang, who were friendly with each other. At that time, there were several incidents for which the blunt Zhang had offended either Emperor Xuanzong‚Äîwho was described to have begun to tire of governance and started seeking luxuries in earnest‚Äîor Li Linfu, who was described to be ingratiating the emperor: * In fall 736, when Emperor Xuanzong was at Luoyang, he had set to return to Chang'an on March 7, 737. However, at that time, an incident occurred where there were strange apparitions appearing in the Luoyang Palace, and Emperor Xuanzong did not want to stay at Luoyang. On or right before November 9, 736, he summoned the chancellors to ask them whether he could depart for Chang'an immediately. Pei and Zhang, pointing out the fact that it was harvest season and that the imperial train would interfere with harvest, requested a one-month delay. After Pei and Zhang exited, however, Li Linfu remained personally and stated his agreement with the departure, arguing that the farmers could be compensated by relieving their taxes. Emperor Xuanzong was pleased and immediately departed for Chang'an. * Emperor Xuanzong was, then, impressed with Niu Xianke, the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), wanted to make him the minister of defense. Zhang, who pointed out that Niu was not well-learned and had started from the ranks of low-level administrators‚Äîcontrary to the Tang tradition of going through the imperial examinations‚Äîopposed, and then further opposed the creation of a title. Eventually, despite Zhang's opposition, Emperor Xuanzong, with concurrence from Li LInfu, created Niu the Duke of Longxi. * Li Linfu was associating with Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Wu and trying to have Emperor Xuanzong make her son Li Mao () the Prince of Shou crown prince to replace Emperor Xuanzong's then-crown prince Li Ying, who had long lost Emperor Xuanzong's favor. With Zhang strenuously opposing such a move, Li Ying remained in his position. * The deputy minister Xiao Jiong (), whom Li Linfu recommended, was demoted on the suggestion of Zhang and Zhang's friend Yan Tingzhi, who further offended Li Linfu by refusing to meet with him. Soon thereafter, there was an incident where Wang Yunyan (), the husband of Yan's ex-wife, was accused of corruption. Yan tried to intercede on Wang's behalf, and this was discovered. Li Linfu thus made accusations to Emperor Xuanzong that Zhang and Pei were engaging in factionalism. Around the new year 737, Emperor Xuanzong removed Pei and Zhang from their chancellor posts, making them Chengxiang () -- the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) instead. Niu was made chancellor to replace them, serving with Li Linfu. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, for example, commented: In 737, the imperial censor Zhou Ziliang () submitted an indictment against Niu, arguing that Niu should not be chancellor because he lacked talent to be chancellor, and further citing prophecies that appeared to indicate that someone named Niu would usurp the throne. Emperor Xuanzong was incensed, and had Zhou caned and exiled‚Äîand Zhou died shortly after departing Chang'an. Li Linfu then submitted an accusation against Zhang, pointing out that Zhang had recommended Zhou. Zhang was therefore demoted to be the secretary general at Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). However, even after Zhang's demotion, Emperor Xuanzong still remembered his honesty, and when officials were recommended, he would often make the inquiry, \\"How does their honesty compare to Zhang Jiuling?\\" Zhang died in 740, while on a vacation in Shao Prefecture to visit his parents' tomb, and was given posthumous honors. After An, then a powerful military governor (jiedushi), rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong's rule in 755, Emperor Xuanzong was, in 756, forced to flee to Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçóÈÅì, roughly modern Sichuan and Chongqing) and pass the throne to his son Emperor Suzong. Remembering Zhang's warnings about An, issued an edict further posthumously honoring Zhang and sent messengers to Shao Prefecture to offer sacrifices to Zhang.  Poetry  Zhang Jiuling had five of his poems selected for inclusion in the famous anthology of poetry Three Hundred Tang Poems. The titles, as translated by Witter Bynner are: * Thoughts I * Orchid and Orange I * Thoughts III * Orchid and Orange II * Looking at the Moon and Thinking of One Far Away [first sentence of : ‚ÄúThe moon, grown full now over the sea, Brightening the whole of heaven. ‚Äù to rank as a masterpiece throughout the ages. meaning : As the bright moon shines over the sea, from far away you share this moment with me.

Under the advice of the cabinet of ministers and using the Constitution of India, the President can overrule many provisions of the constitution, which guarantee fundamental rights to the citizens of India and acts governing devolution of powers to the states which form the federation. In the history of independent India, a state of emergency has been declared thrice. The first instance was between 26 October 1962 to 10 January 1968 during the India-China war, when \\"the security of India\\" was declared as being \\"threatened by external aggression\\". The second instance was between 3 December 1971 to 21 March 1972, which was originally proclaimed during the Indo-Pakistan war. It was later extended along with the third proclamation between 25 June 1975 to 21 March 1977 under controversial circumstances of political instability under Indira Gandhi's prime minister-ship, when emergency was declared on the basis of \\"internal disturbance\\", but this term was too vague and had a wider connotation and hence 44th amendment act 1978 substituted the words \\"internal disturbance\\" for \\"armed rebellion\\" \\". The phrase Emergency period used loosely, when referring to the political history of India, often refers to the third and the most controversial of the three occasions. The President can declare three types of emergencies ‚Äî national, state and financial emergency. National emergency under Article 352 Originally at the beginning, National emergency could be declared on the basis of \\"external aggression or war\\" and \\"internal disturbance\\" in the whole of India or a part of its territory under Article 352. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 war (China war), 1971 war (Pakistan war), and 1975 internal disturbance (declared by Indira Gandhi). But after 44th amendment act 1978, National Emergency can only be declared on grounds of \\"External aggression or war\\", also called as External Emergency & on the ground of \\"armed rebellion\\", also called as Internal Emergency. The President can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. Such a proclamation must be laid before both houses of Parliament and the state of emergency expires after one month unless approved within that time by both houses sitting and voting separately. However, if the Lok Sabha (the lower house) has been dissolved or dissolution takes place in the state of emergency, and the Rajya Sabha approves of the state of emergency, the deadline for the Lok Sabha is extended until thirty days after that house reconstituted. According to Article 352(6),http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1018568/ approval by either house requires a special majority: those in favour of the motion must be two thirds of those present and voting, and amount to a majority of the entire membership of that house. A Parliamentary resolution extends the state of emergency for up to six months, and it can be extended indefinitely by further resolutions in six-monthly increments. During a national emergency, many Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended. The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. By contrast, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended according to the original Constitution. In January 1977, during the emergency declared controversially by Indira Gandhi, the government decided to suspend even the Right to Life and Personal Liberty by dispensing with Habeas corpus. Justice Hans Raj Khanna defended the Right to Life and asked: \\"Life is also mentioned in Article 21 and would Government argument extend to it also?\\". The Attorney General observed: \\"Even if life was taken away illegally, courts are helpless\\". A national emergency modifies the federal system of government to a unitary one by granting Parliament the power to make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws). Also, all state money bills are referred to the Parliament for its approval. During an emergency, the term of the Lok Sabha can be successively extended by intervals of up to one year, but not beyond six months after the state of emergency has been revoked.  President Rule, under Article 356  A state of emergency can be declared in any state of India under article 356 on the recommendation of the governor of the state. Every state in India except two states, Chhattisgarh and Telangana has been under a state of emergency at some point of time or the other. The state of emergency is commonly known as 'President's Rule' and is usually not referred to as 'State Emergency' for a number of reasons. If the President is satisfied, based on the report of the Governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the Constitution, he/she may declare an emergency in the state. Such an emergency must be approved by the Parliament within a period of two months. It is imposed for an initial period of six months and can last for a maximum period of two years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months.The 42nd amendment act of 1976 extended the initial time duration of President Rule from 6 months to 1 year. Subsequently, 44th CAA 1978 restored the 1-year period back to 6 months. Originally, the maximum period of operation of President Rule was 3 years. This 3-year period was divided into 1 year of ordinary period and 2 years of extra ordinary period for which certain conditions are to be fulfilled. Therefore, from now on after every 1 year Parliament needs to approve the same. If the emergency has to be extended for more than three years, it can only be done by a constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. During such an emergency, the President can take over the entire work of the executive, and the Governor administers the state in the name of the President. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The Parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list (see National emergency for explanation).

These strategies are supported by substantial mathematical, computational, and trading platforms. Trading strategy Shows a statistical arbitrage strategy on artificial data. The portfolio prices are a result of combining the two stocks. As a trading strategy, statistical arbitrage is a heavily quantitative and computational approach to securities trading. It involves data mining and statistical methods, as well as the use of automated trading systems. Historically, StatArb evolved out of the simpler pairs trade strategy, in which stocks are put into pairs by fundamental or market-based similarities. When one stock in a pair outperforms the other, the under performing stock is bought long and the outperforming stock is sold short with the expectation that under performing stock will climb towards its outperforming partner. Mathematically speaking, the strategy is to find a pair of stocks with high correlation, cointegration, or other common factor characteristics. Various statistical tools have been used in the context of pairs trading ranging from simple distance-based approaches to more complex tools such as cointegration and copula concepts. StatArb considers not pairs of stocks but a portfolio of a hundred or more stocks‚Äîsome long, some short‚Äîthat are carefully matched by sector and region to eliminate exposure to beta and other risk factors. Portfolio construction is automated and consists of two phases. In the first or \\"scoring\\" phase, each stock in the market is assigned a numeric score or rank that reflects its desirability; high scores indicate stocks that should be held long and low scores indicate stocks that are candidates for shorting. The details of the scoring formula vary and are highly proprietary, but, generally (as in pairs trading), they involve a short term mean reversion principle so that, e.g., stocks that have done unusually well in the past week receive low scores and stocks that have underperformed receive high scores. In the second or \\"risk reduction\\" phase, the stocks are combined into a portfolio in carefully matched proportions so as to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, market and factor risk. This phase often uses commercially available risk models like MSCI/Barra, APT, Northfield, Risk Infotech, and Axioma to constrain or eliminate various risk factors.For example, Andrew Lo (op.cit.) states \\"the widespread use of standardized factor risk models such as those from MSCI/BARRA or North-field Information Systems ... will almost certainly create common exposures among those managers to the risk factors contained in such platforms\\" Broadly speaking, StatArb is actually any strategy that is bottom-up, beta-neutral in approach and uses statistical/econometric techniques in order to provide signals for execution. Signals are often generated through a contrarian mean reversion principle but can also be designed using such factors as lead/lag effects, corporate activity, short-term momentum, etc. This is usually referred to as a multi- factor approach to StatArb. Because of the large number of stocks involved, the high portfolio turnover and the fairly small size of the effects one is trying to capture, the strategy is often implemented in an automated fashion and great attention is placed on reducing trading costs. Statistical arbitrage has become a major force at both hedge funds and investment banks. Many bank proprietary operations now center to varying degrees around statistical arbitrage trading. Risks Over a finite period of time, a low probability market movement may impose heavy short-term losses. If such short- term losses are greater than the investor's funding to meet interim margin calls, its positions may need to be liquidated at a loss even when its strategy's modeled forecasts ultimately turn out to be correct. The 1998 default of Long-Term Capital Management was a widely publicized example of a fund that failed due to its inability to post collateral to cover adverse market fluctuations. Statistical arbitrage is also subject to model weakness as well as stock- or security-specific risk. The statistical relationship on which the model is based may be spurious, or may break down due to changes in the distribution of returns on the underlying assets. Factors, which the model may not be aware of having exposure to, could become the significant drivers of price action in the markets, and the inverse applies also. The existence of the investment based upon model itself may change the underlying relationship, particularly if enough entrants invest with similar principles. The exploitation of arbitrage opportunities themselves increases the efficiency of the market, thereby reducing the scope for arbitrage, so continual updating of models is necessary. On a stock-specific level, there is risk of M&A; activity or even default for an individual name. Such an event would immediately invalidate the significance of any historical relationship assumed from empirical statistical analysis of the past data. StatArb and systemic risk: events of summer 2007 During July and August 2007, a number of StatArb (and other Quant type) hedge funds experienced significant losses at the same time, which is difficult to explain unless there was a common risk factor. While the reasons are not yet fully understood, several published accounts blame the emergency liquidation of a fund that experienced capital withdrawals or margin calls. By closing out its positions quickly, the fund put pressure on the prices of the stocks it was long and short. Because other StatArb funds had similar positions, due to the similarity of their alpha models and risk- reduction models, the other funds experienced adverse returns.Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. What Happened to the Quants In August 2007? One of the versions of the events describes how Morgan Stanley's highly successful StatArb fund, PDT, decided to reduce its positions in response to stresses in other parts of the firm, and how this contributed to several days of hectic trading. In a sense, the fact of a stock being heavily involved in StatArb is itself a risk factor, one that is relatively new and thus was not taken into account by the StatArb models. These events showed that StatArb has developed to a point where it is a significant factor in the marketplace, that existing funds have similar positions and are in effect competing for the same returns. Simulations of simple StatArb strategies by Khandani and Lo show that the returns to such strategies have been reduced considerably from 1998 to 2007, presumably because of competition. It has also been argued that the events during August 2007 were linked to reduction of liquidity, possibly due to risk reduction by high-frequency market makers during that time.Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. What Happened to the Quants in August 2007?: Evidence from Factors and Transactions Data It is a noteworthy point of contention, that the common reduction in portfolio value could also be attributed to a causal mechanism. The 2007-2008 financial crisis also occurred at this time. Many, if not the vast majority, of investors of any form, booked losses during this one year time frame. The association of observed losses at hedge funds using statistical arbitrage is not necessarily indicative of dependence. As more competitors enter the market, and funds diversify their trades across more platforms than StatArb, a point can made that there should be no reason to expect the platform models to behave anything like each other. Their statistical models could be entirely independent. Worldwide practice Statistical arbitrage faces different regulatory situations in different countries or markets. In many countries where the trading security or derivatives are not fully developed, investors find it infeasible or unprofitable to implement statistical arbitrage in local markets. =China= In China, quantitative investment including statistical arbitrage is not the mainstream approach to investment. A set of market conditions restricts the trading behavior of funds and other financial institutions. The restriction on short selling as well as the market stabilization mechanisms (e.g. daily limit) set heavy obstacles when either individual investors or institutional investors try to implement the trading strategy implied by statistical arbitrage theory.

Most of the original moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the late 12th or early 13th century and the castle played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison. The surviving rectangular St George's Tower is now believed to pre-date the remainder of the castle and be a watch tower associated with the original Saxon west gate of the city. Most of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford's local prison. A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876; this became HM Prison Oxford. The prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel and visitor attraction. The medieval remains of the castle, including the motte and St George's Tower and crypt, are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument. History =Construction= Oxford Castle & Prison Visitor Attraction According to the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis (Abingdon Chronicle),Referenced in Harfield, p.388. Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071‚Äì73.Joy, p.28. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England and William the Conqueror granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town.MacKenzie, 147; Tyack, p.5. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle.Amt, pp.47‚Äì8. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey.Harfield, pp.384, 388‚Äì9. D'Oyly (d'Oilly)'s Oxford holdings are, however, mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"Meadow 30 acres. 1 mill, value 0.5 [pounds].\\";Open Domesday, Place: Oxford: entry 13 the mill mentioned is presumably the Castle Mill, formerly adjacent to the still surviving St. George's Tower, rebuilt in 1781 before eventually being demolished in 1930.Oxford Archaeological Unit Ltd 2011, p.2 D'Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town, using the natural protection of a stream off the River Thames on the far side of the castle, now called Castle Mill Stream, and diverting the stream to produce a moat.MacKenzie, p.147. There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site, but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo-Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification. Oxford Castle was an \\"urban castle\\", overlying a portion of the Saxon town wall, but it remains uncertain whether local buildings were demolished to make room for it. Poore et al. (2009) give a suggested street plan of the town in late Saxon times (their figure 4) showing the then town wall with its north, west, south and east gates; at the north gate is the Saxon tower now associated with the church of St Michael at the North Gate, while the west gate is occupied by the apparently Saxon tower of St. George's, which is now believed to have subsequently been incorporated into the fabric of the later Norman castle.Poore et al., 2009, p.8. Oxford Castle, around 1250.

The initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey, copying the plan of the castle that D'Oyly had already built away at Wallingford. The motte was originally about high and wide, constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing.MacKenzie, p.148; Oxford Archaeology, accessed 12 September 2010. There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey: it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first (thus utilising the pre-existing St. George's Tower as the first keep) which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey.Hassall 1976, p.233. By the late 12th to early 13th century, the original palisade walls and wooden keep had been replaced in stone.Beckley and Radford, 2012, p. 37 The new curtain wall incorporated St George's Tower, which is built of coral rag stone, at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability.Tyack, p.7; MacKenzie, p.148. This was the tallest of the castle's towers, and is now believed to be a survival from late Saxon times (c. 1020) as a watch tower associated with the west gate of the Saxon city.Tyack, p.6; Hassall 1976, p.233.Oxford Council: Historic Urban Character Area 12: Castle and Periphery - Oxford CastleSignboard from Oxfordshire County Council on Oxford Castle Site Evidence that this tower is Saxon in origin and thus pre-dates the castle itself is presented in Poore et al. (2009),Poore et al., 2009, p.5-6. who comment that \\"a single, massive stone tower does not seem to belong within the outer defences of an earth-and- timber castle\\", and other sources have concurred on architectural grounds, also noting that its orientation does not match that of the remainder of the castle, and that its height would have originally afforded an extensive view over the city, but which would have been superseded (and in fact, blocked) with the construction of the castle motte.Davies, p.72.Anglo-Saxon Oxfordshire: Norman Oxford (Ashmolean Museum)http://www.anglo-saxon- churches.co.uk: St. Georges Tower, Oxford The date of the remaining towers is uncertain although the southernmost, round tower, of which the base still remains, is dated to 1235 in various documentary sources, including Woolnoth's The Ancient Castles of England and Wales of 1825; in at least one source, it is referred to as \\"Henry III's Tower\\".Plan of Oxford Castle (provenance unknown) Inside the walls the buildings included a chapel with a crypt attached to St. Georges Tower, which may be on the site of a previous church. The chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It was a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches.Tyack, p.8. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry had endowed a chapel with a college of priests, which is presumed to be the structure in question; at an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George. As detailed below, the crypt of this chapel still survives, albeit in a new location within the castle, having been moved and reconstructed from its original materials in 1794. The ten-sided stone shell keep, , constructed in the 13th century to replace an earlier wooden structure, closely resembled those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles.MacKenzie, p.149; Gravett and Hook, p.43. The keep enclosed a number of buildings, leaving an inner courtyard only across.MacKenzie, p.149. Within the keep, stairs led down to an underground wide stone chamber, with an Early English hexagonal vault and a deep well providing water in the event of siege.Tyack, p.8; MacKenzie, p.149. =Role in the Anarchy and Barons War= Empress Matilda escaped from Oxford Castle in 1141 in the Anarchy. Robert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle.MacKenzie, p.149; Amt, p.48. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.Gravett and Hook, p.44. Finally in December, Matilda responded by escaping from the castle; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls with three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm.MacKenzie, p.149; Gravett and Hook, p.44. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war.Amt, p.48. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.Amt, pp.56‚Äì7. In the Barons' War of 1215‚Äì17 the castle was attacked again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breaut√©, who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate.Hassall 1971, p.9. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235.Hassall 1976, p.235; Tyack, p.8. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246.Davies, p.3; Marks, p.93. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.Munby, p.96. =14th‚Äì17th centuries= Bodleian Libraries, Agas map of Oxford, 1578 - detail of the Castle. From copy of the earliest map of Oxford by Ralph Agas, engraved by Augustine Ryther, in a reduced facsimile engraved by R. Whittlesey in 1728. John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605, showing the castle (labelled \\"P\\") at upper right. (North is at the bottom of this map) Remains of the remodelled Oxford Castle in the early 1670s: detail from David Loggan's Oxonia Illustrata map/bird's eye view, published in 1675 (BL 128.h.10), with north at the bottom. The Castle Mill is visible adjacent in the stream adjacent to the prominent St. George's Tower, and a portion of the round base of the southernmost tower also remains. How an artist in 1845 imagined Oxford Castle looked in the 15th century; a possibly more realistic reconstruction of the appearance of the castle in Norman times is available here. By 1327 the fortification, particularly the castle gates and the barbican, was in poor condition and ¬£800 was estimated to be required for repairs.Crossley and Elrington, p.297. From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair. The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford, a jail, and a criminal court. Assizes were held there until 1577, when plague broke out in what became known as the \\"Black Assize\\": the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, two knights, eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died, including Sir Robert D'Oyley, a relative of the founder of the castle.Tyack, p.8; Hassall 1976, p.235; MacKenzie, p.149; Davies, pp.91‚Äì2. Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle. Ralph Agas's map of Oxford in 1578 shows that by then, while the curtain wall, keep and towers remained, the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses. Hassall, 1976, states that by 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall,Hassall 1976, p.235, 254. although this is contradicted by the castle's appearance in John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years.Davies, p.3. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep.Oxford Archaeology, accessed 12 September 2010. A map of the castle prepared for Christ Church College in 1615 shows the keep on its mound, St. George's Tower with associated buildings and sections of the curtain wall remaining to the north and south, and the next tower to the south, plus a single remaining tower to the north-east, as well as the Castle Mill and a southern entrance to the castle complex;Poole et al., Figure 6drawing based on Christ Church 1615 map according to this map, by 1615 houses and their gardens had been built up to over half of the Castle Ditch or moat, which appears to still contain water. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby.Joy, p.29. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform.Joy, p.29; Oxford Archaeology, accessed 12 September 2010. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped to its current form. =Role as prison= St George's Tower in 1832, viewed from across the Castle Mill Stream; the water mill (Castle Mill) is visible, immediately to the right of the tower, built across the stream. After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison.Davies, p.6. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752.Davies, p.106. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair.Davies, pp.9‚Äì10. A view of the castle published in 1769 in the work \\"England Displayed\\" by P. Russell and Owen Price is of interest in that it shows the appearance of the chapel attached to St George's tower prior to its demolition in 1794, as well as the motte and some then-surviving portions of the curtain wall including an arch or gateway in the wall immediately to the north of the tower.View of Oxford Castle, 1769 (www.alamy.com) The chapel and/or associated buildings are also shown, from a range of angles, in views by other artists including Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's Antiquities (drawing dated 1729),The North View of Oxford Castle (sandersofoxford.com) a 1773 engraving included in Francis Grose's Antiquities of England and Wales, 1786,Oxford Castle, Oxfordshire, from Francis Grose's Antiquities of England and Wales, 1786 a painting by Michael Angelo Rooker dating from 1779,View of Castle Hill, Oxford by Michael Angelo Rooker (1746‚Äì1801), from Oxfordshire County Museums Service and a view by the artist John Baptist Malchair dating from 1784.Oxford Castle and the Castle Mound, 27 May 1784.

(Photo by Ashmolean Museum/Heritage Images/Getty Images) In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including the extent to which vermin infested the prison.Davies, p.14. Partly as a result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.Davies, p.15. In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn.Hassall 1976, p.235; Whiting, p.54. The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus.Hassall, p.235. Building the new prison included demolishing the old chapel attached to St George's tower and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805.Hyack, p.7; Whiting, p.54. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King.Munby, p.53; Davies, p.24. In the 19th century the site continued to be developed, with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840‚Äì41 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854. The prison itself was extended in 1876, growing to occupy most of the remaining space. The inmates included children, the youngest being a seven-year-old girl sentenced to seven days hard labour in 1870 for stealing a pram.Oxford Castle mugshots show 'victims of their time, BBC News, accessed 15 January 2017. In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford. =Today= Oxford Castle approximate extent, versus present day features: castle outline from Booth et al., 2003; basemap from OpenStreetMap, June 2018.

St George's crypt chapel, rebuilt in 1794 re-using its late 11th-century Norman columns and capitals The prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying a large part of the former prison blocks, with cells converted as guest rooms. However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests.Smith, p.93.

The full extent of the original castle is somewhat obliterated today, especially with the intrusion of the newer County Hall into the eastern side, while New Road runs over the location of north-east portion of the curtain wall with its two square towers; nevertheless the position of its outer perimeter moat is approximated by portions of New Road, Castle Street and Paradise Street (refer map at right), while the remains of the original Barbican lie underneath the modern Westgate shopping centre.

It was built in 3807 BC and is the second-oldest timber trackway discovered in the British Isles, dating to the Neolithic. It is now known that the Sweet Track was predominantly built along the course of an earlier structure, the Post Track. The track extended across the now largely drained marsh between what was then an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to or around 1.2 miles. The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artifacts and prehistoric finds, including a jadeitite ceremonial axe head, have been found in the peat bogs along its length. Construction was of crossed wooden poles, driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used for a period of only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original, in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve. Location In the early fourth millennium BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick close to the River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were likely to have been similar to those found in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog; they include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways. Sites such as the nearby Meare Pool provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs around it, particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC), and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud. The two Meare Lake Villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone. Discovery and study The track was discovered in 1970 during peat excavations and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet. The company for which he worked, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at Cambridge University, who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways. Coles' interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including English Heritage. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC. The work of John Coles, Bryony Coles, and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize. Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers has enabled precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the discovery in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period. The wood used to build the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment. A polished jadeitite axe head from the Museum of Toulouse In 1973 a jadeitite axehead was found alongside the track; it is thought to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100 similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made. A geophysical survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear magnetometer data; the wood may be influencing the peat's hydrology, causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix. Builders The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC, and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years. Construction Diagram showing a cross section of the Sweet Track A replica of the Sweet Track Digital reconstruction of the Sweet Track, southern end Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, the track was a walkway consisting mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, driven into the underlying peat. The planks, which were up to wide, long and less than thick, were cut from trees up to 400 years old and in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to long and in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed on top of the first one to bring the plank above it level with the rest of the walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found. The wetland setting indicates that the track components must have arrived prefabricated, before being assembled on site, although the presence of wood chips and chopped branches indicates that some trimming was performed locally. The track was constructed from about of timber, but Coles estimates that once the materials were transported to the site, ten men could have assembled it in one day. The Sweet Track was used only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and therefore curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest that it was in daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC. Conservation Most of the track remains in its original location, which is now within the Shapwick Heath biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserve. Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section, several hundred metres of the track's length are now being actively conserved. This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare. A section, which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot's Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated. Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Somerset Levels Project. Although the wood recovered from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing the water in the wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely. A section of the track on land owned by Fisons (who extracted peat from the area) was donated to the British Museum in London. Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre near Glastonbury. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 as a result of budget cuts imposed by Somerset County Council. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the Museum of Somerset. Sections of the track have been designated as a scheduled monument, meaning that it is a \\"nationally important\\" historic structure and archaeological site protected against unauthorised change. These sections are also included in Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register.

He is portrayed as a journalist and talk show host, usually living in Gotham City, who gains the ability to transform into the superhuman Creeper (and vice versa) thanks to experimental science developed by Dr. Yatz. First appearing in Showcase #73 (March 1968), his origin was revised in Secret Origins Vol. 2 #18 in 1987, then partially revised again in The Creeper Vol. 1 #1-4 in 1997, then completely reimagined in the 6-issue mini-series The Creeper Vol. 2, published in 2006-2007. Originally, Ryder's transformation into the Creeper involved activating a device that granted superhuman abilities while also causing his face to be covered in yellow make-up, his hair to be concealed by a green wig, and his clothing to be instantly replaced by a yellow and red costume with green trunks and a sheepskin cape; as the Creeper, Ryder then shifted his voice tone and acted chaotically in order to intimidate foes and protect his identity. Starting in 1987, it was said Ryder suffered an actual slight change in personality when he became the Creeper, as the device not only empowered him and dressed him in a costume but also altered his brain chemistry. Starting in 1997, Ryder and the Creeper are treated as two personalities sharing the same body. The 2006-2007 mini-series The Creeper Vol. 2 presented a new origin. Starting with this story, Ryder's transformation no longer involved a costume and was now depicted as a physical transformation into a yellow-skinned, green-haired superhuman with a different face, voice, and body, and a red mane of fur sprouting from his shoulders and back. Along with his strange appearance, the Creeper is characterized by superhuman strength, agility, healing, and stamina, as well as a maniacal laugh. Starting in the 1990s, this laugh has been able to cause pain or immobility in enemies. Through experience and training, the Creeper is a formidable fighter and acrobat. In the New 52 continuity, a short-lived incarnation of the Creeper was a villain not a hero, a malicious oni demon who inhabited human hosts in order to create chaos. The Creeper is a frequent ally to Batman and has been a recurring character in that hero's stories. Outside of comics, the Creeper has appeared in the TV shows The New Batman Adventures and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and was referenced and seen in his civilian identity Jack Ryder in the Batman Arkham video game series. The Creeper shares visual similarities to the villain Joker but originally no connection was intended and the two characters did not meet until 1975, seven years after the Creeper's debut. The animated series The New Batman Adventures connected the Joker to the Creeper's origin in the 1995 episode \\"Beware the Creeper.\\" The 2006 comic book mini-series The Creeper Vol. 2 followed suit by revealing the Joker's signature poison was one of several agents used by Dr. Yatz to first transform Jack Ryder into the Creeper. Publication history Showcase #73 (April 1968), the Creeper's first appearance, with art and script by Steve Ditko & dialogue by Don Segall. The character first appeared in Showcase #73 (April 1968). Later the same year, the Creeper starred in his own series Beware the Creeper, written by Dennis O'Neil (with Steve Ditko plotting the first issue). It lasted six issues. The Creeper repeatedly fought a chameleonic villain called Proteus, whose true identity was revealed just before his violent death in the final issue. For the next two decades, the Creeper made sporadic appearances in DC Comics stories, often aiding other heroes such as Batman. Most of these stories were written by Denny O'Neil. The Creeper teamed with Batman in The Brave and the Bold #80 (November 1968), then guested in Justice League of America #70 (March 1969). He also appeared with Batman in Detective Comics #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in Detective Comics #443 (November 1974), Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975). In Detective Comics #447‚Äì448 (May‚ÄìJune 1975), the Creeper helped Batman prove he had been framed for murder. In 1975, he met Batman's arch-enemy the Joker for the first time in Joker #3. The story, which featured a character intended to emulate Peanuts creators Charles Schulz, began with the Creeper being mistakenly blamed for a crime the Joker committed due to their similar appearances. Later that year, the hero appeared in Super-Team Family #2 and was given a new origin that was not referenced again later. The Creeper appeared in a one-off solo story in 1st Issue Special #7 (October 1975), penciled by Ditko. He met Wildcat in Super-Team Family #2 (January 1976), and reunited with Batman in The Brave and the Bold #143 (October 1978) and #178 (September 1981). He and other stars of Showcase appeared in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published Showcase #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko) was later included in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #2 and in The Creeper by Steve Ditko hardcover collection published by DC in 2010. The hero also appeared in back-up stories featured in Adventure Comics #445‚Äì447 (1976), World's Finest Comics #249‚Äì55 (1978‚Äì1979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and The Flash #318‚Äì323 (1983). He teamed up with Superman in DC Comics Presents #88 (December 1985), written by Steve Englehart. Following the company wide crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985-1986), DC Comics rebooted large portions of its superhero universe, and many characters were given revised origins or reimagined natures in order to make them more relevant to modern comic book readers. In Secret Origins Vol. 2 #18 (1987), in a story presented by Andrew Helfer and Keith Giffen, the Creeper was given a new origin and it was now said Ryder's behavior while in costume wasn't simply an act. In this origin, Ryder is drugged against his will when he is then exposed to Dr. Yatz's technology. Whenever he summons his Creeper costume afterward, a side-effect is that his mind reverts to the state it was in when he was drugged, thus causing the Creeper's strange behavior. In Eclipso #13 in 1993, the Creeper joined a group of heroes in an attempt to defeat the DC villain Eclipso. They failed and the Creeper was killed. He then made an appearance in The New Batman Adventures in 1995, in the episode \\"Beware the Creeper.\\" The episode depicted him as reporter Jack Ryder who is investigating the Joker and then accidentally transformed into a similar looking being with yellow skin and green hair. His personality altered by this transformation, Ryder grabs a red boa and declares himself the Creeper. Back in the comics, the character was revealed to be alive following his adventure against Eclipso due to a newly-revealed healing ability so powerful that he could even restore severed limbs. In the 1997 series The Creeper Vol. 1, written by Len Kaminski, Ryder realizes that before he was ever transformed into the Creeper he possibly had multiple undiagnosed mental illnesses (mentioned are bipolar disorder and an obsessive need for order), apparently inherited form his mother. The series depicted the Creeper as a second personality distinct from his own and occasionally warring for control over their shared body. Ryder also realizes he has repressed the memories of his true origin; the two versions he has recalled before (the original Ditko origin and the Helfer/Giffen origin) were each skewed versions of the truth that his mind found more acceptable. While trying to discover the truth, he fights Proteus again. The series ended in 1998 before the full truth of the Creeper's origin could be fully revealed. The series included a special issue #1Million, a tie-in to the 1998 crossover DC One Million.Creeper, The (DC 1997 series) at the Grand Comics Database In 2003, DC's Vertigo Comics imprint released a new mini-series called Beware the Creeper. Taking place outside of the DC canon, this story featured Judith and Madeline Benoir, twin sisters living Paris in the 1920s. The story explores their lives and their connection to the Creeper, a mysterious costumed woman who terrorizes a corrupt family. Following the DC crossover Infinite Crisis (2005-2006), parts of DC Comics continuity were revised and some characters were given altered histories. Jack Ryder was reintroduced in a follow-up comic DCU: Brave New World (2006), in a short story written by Steve Niles and drawn by Justiniano. The story depicted Ryder as a former journalist who now hosted a talk show You Are Wrong where he often attempted to expose corruption and provide commentary on news events. In narration, Ryder reveals that he has been secretly fighting crime as the Creeper for some times, and his transformation is presented as a physical alteration of his body and appearance, not just having a costume, wig, and make-up appear on him. Ryder also comments that the Creeper is a separate personality sharing his body, a creature who seems wild and sometimes fights for control of their shared body but is also in some ways more altruistic than the talk show host, and whose conscience is now influencing Ryder to be a better person. Later the same year, The Creeper Volume 2 (October 2006 ‚Äì March 2007), also written by Niles and drawn by Justiniano, featured a flashback story revealing the Creeper's newly revised origin, connecting him to the Joker. The idea that Ryder has a mental illness before ever becoming the Creeper is eliminated; this alter ego's personality is a result of experimental science affecting his body, mixed with the Joker's signature madness-inducing chemical weapons. Batman becomes involved in the story and later gives Ryder a chemical solution that can cure him of the Creeper entirely. Ryder throws away the cure, deciding that he and the Creeper can do more good together. During the Reign in Hell mini-series (2008-2009), the Creeper was presented as a demon co-inhabiting the body of Jack Ryder, one of several yellow-skinned demons inhabiting Hell. The same story quickly became notorious among readers for many continuity errors and unexplained contradictions with accepted DC Comics canon. Following this story, other comics featuring the Creeper once again depicted him as a human who had been altered by science rather than one possessed by a demon. In the collected edition of Wednesday Comics (200 pages, DC Comics, June 2010, ; Titan Books, July 2010, ), the Creeper is featured in the story Beware the Creeper, written by Keith Giffen with art by Eric Canete. In 2011, DC Comics rebooted its superhero universe again with the New 52 comics. The New 52 continuity gave a new origin for the Creeper in Justice League Dark #23.1. The issue portrayed the Creeper as an oni who \\"justifies cruel temper tantrums under the guise of spreading chaos\\" and inhabits numerous human hosts, including Jack Ryder. The 2017 DC Rebirth comic removed many ideas introduced by the New 52 comics and brought back many ideas and stories published before 2011. Jack Ryder and the Creeper appeared again afterward, now once again depicted as a man who becomes a yellow-skinned superhuman due to scientific experimentation rather than demonic possession. Fictional character biography = Pre-Crisis = Jack Ryder is a former Gotham City is the host of a political talk show. He is fired after criticizing his own sponsors on-air and refusing to change his behavior or apologize. Knowing Ryder is a decent detective, Chief of Network Security Bill Brane hires the former talk show host as one of his investigators. Brane reveals that CIA contacts have asked him to held find Dr. Yatz, a scientist recently captured by local gangster Angel Devlin who is working with communist powers. Ryder decides to infiltrate a masquerade party at Devlin's mansion and visits a local costume shop. The clerk explains he mainly sells costumes for children, but offers Ryder \\"leftovers\\" from adult orders. Ryder cobbles together the costume involving yellow tights, green trunks, and red gloves and boot. He completes the disguise with yellow make- up, a green wig, and a red sheepskin rug he decides to use as a cape. At the costume party, Ryder fights some of Devlin's henchmen, suffering injuries in the process, and then discovers the kidnapped Dr. Yatz. The scientist injects Ryder with a chemical serum designed to accelerate healing while also granting great strength and stamina. He also hides a tiny device of his own creation in Ryder's wound, saying it is the safest way to keep the technology hidden from Devlin. The device, he explains, can \\"rearrange the molecular structure of matter,\\" making clothing or items weightless and invisible until needed. By activating the device now hidden beneath his skin, Ryder is able to instantly cause his yellow and red costume to vanish or reappear instantly. As Yatz then destroys the evidence of his work, Devlin's men arrive and shoot him dead. In costume, Ryder escapes Devlin's party but is blamed for the chaos. Police arrive and one of the cops refers to the yellow-costumed intruder as a \\"creeper.\\" Deciding he likes the name, Ryder later attacks and defeats Devlin's gang. He then reverts to his civilian guise and informs Brane and the police of Devlin's involvement in Yatz's death. Ryder then decides to continue secretly operating as the Creeper whenever he needs to fight crime. In his private life, he continues acting as a WHAM-TV network security investigator for Brane. A month after first becoming the Creeper, Ryder is assigned to help WHAM-TV weather correspondent Vera Sweet, who has been threatened. The two initially dislike each other, but over time they develop a flirtatious relationship. Although the Creeper fights crime, he is frequently considered a villain himself by news media and authorities. During his first adventure involving a costumed villain, a man called the Terror, Ryder realizes that Yatz's implanted device has two side-effects: when he is the Creeper, it prevents his costume and make-up from being removed from his body, and when he is Ryder his superhuman powers become dormant, leaving him vulnerable. During his early adventures, the Creeper regularly fights a shape-shifting terrorist name Proteus. At one point, Proteus reveals that he is motivated by being overwhelmed by how corrupt he finds society. He had hoped to find a friend in the Creeper and had spared his life before, but then concluded the yellow vigilante is actually an enemy after learning he is secretly Jack Ryder. While attempting another attack on society, Proteus seemingly kills himself and the Creeper muses whether he has lost both an enemy and a friend. Following this, the Creeper continues operating in Gotham City and Jack Ryder becomes a television reporter for WHAM-TV. He winds up teaming up with other superheroes often, most frequently aiding Batman. During an encounter with the Joker, the Creeper is rendered temporarily amnesiac and is tricked into helping the Joker plant a bomb, only realizing the truth at the last moment. He then brings the Joker to justice, not as the Creeper but as Jack Ryder. = Post-Crisis Revision = Following Crisis on Infinite Earths, much of DC Comics history is revised. The Creeper is giving a new origin and interpretation as well. In the new continuity, Ryder is not a talk show host or TV reporter initially. Instead, he is a newspaper journalist working for the Herald Examiner and known for exposing corrupt criminal operations. Investigating the home of criminals during a masquerade party, he is ambushed and knocked out. The criminals knew he intended to investigate them and have decided to humiliate him before taking revenge. They drug him with a hallucinogen, one said to cause psychosis if used in too strong a dose, dress him up in a yellow and red costume with a green wig, and present him to the masquerade party as a jester called \\"the dancing creep.\\" Drugged and confused, Ryder attempts to escape but is severely beaten. He is then taken some distance away, shot, and left for dead. Ryder awakens in the home of Dr. Emil Yatz, a German immigrant and scientist who discovered the journalist dead near his estate. Yatz explains he used his experimental \\"inorganic matter transference\\" technology to heal and revive Ryder. Yatz explains he was rejected by the scientific community and became a science fiction write before finding a sponsor. He created a device that can map the atomic structure of inorganic objects and then \\"swap\\" them with others, rending one temporarily invisible and intangible. Yatz realized his criminal sponsors intended to kill him soon, and when he found Ryder he decided to hide his powerful device inside the man's body. Attaching the power source activated the device now in Ryder's forearm under his skin, healing the man. After destroying his scientific notes, Yatz explained that the device's \\"sub-atomic matrix\\" has been imprinted with Ryder's costume since he was wearing it when the scientist attached the power source. Now realizing Ryder also had a drug in his system, Yatz warns the drug may have been imprinted as well, meaning Ryder will once again be in a drug-induced state if he activates the device. The criminals arrive and murder Yatz before the scientist can say more. Touching his forearm, Ryder activates the Yatz device and becomes the costumed, chaotic Creeper, bringing the criminals to justice with physically enhanced abilities and healing. He later wakes up at his typewriter, having no real memory of his activities as the Creeper but knowing his alter ego will be an effective weapon against crime. =Death and Rebith= The Creeper appeared in the Eclipso: The Darkness Within crossover that happened in various DC Comics annuals in 1992. Tricked into being mentally controlled by the dark diamonds of the demonicEclipso, the Creeper is later freed by Bruce Gordon, the villain's longtime adversary. In the self-titled Eclipso comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon, and Gordon's wife Mona make a foray into a South American territory Eclipso has conquered. Later, the Creper joins government operative Amanda Waller and several heroes to fight against Eclipso. Called the Shadow Fighters, the group included Major Victory, the original Steel, and Wildcat II. In Eclipso issue #13, some of the Shadow Fighters venture into Eclipso's territory and engage the villain in battle. Eclipso uses his power to possess several hyenas, using them to track down the Creeper and literally tear him apart limb from limb, apparently killing him. The remains, along with those of other fallen heroes, are stolen from Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters. Years later, the new series The Creeper Volume 1 reveals that the Creeper's healing ability increased in order to compensate for the damage inflicted by Eclipso, allowing him to heal and resurrect. He also now exhibits a weaponized laugh that can cause pain and even stun opponents. The experience of death and resurrection is traumatic for Jack Ryder, who becomes a patient to the psychiatrist Dr. Solos. While undergoing therapy, Jack Ryder considers the possibility that he has inherited his mother's mental illness and may have only mistakenly believed the Creeper's personality is a result of drugs and a scientific device. He later realizes that he has conflicting memories of the Creeper's origin. In one version, he remembers buying costume leftovers before infiltrating a masquerade party. In another version, he remembers being drugged and shot before Dr. Yatz resurrected him. He realizes the different versions of this origin include elements that don't make much sense to him and concludes that none of these memories are accurate, that he has repressed the memory of his origin and his mind created other scenarios he found more acceptable. Ryder discovers Dr. Solos is actually his old enemy Proteus in disguise and learns the villain is somehow connected to his origin. Further information is not revealed, as The Creeper Vol.1 is cancelled. =Post- Infinite Crisis Reboot= Following the crossover Infinite Crisis, several areas of DC Comics continuity are revised again. Jack Ryder is a former journalist who now works as the host of a controversial political and news commentary TV show You Are Wrong!, where he regularly challenges criminals and politicians and often praises costumed vigilantes. Later on, Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders reveals that in the new history, Ryder briefly dated Gotham photojournalist Vicki Vale when he was younger. His ex-girlfriend Vera Sweet is now a producer and on-air reporter for the same network. When he realizes others are becoming suspicious of his connection to the notorious Creeper, Ryder pretends to be disillusioned by that particular vigilante, promising $1million to the person who catches the Creeper and brings him to face the law. The Creeper's new origin story is soon revealed in flashback in the mini-series The Creeper Volume 2. Years earlier, Ryder is interested in the work of scientist Dr. Vincent Yatz, who is combining stem cell therapy and microscopic nanotechnology to create a revolutionary \\"nanocell\\" treatment called \\"smart-skin.\\" This technology enhances a human body's regeneration, not only healing wounds but even preventing scarring and restoring burns. Local mobsters come to Yatz's lab to steal this new technology and Ryder accidentally interrupts when he arrives. Unable to escape but determined to keep the mobsters from taking his discovery, Yatz quickly injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into an unwilling Ryder. Believing that Yatz will create more nanocells if forced to, the criminals shoot Ryder in the head and throw him into the ocean. The smart-skin activates and revives Ryder, transforming him into a yellow-skinned superhuman with green hair and a mane of thick, red hair growing on his back and shoulders. The Creeper has Ryder's knowledge but acts as a separate personality. After the Creeper transforms back into Ryder, the TV host discovers he can still hear the Creeper's voice in his head, allowing them to communicate. Batman encounters the Creeper while on patrol and then investigates the Dr. Yatz case, discovering in the process that this new yellow-skinned vigilante is really Jack Ryder. Ryder and the Creeper learn that Yatz secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon and that tests on human subjects repeatedly resulted in mutated monsters. To achieve better results, Yatz took on a silent partner who introduced his own chemical \\"nerve agent\\" to the smart-skin, which resulted in Ryder's unique transformation into the Creeper. The silent partner is revealed to the Joker, and the \\"nerve\\" agent used was a version of his Joker venom, known to normally alter skin and hair color in victims while inducing temporary madness and uncontrollable laughter before killing them. In exchange for helping Yatz improve his results, the Joker wants to use the man's technology to create an army of maniacal, super-strong, near-invincible soldiers. Seeing the successful results with Ryder, the Joker refers to the Creeper as \\"family.\\" A similar batch of smart-skin is then used to turn dozens of others into maddened, yellow-skin soldiers with green and red hair. Batman and the Creeper defeat the Joker and his operation with Yatz. Batman creates a chemical agent that can cure Ryder of the Creeper and offers it to the TV host. Ryder decides to throw away the cure and instead forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals. This ends the flashback mini-series, and the Creeper shows up sporadically in other DC Comics stories, encountering Eclipso again and helping to fight the Sinestro Corps. During the crossover Final Crisis, Batman is believed killed. It is then revealed that Batman prepared for this eventuality by leaving instructions to recruit a team of heroes he trusts, tasking them to act as a new version of the Outsiders. The Creeper is recruited into this new team, though this version of the team lasts only a year. Later, Batman is revealed to be alive. =Reign in Hell= During the Reign in Hell miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co- inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to Hell by Lilith, the mother of all Earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar-looking species of demon. The Reign in Hell miniseries had many internal continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward. =The New 52= In 2011, DC Comics created a new version of its universe called the New 52. In this timeline, the Creeper is first seen in a brief cameo when he is considered as a candidate for a new United Nations-sanctioned Justice League International team.Justice League International Volume 3 #1 (November 2011) In Phantom Stranger #7 (2013), Jack Ryder is introduced as a talk show host at Morgan Edge's network who recently quit his job. After encountering the Phantom Stranger, Ryder is killed by a monster attacking Metropolis.Phantom Stranger #7 (June 2013) The Presence, in the form of a dog, notes that Ryder's story is not over, that he was not led to his death but rather to his destiny. In Katana #3 and #4 (June 2013), it is revealed that the New 52 version of the Creeper is a malicious and fearsome looking oni who regularly \\"rides\\" human hosts in order to cause chaos and violence. Unlike previous incarnations, this Creeper is a villain (though why he would be considered for membership in Justice League International earlier is never explained). This oni is revealed to be locked inside Soultaker, the mystical sword of the hero Katana, along with many other souls of enemies the blade has defeated over the centuries. When the villain Killer Croc breaks the sword, all the souls are released, including the Creeper who reveals that he sometimes whispered to Katana through the sword, pretending to be her dead husband. Seeking out a new body to \\"ride,\\" the Creeper discovers the recently deceased Jack Ryder and decides to possess it.Katana #4 (July 2013) The relationship between this oni Creeper and Jack Ryder is further explored in Justice League Dark #23.1 (subtitled Creeper #1), part of the Forever Evil crossover. The story reveals the Creeper's past in feudal Japan and describes him as a wild being who \\"justifies cruel temper tantrums under the guise of spreading chaos.\\" Although his appearance in the series Katana indicated the Creeper was defeated by Katana herself and that he has possessed Jack Ryder's body before, the origin revealed in Justice League Dark contradicts this by revealing the oni demon has been trapped inside of Soultaker since the days of feudal Japan, passing the time by tormenting the other imprisoned souls, and that he never and could never have met Jack Ryder before meeting him after being freed. Possessing Ryder's body results in Jack Ryder being resurrected, unaware that he now shares his body with an oni demon who occasionally takes over his form and uses him to cause chaos and death. Ryder is confused by his occasional black outs but continues working as a TV reporter for the show Life After Death. =DC Rebirth= The 2017 initiative DC Rebirth altered DC Comics continuity yet again, removing much of the New 52 changes and restoring several stories and ideas from comics published before 2011. Post DC Rebirth, the Creeper is reintroduced with his more classic appearance, once again the product of experimental science rather than a demon inhabiting a human host. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Jack Ryder becomes the Creeper to battle a Deathstroke copycat, then is recruited by Bizarro to join the Red Hood's team of Outlaws. In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Creeper is shown to have been captured by Kobra's cult until he is retrieved by Black Adam.Doomsday Clock #5 (May 2018). DC Comics. He and Black Adam later attack Israel.Doomsday Clock #7 (September 2018). DC Comics. Powers and abilities =Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths= The Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of Dr. Yatz's discoveries. Pre- Crisis, Jack Ryder transformed into the Creeper by holding and pressing the button of a small \\"activator\\" device he often kept in his pocket. This activated another device hidden underneath his skin that would rearrange molecules, immediately replacing Ryder's clothing with the Creeper's costume, yellow make-up, green wig, and red sheepskin cape. This would also activate a chemical Dr. Yatz had injected in Ryder, granting the Creeper superhuman strength, healing, and stamina. As soon as Ryder deactivated the Creeper costume and forced it to disappear, his superhuman powers would become dormant as well. Later comics indicated the Creeper also had superhuman agility and reflexes, allowing him to be an effective fighter and acrobat. His strength, balance, and agility enabled him to scale buildings with great skill and speed. = Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths = This version of the Creeper has the same powers as before, but owes them all to one device implanted in him rather than to a chemical agent and two devices. When he first becomes the Creeper, he is under the influence of drugs. As a result, each time he becomes the Creeper again, the device not only restores his powers and replaces his clothing with his costume, wig, and make-up but also alters his brain chemistry to mimic how it had been when he'd been under the influence of drugs. When the Creeper transforms back into Ryder, Ryder has trouble remembering the Creeper's actions. After seemingly being killed by being dismembered, the Creeper later turns up alive and it is now said that his healing ability is so great he is possibly immortal. After this revelation, the Creeper is able to stun and inflict pain with his laughter and Ryder now recalls some of the Creeper's memories, though now regards him as a distinct personality. = Post-Infinite Crisis = In this version of history, Jack Ryder is injected with \\"nano-cell\\" technology called \\"smart-skin,\\" an experimental science intended to create aggressive superhuman soldiers. The smart-skin is created with a combination of stem cell research, nano- technology, and the Joker's madness-inducing and pigmentation altering \\"Joker venom\\" chemicals. As a result, Jack Ryder physically transforms into a yellow- skinned, green-haired superhuman with a mane of red fur and its own distinct personality. The nano-cells that transform Ryder into the Creeper also rearrange the molecules of his clothing to become the Creeper's costume and vice versa. The Creeper has superhuman strength, agility, stamina, healing, and reflexes, and his laugh can be focused to inflict pain on targets. The Creeper and Jack Ryder are able to share information and mentally communicate. Other versions =Beware the Creeper= The 2003 Vertigo Comics series Beware the Creeper features a female Creeper living in a 1920s Paris in a world separate from the mainstream DC Comics canon. =Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again= The Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001‚Äì2002 miniseries Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, wherein he has already been struck fatally. He is impaled by \\"Joker Boy\\" as part of a revenge scheme against Batman. =Kingdom Come= In the 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come, The Creeper appears as an elderly metahuman who works for Batman's rogue faction of metahumans.Kingdom Come #2. DC Comics. =JLA: The Nail= In the 1998 miniseries JLA: The Nail, where the public has been convinced that metahumans are alien invaders thanks to a smear campaign masterminded by Lex Luthor and a part-Kryptonian Jimmy Olsen, the Creeper is imprisoned by Cadmus Labs, Lois Lane noting that she once saw him save a family from a psychotic gunman.JLA: The Nail #2. DC Comics. =DC One Million= The 1998 DC One Million event revealed the legacy of the modern DC heroes by depicting their successors who lived in the 853rd century. In the year 85,271 on the planet IAI, an entity known as RYDR senses a disturbance that may unravel all that is and transforms into its other, the sum total of collective unreason, shamanic avatar and raw distillate of madness known as the Creeper. The trail leads back to Jack Ryder, who grew tired of being a superhero. Jack and the Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of the Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and the Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.The Creeper Volume 1 #1,000,000 =Tangent Comics= In the Tangent Comics universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle. In one of the possible origin stories for the Earth-9 version of the Green Lantern, Creeper and the other members of the Black Circle task Zatanna to retrieve the mystical Green Lantern.Tangent Comics: Tales of the Green Lantern #1 (Sept 1998). DC Comics. =Amalgam Comics= Nightcreeper (Kurt \\"Jack\\" Ryder) of Amalgam Comics combines DC's Creeper with the Marvel Comics mutant hero Nightcrawler. Nightcreeper's debuts in JLX #1 (1996).

The gas and the chemicals transform him into the Creeper. The Creeper then goes on a crusade against the Joker to avenge himself (he's the first person that the Joker ever describes as a 'lunatic'), while frequently being sidetracked by an infatuation with Harley Quinn and his own stream-of- consciousness rambling. Batman manages to use a skin patch to suppress the Creeper, and informs Ryder he can still salvage his career. After Batman and Robin leave, Ryder thinks the situation over and removes the patch. Ryder begins chuckling, which soon becomes the Creeper's signature laughter. ** The Creeper made frequent non-speaking appearances in Justice League Unlimited as one of the sixty members of the extended Justice League international. * The Creeper appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Brian Bloom.

After the game begins, one of the early missions features Bruce Wayne rescuing Ryder from some thugs in Arkham City, Ryder revealing that he wound up in Arkham City after he began to investigate Hugo Strange's actions and motivations in creating Arkham City. He reveals information about Strange to Batman after he is saved. He is also on Deadshot's hit list and Batman must save him before he is killed. Additionally, an interview between Vicki Vale and Mayor Quincy Sharp can be heard that reveals vigilantes operating in Gotham, including the Huntress and the Creeper. * In the end credits of Batman: Arkham Origins, he is featured as heard interviewing several well known figures of Gotham City about the events that transpired during Christmas Eve involving Batman, the 8 assassins that were hired to hunt him down, and other villains involved.

The game was published by Midway Games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The PC version was published by Encore in North America and by Zoo Digital Publishing in Europe. In North America, the game was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in March, and for PC in June. In Europe, it was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May, and for PC in July. A version was also planned for the GameCube, but was cancelled prior to release. In 2017, the game was released on GOG.com by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the current owner of the IP after acquiring publisher Midway Games' assets following the latter company's bankruptcy in 2009. The game tells the story of Torque, a prisoner on death row for murdering his ex-wife and two children, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, saying he blacked out and cannot remember what happened. Shortly after he arrives in Abbot State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland, an earthquake hits the island, resulting in the prison being attacked by unusual supernatural threats. After being freed, Torque attempts to fight his way to freedom while confronting his own personal demons, all while attempting to remember what really happened to his family. The game features three endings, depending on the players' actions throughout, each of which reveals a different version of the murder of Torque's family. The Suffering received primarily positive reviews. Some critics felt the blend of action with horror didn't work, and that the game was not sufficiently scary. Others praised its deviation from traditional survival horror games such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Fatal Frame. Many also lauded the creature design, the tone, and the game's morality system, which determines both the ending, and how certain characters interact with Torque during the game. The Suffering was a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million units worldwide across all platforms. In 2005, a sequel was released, The Suffering: Ties That Bind. Gameplay The Suffering is an action game in which the player controls Torque, the player character, from either a first-person or third-person perspective, depending on their preference. The game is fully playable in both first and third-person views, with all actions available in both modes. Torque can run, shoot, jump, interact with the environment, interact with NPCs, and use items, such as flashlights, flares, flash grenades, TNT, shrapnel grenades, and molotov cocktails. Weaponry includes a shiv, an axe, a .357 revolver, a tommy gun, dual revolvers, a shotgun, an improvised flamethrower, and M2 Brownings. Other items which can be found during the game are Xombium tablets (which restores the player's health), paperwork with story content, maps, ammo, and flashlight batteries. Most of the enemies in the game are representative of different types of execution methods that have taken place on Carnate Island. Slayers represent decapitation, Marksmen represent death by firing squad, Mainliners represent lethal injection, Noosemen represent hanging, and Burrowers represent burial alive. Other creatures represent events from Carnate's history. Festers are the reincarnation of slave traders who ran their slave ship aground on Carnate, and left their slaves tied up in the hold to be eaten by rats, rather than freeing them. Infernas are the trapped spirits of three children who accused eleven innocent people of being witches during the time of a Puritan settlement on the island. The eleven people were burnt alive. HUD in third-person mode. Torque's health and insanity meter are on the bottom left. On the bottom right are, from top to bottom, his Xombium bottles, flashlight batteries, projectile weapon count, and ammo count. As Torque kills enemies during the game, an on-screen meter called his \\"Insanity meter\\" begins to fill. Once it is full, it begins to flash, and at this point, Torque can transform into a monster. In this form, Torque can tear enemies apart and can perform several powerful attacks. The more enemies Torque kills whilst in this form, the more powerful the monster becomes and the more combo moves become available. However, when in this form, Torque's health automatically depletes, and if he doesn't change back to his human form prior to his health meter fully depleting, he will die. A major part of the gameplay in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both Torque's own physical appearance (he will begin to look more and more healthier the more good he commits and less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. Plot Note: This plot synopsis details the \\"good ending\\" The game begins as Torque (who never speaks) is being escorted by CO Ernesto Alvarez (voiced by Mark Dias) onto death row in Abbott State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland, an island with a long and troubled history. Torque has been sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and their two children, although he claims to have blacked out during the incident, and can remember nothing. Shortly after entering his cell, an earthquake rocks the prison, and moments later, all of the inmates on death row except Torque are killed by strange creatures. One of the creatures opens Torque's cell, and he sets out to escape. After seeing several guards killed by the creatures, Torque uses security monitors to find the entire prison is under attack. He then gets a phone call from his dead wife, Carmen (Rafeedah Keys), telling him the island is more than a prison, that it brings out evil in everyone, and advising him to escape as soon as he can. Descending to the basement, he soon encounters the spirits of three of Abbot's most famous occupants. Dr. Killjoy (voiced by John Armstrong) was a psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an insane asylum on the island in the 1920s. Obsessed with discovering what is wrong with Torque, Killjoy appears as an image projected from 16 mm film projectors. Hermes T. Haight (John Patrick Lowrie) was the executioner in Abbot for twenty-seven years, before he committed suicide in the gas chamber. He appears as a green vapor formed into the shape of a human. Hermes is determined to drive Torque into unleashing the evil inside him. Horace P. Gauge (John Armstrong) was an inmate who was executed in the electric chair for murdering his wife during a conjugal visit. Full of guilt for his actions, he claims Carnate drove him to it, and wants to help Torque realize his decency. He appears in the form of electricity. They teach Torque how to unleash the anger inside himself and transform into a powerful monster, although the transformation is only in Torque's mind. Torque then encounters a fellow inmate, Dallas (Mark Berry), who he knows from his previous prison, Eastern Correctional Institution. They head through the eastern cellblock, where Torque has a vision of Carmen, who explains why she left him; when he was incarcerated for the second time, she knew she needed to make a change to her life. Torque and Dallas make it to the loading bay, and Torque heads to the control room, opening the doors, and allowing Dallas to escape. However, a fire starts, preventing Torque from following. He then hears a call from Consuela Alvarez (Meg Savlov), Ernesto's wife, asking Ernesto to call her. She tells him that herself and the girls are fine, but there is a fire in the nearby forest getting closer to their house. Torque heads to the western cellblock, where he has another vision of Carmen, telling him she is pregnant but is filing for divorce. Torque heads to the radio room, finding the radio is working, but something from the asylum is preventing communication with the mainland. Torque heads to the asylum, and encounters Killjoy, who is determined to \\"cure\\" him using his \\"Rebirth Machine.\\" Torque fights through a series of tests set by Killjoy before destroying all his projectors. Killjoy then tells Torque to return to the prison, where he will give him his diagnosis. Torque heads back to Abbot by way of the beach, where he encounters Clem (Ross Douglas), an elderly inmate who was in the middle of an escape when the earthquake struck. Clem has a small one-person boat ready to sail, but needs Torque's help fighting creatures emerging from a wrecked slave ship before he can leave. Torque sets fire to the wreck, enabling Clem to escape. He enters Abbot's sewer system where he encounters Horace, who tells him Abbot wants his soul. He then heads to the electric chair, destroying it and releasing Horace's spirit. Returning to death row, he finds Killjoy's diagnosis, and then returns to the radio room. Successfully sending a signal, he learns a Coast Guard vessel is on the way. However, Carnate's lighthouse is not working, and must be reactivated before the vessel can approach the island. Torque heads to the lighthouse, passing through the old military barracks, Fort Maleson. In the fort, he encounters Hermes, who forces him to fight. Torque defeats him by using pressurized gas to push Hermes into a furnace. He continues to the lighthouse, outside of which he meets Ernesto, who is trying to find his family. They restore power, and reactivate the lighthouse, arranging to meet the ship at the dock. They then head to the nearby village to look for Ernesto's family. The gate to town is locked, but in return for freeing his soul, Horace opens it. They then encounter a broken bridge, but, impressed with Torque's efforts to kill him, Hermes helps them cross. As they near the village, however, they are separated by a fire, and Ernesto goes on alone, telling Torque to get to the docks. As he arrives, he encounters Killjoy, who tells him to cure himself he must face what awaits him, and only by using the Rebirth Machine can he defeat it. Torque heads to the docks where he encounters a massive creature with a miniature version of himself protruding from its stomach. Torque fights and defeats the creature, finally remembering what happened to his family; when he arrived home, Torque overhears his wife screaming. Two thugs killed his entire family; one of the thugs beat his wife to death with a bat whilst the other drowned his youngest son, and threw his eldest son out of a window. Before leaving one of the thugs tells him \\"The colonel sends his regards. Back in Eastern he warned you... But you didn't listen. He said to leave you alive, only you. Enjoy your new life.\\" Torque heads to the docks and is picked up by the coast guard. On the boat, the captain recognizes him, and reveals that his case has been reopened after the prosecutor was indicted, and Torque will likely have a retrial. The game ends with the boat sailing away from Carnate. =Alternate endings= Bad ending After Torque defeats the creature, he remembers the murders. Realising that he was the one who killed his family; he smashed his wife's head in, drowned his youngest son, and threw his eldest son out of a window. When the coast guard arrives, Torque transforms into his monster state and kills him, before running back into the woods of Carnate. Neutral ending After Torque defeats the creature, he remembers the murders. During an argument with his wife, he pushed her, and she accidentally knocked her head against the bedside table. Seeing his mother dead, Torque's eldest son, Cory, drowns his younger brother and then jumps from the upstairs window, telling Torque, \\"You took her away, I'm taking us away.\\" When the coast guard arrives, Torque knocks him out and commandeers the boat, sailing away from Carnate. Development =Story and influences= The origins of The Suffering date back to early 2002, when Surreal Software game designer Richard Rouse III wrote a two-page pitch, which described the game as \\"a stylized horror shooter. The frenetic gameplay of Devil May Cry meets the horror setting of Resident Evil and the immersive game-world of Half-Life.\\" The basic design for the game originated from Rouse's negative experiences working on a western role-playing game called Gunslinger, which was eventually cancelled. Rouse felt Gunslinger had been too ambitious for its own good, especially a \\"morality system\\" which saw entire towns full of people react differently to the player character depending on what actions the player had taken earlier in the game. Finding this system impossible to implement effectively, Rouse envisioned The Suffering as having a \\"drastically stripped down morality system\\" with a much simpler AI system for tracking it. In looking for early inspiration for the game, the developers turned to horror films, with the team universally agreeing that their favorite such film was Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. According to Rouse, The influence of The Shining, and other horror films, also influenced how the developers handled the basic storyline, especially Torque's backstory; =Gameplay and design= An early decision on Rouse's part was that The Suffering be more of an action game than a traditional survival horror. This had implications for much of the design work on the game, as \\"it meant we were going to focus more on combat and avoid the long cutscenes, frail central characters, clumsy controls, fixed camera angles, and sparse ammo of many console horror games.\\" Another early decision was to keep the central character as much of a mystery as possible, implying only his strength and little else. Artist Mike Nichols says, \\"We didn't really want a character that looked of any particular nationality or race. He really is almost Neanderthal in appearance. He's very primal. We wanted that strength to come through.\\" Richard Rouse III, writer and lead designer of The Suffering. Creature design was also an important element in the development process, with the team determined to create a unique array of enemies. According to Rouse, After the team had done their initial creature design for the game, they sent their work to Stan Winston Studios, where Terry Wolfinger took the preexisting designs and finessed them, changed colors, added details etc. to make them more unsettling, referred to as \\"Stan Winstonizing them.\\" However, it was also important that the creatures, and the game as a whole, have a real world basis, so as to enhance the horror. Rouse explains, =Game mechanics= An important element in the design process was what Rouse refers to as \\"player-empowerment;\\" allowing players a great deal of freedom within the game world. A key concept in this was that the player's actions would work to determine the guilt or innocence of Torque; A great deal of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game originally had a target-lock system, based on the controls in Syphon Filter and Devil May Cry. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on \\"PC-style shooters\\" such as Half Life, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, \\"with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development we realized we had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun.\\" However, with the release of successful console third-person shooters such as Max Payne, Halo, Medal of Honor: Frontline, and SOCOM, all of which \\"eschewed target-lock in favor of double- stick control schemes that simulated the mouse/keyboard experience from the PC,\\" the team decided to scrap their target-lock system and go with a free aim system; \\"looking at the sales for these titles, we concluded the installed base of players who were familiar with these controls was now large enough that we could take the risk of turning off a few newbies. The change was a huge success for the game: it fixed the disconnect in our gameplay and added depth that had been completely missing.\\" =Announcement and promotion= The game was unofficially revealed on March 17, 2003, when Midway Games sent a list of upcoming games out to retailers. The list included The Suffering, which was described as \\"action-horror game set inside a prison.\\" The game was slated for an October 2003 release for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. Midway officially announced the game on April 15, calling it an \\"action-packed survival horror game set in a maximum security prison.\\" Helene Sheeler, vice president of marketing for Midway stated, \\"The Suffering redefines terror with a chilling look into a penitentiary haunted by apparitions of executed prisoners grotesquely reincarnated as the methods of executions that befell them.\\" It was also revealed the creatures in the game were designed by Stan Winston Studios. Several days later, Midway revealed the game's fictional prison, Abbot State Penitentiary, located on Carnate Island, off the coast of Maryland was partially based on Alcatraz, located on Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco. In the game, Abbot had been built from the remains of a World War II army base, whereas Alcatraz was originally a military prison. They also revealed the game would be M-rated, and the 3D game engine would draw the locations in real-time (as opposed to the 2D pre-rendered backgrounds found in the Resident Evil games). The game was first previewed at the E3 event in May. In September, Midway announced the game was being pushed back from October 2003 to early 2004. Of the delay, Richard Rouse III wrote, In October, Midway ran a promotional event in West Virginia State Penitentiary. A defunct gothic prison that is supposedly haunted, game journalists spent the night in the facility with representatives from Midway and Surreal Software. A demo of the game was available in the cafeteria of the building. On October 28, Midway announced the GameCube version had been cancelled, explaining \\"we want to concentrate on the leading platforms in the marketplace when it comes to launching original product. We are still publishing titles like Blitz and Hitz for the Nintendo GameCube, but for The Suffering we are concentrating on the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox.\\" The game went gold on February 23, 2004, with a North American release date set for March 8. David Zucker, Midway's CEO, projected revenues of $140 million for the fiscal year of 2004, an increase of over 50% from that of 2003. CFO Thomas Powell stated the targets were based primarily on the company's high hopes for The Suffering, and their \\"second tier of titles,\\" including NBA Ballers, MLB Slugfest, and Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, as well as titles coming later in 2004 such as Mortal Kombat: Deception, Area 51, and NARC. On May 5, Encore announced they would be releasing the game for Windows at the end of the month. =Audio= The music for The Suffering was composed by Erik Aho, who had previously worked with Surreal Software on Drakan: The Ancients' Gates. The original concept for the music and sound design was proposed by lead sound designer Boyd Post. The concept entailed creating \\"instruments\\" out of objects found in the environments depicted in the game, and using them to create both the sound design and the music, which would organically intertwine with one another. According to Post, Erik Aho further explains, Instruments were also created by Seattle musician/instrument designer Ela Lamblin. These included a Stamenphone (\\"a sort of cross between a waterphone and a tambura that can be bowed to create droning tonal melodies or struck for a percussive metallic resonating sound\\") and Orbacles (\\"hollow metal pods large enough to fit a person inside. These could be struck to create percussive impacts, bowed with superballs to create moaning ambiences and played like congas to create rhythms\\"). These were combined with other objects such as hubcaps, railroad spikes, hammers and glass jars. Metal rods \\"were about 8-10 feet long and were played by rubbing rosin-coated gloves lengthwise along the rods. These created otherworldly drones that were later put into a sampler, pitched up and down and layered to create ambiences. The rods were also struck to create violent shrieks and metallic percussive sounds.\\" A mounted bicycle wheel \\"was played by cranking the wheel and scraping different objects across the spokes.\\" Even strange events from the recording sessions at Robert Lange Studios made it onto the track. For example, according to Aho; Of the music as a whole, Aho says, =Digital distribution= In October 2008, the PC version of the game was released as freeware by the United States Air Force on FileFront (no longer available). On September 8, 2017, both The Suffering and The Suffering: Ties That Bind were released on GOG.com as DRM-free titles. Reception The Suffering received \\"generally favorable reviews\\"; the PC version holds an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-six reviews; the PlayStation 2 version 77 out of 100, based on forty-seven reviews; the Xbox version 77 out of 100, based on forty-four reviews. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazines Joe Rybicki scored the PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5, arguing it was not scary due to it being an action game, as opposed to a survival-horror. He wrote \\"if Fatal Frame is the gaming equivalent of The Shining, The Suffering is Friday the 13th.\\" Although he praised the morality system and the general gameplay, he concluded \\"I felt the psychological elements and the morality-play overtones were largely wasted on what is at its most fundamental level a fairly run-of-the-mill shooter.\\" Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell scored the PlayStation 2 version 7 out of 10. As with Rybicki, he felt the blend of action and horror elements didn't really work; \\"in trying to mix horror and action, The Suffering sets itself up for failure [...] once you shake off the anxiety you've been trained to associate with survival horror and just get on with it, it becomes something of a slog.\\" However, he felt the game did feature \\"some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights.\\" He further wrote \\"Certainly it's been well designed in places.\\" However, he concluded \\"The Suffering has some scary moments, but for the most part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It's a shame, because The Suffering could have been great. We're not asking for a carbon copy of Resident Evil or Silent Hill, but with a little more consideration, Surreal could have remoulded the experience a lot more effectively.\\" GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann scored the game 7.6 out of 10, writing \\"it might be a little too straightforward in spots, but it does make for a solid action game.\\" He concluded that \\"although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying to scare you, it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [But] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game.\\" GameSpy's David Hodgson scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3 out of 5, calling the game \\"Oz meets Clive Barker, drenched in the entrails of Stephen King. It's survival-horror with swears. It's the proof the ESRB is kidding Congress with the non-existent \\"Adults Only\\" rating. It's offensive, psyche-damaging, brutal, makes no sense, and is unforgiving and violent. And damn good fun.\\" Scott Osborne scored the PC version 4 out of 5, writing \\"The Suffering offers a smooth blend of survival horror and shooter action.\\" Of the PC port, he wrote \\"you'll find a few bugs, clipping problems, and occasional clunky moments when a character's important dialogue is interrupted by that of a scripted event, creating an audio muddle. It's a shame The Suffering didn't receive a bit more polishing and a major graphics upgrade for the PC. Still, with its well-designed levels, fluid pacing, and hyper-violent combat in eerie locales, The Suffering is a fun way to safely tap into your dark side.\\" Game Informers Jeremy Zoss scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.25 out of 10, writing \\"if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering is the equivalent of a splatter flick.\\" He concluded \\"while I have many positive things to say about this title, I cannot stress enough that it's not for everyone. Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering.\\" IGN's Aaron Boulding scored the game 8.5 out of 10, giving the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award. He called it \\"a great game, not just a great horror game,\\" writing \\"it succeeds as both a horrific thrill ride and fun action experience.\\" He concluded \\"In a genre that's overrun with sequels and lame attempts at horror, The Suffering is a breath of fresh death rattle. The action is intense, the creatures are actually creepy, and the story does not shy away from truly macabre elements. One cannot say enough about the horrific world that's been created here. Everywhere you look, every little thing you do, has been placed there to ratchet up the suspense and put you in an eerie state of mind.\\" =Sales= The Suffering was a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million units worldwide across all platforms. The game was also credited with putting Midway \\"back on the map\\" as a major video game publisher after several years of games underperfoming. In April, Midway announced their projected revenue for the first quarter of 2004 was $18 million, primarily due to the success of The Suffering. On April 6, Midway purchased Surreal Software. Midway CEO David Zucker stated \\"The positive market reception to The Suffering illustrates our ability to successfully develop and release entirely new properties that resonate strongly with the growing audience of sophisticated, mature gamers. The acquisition of Surreal Software Inc., the visionary developer behind The Suffering, strengthens our internal product development team and reinforces our ability to create high quality games.\\" Surreal's co-founder, and The Sufferings director Alan Patmore stated \\"We developed a great working relationship with Midway during the development of The Suffering and feel that partnering with them will allow us to increase the quality of our titles by providing us with additional resources--and by allowing us to leverage their resources and expertise. It's that simple. We just want to make great games and feel that the acquisition will help us accomplish this goal.\\" Film On September 8, 2005, Midway and MTV Films announced a film adaptation based on both The Suffering and The Suffering: Ties That Bind was in development. Stan Winston had signed on to work on the project, with producers Jason Lust and Rick Jacobs. No writers, actors or directors had yet been approached. However, there have since been no further developments, with the project presumably cancelled.

Tillicoultry is usually referred to as Tilly by the locals. One of the Hillfoots Villages on the A91, which runs from Stirling to St. Andrews, Tillicoultry is situated at the southern base of the Ochil Hills, which provide a spectacular backdrop. The River Devon lies to the south. The river also runs through neighbouring villages Dollar and Alva to the east and west respectively. The former mining village of Coalsnaughton lies just south, whilst Alloa lies southwest. The \\"hill\\" referred to in the first etymology is likely to be Kirkhill, at the east of the town. The alternative Latin etymology, Tellus culta, the cultivated land, suggested by Rev. William Osborne, minister of the parish from 1773 to 1794, is also possible. However, as both etymologies could equally be applied to a hundred places in Scotland, both are suspect, as neither define the town in a unique manner. History The estate of Tillicoultry was taken from Aleumus de Meser in 1261 by Alexander III for failure to render due feudal services.http://mercermillions.info/mercers_unattached/aleumus_de_meser_1190c.htm The estate had originally been received by de Meser's father, also Aleumus, from Alexander II. It was then granted to William Count of Mar and remained in possession of the Mar, and then by marriage of Margaret, Countess of Mar, to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, the Douglas family until 1483,Fraser, Sir William, The Douglas Book vol iii, p23, Eddinburgh 1885 when it changed hands to the ancestors of Lord Colville of Culross. By 1634 it was sold to Sir William Alexander of Menstrie (later, 1st Earl of Stirling). Between 1644 and 1840, ownership of the estate changed hands frequently. The origins of the village lie in the Westertown (previously Cairnstown) area, where the road to Stirling crossed the Tillicoultry Burn. It is thought that the centre of Westertown was probably in the area now known as Shillinghill. There are records of a Parish church existing in Tillicoultry from 1639, the current minister being Colin Coyle, who only recently replaced the shamed Neil McMurray, and knowledge of cloth manufacture dating from the 1560s. Traces of a Druid circle, sixty feet in diameter, were found in the eastern area of the parish at the end of the 18th century. A Pictish fortress stood upon the Castle Craig, near the current site of Craigfoot Quarry on Wood Hill, to the west of Tillicoultry Glen. This has long since been ruined, however legend has it that the stone of the fortress was employed in the building of Stirling Castle. Due to the rapid growth of the village during the 19th century, there were problems with overcrowding, poor housing, high infant mortality, water supply and drainage. In an attempt to address these problems, Tillicoultry Burgh was created in 1871. It lasted until 1975 when it disappeared as a result of local government reorganisation. A map of Tillicoultry from 1945 Around 1930, one of the first bus stations in the country was built at Murray Square to serve the eight bus services which terminated in the town. The original glass and cast iron shelters were replaced by modern shelters some time ago. Despite the growth in car ownership and the corresponding decline in public transport, Tillicoultry, and indeed all the Hillfoots villages, retain a regular bus service. The old Harviestoun estate, where Archibald Tait (1811‚Äì82), Archbishop of Canterbury, spent much of his boyhood, lies East- North-East of the village. Robert Burns visited the estate in the summer of 1787, during his stay he wrote The Banks of the Devon and Fairest Maid on Devon Banks. A commemorative cairn at the roadside, near the east lodge to Harviestoun, marks this event. =Industry= 19th Century use of water power along the burnside in Tillicoultry. The burn which runs off the Ochils and down through the glen into west of the village provided an attractive source of water for the early textile industry in Tillicoultry, being used for the washing and dying of wool. During the early 18th century a cloth known as Tillicoultry Serge was manufactured by weaving worsted with linen. By the time of the industrial revolution the burn was a recognised source of power, with the first mill being established in the 1790s. Many more textile mills were built along the burnside, by the 1830s, steam powered mills were introduced and by 1870 there were 12 mills employing over 2000 people. As the industry expanded, more workers were attracted to the village. The population of the parish, which had stood less than 1,000 at the turn of the 19th century, had grown to over 4,500 by the early 1850s. Textile mills and coal mines remained the biggest employers of the local population until the first half of the 20th century. In the 1950s the most recent colliery (map) to be worked, on the south bank of the River Devon, set new productivity records due to a high level of mechanisation. Its impressive adit entrance, now safely bricked up, can still be seen. In 1851, due to the importance of Tillicoultry as an industrial centre, it became the first Hillfoots village to have a rail connection. In 1921 Samuel Jones Limited established a paper mill at Devonvale, the current site of Sterling Furniture. In 1926, 33 people were employed at the site and the firm returned its first profit. By 1936, 238 staff were employed by the company. Sydney Platfoot was appointed Managing Director of the Devonvale works in 1922, he later went on to become town provost from 1930 to 1936. In 1964, the company merged with Wiggins Teape and by 1967 employed a fifth of the working population. Tillicoultry Quarries Ltd, as the name suggests, was established in 1930 by R.W. Menzies at Craigfoot Quarry Tillicoultry, and remains 100% owned by the Menzies family. Quarrying no longer takes places in Tillicoultry, the companies Head office is based in nearby Kincardine. Quartz-dolerite was first extracted in 1930 from the now inoperative Craigfoot Quarry (map), however quarrying had taken place on a smaller scale at the site since 1880. On 26 January 1949 the quarry was the site of a tragic explosion when a magazine containing 150 lb of explosive detonated killing quarryman Alexander Honeyman and blowing out doors and windows in the Shillinghill and Upper Mill Street area. =The Flood of 1877= Devastation in Upper Mill Street, following the flood of 1877. Following a particularly wet summer and torrential rainfall over a 12-hour period, Tillicoultry Burn burst its banks on the morning of 28 August 1877. Flooding was widespread throughout Strathdevon, both Alloa Railway station and Alloa Brewery were submerged, crops were destroyed around Tullibody and there was extensive property damage in Dollar also. The Alloa Advertiser described the rainfall as 'not simply heavy rain; it was a terrific downpour- persistent, incessant, it fell in bucketfuls- to use our expressive vernacular it came down like \\"hale water\\"'. Workers in mills to the west side of the burn were trapped in their workplaces, unable to cross Mill Street due to the flood water. By breakfast time the houses and shops of High Street were under three feet of water. Three people, Castle Mill owner William Hutchison, dyer William Stillie and Isabella Miller, a young factory worker, were swept away when the bridge on which they were standing collapsed into the flood waters. The collapse was probably due to the impact of water-borne debris upon the embankment on which the foundation of the bridge stood. Both William Hutchison and Isabella Miller perished in the torrent, however William Stillie was rescued further downstream. Despite exhaustive searches, Isabella Miller's body was not recovered for several days. It was eventually discovered at Glenfoot, where the burn joins the River Devon. The village was deprived of water and gas supplies for a week following the flood. The cost of repairs to the Burnside amounted to ¬£2,000.
