Biography Domenico dall'Oglio was born in Padua, Italy. He was probably a pupil of Giuseppe Tartini, either after 1721 when Tartini was appointed Maestro di Cappella at the Basilica di Sant'Antonio in Padua, or perhaps after 1726 when Tartini founded his violin school.Mooser proposes that Domenico dall'Oglio might have studied under Antonio Vivaldi: this idea stems from the erroneous assumption that Domenico was the son of a certain Pietro dall'Oglio, who was maestro di choro 1713-1718 at the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, where Vivaldi was active as a violin teacher for several decades. However, recent research has found that \\"Pietro dall'Oglio\\" was a pseudonym of Pietro Scarpari, an important figure at the Ospedale at the time. Another reason for Mooser's mistake may be the fact that Domenico dall'Oglio was very influenced by Vivaldi's style of composition. In 1732 dall'Oglio was appointed violinist at the Basilica di Sant'Antonio, but in 1735 he left Padua to go to Russia with his brother Giuseppe, a cellist. Both brothers remained in St Petersburg for nearly 29 years in the service of the imperial court. Court records make frequent reference to Domenico's activities as a virtuoso violinist and composer, and as a participant in the intrigues of the court. For relaxation he liked to build musical instruments – violins and lutes. He died in Narva, Estonia, on his return journey to Italy. Musical style Most of dall'Oglio's works are instrumental compositions, but at the imperial court of St Petersburg, in the absence of the maestro di cappella Francesco Araja, dall'Oglio was several times called on to produce music for the theatre. He was a master of the Italian virtuoso style of the eighteenth century, with frequent use of double-stopping and passages at high positions. Structurally his violin sonatas follow the shape Allegro-Adagio-Allegro, instead of the then customary structure Allegro-Grave/Largo-Allegro; noteworthy are the slow movements of his compositions, which have elaborate embellishments typical of the school of Tartini.

Description  Each trainset is composed by 3 or 4 cars: a power car (ALe 803), 1 or 2 trailers (Le 803.100), and a control car (Le 803.000). The numbers are ALe 803.001–053 for the power cars, Le 803.101–161 for the trailers, and Le 803.001–053 for the control cars.  History  The ALe 803 were conceived at the end of the 1950s to resolve the increasing problems of commuting around the larger cities of Italy. They were designed together with the ALe 601 series luxury railcars, with a similar structure and shared components. In 1959 the Ferrovie dello Stato ordered a first series of 20 trainsets, and a second series of 15 trainsets specifically conceived for the Naples metropolitan railway, with fewer seats and more austere interiors. Each set was made of three distinct cars - power car, trailer and control car. Those series were delivered from 1961 to 1963; the first were assigned to Rome, and in 1964 they were put in service in Genoa for its urban railway service. The FS were satisfied with those early trains, so in 1971a third series of 18 trainsets was ordered, ten 3 car sets and eight 4 car sets (with two intermediate trailers). These were delivered in 1972–1973. Beginning in the late 1970s the ALe 803 series trains were supplanted by the newer EMUs of ALe 801/940 and ALe 724. By 2009 only 15 of these trains were still in use. The last one was retired in 2015, train number 803-033.  Derived units  The EN 300 series trains for SEPSA, built in 1977, were derived from the ALe 803.Le napoletane... In: ″I Treni″ Nr. 320 (November 2009), p. 19.

It was published by Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries began to see the tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force. The book begins with a discussion of targeted killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, the choice of targets, and when and whether the ends can be used to justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuse of process. Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties. Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. The book was well received in law reviews and by academics across multiple disciplines. Robin Geiß and Steven J. Barela praised its coverage of the legal, moral, political, and strategic aspects of targeted killings. Steven R. Ratner welcomed its addition to the academic literature, and Madeline E. Cohen wrote that it would be a useful reference for additional research. Abraham David Sofaer praised its treatment of the subject and tables, though he argued the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model of the use of deadly force against individuals. Background Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World developed as an outgrowth from a conference in April 2011 that focused on philosophy and law. The conference took place at the Institute for Law and Philosophy of the University of Pennsylvania. Experts in the fields of public policy, politics, military regulations, battlefield knowledge, law, ethics, and philosophy discussed contemporaneous issues surrounding targeted killing in society. The conference was titled \\"Using Targeted Killing to Fight the War on Terror: Philosophical, Moral, and Legal Challenges\\" and was organized by the University of Pennsylvania Law School. At the time of the book's initial print publication date, its editor Andrew Altman worked as Professor of Philosophy at Georgia State University and concurrently as Director of Research at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics. Claire Finkelstein was the Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and concurrently as co-director of the University of Pennsylvania Institute of Law and Philosophy. Jens David Ohlin was employed as an Associate Professor of Law at Cornell Law School. Ohlin's work had been published in academic journals, including the American Journal of International Law, the Columbia Law Review, and the Harvard International Law Journal. He wrote the 2008 book Defending Humanity: When Force is Justified and Why with George Fletcher, which was also published by Oxford University Press. Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World was published in hardcover format by Oxford University Press on 30 April 2012. A paperback version was published at the same time. It was also published as an e-book for the Amazon Kindle by Amazon.com on 1 March 2012. In September 2012, the work was published at Oxford Scholarship Online. Content summary Predator drone, a weapon used in targeted killings Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World begins with an introduction by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries began to see the tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force. The first section of the book is a discussion of targeted killing of non-combatants. In an essay titled \\"Rebutting the Civilian Presumption: Playing Whack-a-Mole Without a Mallet?\\", Colonel Mark Maxwell criticizes the opposition of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to targeted killing. Maxwell writes that individuals may indeed serve a combat task without being a member of a particular state force. He argues for an extension of the definition of combatant to include those who arm themselves and engage in combat roles. \\"Targeting Co-Belligerents\\" by professor Jens David Ohlin supports Maxwell's opinion and describes an analytical viewpoint called \\"linkage\\" in which he states armed terrorists and members of organizations can be killed. Ohlin interprets the guidelines of the ICRC to include reliance upon a military system of identification of combatants. \\"Can Just War Theory Justify Targeted Killing\\" by professor Daniel Statman is an analysis of three thought processes used to discuss targeted killing rules: \\"contractualist\\", \\"collectivist\\", and \\"individualist\\". Statman writes that the tactic of targeted killing is a just form of combat in each of these analyses. New York University and Oxford University professor Jeremy Waldron deconstructs the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. He says that similar rationalizations could be used by the enemy against those conducting the targeted killings, there may be an inherent selection bias of targets, and warns of a slippery slope when defending an actor that uses the methodology. In the second portion of the book, a group of articles discuss which sets of laws should be used to regulate targeted killing. Philosophy professor Jeff McMahan of Rutgers University asks, \\"Targeted Killing: Murder, Combat or Law Enforcement?\\". He says that eliminating enemies for purposes of self-defense is justified. McMahan writes about the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuses of process. University of Pennsylvania law and philosophy professor Claire Finkelstein writes in \\"Targeted Killing as Preemptive Action\\" about the difficulties of rationalizing targeted killing outside of the realm of typical combat between state actors. Finkelstein characterizes people as noncombatants unless they are a member of a group that includes identification through standardized attire and criminal behaviour patterns. Mississippi College School of Law professor Richard V. Meyer writes that current regulations and standards for targeted killing are inadequate. He says that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties involved. The book's third group of essays analyzes the rationale of self-defence as a justification for targeted killing. Washburn University School of Law professor Craig Martin writes in \\"Going Medieval: Targeted Killing, Self-Defense and the Jus ad Bellum Regime\\" that self-defence is not an appropriate rationale for targeted killing because such a justification is restricted to conflicts between state actors. University of Tulsa School of Law professor Russell Christopher writes in \\"Imminence in Justified Targeted Killing\\" that self-defence should be ruled out as a suitable position in several examples of potential conflict. He critiques arguments by governments including the United Kingdom and the United States that self-defense can be used as a rationalization of action against imminent danger. Western Washington University emeritus philosophy professor Phillip Montague says in an essay titled \\"Defending Defensive Targeted Killings\\" that use of this tactic against combatants can be seen as defensible and justified acts against terrorism or those who assist terrorist organizations. The fourth portion of the book discusses how to make specific choices in targeted killing situations prior to state actors carrying out actions against individuals. University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law professor Amos N. Guiora discusses \\"The Importance of Criteria-Based Reasoning in Targeted Killing Decisions\\" and concludes that instead of combatant commanders in the field, lawyers in consultation with decision algorithms must make decisions on targets. Pepperdine University School of Law professor Gregory S. McNeal critiques the arguments of those against targeted killing in his essay, \\"Are Targeted Killings Unlawful? A Case Study in Empirical Claims Without Empirical Evidence\\". He differentiates between decision-making processes of the United States military and those of the Central Intelligence Agency, emphasizing the U.S. military tactic of attempting to avoid collateral damage. Ave Maria School of Law associate professor Kevin H. Govern examines the killing of Osama Bin Laden in his piece \\"Operation Neptune Spear: Was Killing Bin Laden a Legitimate Military Objective?\\". He says this particular killing was justified and borne out of a rational decision-making process. American University Washington College of Law professor Kenneth Anderson distinguishes the use of military drones from targeted killing in his article \\"Efficiency in Bello and ad Bellum: Making the Use of Force Too Easy?\\". He says targeted killing as response to threats and to prevent potential terrorist attacks is justified. The final portion of the book analyzes consequentialism within the scope of normative ethics and deontological ethics. Florida State University Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar Fernando Tesón writes in his essay \\"Targeted Killing in War and Peace: A Philosophical Analysis\\" that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. University of Illinois law and philosophy professor Michael Moore says in \\"Targeted Killings and the Morality of Hard Choices\\" that targeted killing can be seen as justified through both deontological and consequentialist models. University of Pennsylvania School of Law professor Leo Katz writes in \\"Targeted Killing and the Strategic Use of Self-Defense\\" that there is a danger of a state government artificially generating instances in which it asserts it must use targeted killing in self-defense. He warns against situations in which governments find it easier to kill terrorists than to put them through due process of law. Katz concludes that current regulations support targeted killing because existing law does not consider his argument and justifies the tactical elimination of terrorists. Reception Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World was reviewed in the European Journal of International Law by University of Potsdam international and European law professor Robin Geiß. The reviewer wrote that the book \\"is a thought-provoking contribution that takes a refreshingly broad and timely approach in addressing the legal, ethical, and strategic-political dimension of the contemporary debate over targeted killings\\". Geiß concluded, \\"There is some overlap between the chapters, their relationship is not always evident, and as much as the interdisciplinary approach of this volume is to be appreciated, assembling and interlinking the different legal, ethical, and political findings in an overarching, concluding chapter would have been particularly useful. Nevertheless, the book reflects the entire spectrum of diverging views on the matter, and adds an important impetus to move the current debate forward.\\" Assistant Professor and Head of Reference at Leonard Lief Library, Lehman College, City University of New York, Madeline E. Cohen wrote in an article for the International Journal of Legal Information, \\"Within the context of moral and legal principles, and military strategy, the subject of targeted killings is analyzed in great detail. These essays are interdisciplinary in their approach, and give various sides of arguments on this rich subject.\\" She concluded, \\"An excellent introduction by Andrew Altman provides an overview of 'Our Asymmetric World' and models used to combat terrorism. References, tables of cases and legal instruments are included making this an excellent reference for further research.\\" Abraham David Sofaer reviewed the book for the Texas Law Review. Sofaer wrote, \\"It is a beautiful book: large, with print size that is easy on the eyes, and with sufficient space between lines of text to make the complex material at least visually digestible. It has useful tables of cases, instruments, legislation, and abbreviations, as well as an index.\\" He commented, \\"it should be clear that a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject.\\" Sofaer said that the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model of how and when to use deadly force against individuals. The collection also received a review from University of Geneva postdoctoral research fellow in the faculty of law, Steven J. Barela, in the Journal of International Criminal Justice. Barela described the book as \\"a constructive work with a wide purview onto one of the most pressing and difficult policy questions of our time\\". He stated, \\"this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues\\". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, \\"In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners.\\" University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, \\"Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict\\". He concluded, \\"[the book's] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group\\".

His main research field focused on the avifauna of islands, including Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tenerife, the Azores, and Kiritimati. Other interests include insects and spiders, of which Ashmole discovered and described some new taxa. Career In 1957, Ashmole graduated to Bachelor of Arts in Zoology at Brasenose College in Oxford. In the same year he became a research student at the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology (EGI) and accompanied the scientists' couple Bernard and Sally Stonehouse and the ornithologist Doug Dorward on a two-year expedition of the British Ornithologists' Union to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. Ashmole studied here the breeding and moult cycles of terns, which he wrote about in his Oxford doctoral thesis, entitled The Biology of Certain Terns: With Special Reference to Black Noddy Anous tenuirostris and the Wideawake Sterna fuscata on Ascension Island.Ted Anderson: The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology, p 167, Oxford University Press, 2013. In 1960, Ashmole married Myrtle Jane Goodacre, whom he met at a students' conference in 1957. Myrtle Goodacre worked as researcher and librarian at the EGI and became Ashmole's collaborator in many research projects. The couple has one son and two daughters. Postdoctoral Ashmole worked as demonstrator at the University of Oxford in 1960. He also was active as a research officer at the EGI until 1963. Through the mediation of David Lack, who worked with G. Evelyn Hutchinson at the EGI, Ashmole received a summer research fellowship at the Peabody Museum of Yale University. Subsequently, the Ashmoles spent a year in Hawaii on a Yale fellowship at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum from where they studied feeding ecology and breeding cycles of terns and other seabirds on Kiritimati, as well as trying to assess the effects of nuclear weapons testing on sea birds. Subsequently, Ashmole served as assistant and associate professor at Yale University, where he did research work until 1972. From 1972 to 1992 he held the post of lecturer and senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. Ashmole collected subfossil material of extinct bird species, including the Saint Helena hoopoe,Storrs L. Olson. (1975). Paleornithology of St Helena Island, south Atlantic Ocean.

During a month-long research period on fossil birds on Saint Helena in 1959, Ashmole and his colleague Doug Dorward discovered the forceps pincers of the Saint Helena earwig, a species which was rediscovered in 1965 for a short term. Philip and Myrtle Ashmole are also active in the nature conservation movement. Most notable is the restoration of Carrifran Wildwood in the Southern Uplands of Scotland. For that and other projects the Ashmoles helped to found the Borders Forest Trust, an environmental charity, in 1996, of which Philip Ashmole has been a long- serving trustee. In 2015, Philip and Myrtle Ashmole received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RSPB Nature of Scotland Awards.RSPB Nature of Scotland Awards: List of Winners Ashmole's halo Ashmole's work on Ascension Island led him to propose a hypothesis about how large concentrations of seabirds might be able to deplete forage fish resources in the vicinity of their breeding colonies, creating a zone of reduced food availability that would influence foraging and breeding success and behaviour. This zone was later termed \\"Ashmole's halo\\" by other researchers. The concept has since been widely used in ecological studies of seabirds, and found to apply in varying degrees to many different species and ecological regions. Works (selected) *P. Ashmole, M.

He is a major figure on the Islamist side of the 2014 Libyan Conflict and founder of the LROR group which is considered \\"terrorist\\" by the internationally recognized Libyan parliament. He is reported to have rigged proceedings of the General National Congress while serving as its president.  Biography  He was originally elected to the GNC as member for Zuwarah. He had some support from the Muslim Brotherhood, but stood as an independent candidate. He has denied strong links with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, he was the Islamist candidate for president of the Libyan General National Congress, but was considered a compromise candidate acceptable to more liberal members of the congress. As a result, he became GNC president on 25 June 2013. He had the support of the Muslim Brotherhood's party, the Justice and Construction Party, in his election. On becoming GNC president, Abusahmain was the first Libyan Berber to attain a national leadership role since the Tripolitanian Republic of 1918–22. Abusahmain immediately set up an Islamist armed group, the LROR, which attempted an Islamist coup in October 2013. He suppressed debates and inquiries which the Islamist part of the GNC did not want, including a debate over his alleged illegal diversion of money towards the LROR. During Abusahmain's presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups. He played a part in the constitutional crisis which emerged when Islamist Ahmed Maiteeq was supposedly elected prime minister in a GNC session in April 2014 which was intimidated by armed Islamist militants bursting into parliament. Although the Deputy Speaker, Justice Ministry, Supreme Court and opposition parties rejected the proceedings as illegal, Abusahmain signed a decree confirming Maiteeq According to supporters of the eastern government, his term ended when the new House of Representatives was established on 4 August 2014. He was succeeded by Abu Bakr Baira, the interim head of new parliament. He was also GNC representative for his Amazigh (i.e. Berber) hometown of Zuwarah, in the west of the country.

The technology is of increasing interest as car and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers continue to increase efficiency, saving fuel and reducing emissions.  Thermal losses of an internal combustion engine  While technological improvements have greatly reduced the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines, the peak thermal efficiency of a 4-stroke Otto cycle engine is around 35%, which means that 65% of the energy released from the fuel is lost as heat. High speed Diesel cycle engines fare better with around 45% peak efficiency, but are still far from the maximum theoretical efficiency, with 55% of the fuel energy content rejected as heat.  Exhaust heat recovery technologies  = Rankine = Rankine cycle systems vaporize pressurised water using a steam generator located in the exhaust pipe. As a result of the heating by exhaust gases, the fluid is turned into steam. The steam then drives the expander of the Rankine engine, either a turbine or pistons. This expander can be directly tied to the crankshaft of the thermal engine or linked to an alternator to generate electricity. UK researchers at Loughborough University and the University of Sussex concluded that waste heat from light-duty vehicle engines in a steam power cycle could deliver fuel economy advantages of 6.3% – 31.7%, depending upon drive cycle, and that high efficiencies can be achieved at practical operating pressures. = Thermoelectric generators (TEG) = A second technology, thermoelectric generators (Seebeck-, Peltier-, Thomson effects) is also an option to recover heat from the exhaust pipe, but has not been put to practical use in modern cars.  Exhaust Heat Recovery on internal combustion engines with Rankine Cycle Systems  = Passenger cars = Facing the new American, European, Japanese or Chinese regulation, more and more stringent concerning CO2 emissions, exhaust heat recovery sounds like one of the most efficient ways to recover a free energy, since heat is generated in many ways by the engine. Numerous companies develop system based upon a Rankine Cycle:  BMW  The German company has been one of the first major to study exhaust heat recovery with a Rankine system called Turbosteamer.  Chevrolet EGHR  The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid car features an Exhaust gas Heat Recovery (EGHR) system to accelerate coolant heat up time. This gives faster heat up of the engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less fuel is used giving reduced emissions. This will also quicken cabin heating warm up for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can warm the battery pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system. When the engine is warmed up the exhaust gas is diverted to a by-pass pipe.\\"2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery: Feature Spotlight\\" By Aaron Brzozowski, GM Authority, April 2, 2015  Honda  Honda also develops a module based on a Rankine Cycle to improve overall efficiency of hybrid vehicles, by recovering the heat of the engine and turning it into electricity for the battery pack. In the US highway cycle, the Rankine cycle system regenerated three times as much energy as the vehicle's regenerative braking system.  Exoès  A French company, Exoès is specialized in designing and manufacturing exhaust heat recovery systems based on Rankine Cycles. The system EVE, Energy Via Exhaust, leads to fuel savings from 5 up to 15%.  Barber Nichols  Barber-Nichols Inc. develops Rankine technologies for vehicles.  FVV  The German consortium unites the majority of internal combustion engine manufacturers across the world. Two task forces are currently studying exhaust heat recovery systems on passenger cars. = Trucks = Renault Trucks: As a part of the All For Fuel Eco Initiative, Renault Trucks studies a Rankine system for long distance vehicles that could lead to 10% fuel savings. The goal is to produce enough energy to feed the components and electronic auxiliaries with electricity and reduce the fuel consumption by reducing the load on the alternator. = WildFire Heat Recovery System (WFHRS) = Double Arrow Engineerings' WildFire Heat Recovery System (WFHRS) is under development and utilizes wasted heat from both coolant and exhaust. This system mechanically adds power back to the drive-line, utilizing a Rankine engine as the energy conversion method. The WFHRS is designed for a variety of different applications, both fixed and variable RPM, aftermarket and OEM applications, but generally geared toward larger equipment such as large on- highway trucks, diesel generators, large buses and motor-homes, marine vessels, medium duty trucks, etc. = Trains = IFPEN, Enogia and Alstom are developing a system called Trenergy dedicated to improve train fuel efficiency. = Exhaust heat recovery in sport = Fuel efficiency, reduction of CO2 emissions, reliability and costs are necessary parts of Formula 1 manufacturers’ strategies. Automobile sport is also a good place to trial and assess technologies that, once made reliable, and with costs reduced by experience in production, can be adapted to private cars. Formula 1 constructors produced one of the first exhaust heat recovery systems, and nowadays these devices are essential parts of embedded technologies on F1. Heat recovery was scheduled to become mandatory in the 2014 F1 Championship.

He served as chairman of the East India Docks Company, and was deputy master of Trinity House. He was also (briefly) a Member of Parliament. Mariner Woolmore was born in Whitechapel. Little is known of Woolmore's life before he went to India in 1768, aged 12, aboard the East India Company ship, the Granby, returning to England in 1770. He joined the Marine Service of the East India Company, and was a midshipman on the Company's ships Duke of Richmond and Stormont, and then second mate on Earl of Chesterfield. He served as second mate on Harcourt, trading to America from 1774 to 1777, with a brother as third mate. He married his first wife, Margaret Wickham Mason, in December 1778. He was third mate on the East India Company ship from 1779 to 1781, and was then second mate on Earl of Chesterfield from 1781. Shipowner Woolmore remained in India in 1782 to become the captain of a \\"country ship\\", a privately owned merchant vessel, and then became part-owner and commander of a ship trading between India, Malaya, and China. He made two voyages between England and China as captain of Earl Talbot from 1788 to 1791. His first wife died in December 1788, and Woolmore married his second wife in January 1790. Harriet Turner was the daughter of John Turner, and sister of Charles Hampden Turner. Woolmore went on to own or part-own seven merchant vessels trading in the East Indies - Earl of Wycombe, Earl Howe, Admiral Gardner, Lord Duncan, , Harriett and Huddart. He was a partner of Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet. He also became a partner with his brother-in-law Charles Hampden-Turner and Joseph Huddart in a business producing rope and cordage. He had given up his commercial interests in East India shipping and his stock in the East India Company before 1813. East India Docks Company and Trinity House Woolmore was deputy chairman of the East India Docks Company from 1803 to 1819, 1822 to 1824, and 1827 to 1892, and acting chairman in 1826–7, 1830-1 and 1834–5. Roads near the docks are named after individuals connected with the company, and Woolmore Street in Poplar is named after him. He became an elder of Trinity House in 1803, and was deputy master of Trinity House from 1825 to 1834. He was a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation from 1811, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1830. MP With William Jacob, he served as one of two Members of Parliament for Westbury, from 1806 to 1807, having purchased the seat from the trustees of Montagu Bertie, 5th Earl of Abingdon. He stood unsuccessfully for St Ives in the 1807 general election. Later life He was a friend of William IV, and became a knight bachelor in March 1834 and a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH) later in 1834. He left most of his property to his wife and her brother. No children are known. He is said to have been one of the last men in London society to wear a pigtail.

The article of Italian Wikipedia on Campanile Basso cites an altitude of 2877 meters. It is of a slender, almost fully vertical shape on all sides, rising 300 metres straight up. The mountain is named for its similarity in shape to a belltower (It.: campanile) and it being low (It.: basso) compared to the neighboring Campanile Alto and Brenta Alta. The German alpinist Karl Schulz introduced in 1884 the name Guglia di Brenta (\\"Guglia = \\"spire\\"),Zeitschrift des Deutschen u.

Around the turn of the century a competitive race for the first ascent started, which took inspiration from the emerging nationalistic feelings in the region, as much as from the ascent of rock climbing as a sport. Most of the illustrious forebears of modern rock climbing climbed this mountain during the first half of the Twentieth century. Climbing history The first men to undertake an ascent were Carlo Garbari, Antonio Tavernaro and Nino Pooli, all from Trentino. They climbed on August 12, 1897 along the route that is now known as the Via Normale, scaling the so-called parete Pooli (\\"Pooli wall/face\\") and traversing over a horizontal ridge called Stradone Provinciale proceeding vertically on the west side towards a small pulpit now known as Albergo al Sole towards the tiny Terrazzino Garbari. From here there were only 35 meters remaining to the top, of which Pooli covered twelve, but then further progress was considered impossible. Garbari, who had threatened Pooli to \\"finish the climb or die\\", left behind a note saying \\"Who will reach this note? I wish them better luck!\\"Ewald Weiss, Campanile Basso/Guglia di Brenta, 100 Jahre Alpingeschichte am \\"Welträtsel am Stein\\", 1999 On August 16, 1899 two students from Innsbruck, Carl Berger and Otto Ampferer, followed the same route. They had been unaware of the attempt two years earlier, but found a climbing hammer, empty wine bottles, and finally Garbari's note. They failed to pass the same crux, but after taking a rest day came back and found a traverse towards the north face from where they could climb to the summit through what is now known as the parete Ampferer, gaining the first ascent of Campanile Basso on August 18, 1899. (Via Normale, III/IV) Nino Pooli returned in 1904 to climb at last the part that he couldn't master in 1897 (Via Pooli- Trenti, V+, W wall, 35 m.). The Via Normale was indeed a winding trajectory but remained the only existing route to the top until 1908. In that year a young German lawyer and his dashing American friend decided to climb this mountain from its very base where the big shoulder on its west side sticks out. Rudolf Fehrmann and Oliver Perry-Smith thus traced a completely new route along the south-west dihedral up to the top of the shoulder and from there connecting to the Via Normale (Via Fehrmann, IV+, SW dihedral, 350 m.). Paul Preuss came in 1911 and -after making the second ascent of the Fehrmann route- climbed in solitary a completely new and much more direct and elegant itinerary on the east face that goes straight up from the Stradone Provinciale (Via Preuss, E wall, 110 m., V/IV). King Albert of Belgium (le Roi Alpiniste) climbed Campanille Basso in 1933 by the Via Preuss, giving name to the Terrazzino Re dei Belgi. Giorgio Graffer traced two classical routes in 1933-'34 on other sides of the mountain: (Spigolo Graffer (NE edge) - 110m - V (1933) and Via Graffer - SW edge - 380m - V+ (1934)). During the next decades another number of classical climbing routes was opened: Via Armani (N wall) - 200m - V/VI (1934), Via Fedrizzi-Armani (S wall) - 260m - VI (1935), Spigolo Fox (SE edge) - 110m - V+ (1937), Via Cristina - NW edge - 380m - VI- (1947), Via Rovereto - W - 380m - VI/A2 (1961), Via Stenico-Navasa (S wall) - 380m - VI/A2 (1962), Via Maestri-Claus (N wall) - 110m - VI/A1 (1965), Via Schubert- Werner (SW edge) - 380m - VI (1968). Every alpinist of note during the first half of the twentieth century made an ascent by one of these itineraries or the innumerable variants thereof. In 1940 the number of entries in the summit book had reached the magic number of thousand. By 1970 that number had been multiplied by five.

That top consists of a roughly square plateau with a small platform on which a set of tubular bells is placed, along with a small crucifix and a summit book. Because the numbering of the entries in the book has become irregular since 1963 it is difficult to ascertain the exact number of ascents since 1899. The descent is done by double rope abseil, roughly along the lines of the Via Normale. For this purpose large ringed pitons are put in place with minimal intervals of 25 meters. In 1936 a via ferrata, the so-called Via delle BocchetteVia ferrata (section Via delle Bochette: the Classic Via Ferrata) was traced along he foot of the mountain passing over the Bocchetta del Campanile BassoThis part of the itinerary was dedicated in 1936 to the Jewish Italian financier and alpinist Otto Gottstein. see Castiglioni, page 177. and the Bocchetta del Campanile Alto.Enzo Gardumi, Fabrizio Torchio: Dolomiti di Brenta, Casa editrice Panorama, Trento 1999, page 144-145, This route is the best way to approach the mountain and/or to get an impression of Campanile Basso from close by. Context Trentino was 'Welshtirol', part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1899. But the spirit of Irredentismo was firmly present among the local alpinists, who had founded their own Società deli Alpinisti Tridentini. Legend has it that Berger and Ampferer, during their first ascent of Campanile Basso had planted a small but 'Germanic' flag on the top and that a few days later Nino Pooli and Riccardo Trenti climbed to the top again to replace that flag by a 10 meter wide yellow-bleu Alpinisti Tridentini flag.Pubblicazione commemorativa della Società degli alpinisti tridentini nel suo cinquantenario (1872–1922), Trento, SAT, 1922, pag. 60. See also the article on Campanile Basso in Italian Wikipedia. Hanns Barth in Zt.sch. DÖAV 1907, page 335, seems unaware of this flag issue. He names a certain Pfann and Leberle from Munich as the second climbers and himself (& co, in 1901) as the third. The first Italian to stand on Campanile Basso was probably Tita Piaz on 26 September 1902, when he climbed to the summit with Franz Wenter. A big yellow-blue flag display could have happened in 1904, when Pooli and Trenti traced the Via Pooli. There were other flag incidents, like the one on Cima Brenta in 1912. A.o. Silvio Girardi: Molveno, Andalo, Fai della Paganella, Manfrini 1973, page 203. The fate of its first climbers would have a sometimes strangely connected place in the turmoil of the two World Wars. Ampferer became an important geologist and member of the Austrian Scientific Academy while Berger fell on the front lines during the First World War in 1915. Garbari continued as an Alpine Guide and played a role in the First World War and the accession of Trentino to Italy. Perry Smith left Europe at the start of the First World War, and Fehrmann became a Nazi during the Second World War and died under dire circumstances in Soviet political detention. Paul Preuss died young in a fall on the Gosaukamm in 1913, two years after his exploits on Campanile Basso. The Nazis tried to eradicate the memory of Preuss, who was of Jewish descent, but he is now regarded as a hero and a founding father of free climbing. King Albert, hero of the First World War, died in 1934, a year after his ascent of the Via Preuss, also in a fall, at Marche-les-Dames. Giorgio Graffer was shot down in his fighter aircraft over Albania in 1940.

Biography He was born in New York City, and graduated at Columbia College. He took up a business career for 20 years, and then entered Virginia Theological Seminary. He was ordained a deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1830, and that same year also became a priest. He was a philhellene, and in 1830 he went as a missionary to Greece. At Athens he and his wife, Frances Maria Mulligan Hill (1799-1884), who he had married in 1821, established schools for girls and boys. These were the first Athenian schools founded after Greece's secession from the Ottoman Empire. Also part of their mission was John J. Robertson, an Episcopal clergyman. He set up a printing press. The Greek government eventually founded a school for boys, and the Hills decided to devote their attention to educating girls. In their educational work, the Hills made no effort to promote their own church, but were careful to work with the Greek Orthodox Church and the government, by which they were officially recognized in 1834. The Hills also founded a high school for the training of teachers. Their work at first received little encouragement, but prospered after pupils from prominent and wealthy Greek families began to attend the school. Hill was chaplain of the British Legation in Greece from 1845 to 1875, and continued his teaching during that time. He and his wife also founded a free school for the poor. He went blind around 1877, but with his wife's assistance continued to direct their educational efforts. In 1881, on the 50th anniversary of the girls' school, he was officially thanked by King George I of Greece. On his death at Athens, the Greek government, in recognition of his educational work among the women of Athens, buried him with the honors of a taxiarch, and the Athenian municipality erected a monument to his memory. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by Harvard and Columbia. Frances Hill also died in Athens. The school that the Hills founded is still in operation in Athens under the name of the Hill Memorial School.

He previously played in the Scottish Premier League with Partick Thistle. Career Howie joined Partick Thistle from their youth set-up in 1999 and made his first team debut against Queen of the South at the age of sixteen in May of that year. A few months after he signed a new contract with the Jags in April 2001, his career was interrupted after a serious assault in a Glasgow street left him with a fractured skull, spending a month in hospital with his future as a player in doubt. Howie returned to the Partick first team in November 2003, by which time the club had been promoted to the Scottish Premier League, and made eleven appearances before the end of the season, which ended in relegation. After his release by Partick Thistle in 2005, Howie joined Junior side Glenafton Athletic under the management of his former Thistle boss Gerry Collins. He moved on to local East Ayrshire rivals Cumnock Juniors in the summer of 2011 before signing for Pollok in June 2013. Despite being named captain, his spell with the club ended with a suspension after he was sent off following an altercation with an opponent in a fixture against Auchinleck Talbot; Pollok were relegated at the end of the season. Championship Manager Howie's name became well known around the world to fans of the Championship Manager football video game series, after some of its versions produced around the time of his breakthrough at Partick Thistle coded his potential abilities generously, whereby he would develop into one of the world's finest players. In an interview for a book based around the series, Howie stated that he had been \\"addicted\\" to playing the game and would always sign 'himself', often seeking a partnership with Mark Kerr, another Scottish midfielder of the era whose elevated profile in the virtual universe brought him extra attention in real life.

It was founded in 1999 by enologist and entrepreneur Susana Balbo.  History  After twenty years of working as a consultant winemaker both in Argentina and around the world, Susana Balbo decided to open her own winery. In 1999, Susana rented a small winery and began her first batches of wine. Initially the production was quite small. The first batches of the Susana Balbo and Ben Marco lines were released in August 2000. The period between 2001–2009 was a time of both internal and external expansion for the company. The groundbreaking for the current winery occurred in 2001. During the same year, the proprietary vineyard was planted. Over the next eight years, the winery had several renovations. A barrel room was added in addition to an on-site bottling and storage plant. With each renovation the winery capacity grew significantly. At the same time, the portfolio of the winery was completed. From 2010 through the present, the winery has undergone significant internal organizational changes. During this time both of Susana’s children decided to join the family business. Her son Jose received his enology degree from UC Davis and works as both the winemaker and the export manager. Ana, her daughter, has a degree in Business Administration from Universidad de San Andres and is the manager of the marketing department. In 2013, Edgardo del Popolo was appointed CEO of Dominio del Plata. Also in 2013, the restaurant Osadia de Crear opened at the winery. This project was spearheaded by Ana and Chef Jose Cacciavillani. The restaurant offers fusion dishes of Mediterranean and Argentine inspiration, as well as deli sandwiches and salads.  Susana Balbo  Susana Balbo was born in Mendoza, Argentina to a traditional Italian family. Wine was always a big part of her life as she was growing up “My first memory is not actually mine, it’s told to me by my parents. In my childhood, the beverage for kids was water with a drop of wine to taint the color. So my parents gave me a full glass of water with a few drops of wine, and it seems I liked it as a 3-year old. They say they looked to the side, and I was taking the bottle to pour a full glass of wine!” She opted to become a wine maker and graduated from Don Bosco University in 1981 with a degree in enology. Upon graduating, Susana became the first female enologist in the history of Argentine winemaking. Susana’s first job as a winemaker was at Michel Torino winery in the Salta province. At Michel Torino, Susana was put in charge of further developing the Torrontes varietal, which is native to Argentina. She stylized the wine so that it showed a very floral nose, with a refreshing citrus taste. To this day, she is credited with being the creator of this distinctive and popular style earning her the nickname “Queen of Torrontes.” After working in Salta, Susana returned to Mendoza to work in wineries including Bodega Martins and Bodega Catena Zapata. She founded Dominio del Plata in 1999 in Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza. Even though she started her own winery, Susana maintains her presence in the global wine community. She served as president of Wines of Argentina twice, and still works as a consultant for many wineries around the world.  Winery  In its current phase, the winery has an approximate area of 7,000 square meters. Dominio del Plata mainly uses stainless steel fermentation tanks. The winery ferments in concrete tanks and oak barrels, but on a smaller scale. The approximate yearly output of the winery is 2,000,000 liters. Dominio del Plata is environmentally friendly, and employs practices such as water recycling and reduced packaging weight to minimize its carbon footprint. The winery has received ISO 22000 certification, which provides consumers with transparency throughout the winemaking and shipping processes.  Wines  Dominio del Plata currently exports to 36 Countries. The biggest markets are the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Japan. There are four major brands produced by Dominio del Plata: Crios, BenMarco, Susana Balbo, and Nosotros. = Crios = This is a line of young, fresh, and very fruit forward wines. Crios means “offspring” in Argentine slang. *Chardonnay *Torrontes *Rose of Malbec *Pinot Noir *Malbec *Cabernet Sauvignon *Syrah-Bonarda *Red Blend = BenMarco = The BenMarco wines are the most traditional Argentine style wines produced by Dominio del Plata.

The best 40 barrels are selected by the enologists each year, and are then left to age for 18 months in new French oak. In Spanish, Nosotros means “us”. This wine is dedicated to all of the people who work to produce it. *Malbec  Awards  Sources. *Crios Torrontes 2011, 90pts, Stephen Tanzer’s International Wine Cellar, March 2012 *Crios Chardonnay 2010, Silver Medal, “Argentine Wine Awards 2011” *BenMarco Expresivo 2009, 92pts, Robert Parker Jr.’s “The Wine Advocate”, December 2011 *Susana Balbo Brioso 2008, 93pts, Robert Parker Jr.’s “The Wine Advocate”, December 2011 *Susana Balbo Late Harvest Torrontes 2011, 92 pts, Stephen Tanzer’s International Wine Cellar, March 2013 *Nosotros Malbec 2008, 94pts, Robert Parker Jr.’s “The Wine Advocate”, December 2011  References   External links  *Dominio del Plata *Osadia de Crear Facebook Category:Wineries of Argentina Category:1999 establishments in Argentina Category:Mendoza, Argentina ","title":"Dominio del Plata Winery"},{"id":"39776629","text":"Deh Cheragh (, also Romanized as Deh Cherāgh) is a village in Zalu Ab Rural District, in the Central District of Ravansar County, Kermanshah Province, Iran.

WiLan licenses patent portfolios that it owns and also partners with owners of patent portfolios. WiLAN Labs conducts ongoing research and development into advanced wireless communication systems. WiLAN is the main subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc., which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. History In 1992, Hatim Zaghloul and Michel Fattouche co-founded WiLAN after they developed together the Wideband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (WOFDM),United States Patent Document patent number 5,282,222 and Multi-code Direct-sequence Spread Spectrum (MCDSSS).United States Patent number 5,555,269 and the reissued patent number 38,802 Through WiLAN's efforts, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has allowed OFDM technology over the 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM band for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards. MC-DSSS (MultiCode-Direct-sequence Spread Spectrum) is central to high speed CDMA applications, the main technology currently used by many cellphone networks. In March 1998, WiLAN had its initial public offering. In November 1999, WiLAN and Philips invited companies to attend a meeting to form an alliance to promote the OFDM technology and its applications. WiLAN was a founding member of the WiMAX Forum together with Ensemble, CossSpan, Harris, and Nokia. From its founding in 1992 to 2000, WiLAN had success as interest and investment in the tech industry grew. However, in 2000, when the world's first tech bubble collapsed, WiLAN's fortunes changed. At the start of 2000, WiLAN's share price was at $80. By the end of that year, WiLAN's share price had dropped by 90 per cent. Refocusing business in 2006 In 2006, WiLAN changed their business model. Instead of focusing on research and development and trying to commercialize its patent technology, WiLAN divested its various technology product lines to refocus its business on licensing intellectual property and patent rights. WiLAN's company goals would center around licensing its own technology patents to third-party companies, as well as licensing patents it had acquired. In line with WiLAN's refocus on patent licensing, in late 2005 the company brought in Jim Skippen, who had previous experience in licensing technology from working at Mosaid as a senior vice president of patent licensing and general counsel. WiLAN also moved from its original location in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to Ottawa, where the company has remained since. That same year, WiLAN acquired Tri-Vision, a company that developed a key ingredient in the V-Chip technology. WiLAN also signed a $50 million license deal with Nokia, allowing Nokia to use WiLAN's wireless patents. By 2012, WiLAN owned or controlled more than 3,000 patents. In 2015, WiLAN announced that it had gained a new portfolio of 7,000 patents in technology related to access memory, flash memory, semiconductor manufacturing, and other technologies. Labeled the \\"Qimonda portfolio\\", in June 2015, WiLAN announced it had signed a multi-year licensing agreement with Samsung, allowing Samsung to use technology in WiLAN's new Qimonda portfolio. Restructuring in 2015 In late 2015, WiLAN announced that, beginning in October 2015, it would undergo a significant company restructuring. As part of this restructuring, WiLAN announced that it would spin off its research and development unit and cut its dividend to shareholders. The restructuring would affect 30 per cent of WiLAN's workforce. The company would also focus on licensing patent portfolios owned by other companies and helping companies monetize their patents. In April 2017, WiLAN acquired International Road Dynamics, a Saskatoon-based road traffic management system engineering company, for $63.5 million. In May 2017, they acquired VIZIYA, a software services provider, for $40 million. The acquisition of VIZAYA was part of a broader restructuring at WiLan from a patent licensing company to a more diversified technology holding company. As part of the restructuring, a new holding company, Quarterhill Inc., was created, which contains WiLan Inc., International Road Dynamics, and VIZIYA as subsidiaries.

As a dimensionless quantity, it allows for the comparison of dissimilar animals or modes of transportation. It has a wide range of applications, from comparing human gaits to observing the change in efficiency of trains over time. It is calculated in one of two ways, both shown in the following definition: \\\\mathrm{COT} \\\\triangleq \\\\frac{E}{mgd} = \\\\frac{P}{mgv} where E is the energy input to the system, which has mass m, that is used to move the system a distance d, and g is Standard gravity. Alternatively, one can use the power input to the system P used to move the system at a constant velocity v. The cost of transport is non- dimensional. It is also called specific tractive force or specific resistance (see von Kármán–Gabrielli diagram), or the energy index. When the energy comes from metabolic processes (i.e., for animals), it is often called the metabolic cost of transport. The metabolic cost of transport includes the basal metabolic cost of maintaining bodily function, and so goes to infinity as speed goes to zero. A human achieves the lowest cost of transport when walking at about , at which speed a person of has a metabolic rate of about 450 watts. This gives a dimensionless cost of transport of about 0.39. If only the additional metabolic cost (above the resting rate) is counted then the most efficient speed will be lower. The optimal speed if both energy and distance traveled in a given time are taken into account (with some \\"price\\" for each) may be faster or slower than the speed giving the lowest COT. Running entails a higher cost of transport, but one which does not depend very much on speed up to the maximum speed of endurance running (about , see graph).

She is frequently commissioned by fashion labels and magazines to create art films, animations and editorials that appear both online and in print. Her illustrations are highly visible, regularly featured on the covers of Vogue Nippon and Vogue UK, as well as in the promotional imagery of Louis Vuitton. Ratcliffe is also an animation director and designer for notable clients such as Lady Gaga, Kenzo, Barneys New York, Jimmy Choo and Louis Vuitton. Her in-house studio consists of herself and a specialist team focusing on illustration, animation, graphic design, logo design, and other various disciplines. Early life and education Born in Berkshire, England, Jo Ratcliffe studied painting and print making at Saint Martin's College of Art and Design in London. Just out of college, she got her first art job drawing the comic book adventures of \\"Cindy\\" for Marvel Comics. Ratcliffe wielded this same hand-drawn aesthetic in her early editorial work for London- based fashion-art magazine, Dazed and Confused, to which she regularly contributed, incorporating illustration into graphics. Although she came from a background of working with traditional media, Ratcliffe later taught herself Photoshop and Illustrator - still her tools of choice.  Career  Jo Ratcliffe is known for her animated fashion films, typographic work, and graphics. But her surreal illustrations of lanky, hand drawn women have also garnered attention from magazines like Another Magazine, V Magazine, Juxtapoz, computerarts, NOWNESS and \\"The Gentlewoman.\\" Stylistically, Ratcliffe's work lends itself to fashion and hand drawn illustration. Ratcliffe has served as director and designer on fashion films both animated and live-action for high- profile fashion labels, including Nina Ricci, Kenzo, Chloe, Jimmy Choo, Barneys New York, and Cole Haan. In an interview with crane.tv she discusses a project she did with Kate Moss and, fashion house, Balmain in which she was asked to convey Moss's mood through animation.

It was aired on April 29, 2013. The episode was written by Michael Taylor and it was directed by Omar Madha. Plot Nolan (Grant Bowler), Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) and Yewll (Trenna Keating) are trying to find the culprit behind the murders of two humans. They discover that the two men were targeted with Hellbug attack pheromones, attracting Hellbugs to kill them. In the room where the second man was killed, they find an empty Hellbug egg purse - something that one can't find outside the nest - leading them to believe that someone is behind the Hellbug attacks. Meanwhile, Hellbugs attack the Tarr residence, where Christie (Nicole Muñoz) is having dinner with Alak (Jesse Rath) and his parents. Datak (Tony Curran) manages to kill the attacking bugs, and they all escort Christie back to her home. Nolan arrives after them, along with Irisa, Tommy (Dewshane Williams) and Yewll. Checking if any of them was targeted, they discover that Christie's clothes are sprayed with the pheromones. Nolan discovers that the two dead men had sold land to Rafe McCawley (Graham Greene) in the past for his mines. Nolan, believing that the attacks are somehow connected with that fact, asks Rafe for details. Rafe tells him that there was nothing illegal when he bought the land, but he says that the two men had bought the land from an Irathient family. When Nolan sees the signatures on the papers, he realizes that something is not right. In the meantime, Irisa starts to have \\"visions\\" again. When Nolan realizes that, he reminds her that those visions are post-traumatic stress and they are not real. When Nolan tells her he had thought those visions had stopped, Irisa tells him that they never did, she just stopped talking about them. Her visions this time have to do with an Irathient family. In those visions she recognizes Rynn (Tiio Horn), one of the women of the Spirit Riders. Later, while talking to Sukar (Noah Danby), the leader of the Spirit Riders, about Rynn and what she saw in her vision, Sukar informs Irisa that she has \\"The Sight\\", an ability where one can see the past, the present and the future without actually being present for the events. Sukar believes that this ability is given by the Irathient God Izru and the person who has it is blessed because they were touched by him. Sukar helps Irisa to use her ability, so they can discover what happened in Rynn's past. Irisa sees that Rynn's parents were murdered because they didn't want to sell their land to the two men. Rynn managed to escape before the men could kill her. Rynn's father was an entomologist, a talent that Rynn inherited, helping her to use the Hellbugs to kill the men. Irisa's vision leads her, Nolan, Tommy and Sukar to the Hellbug nest that Rynn discovered, where they capture her. It is proved that she was behind the killings while she was trying to avenge her parents. Leaving the nest, they destroy it. At the end of the episode, Rafe deeds the stolen land back to the Irathient Spirit Riders, since he didn't know that the two men had taken the land illegally before selling it to him.

It started operation on 11 September 1876. and was installed by the Corporation to indicate Greenwich Mean Time to assist with the regulation of public clocks. Operated by electrical control, the ball dropped from top to bottom of a short staff at 1pm each day. It was removed in 1886. Its use was probably discontinued because the installation had lost both its novelty and usefulness through the more general availability of Greenwich time, and the greater accuracy of public clocks.Nottingham Evening Post. 6 January 1933 References Category:Buildings and structures in Nottingham Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1724 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1926 Category:1836 fires Category:Time balls Category:1724 establishments in England ","title":"Nottingham Exchange"},{"id":"39776872","text":"Sullivan's index also known as Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) is a method to compute life expectancy free of disability. It is calculated by formula: Life expectancy - duration of disability Health expectancy calculated by Sullivan’s method is the number of remaining years, at a particular age, that an individual can expect to live in a healthy state. It is computed by subtracting the probable duration of bed disability and inability to perform major activities from the life expectancy. The data for calculation is obtained from population surveys and period life table.

The first opened in 1854 as a terminus of the Great North of Scotland Railway's (GNoSR) first line to . This was replaced two years later by a station on a new line to a city terminus at Waterloo. It was replaced again when the Denburn Valley Line to Aberdeen Joint opened in 1867. The Great North of Scotland Railway amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and became part of British Railways when the railways were nationalised in 1948. The station was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. The line remains open as the Aberdeen to Inverness Line. Stations =Aberdeen Kittybrewster= Aberdeen Kittybrewster opened to the public on 12 September 1854 as the terminus of Great North of Scotland Railway's first line to . The station had a single platform, with a loop clear of the platform to allow the locomotive to run round the carriages and push them into the station. On 23 September, the third day after opening to passengers, a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed to hold on to the lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting on the platform. The station staff should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident. =Waterloo= The GNoSR sought and obtained powers for a branch that followed the Aberdeenshire Canal from Kittybrewster to a terminus at Waterloo in the docks. Kittybrewster station was rebuilt with through platforms, and the line was opened to goods traffic on 24 September 1855 and passengers 1 April 1856 and . =Joint Station= Kittybrewster was again rebuilt with double line railway to a new joint station in Aberdeen. The station and new line opened on 4 November 1867, the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street closing to passengers and becoming goods terminals. In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway. This was nationalised in 1948, and services provided by British Railways. The station was recommended for closure by Dr Beeching's in his report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" and closed on 6 May 1968. =Locomotive works= The Great North's locomotive works were at Kittybrewster until 1902, when they moved to Inverurie Locomotive Works. Services Initially the service was three passenger and one goods train a day, which was increased to five trains a day in 1855 after the GNoSR extended to Keith. This was later reduced to four, until 1858 when the Highland Railway reached Keith, and the service was five trains a day to Keith, with connections or with through carriages on Highland Railway trains to Inverness. This was supplemented by three or four services a day after the Formartine and Buchan Railway opened in 1865 and Peterhead and Fraserburgh were provided with through services from Aberdeen. In 1887 the service between Aberdeen and Dyce was improved as the number of local trains increased and new stations were opened; by the end of the year there were twelve trains a day, and this eventually became twenty trains a day that took twenty minutes to call at nine stops. As it was Queen Victoria's Golden Jublilee, the trains were initially called the Jubiliees, but became known as the Subbies. However, by the 1930s these services had been losing money for some time as a result of competition from the local buses, and from 5 April 1937 the local services between Aberdeen and Dyce were withdrawn and most of the intermediate stations closed. The services in summer 1948 included *14 trains per day (tpd) to *5 tpd to and via *4 tpd to via *5 tpd to , with 3 through services to .

It is a re-telling of the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe, and focuses on the romance between Catriona of Clan Campbell and Alasdair Og MacDonald of Clan Donald, each from rival clans. Roberson was inspired to write the novel after learning of the massacre in a British history class, and waited 25 years until she felt ready to tell it. Lady of the Glen was published by Kensington Books in April 1996, with cover art by book illustrator Anne Yvonne Gilbert. A German translation was released in 2001. Plot summary The novel is set amidst the background of the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe, which was ordered by King William III. Catriona of Clan Campbell, daughter of the Laird of Glenlyon, falls in love with Alasdair Og MacDonald, a member of a rival clan. Their love must endure the political machinations of King William and the Jacobites. In August 1691, William offers all Highland clans a pardon for their part in the Jacobite Uprising, as long as they took an oath of allegiance before 1 January 1692 in front of a magistrate. Alasdair struggles greatly to meet this deadline, as the message reached its recipients in mid-December, in difficult winter conditions, only a few weeks before the deadline. The tension of this political situation is mirrored by the fraught romance of Catriona and Alasdair. Development Lady of the Glen was written by American author Jennifer Roberson. She learned of the Massacre of Glencoe in a British History class she took at Northern Arizona University, and thought \\"then it would make a terrific tale.\\"Roberson, Lady of the Glen, p. 415. She waited 25 years \\"until [she] felt ready to write it,\\" as she wanted \\"to do right by the story.\\" Roberson did not realize until she began her research in 1985 \\"how much story there was to tell, nor how dramatic.\\" For research, the author read John Prebble's \\"outstanding and invaluable\\" 1966 work Glencoe and visited the site of the massacre itself. Roberson has admitted that while she desired to be as historically accurate as possible, she \\"occasionally relied on personal suppositions and interpretations, and, where necessary, significantly compressed the time frame and chronology of events to improve the story's pacing.\\" According to her, all of the main characters are based on real people; a MacDonald did in fact marry a Campbell of Glen Lyon, though Roberson changed her name from Sarah to Catriona and made her the laird Glenlyon's daughter, not his niece.Roberson, Lady of the Glen, p. 414. She later listed Lady of the Glen among her favorite works. Release and reception The novel was released in April 1996 by Kensington Books, with cover art by book illustrator Anne Yvonne Gilbert. A German translation was published in 2001. Roberson stated in a March 2007 interview that a screenwriter had twice \\"optioned\\" the book but noted that this was true of many other works. Of all her period dramas, Roberson thought Lady of the Glen was best suited for film adaptation, and stated that she would love for Sean Connery to play the MacDonald laird. Publishers Weekly gave Lady of the Glen a mixed review, criticizing it for \\"offer[ing] only a smidgen of suspense\\" due to its many flash-forwards. They did however laud Roberson for creating an \\"atmospherically real\\" Scotland, \\"which comes as no surprise from an author who writes acclaimed fantasies (the Sword-Dancer saga, etc.) as well as romances.\\" Publishers Weekly concluded that those who enjoyed Roberson's 1992 novel Lady of the Forest would also like Lady of the Glen. Another reviewer described Lady of the Glen as being \\"a pleasure,\\" and Kensington Publishing deemed the novel \\"similar in theme to the recent films Rob Roy and Braveheart.\\" Lady of the Glen was listed among author Willa Blair's favorite historical fiction novels set in Scotland.

The dam was completed in 1960 after seven years of construction, and serves mainly to generate hydroelectric power. Background Construction on the main dam in 1956 When Taiwan was under Japanese rule in 1934, hydroelectric plants were constructed at Sun Moon Lake to generate power from the fall of the Zhuoshui River. The Japanese also sought to build power stations upstream on Wushe Creek and Wanda Creek (), the two main tributaries that combine to form the Zhuoshui. A reservoir would be required to control the flow of water to the power stations and serve the dual purposes of flood control and trapping sediment. In 1939, construction began on a high concrete gravity dam on the Wushe Creek. When World War II broke out in 1941, industrial resources were increasingly diverted to the war effort and construction was halted in 1944 with only the power plants and 6 percent of the dam complete. After the war, Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) took over the project with aid from the United States Agency for International Development. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation consulted on a re-design which increased the dam height to . Construction resumed in May 1953. The reservoir first filled in 1957, and the project was officially completed in August 1960, at a cost of NT$376,077,000. Specifications =Construction details= The dam is a curved concrete gravity structure with a height of and length of . The crest elevation is , and supports a roadway. Altogether, the dam contains of concrete. The spillway consists of two radial gates with a capacity of .

However, like many reservoirs of Taiwan, it has suffered heavily from siltation, especially after Typhoon Morakot in 2009. The current useful capacity is estimated at no more than . =Power station= Wanda Power Station The Wanda Power Station () is located about downstream and was the only part of the project to be completed before the construction halted due to World War II. In 1943, it began generating power using water from Wanda Creek, which joins with the Wushe Creek here to form the Zhuoshui River. The three Pelton turbines installed at the time are known as unit G3 and have a capacity of 15,000 kilowatts (KW). In 1957 generating units G1 and G2 were put into service, using water from the Wushe reservoir at a gross head of . G1 and G2 have a capacity of 20,700 KW each. In 2012 unit G4 was installed, providing an additional capacity of 19,700 KW. All three units are powered by vertical-axis Francis turbines, and generate about 182 million kilowatt hours (KWh) per year. The Songlin Power Station () is located downstream and generates power from the combined outflow of G1 through G4. It consists of two Francis turbines powering two 20,900 KW generators. In 2012 Taipower began an overhaul of the power station, installing three new generators and upgrading a fourth. On September 13, 2013 the installation was completed, replacing aged equipment that had been in use since the late 1950s.

Concept In that Gazu (illustrated reference), it depicts beside what appears to be a brothel a woman with an elongated lower body, but the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō has no explanatory text, so it is unclear what kind of yōkai this depiction was intended to be. There is the interpretation that this yōkai was an imaginary invention designed to parody the Yoshiwara Yūkaku of the Edo period. The book Yōkaigadan Zenshū Nihonhen Jō (妖怪画談全集 日本編 上, \\"Complete Analysis of Yōkai Paintings, Volume Japan, First Part\\") by the folklorist Morihiko Fujisawa gives the explanation that in the story from the Wakayama Prefecture called Takanyōbō (高女房, \\"Tall Woman\\"), a takaonna would cause frights on the second floors of girō (brothels). Also, in the book Tōhoku Kaidan no Tabi (Travels for Mysterious Tales of Tōhoku) by the novelist Norio Yamada, the kaidan (mysterious tale) titled \\"Takaonna\\" presents the takaonna as one that peeks peek into the second floor of the house, as a deeply jealous and ugly woman who could not get with any man, so they would walk around peeking on the second floors of brothels. Due to this, much yōkai- related literature from the post-war period would also state that the takaonna is an ugly woman unable to get with any man who would mutate and become a monster and then peek into the second floor of brothels to menace people, but the yōkai researcher Kenji Murakami points out that Fujisawa's explanation is nothing more than a mere imagined interpretation of Sekien's painting and that Yamada's mysterious tale is a completely different tale that simply put under the title of being a takaonna.

He came across the continent to California in 1852, in a small party one of whom was Daniel Showalter of Pennsylvania, but when they arrived in California they went their separate ways.\\"The antagonists, Daniel Showalter of Kentucky and Charles W.

Allied to those interests he was elected Sheriff of San Bernardino County in 1859. Piercy resigned in Oct. 1860 to run for a seat in the State Assembly. In the bitterly contested campaign of 1860, Charles W. Piercy was nominated for member of the 1st District of the California General Assembly by one party, and W. A. Conn the incumbent, by the other. Piercy was elected, but there was a claim of fraud. The accusation was that polls at Temescal, maintained by a resident named James Greenwade, kept open shop for three weeks and that whenever candidate Piercy was in need of more votes, they were furnished from this precinct. The case was taken to court, where the two opposing lawyers, H. M. Willis and Bethel Coopwood, had a fight in court wherein Coopwood sustained a slight wound, but won the case. Piercy won his seat as a member of the 1861-62 California State Assembly, representing California's 1st State Assembly District.

Educated as a doctor in the East, he migrated to Southern California in 1854. A few years later, he purchased a large tract of land in Rancho San Bernardino. He served various political roles in state and local government. After retiring from his medical practice, he became a rancher and vintner, and had a large mansion built for his family. His sons also became prominent local politicians and businessmen. After Barton's death, his land holdings were split into lots and sold for development; the area eventually became the city of Redlands. Barton built some of the earliest buildings in Redlands and neighboring San Bernardino, and his villa is now listed as a historic site. Barton was also a philanthropist and social host. He and his family were well-known and influential in the San Bernardino area during its pioneer era.  Early life and family  Barton was born in South Carolina in 1823 to a family descended from European colonists of the area. He studied medicine in Lexington, Kentucky, which he moved to in 1845. He lived and worked as a doctor in Texas and Alabama after his time in Kentucky. He met and married his wife, Eliza Brite, in Texas, and they resided in El Paso until 1854. In that year, he moved west with his wife to El Monte, California. The Bartons had two sons during this time, John H. Barton (b. 1855) and Hiram Barton (b. 1856).  Career  In the late 1850s, Barton was able to purchase large amounts of land from members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Rancho San Bernardino at low prices due to Brigham Young's recalling the Mormon outpost in San Bernardino. From Charles C. Rich and Amasa Lyman, leaders of the Mormon settlement in the area, he purchased, for $5,000 (approximately $ today), of property around the San Bernardino Asistencia, land known as Old San Bernardino due to its status as a late 17th-/early 18th-century outpost of Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. His purchases also included a number of properties within San Bernardino proper. Barton was appointed the city's postmaster, and built a building in 1858 in San Bernardino out of adobe to house a post office, doctor's office, and pharmacy. Due to Barton's other commitments, the post office was effectively overseen by John P. Barton, his brother. Also in 1858, Barton was elected school superintendent for the recently formed county of San Bernardino. The Barton Villa, home to Barton and his family later in his life. The villa was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 1859, Barton and his family moved to the Asistencia and sold their San Bernardino home. Around this time, Barton shifted his focus from medicine to ranching and farming. Some sources report that he gave up medicine entirely, while others state he maintained a home office for some time. Barton had the Barton Villa, now the oldest extant house in the city of Redlands, built as a home for him and his family. He served as a member of the California State Assembly in the early 1860s, representing what was then the first district. He died in 1899.  Legacy  Barton Road, which runs between Redlands and Grand Terrace, is named after him. Barton and his sons' real estate holdings would come to be known as the Barton Ranch or Barton Tract, and after being subdivided and sold off into individual house lots, would eventually become the land incorporated as the city of Redlands.

They perform dances that originate in these cultures as well. Living Legends was formed in 1971 by Janie Thompson. History Living Legends originally started as the Lamanite Generation which was an all Native American performing group organized by Janie Thompson. The organization was first formed in 1971 and their first tour was across Indian reservations. They toured the Eastern United States in 1974 and they toured in Central and South American the following year. Thompson stated that the 1975 tour was, \\"the most significant tour in [her] entire career\\", because it impacted and influenced Native Americans south of the United States. Living Legends has performed around the world including China and the 1992 International Expo in Seville, Spain. In the 1970s, the group was noted for its closing song at most performances \\"Go My Son\\", written by Arliene Nofchissey and Carnes Burson. The song encourages Native Americans to receive an education. This idea comes from the Navajo Chief Manuelito who urged Native Americans to obtain an education. Native communities did not always see this message from the Laminate generation positively. The transition to its current name was a long drawn out process. For example, in 1991 they still were using the name \\"Lamanite Generation\\" but performed a program entitled \\"Living Legends\\". Professor and historian Jared Farmer considers that BYU may have changed the name of the group to \\"Living Legends\\" to avoid racism associated with the word \\"Lamanite\\".

She was a professor at Brigham Young University and the founding director of the BYU Young Ambassadors and the Living Legends (BYU) performance groups. She was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served as a missionary in Wales. Thompson was born August 20, 1921, to J. Henry Thompson and Lora Harmon. She grew up in Malta, Idaho. She was the oldest of seven children. Thompson's mother was a singer and dancer, until a train accident left her unable to continue dancing. She would think of choreography and have Thompson dance out the steps for her. Her father sang bass. There was one piano in her house growing up, but her family could not afford lessons, so Thompson taught herself to play. She first performed at age 14. She attended Raft River High School and graduated in 1939. Thompson was accepted to Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1939. She worked as a pianist, playing in dance classes, to put herself through college. and graduated in 1943 with a music degree. She associated with the Army Cadet Marching Band which helped launch her career when she was asked to be their lead female singer. Career After graduating, Thompson taught music for some time at Timpanogos Elementary School in Provo, Utah. She quit her teaching job to go to California, where Thompson entered a singing competition in San Francisco. She became a Civilian Actress Technician, allowing her to perform for the Army of Occupation. She toured Europe, performing for soldiers in World War II with the 314th Army Special Service Band. She performed weekly at the Wiesbaden Opera House, and also performed with Tony Bennett. She returned to the United States in 1947 and performed with Ike Carpenter. She was then called on a mission for the LDS Church to Wales in 1950. Thompson returned to the U.S. and she went to BYU to establish the Student Program Bureau in 1952 at the request of Ernest L. Wilkinson. She accepted the position although she also received a job offer to continue working with Ike Carpenter the same day. Although she did not want to accept the job with her own career beginning, she felt that she was supposed to take the job. During her first four years at BYU, Thompson put on over 2,000 shows. She traveled to all the high schools in Utah, while also helping with youth productions with the Young Women's organization in the church. She also served for a time as a member of the YWMIA General Board. She left BYU in 1956, when she went to New York City to be a talent coach at a professional talent studio. In New York, Thompson taught music lessons on Long Island and trained children to sing. She was offered jobs writing musical commercials, but she returned to the university in 1959. Throughout her time at BYU, Thompson helped direct performances and even organized performances for U.S. servicemen. She was the founder of several performing groups, including Young Ambassadors and Living Legends which tour internationally today. She not only helped produce shows, but she also wrote some shows as well, publishing over 100 musical works. She launched BYU's first international tour in 1960. She officially retired from BYU in 1984; however, she maintained a studio at BYU after retirement. She continued to help with musical productions until her death. Some of her students were Heather Young, Sally Flynn and Sandi Griffiths from The Lawrence Welk Show, and Joseph Runningfox. Later life She was involved with America's Freedom Festival in Provo, Utah, for several years. Although she never married and did not have children of her own, she strove to help each of her students reach their full potential. She continued composing music and helping with productions up until her death. Her students remembered her as a stern taskmaster that was filled with love. She died on June 1, 2013, in Orem, Utah.

It was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill is a reaction to an increase in sexual assaults taking place in the military, an increase of more than a third between 2010 and 2012. In 2012, there were an estimated 26,000 assaults, with exact numbers unknown because many people still fear the consequences of reporting what happened to them. Currently, the Inspector General is required to investigate whether sexual harassment reports led to retaliatory actions against the person making the report. This bill, if passed, would expand those investigations to include looking at whether retaliatory action also happened in response to report of rape, sexual assault, or sexual misconduct. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. If passed, the bill would require the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with respect to the Coast Guard, or any of the military departments to investigate allegations of retaliatory personnel actions taken in response to making protected communications to such Inspector General regarding alleged instances of rape, sexual assault, or other forms of sexual misconduct in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Procedural history was introduced into the House on May 7, 2013 by Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN). It was immediately referred to the United States House Committee on Armed Services and was sent to the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel on June 20, 2013.

The man on the left has an eyeball on his left hand. Tenome (手の目, eyes of hand, or rather hand eyes) is a Japanese yōkai that appeared in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Toriyama Sekien. Concept They appear as a zatō (a kind of member of the blind persons' guild such as the tōdōza or a ranking of members of related groups such the Anma, moxibustion practitions, and members of the biwa hōshi, among other organizations) with both eyes not on the face, but on the palm of each hand. There is no explanatory text in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō so there are no details that can be known from it. In the yōkai emaki, the Tenpō period Hyakki Yagyō Emaki of the Matsui Library in Yatsuhiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, is the label teme-bōzu (手目坊主, \\"eye-hand bonze\\") for a yōkai thought to have been inspired by Sekien's \\"tenome.\\" The \\"Bakemonozukushi\\" (化物づくし) (owned by Kōichi Yumoto, designated Yumoto book B) also has a depiction of something that appears to be of the same design as Sekien's tenome. Both these examples have no explanatory text in the emaki so there are no details that can be known from them either. Also, Inui Yūhei depicted a yōkai called the \\"tenome\\" in an old illustrated manuscript currently owned by the Shisui Library (date of authorship unknown) where it was introduced with the words \\"are taru kusamura nado ni amatsuchi no seisei ni te shiyazu to ifu\\" (あれたる草村抔に天地のせいせいにて生ずと云, \\"these are said to be born from the grasses and grow from the land and sky.\\"乾猷平 著 『蕪村妖怪絵巻解説 附・化物づくし』 北田紫水文庫、1928年、9頁。 In the collection of kaidan, the Edo-period Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (1677), there is the setsuwa titled \\"Bakemono ni Hone wo Nukareshi Hito no Koto\\" (ばけ物に骨をぬかれし人の事, \\"How a Person Had Their Bones Removed by a Monster\\") illustrated with a yōkai that had an eye on each hand, and this monster is thought to have been designed based on Sekien's \\"tenome\\".稲田篤信・田中直日編 『鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行』 高田衛監修、国書刊行会、1992年、61頁。。 This story goes as follows. Once, a man went on a trial of guts (or \\"test of courage\\") to the graveyeard at Shichijogawara in Kyoto when a monster who appeared to be an old person around 80 years in age came after him, and this monster had eyeballs on each palm of the hand. The man fled into a nearby temple and after he made the monk there let him conceal himself in a nagamochi (a kind of chest), the monster chased after him, whereupon there was a sound like that of a dog sucking a bone, and after that it finally disappeared. It is said that when the monk opened up the nagamochi, the man was found to have all the bones in his body removed, his body reduced to just skin. According to the Iwate no Yōkai Monogatari by Yoshio Fujisawa, in a certain legend told in the Iwate Prefecture, there is the following tale about the tenome. A certain traveler was walking along the plains at night when a blind person approached. This blind person had an eyeball on each palm of the hand, and these eyes seemed to be looking for something. The traveler ran away out of surprise, and rushed into an inn. After telling the owner of the inn what had happened, the owner answered that in a certain place a few days ago, a blind person was killed and robbed by a scoundrel, and the blind person wanted to have at least one look at the face of those scoundrels, if not with regular eyes, at least with eyes on the hands, and this grievence led the blind person to become a \\"tenome\\" yōkai, and similarly in Echigo, it is said that a tenome had appeared after a blind man was killed. The yōkai researcher Katsumi Tada gives the interpretation that these drawings of the yōkai \\"tenome\\" and others are a word play on the phrase \\"bake no kawa ga hageru\\" (an expression meaning \\"to give away/reveal one's true character\\", literally meaning \\"to peel off one's layer of disguise\\"). The scene of eyes on a raised hand would represent the famous expression \\"teme o ageru\\" (literally \\"to raise one's hand-eye\\") meaning to reveal one's tricks and ruses, and a bonze's head would mean both \\"hageru\\" (which has a second meaning, \\"to grow bald\\") and the phrase \\"bōzu ni naru\\" (an expression that means \\"to lose in a match\\", literally \\"to become a bonze\\"). He explains that the background of the \\"tenome\\" in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō has a moon and a field of susuki, so the whole drawing is telling a joke with the moon indicating the bōzu (meaning \\"bonze\\" or \\"baldie\\") card in hanafuda (bōzu is an alternate name for the August suit) and the susuki being a reference to the kotowaza phrase \\"yūrei no shōtai mitari kare-obana\\" (\\"look at the ghost's true identity, it's a withered obana\\"), an expression about being so paranoid that anything, even withered obana (an alternate name for susuki), might seem like ghosts. Kurayami me As a yōkai similar to the tenome, there is the \\"kurayami me\\" (darkness eye) written about in the yōkai explanatory book Yōkai Majin Seirei no Sekai (1977) by Norio Yamada. It states that these have eyes on the front of each knee, and they can easily walk around in the dark but often bump into things in the daytime. In popular culture * Pan's Labyrinth (El laberinto del Fauno, \\"Faun's Labyrinth\\"): In the Spanish movie directed by Guillermo del Toro, the main character (Ofelia) is given a second task which consists in retrieving an ornate dagger from the lair of a character known as \\"the Pale Man\\", which resembles the Tenome. * Release from Agony: On the album cover for Release From Agony by Destruction depicts a Tenome hooked up to an IV. *Aaahh!!!

It was made in 1935. Where's George? was modelled on the successful 1931 association football film Up for the Cup. Sports films were popular in this era and in 1935, the British & Dominions Film Corporation decided that they wanted to make a comedy centred on the sport of rugby league. Both films were directed by Jack Raymond, and also featured the same star, Sydney Howard, as Yorkshireman Alf Scodger. The film went on general release in late 1935 but just a few weeks later, in January 1936, King George V died. The film was consequently renamed Hope of His Side as posters asking 'Where's George?' were not considered appropriate. The film's script was written by Walter Greenwood and featured actors Mabel Constanduros, Leslie Sarony and Frank Pettingell. Herbert Wilcox was director of production. Carver Doone, a six-foot eight wrestler, played the huge full-back that Alf dodges to score the winning try. Plot The film is about Alf Scodger's attempts to fool his overbearing wife. As a result of these attempts, he accidentally discovers that he has a talent for rugby league and is picked to play for his local Yorcaster club against their rivals Oldcastle from Lancashire. 'George' is a foal that Alf buys and then loses. While playing in the rugby match, Alf spots George in the next field and whilst running to recapture the foal, catches the ball and scores the match-winning try. A local dignitary watching the match sees him score the try and this leads to Alf and his wife becoming reconciled. Cast * Sydney Howard as Alf Scodger * Mabel Constanduros as Mrs. Scodger * Leslie Sarony as Willy Yates * Frank Pettingell as Harry Swan * Sam Livesey as Sir Richard Lancaster * Wally Patch as Ted Sloane Shooting In the summer of 1935, crowd scenes were filmed in the mining village Featherstone in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Two hundred unemployed coal miners were hired as extras. Players from Featherstone Rovers and Huddersfield were used in the rugby scenes. Reception Writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene described the film as \\"badly acted and carelessly directed\\", opining that even an actor like Howard could \\"do very little with the [film's] stale gags\\" and that the portrayal of Alf Scodger was one of \\"devastating pathos\\".

Early years Perret was born in Lyon to a conservative Catholic bourgeois family in that city. His father was a silk merchant- manufacturer, and Perret continued in that business. He fought in the trenches during World War I. Political career Perret joined the Fédération Nationale Catholique, a pressure group, when it was founded in 1924 to resist the anti-clericalism of the Cartel des Gauches, the left-wing coalition. The Fédération Républicaine (FR) was re-founded by Louis Marin in 1925, with a nationalist and right wing agenda. Victor Perret supported Marin in Lyon. Perret's Lyon branch of the party set up committees, student groups, worker groups, a boules federation, social centers and a charity to assist with housing. Perret opposed efforts by Henri de Kérillis to pull together conservatives into a united party supporting André Tardieu, thinking the Fédération Républicaine could represent the right on its own. In 1928 he was president-delegate to the Fédération Républicaine du Rhône, and vice-president of the national party, which broke with the moderation of the progressive republicans of the late nineteenth century. The party took an increasingly radical right-wing position, and became more receptive to the views of its rank and file members. Perret introduced a populist style, where corporatist ideas were accompanied by criticism of economic liberalism and even capitalism. By mid-1932 the faction led by Perret, hostile to social reform and uncommitted to parliamentary democracy, dominated the Fédération Républicaine du Rhône. On 13 January 1934 Perret published an article called Crise de moralité criticizing the parliamentary system, which he and other leaders of the Fédération Républicaine saw as both corrupt and ineffective. He became one of the most influential of the FR's vice-presidents. On 24 July 1934 he wrote to André Tardieu that the time was ripe for a great clean-up. In 1940, after the Fédération had ceased to operate at the national level, Perret was a strong supporter of the Vichy regime. In his view, the republic had caused the debacle and had thus eliminated itself. Victor Perret died in August 1941. Beliefs In Perret's concept of corporatism, both workers and managers would belong to mixed unions, learning to understand each other, as opposed to the confrontational approach promoted by revolutionary trade unions. Perret was in favor of compulsory membership in corporatist groups to prevent big business from dominating industries. Perret saw the masses as being vulnerable to demagogues unless they were given guidance from the elite. Perret believed in strong top-down leadership, and set an example through his unquestioning belief in Marin. He said the party should not look to leadership from notables but should call upon activists, who were the true servants of the people. Perret thought parliamentarians had too much influence in the party. He distrusted the press, who he thought had sold out to the government and business interests. Perret strongly believed in the importance of Christianity in ensuring support by all classes of the traditional ties to one's family, profession and nation. He linked protection of private property to Christian beliefs, and wanted to purge teachers who did not promote that religion from the schools.

A plan in 1935 anticipated 100 searchlight companies, with 2334 searchlights lights and 43,500 men.Roberts However, by 1941 men were increasingly needed for deployment elsewhere and there was a risk that the number of anti-aircraft units might have to be reduced. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Anti- Aircraft Command 1939-1945, General Sir Frederick Pile, supported the employment of women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) to these operational roles. They were first deployed to heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) gun units to work the AA instruments, radars and command posts. These 'Mixed' batteries were a success, but the replacement of men by women in searchlight (S/L) units was less easy to settle. The women would be scattered in small detachments in isolated conditions suffering hardship and few amenities. S/L sites were subject to enemy attack and usually had light machine guns for self-defence, but Defence Regulations prohibited women from firing them.Routledge, pp. 399–400.Pile's despatch. In 1941 a secret trial called the Newark experiment was carried out in AA Command to find out if women would be able to carry out the duties required in searchlight regiments.Brigstock Fifty-four members of the ATS were sent for training at Rhyl to see if they could cope with working in isolated places and if they would have the strength and the ability to operate the searchlights. The experiment proved successful and General Pile later wrote that: \\"They showed themselves more effective, more horror inspiring and more blood-thirsty with their pick-helves than many a male sentry with his gun, as several luckless gentlemen found to their cost\\".Pile, Ack-Ack, p. 222. General Pile was also to write later, \\"The girls lived like men, fought their lights like men and, alas, some of them died like men\\". General Pile also proposed that the women should have a more practical uniform for this work, and should be given the same rates of pay as the men if they were doing the same job. On 2 December 1941, the Under Secretary of State in the War Office wrote a letter recommending that members of the ATS be deployed in searchlight duties. In July 1942 the first seven searchlight troops were formed with ATS members and these were posted to 26th Searchlight Regiment (London Electrical Engineers), which became the first Mixed searchlight regiment. 93rd (M) S/L Regiment On 25 October 1942 the 93rd (Mixed) Searchlight Regiment was formed at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire with 301, 342 and 495 Searchlight Batteries. The batteries came from 26th (Mixed) S/L Rgt, 79th S/L Rgt and 77th S/L Rgt, respectively. Apart from 301 Bty, which was already an all-female battery, the regiment was still 50 percent male when formed, but the wholesale transfer of ATS in, and male gunners out, started immediately: A and B (male) Troops of 495 S/L Bty were exchanged for A & B Trps of 339 Bty of 26th (Mixed) S/L Rgt. On 1 June 1943 C & D Trps of 495 S/L Bty were disbanded and replaced by ATS personnel, and finally 23 August 1943 D/342 Trp disbanded and was replaced by an ATS troop. By the time the regiment was fully converted in August 1943 there were approximately 1500 women in the regiment, apart from the Commanding Officer and the Battery OCs.93rd ReunionFrederick, p. 875.Farndale, Annex M.

A member of the Republican Party, he previously was the Kansas State Senator from the 13th district from 2013 until 2017. Upon his appointment as Kansas State Treasurer by Governor Sam Brownback, LaTurner became the youngest statewide official in the United States.

He defeated incumbent U.S. Representative Steve Watkins in that primary election, amid corruption allegations against Watkins.  Early life and education  LaTurner is a native of Southeast Kansas and was born and raised in Galena, Kansas. He graduated from Galena High School and enrolled at Pittsburg State University, where he earned his undergraduate degree in political science. LaTurner worked for former Kansas Treasurer and Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins during his time in college in her Pittsburg district office.  Kansas State Senator  After losing the 2008 District 13 primary election to Republican Senator Bob Marshall, in 2012, he won the primary against the incumbent, Marshall, then won the general election.Ballotpedia Jacob LaTurner, Ballotpedia. Retrieved August 11, 2020. At the age of 24 he became the youngest member of that body. Stating he was trying to keep Kansas capital Topeka from becoming Washington D.C., he immediately set out to impose term limits on state legislators, reform the process for requesting public records, and combat nepotism within the legislature. LaTurner faced opposition on these issues, seen as extremely ambitious, particularly the term limits. Both Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives Ray Merrick, a Republican, and Senate Democratic Leader Anthony Hensley publicly opposed such initiatives. In February 2015, LaTurner was the lead sponsor of legislation allowing Kansas adults to carry firearms without needing a concealed carry permit. In 2016, he authored a bill limiting property tax increases.  Kansas State Treasurer  LaTurner was appointed Kansas State Treasurer in April 2017 by Governor Sam Brownback. He replaced Ron Estes, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives for . Appointed at the age of 29, LaTurner became the youngest statewide official in the United States. Defeating state senator Marci Francisco in the 2018 election, he became the youngest statewide elected official in the United States. As State Treasurer, one of LaTurner's primary responsibilities is to oversee unclaimed property, over which there is over $350 million worth in Kansas. LaTurner completed a 105 County Tour within 5 months during his first year in office, and returned over $10 million during the tour. During LaTurner's first year in office, he returned a record amount of unclaimed property to Kansans, over $25.5 million. \\"Every dollar we return to the people of Kansas is a dollar that goes back into their local communities,\\" LaTurner said. \\"Not only have we returned a record amount of money to Kansans, but we have made the process more user friendly and we have improved the service offered to Kansans.\\" LaTurner also administers the Kansas Learning Quest 529 Education Savings and ABLE Savings Programs, which assist Kansans in saving for their future. During his first year in office, LaTurner implemented changes to the Kansas Learning Quest and ABLE Savings Programs. Under these changes, individuals living with a disability are able to roll over saved funds within a 529 Education Savings Account into their ABLE Account. Additionally, Learning Quest 529 Education Savings Account holders can utilize their funds for K-12 education tuition. = LaTurner v. United States = As Kansas Treasurer, LaTurner continued a legal case against the United States Department of the Treasury which requested the federal government return the proceeds from matured bonds to Kansas. Though a judge in a lower court sided with the state of Kansas, requiring the federal government to return approximately $150 million in savings bonds to the state of Kansas, the United States Court of Appeals overturned that decision and found in favor of the federal government. The bonds will still be returned to Kansans, but that process will be overseen at the federal, rather than state, level.  2020 elections  =U.S. Senate campaign= On January 8, 2019, LaTurner announced his candidacy for the United States Senate in the 2020 election, hoping to succeed four-term incumbent Pat Roberts. LaTurner's announcement came roughly two weeks after Roberts announced his intention to retire in 2021. LaTurner announced his candidacy at age 30, the minimum age the United States Constitution requires a Senator to be. As LaTurner's next election as State Treasurer would not be until 2022, the Senate campaign was considered relatively low-stakes. Campaigning as a conservative, he supported the proposed Trump wall, an expansion of the physical barrier along the Mexico–United States border, argued for fiscal responsibility, and supported term limits for federally elected politicians. Responding to questions at a meeting with five locals at the Garden City library, he said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \\"thinks that the government can fix all of our problems for us and doesn't think that individuals have rights, naturally.\\" \\"I think that what I believe in, and it's what our founders believed in, is that our rights come from God, not from the government.\\" We need to continue to send people to Washington, D.C., that aren't afraid to stand up with President Trump and defend conservative principles.\\"Senate campaign tour brings LaTurner to Garden City, Garden City Telegram, Amber Friend, August 14, 2019.

In one interview, LaTurner stated he would be the \\"first to support [Pompeo],\\" while in another he said Pompeo had \\"right up to the last minute, he can decide to run.\\" On September 9, 2019, LaTurner suspended his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, opting instead to run for the U.S. House in the 2020 election. =U.S. House campaign= While LaTurner was running his Senate campaign, incumbent Republican Representative for Steve Watkins was becoming embattled in several controversies, including that he inflated his business resume, was not present for important votes, voting fraud and allegations of sexual misconduct. Watkins and his staff had edited his Wikipedia page to remove content relating to the controversies. Many speculated Watkins was planning on resigning prior to the end of his term, which he adamantly denied. Watkins was charged with interference with law enforcement, providing false information; voting without being qualified; unlawful advance voting; and failing to notify the DMV of change of address. In response, former Governor of Kansas Jeff Colyer publicly encouraged LaTurner to consider challenging Watkins for the seat. LaTurner announced he would end his Senate campaign in order to challenge Watkins on September 4, 2019. In an interview with Politico, LaTurner said, \\"At the end of the day, we don't want to see another congressional seat be turned over to the Democrats in Kansas...Congressman Watkins, without question, puts this seat in jeopardy this cycle.\\" Watkins had been elected in 2018 by a margin of less than 1%. LaTurner was able to move $470,000 cash on hand from his Senate campaign to his House campaign, giving him a large advantage over Watkins who had only $260,000 at the time of LaTurner's announcement.

This fountain should be distinguished from the similarly named nearby Triton Fountain (Fontana del Tritone) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, in the Piazza Barberini, with only a single Triton. The Fountain of the Tritons The fountain and the Temples of Hercules Victor and Portunus in the background The building, starting from 1610, of the last Roman aqueduct, the Acqua Paola, didn't move to the background the two aqueducts built just a few years before (the Aqua Virgo in 1570 and the Acqua Felice in 1587), which gave the possibility to erect new fountains on the branches that guaranteed a more widespread distribution of water in the whole town. A secondary branch of the Acqua Felice reached the area south of the Tiber Island: here, between ancient and middle-age monuments (the Arcus Argentariorum, the Arch of Janus, the Temple of Hercules Victor, the Temple of Portunus and the basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin) Pope Clement XI ordered the construction of a monument in his own memory. It is not so clear indeed why the pontiff chose to erect a fountain in an area that was scarcely inhabited, broken-grounded and subject to the floods of river Tiber. In fact, its fulfillment raised many criticisms for the location believed to be unhappy. The fountain was completed in 1715 by architect Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri, during the works for the accommodation of the square in front of the basilica. The whole travertine structure is placed on a circular step (delimited by 16 little columns joined by a grating), within which the design of the main basin represents an octagon with concave sides, or rather the eight-tips star that was the heraldic symbol of the family of the Pope, the Albanis). In the centre there is a group of rocks (an element that had become popular after the success of the fontana dei Quattro Fiumi) with bushes on which two Tritons (due to Francesco Moratti) are knelt with clinged tails and raised arms, sustaining on their shoulders a big oyster shell serving as upper basin. Between the two Tritons there is the coat of arms of the pontiff. Four mascarons formerly dumped water into the main basin; they were removed in the 19th century, probably due to the scarcity of the incoming water, that could have left them dry. In fact the fountain has been without water for a long time, but the hydric provision, though quite scarce, has been restored. The last restorations date back to 1994-1995 and 2010.

An authority on mechanical vibration, he was employed by a number of important US engineering firms and served on the faculty of several major engineering universities. Myklestad made significant contributions to both engineering practice and engineering education, publishing a number of widely influential technical journal papers and textbooks. He also was granted five US patents during his career. Myklestad was employed in various technical capacities by AiResearch, North American Aviation, Westinghouse Electric, Fairbanks Morse, and Bell Helicopter Company. He served on the faculties of California Institute of Technology, University of California, Cornell University, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Illinois, Arizona State University and the University of Texas at Arlington. He was elected fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1967 and fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1969.  Biography  = Early career = Nils O Myklestad was born in 1909 in Williston, North Dakota, United States but returned with his family to Europe where he was schooled and spent his childhood and youth. In 1932, Nils Myklestad graduated from the Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt (College of Advanced Technology), now Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen, Denmark with a BS in Engineering. Shortly afterwards he returned to the United States and was employed as an engineer by Westinghouse and Fairbanks Morse, 1932 -1937. He joined the University of California Berkeley in 1937 serving as a Teaching Assistant until 1938. In 1940 he moved to Cornell University as an Instructor in Mechanics, and studying under James N. Goodier, earned a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from Cornell in 1940. In 1940 N. O. Myklestad was appointed Assistant Professor of Machine Design at Illinois Institute of Technology where he served until 1942. = Work at Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory = From 1942 to 1945 he was the Research Associate in charge of Vibration and Flutter, Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. It was during this time that he made a number of significant contributions to the theory and practice of engineering. In 1944, he published “A New Method of Calculating Natural Modes of Uncoupled Bending Vibration of Airplane Wings and Other Types of Beams”. An efficient numerical method for finding the undamped natural frequencies and mode shapes of structures modeled with numerous beam and inertia elements, the tabular procedure became known as the Myklestad Method. This approach while more complex, is similar to methods developed earlier for torsional systems, and in the introductory sections of Myklestad's article the path-finding work of Heinrich Holzer is credited. In 1945, a similar numerical method was published by M. A. Prohl, \\"A General Method for Calculating Critical Speeds of Flexible Rotors\\". As a consequence the method is also often called the Myklestad-Prohl method or Prohl-Myklestad method. See also Rotordynamics. In any event, the practical importance of the Myklestad Method established a worldwide reputation for its author and has been, and continues to be to this day, widely used for calculation of natural frequencies and normal modes of rotating and nonrotating beam structures. The method has been used in many different applications including vibration analysis of airplane wings and fuselages, helicopter rotor blades, wind turbine blades, naval ship hulls, and rocket powered launch vehicles. The following citation examples, of about 1000 from a Google book search on 'Myklestad Method', show not only the range of structures analyzed by this method but the time span of its use as well. When matrix methods became popular, the Myklestad Method was recast into what became known as the transfer matrix method. During the time he was employed at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, he extended the Myklestad Method to include coupled bending-torsion vibration. and also developed one of the first efficient and numerically accurate methods of calculating the flutter speed of a multi-mass airplane wing model. This approach was used in the flutter analysis of both the B-36 bomber and the Hughes Aircraft Spruce Goose flying boat (Hughes H-4 Hercules). During this highly productive period he also published the first version of his popular book Vibration Analysis. = Work in Industry & Academia, 1947 - 1972 = In 1947 Nils Myklestad accepted a position as Professor of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois where he supervised a number of master's theses and PhD dissertations. He then joined North American Aviation in 1952 where he was in charge of the Navajo Missile Program. From 1954 until 1955 he was Chief of the Systems Analysis Section of Aerophysics Development Company. Myklestad joined AiResearch Manufacturing Company of Arizona in 1955 where he remained as Research Project Engineer until 1961 when he accepted a position as Professor of Engineering at Arizona State University. In 1967 he joined the University of Texas at Arlington as a Professor of Engineering Mechanics. While living in Arlington, TX he also served as a consultant to Bell Helicopter. The author of a number of significant technical articles, he also published four important text books on engineering mechanics. The most widely known of these are his books on vibration analysis, first published by McGraw-Hill in 1944 as Vibration Analysis and revised as Fundamentals of Vibration Analysis in 1956. By using Cartesian tensor notation in his last three books, Engineering Mechanics, Statics of Deformable Bodies, and Cartesian Tensors, Myklestad became an early proponent of tensor analysis in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. During his varied and productive career he also received five US patents. Nils O. Myklestad died in 1972 at age 63 while serving as Professor of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas as Arlington. ASME - N. O. Myklestad Award In 1991 The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, honored this prolific engineer by establishing the N.O.

He previously represented the 25th district in the Kansas Senate and was a Wichita City Councilperson. In the year before O'Donnell was born, his father Michael O'Donnell Sr. became pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Wichita. O'Donnell earned a B.S. in political science from Friends University in Wichita. He has been the chair of the Sedgwick County Young Republicans and on the board of the Wichita YMCA. Political Career O'Donnell began his political career in April 2011 as a member of the Wichita City Council.http://www.sedgwickcounty.org/elections/election_results/Gen16/. He resigned from the Wichita City Council in 2013. O'Donnell served in the Kansas Senate, representing the 25th District from 2013 until 2017. O'Donnell defeated three-term Republican incumbent Jean Schodorf in the primary election on August 7, 2012 by a 58.8% to 41.2% margin. In the general election on November 6, 2012, O'Donnell beat Democrat Tim Snow by 263 votes, 46.6% to 45.3%, with Libertarian Dave Thomas garnering 8% of the vote. While in the Kansas Senate O'Donnell was Chair of Regulatory Boards and Commissions, a member of Ethics and Elections, and Vice-chair of Education Budget, Legislative Post Audit, and Public Health and Welfare. All of the legislation sponsored by O'Donnell died in the Kansas House or Senate, except for general statements of congratulations, support, and commendation. O'Donnell chose not to run as an incumbent for this seat after one term and he was succeeded by Democrat Lynn Rogers (politician). In 2016, O'Donnell defeated four-term Democratic incumbent Tim Norton on November 8, 2016 for the District 2 seat on the Sedgwick County Commission. On November 3, 2016 Michael O'Donnell was rated 93% by American Conservative Union (Positions (State Legislatures)). Controversies =Federal Investigation and FBI Wiretap= On February 14, 2017, it was reported that O'Donnell's cell phone had been wiretapped by the FBI in 2015. On the same day, Wichita businessman Brandon Steven confirmed that he was the subject of a federal investigation related to his involvement in high-stakes poker and the proposed development of Castle Rock Casino. It is unclear whether the two incidents are related. =Federal Indictments for Wire Fraud and Money Laundering= On May 4, 2018, while serving as Sedgwick County Commissioner, O'Donnell was indicted on federal charges including 23 counts of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering. He remained free on a $5000 secured bond. The charges relate to his successful campaign for the Kansas Senate seat.http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article210405994.html The indictment states that over a period of months in 2015 and 2016, O'Donnell wrote checks from his campaign funds to three of his friends, who cashed them totaling $10,500. Prosecutors charged that O'Donnell's friends did little or no campaign work to earn the payments. Furthermore, the indictment maintains that at least $2000 from the cashed checks was deposited into O'Donnell's personal account. On March 4, 2019, O'Donnell was acquitted of 21 counts of money laundering. The jury was hung on five charges, including two counts of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering.Prosecutors weigh options after jury acquits Michael O’Donnell on most counts, Wichita Eagle, Amy Renee Leiker, March 4, 2019. Retrieved October 1, 2019. The decisions on all of the federal charges were based on whether O'Donnell's intent in violating campaign finance rules was \\"knowingly and intentionally\\" to defraud the public, rather than just routine campaign finance violations. Federal Judge Eric Melgren granted the request of prosecutors to dismiss the two remaining counts of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering \\"without prejudice.\\" That gives the Department of Justice the ability to file the charges again in the future.Judge Dismisses Five Remaining Charges Against Michael O'Donnell, KMUW, Nadya Faulx, March 7, 2019.

In October 2020, Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple, represented by former U.S. Attorney Randy Rathburn, filed suit against Kansas state Representative Michael Capps, Wichita City Councilman James Clendenin, and Commissioner O'Donnell, for defamation involving the false charges made against him in his successful 2019 mayoral election race. Allegations cited were that the co-conspirators tried to blame the elaborate, interstate conspiracy on Sedgwick county Republican Chairman Dalton Glasscock, and further that, with false accusations, they intended to generate marital discord within Whipple's own family.O’Donnell, Capps, Clendenin conspired to smear Whipple, blame GOP chair, lawsuit says, Wichita Eagle, Dion Lefler and Chance Swaim, October 14, 2020.

It served as residence for the estate manager (godsforvalteren) at Hørsholm crown estate which belonged under Hirschholm Palace. It later served as residence for the county manager (Amtsforvalteren). Hirschholm Palace was torn down in about 1810 but a number of buildings associated with the palace. The museum's neighbouring building, known as Vognremisen, used to house the palace's carridges. It now contains the local archives. The current rectory on the opposite side of the street was originally a cow stable. Its neighbouring buildings, which now houses the Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry, were originally barns and stables. In front of the museum stands the Stolberg Column which commemorates the agricultural reforms that took place at Hørsholm Estate between 1860 and 1761. They were introduced by count Christian G. Stolberg and were the first of their kind in Denmark. The memorial, a commission from Christian VI's widow, Queen Downer Sophie Magdalene, was raised in 1766 to designs by the French sculptor Nicolas-Henri Jardin.

In their travels, however, they engage in many violent attacks. They begin to kill local residents and various drug cartel members. The film stars Erik Estrada and Julia Benson as the protagonists. It was directed by Terry Ingram with the story by Peter Sullivan and Jeffrey Schenck. The movie was released in the U.S. and Canada initially and then later in Brazil and Germany under the titles Chupacabra and Chupacabra – Angriff der Killerbestien.  Plot  A group of corpses are found in a tunnel, where they were attacked and killed by Chupacabras. The following day, Carlos Seguin (Erik Estrada) and Tracy Taylor (Julia Benson) begin to investigate the killings and discover a dying man who has also been attacked by the Chupacabras. The dying man identifies his killers as \\"Diablo\\" (Spanish for the Devil). Tracy soon discovers a pile of bones deeper within the tunnel. A Chupacabra attacks Tracy, but she is able to kill it and the dead body is then taken back to a lab to study. Later in the film, Agent Perez (Aleks Paunovic), one of Seguin's partners, is searching the field with his dog. Both are eventually killed by a pack of Chupacabras. Before the man is killed, he takes a picture of one of the Chupacabras, which Carlos later finds while investigating the murders. The Chupacabras attack a group of teenagers during a Cinco de Mayo party, forcing Sienna (Nicole Muñoz), Carlos' daughter and one of her friends to hide inside the school. They are able to call Carlos, who is able to shoot the Chupacabras. However, later while they are recovering in their home, another pack of Chupacabras attacks, this time injuring Sienna and killing her friend, Brooke. After being relieved by his boss, Carlos enlists the aid of his son's gang. One of his agent friends, Wilcox (Zak Santiago) also comes up to help with a tactical team. Using the signal from a transponder that Taylor tagged unto one of the Chupacabras, the group trace the pack of monsters into a nearby warehouse. However, they end up being ambushed by the Chupacabras with most of the tactical team being killed. In the climax, Carlos and the group of survivors lead the Chupacabras to the Alamo, where a battle takes place. In the end, they kill all the Chupacabras by blowing up the Alamo.

The X Factor Musical was a musical comedy written by Harry Hill, with music and additional lyrics by Steve Brown. Based on the TV series The X Factor, the musical made its West End and world premiere in March 2014, at the London Palladium. Due to low ticket sales, it closed just 6 weeks and 3 days later on 10 May 2014, reportedly losing £4 million. Background In December 2012, Harry Hill announced that he was working on a musical based on the talent show The X Factor. The show was confirmed in 2013, and it was announced that the musical would open in London in 2014, and would be called It's Time to Face the Musical! On 22 May, it was announced the show would now be called I Can't Sing!, and that it would play the London Palladium, with tickets going on sale the following day. The show was written by Harry Hill and is directed by Sean Foley, with choreography by Kate Prince, set design by Es Devlin, costume design by Leah Archer, illusions by Scott Penrose, lighting design by Jon Clark, orchestrations by Chris Egan, sound design by Gareth Owen and sound effects by Ben and Max Ringham. An original score of 19 songs was penned, by Hill with music by Steve Brown. At the press launch for the show on 2 September 2013, Simon Cowell said of the concept of an X Factor Musical: “I thought the idea of an X Factor musical, if it was too pompous, would be rubbish, and I did not want it to appear like a cash cow. I wanted it to be a celebration of the show but at the same time poke fun at what we do, because you can’t take it too seriously. Harry of all the people was the right person. His observation of the show in the past has been spot on.” People parodied in the show include Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Dermot O'Leary. Production history =West End (2014)= On 30 August 2013, it was announced that Nigel Harman would play the role of Simon Cowell, with Alan Morrissey playing the role of Max and Cynthia Erivo playing Chenice the main contestant in the story. The production's first public performance came at the Royal Variety Performance in November 2013, performing a medley of \\"Please Simon\\" and \\"I Can't Sing!\\", the show's title song. I Can't Sing! began rehearsals on 6 January, with previews commencing on 5 March 2014, at the London Palladium, London, before holding its official opening gala night on 26 March. The production had been scheduled to begin previews on 27 February, however the opening two previews were cancelled due to technical issues with the show's set. Following the initial cancellations, the production had to cancel a further preview performance, due to a key mechanism within the set not functioning correctly. Problems continued into previews, with early performances intervals lasting 50 mins, due to set changeovers between acts taking longer than expected and one preview getting cancelled at the interval due to electrical problems. A typical London performance ran two hours and 30 minutes, including one interval of 20 mins. The production closed on the 10 May, just six weeks and three days after its official opening night. Speaking about the closure, Cowell said “We took a punt and it didn't work out. If I could do things different, I would have gone to local theatres and built up a following. We went in too big a theatre - it's the biggest theatre in the West End.\\" Music In September 2013, four tracks were released on SoundCloud and through the shows official website. The songs were \\"I Can't Sing\\", \\"If That's Not Entertainment\\", \\"Please Simon\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Like Bono\\", although the latter did not make it into the final show. The musical uses a nine-member orchestra consisting of keyboard, guitar, bass, drums, percussion, trumpets and reeds. On 1 April 2020 a YouTube user uploaded all the songs from the show onto the site. The released songs were recorded live during one of the performances through a soundboard. Harry Hill acknowledged the leak on his Instagram page, saying he was \\"very pleased\\" to hear the songs, while jokingly calling the uploader \\"naughty\\". =Musical numbers= ; Act I * \\"Overture\\" - Ensemble * \\"If That's Not Entertainment\\" - Young Simon, Ensemble * \\"It Could Be Me\\" - Max, Brenda, Vladimir, Alterboyz, Ensemble * \\"Life Is Lovely\\" - Chenice, Grandpa, Ensemble * \\"Please Simon\\" - Brenda, Vladimir, Alterboyz, Soul Star, Ensemble * \\"All Woman\\" - Brenda, Liam, Ensemble * \\"I Can't Sing!\\" - Chenice, Max, Barlow * \\"Better than That\\" - Hunchback * \\"The Hugging Song\\" - Liam * \\"Missing You Already\\" - Chenice, Max * \\"X Factor Fever\\" - Chenice, Max, Liam, Brenda, Ensemble ; Act II * \\"Here Come the Judges\\" - Brunhilde, Liam, Gerrard Smalls, Simon, Jordy, Louis, Ensemble * \\"Uncomplicated Love\\" - Simon, Gerrard Smalls, Max, Ensemble * \\"Uncomplicated Love (reprise)\\" - Barlow * \\"Falling in Love with Myself\\" - Jordy, Chenice, Ensemble * \\"Make a Wish...

Los Angeles Times, March 02, 2007Jocelyn Y. Stewart The program is housed in the School of Education. In 1962, The National Leadership Training Program was established on campus by a federal grant to train administrative personnel concerned with rehabilitation of the deaf. Master's degrees were presented to ten participants, and adult education classes were set up at a local church. In 1964 the NLTP admitted its first two deaf students and provided them with interpreters and notetakers for full access to university classes.\\"Deaf Students Follow the Signs in CSUN Classes\\". Los Angeles Times, February 26, 1987SUSAN SOLOMON The program developed telephone communication devices enabling deaf and deaf-blind person to make limited use of telephone; in 1965 they began to train deaf and deaf-blind persons in its use. That year NLTP-D hired its first deaf staff member. By 1968 thirty-three deaf students were enrolled at SFVSC; funding for support services, which had previously come from community service clubs, was taken over by the local vocational rehabilitation office. That year the Department of Special Education established credit courses in American Sign Language and Interpreting. In 1969 the NCOD received a “block funding grant” from the California State Department of Rehabilitation. Another grant allowed the initiation of a program to prepare teachers of the deaf at the secondary level. In 1970 the Drama Department at SFVSC offered a “Sign Language and Drama” course. That year SFVSC received a grant from the Bureau of Adult Vocational and Library Programs for “Project DAWN” (Deaf Adults With Need) to establish adult basic education programs across the country by training local deaf leaders. This model was later expanded to include other handicapped groups. That year SFVSC sponsored a national workshop and several regional workshops designed to bring together parents of deaf persons, deaf adults, and rehabilitation workers. The Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation initiated a summer Master’s program designed to allow teachers of the deaf, particularly deaf teachers, to earn an MA degree through summer residency plus extension courses. By 1971, the entire curriculum of the college was opened to deaf and hard of hearing students. =Renaming= On June 1, 1972 the College was renamed California State University, Northridge; by then the Fall enrollment of deaf students exceeded one hundred for the first time. Pursuant to Assembly Bill 1923, the Trustee’s Committee on Educational Policy designates CSUN as a professional center for training deaf persons; CSUN administration then established a “Center on Deafness” to coordinate the various training and support programs. The Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation appointed a deaf professor as head of the Teacher Preparation Program. In 1973 CSUN awarded a master's degrees to its 100th deaf graduate. In 1974 the Center on Deafness initiated a “Visiting Deaf Professor” lectureship, and deaf teachers from other colleges and universities were invited to spend a semester at CSUN to teach, study, and write. A new “Law and the Handicapped” summer workshop was offered on campus. CSUN joineda “National Interpreter Training Consortium” to meet the need for training interpreters across the country. In 1976 the Center on Deafness initiated a publication series: Selected Readings in the Integration of Deaf Students at CSUN, Sign Language Theater and Deaf Theater: New Definitions and Directions. The center collaborated with IBM Corporation to plan a “New Careers in Business for the Deaf” program. In 1977 CSUN awarded its 200th MA degree to a deaf person. That year the center reorganized, adding a Planning and Evaluation Unit, Administrative Services Unit, and Faculty Liaison person. Center on Deafness administrators testified before the House and Senate Subcommittee on Handicapped. The California State Department of Rehabilitation awarded a contract to the center to establish a Telecommunications Center. =National focus= In 1978 the center's name was changed to the National Center on Deafness, and plans were made for a building on the CSUN campus. A Telecommunications Center honoring the memory of Alexander Graham Bell was set up. in 1980 a deaf student organization, Deaf CSUNians, was established. In 1982 NCOD won the G. Theodore Mitau Award. A Deaf Fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi, was set up at CSUN. The center held its first annual NCOD Awards Ceremony, and also hosted a week-long Interpreter Faire, attracting about 80 local interpreters. In 1984 about 200 Deaf and Hard of Hearing students were enrolled at the center. Three years later the center initiated a study of attrition rates among deaf students in the sciences. Starting in 1987 Deaf CSUNians have decorated a float for the Tournament of Roses Parade. Tradition continues to the present. In 1988 NCOD won the first Deaf Students College Bowl held between CSUN, Gallaudet University, and The National Technical Institute for the Deaf. In 1988 a Deaf Sorority, Alpha Sigma Theta, iwas set up at CSUN. =New home= In 1989 the center was housed in a new building, Jeanne M. Chisholm Hall, donated by Grace Petri in memory of her sister. The center became part of the School of Education. In 1991 a Regional Outreach Program was established by the NCOD to serve colleges and universities in Arizona, California, Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada; several more states were later added. In 1992 NCOD hosted an exhibition of artwork by deaf children in China. During the next year, Lambda Sigma Pi Fraternity was founded. In 1994 the center received a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education.\\"NORTHRIDGE : Deafness Center at CSUN Wins Grant\\". Los Angeles Times, July 28, 1994SUSAN BYRNES The Deaf Studies BA program was installed into the CSU system by 2008.

Los Angeles Times, December 20, 2012 By 2017, approximately 200 deaf and hard of hearing students were attending CSUN each semester and register through the National Center on Deafness to receive services such as interpreting, realtime captioning, typewell, notetaking, tutoring and academic advisement. CSUN Campus Services The main purpose of the NCOD is to provide services for deaf students that want to attend CSUN. Some of the services that they provide are interpreters,\\"Thousands watch Burbank native sign 'Hamilton' hit\\". Los Angeles Times, Sep 30, 2016. Anthony Clark Carpio note takers, closed captioning, and transcription. So that students can participate the culture and the language of Deaf people, academic advisors who know American Sign Language are available in the CSUN Education Building, for both deaf and hearing students. NCOD also provides guidance services and some scholarships for students who are applying for admission to CSUN. The NCOD accumulated a collection of deaf-centered books so that students can read about the history of deaf people. In 2016 the NCOD collection was moved from the NCOD building to the Oviatt Library in CSUN.

Starting with nothing, Chuan was one of the legendary generation of Chinese merchants in Thailand to achieve success in one generation. By the time of his death in August 1993, age 73, Chuan was at the head of one of the three dominant business families in Thailand - the others being the Sophonpanich family and the Lamsam family - and the business group Chuan had created, the Ratanarak Group, included Thailand's most successful terrestrial broadcaster, a major retail banking and insurance group and the country's second largest cement producer. Comparing Thai and US entrepreneurs, Professor Krishnamra, head of the Sasin Business School at Thailand's Chulalongkorn University, has said “given the size of the market and the stage of development, Chuan as an entrepreneur was comparable to the Vanderbilts or Rockefellers”. Chuan is the father of Krit Ratanarak and the grandfather of Chachchon Ratanarak. Early years Chuan Ratanarak was born in Shantou, China in 1920 as Lee Bak Chuan and came with his family to live in Thailand when he was age 6. In the 1940s, as a young man, he worked as a labourer at the Ratchawong pier in Bangkok's docks. He saved his wages until he was able to buy his own ship and in a short period he established two of the most successful waterway transport companies of the time; Bangkok Transport and Bangkok Lighter. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Thailand's Chinese community played a key role in business and commerce. Because of discriminatory anti-Chinese legislation in place from 1939 to 1957 under the pre and post-war premierships of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, and the uncertain political and business environment in post- war Thailand, it became necessary for Chinese business families to develop close business relationships with each other and with dominant military groups and powerful Thai families. In the early 1950s Chuan built particularly close relationships with among others the family of Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien and Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, who would serve as Prime Minister between 1963 and 1971 and again between 1972 and 1973. Building the Ratanarak Group =Shipping= In 1954, Chuan founded the United River Transport Co Ltd with the support of Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien merging his existing shipping businesses - Bangkok Transport and Bangkok Lighter - into the new company. In 1964 Chuan co-founded General Logistics Company, the largest shipping company at that time, with Field Marshal Praphas. Chuan later sold his shares in the business. =Krungsri Bank= Following the 1957 coup by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, Thailand underwent economic reform under the guidance of US economists, the World Bank and the IMF and linked to an expansion of US economic aid to the Thai economy. The new, more open economic policy brought new opportunities for the Chinese business community - particular the banking groups who took the lion's share of the new opportunities - and reduced their reliance on the military for protection. In 1958 Chuan Ratanarak was encouraged by the incoming government to invest in Bank of Ayudhya, known today as Krungsri Bank, which had seen its performance decline following the death of the bank's then leading shareholder and manager. By the end of 1961 Chuan Ratanarak had acquired a controlling stake and assumed ownership of the bank. Chuan served as the senior executive of the Bank from 1961 until 1993. The Thai stock exchange opened in 1962 but the emerging banking system remained the main source of capital. The families that now controlled the largest banks succeeded in using their access to capital to build diversified conglomerate business groups with the number of companies controlled by the four largest banking families increasing five-fold between 1958 and 1973 so that by 1979 more than half of the families’ companies were involved in non-banking activities. Through their political connections and growing economic power, the largest banks also provided a degree of protection for Thai companies to whom they extended loans allowing emerging local businesses to grow rapidly in a difficult business environment, particularly during the period of the US guided reforms in the 1960s and 1970s and building the powerbase and wealth of their supporting banking groups in the process. Strategic lending by Chuan via Bank of Ayudhya was critical to the development of Thai capital during Thailand's early industrialisation and helped to build many of modern Thailand's major business groups. Under Chuan, Bank of Ayudhya became one of Thailand's top three banks. Its success was in very large part due to Chuan's leadership. Comparing Khun Chin, the head of Bangkok Bank to Khun Chuan, the head of Sasin Business School commented: “What Khun Chin could do, Khun Chuan could do later. That is how he built Bank of Ayudhya”. The bank also benefitted from an astute lending policy which meant that the average number of bad loans was significantly below the average loan loss across the Thai banking sector. In 1996, before the Asian financial crisis was to hit Thailand the following year, shares in the bank were trading at just under THB 150 giving the bank a market value of US $4 billion in 2013 prices. =Siam City Bank= In 1963, Chuan acquired a shareholding in Siam City Bank which increased to 25% during further rounds of capital raising making Chuan the bank's major shareholder. Chuan sold his shares in Siam City Bank during the 1980s. =Siam City Cement= In 1967 Chuan Ratanarak was granted the first licence in Thailand to operate a privately owned cement factory and mining operation; Thailand's only cement producer at the time was Siam Cement Company, owned - as it is today - by the Crown Property Bureau. Chuan Ratanarak founded Siam City Cement, producer of the Insee Cement brand, in 1969 and served as Chairman of Siam City Cement from its foundation until 1993. From its inception Siam City Cement grew steadily, beginning production in 1972 and listing on the Thai stock exchange only five years later. During the 1980s the company was the first to use local lignite in place of fuel oils and to deploy a heat-energy recycling system. Production grew steadily during the 1980s and 1990s and production capacity exceeded 12 million tons in 1996. Today Siam City Cement is still Thailand's second largest cement producer with a market share of around 27% and has expanded to become a leading construction materials group. =Channel 7 – BBTV= In 1967 Chuan Ratanarak was granted a licence to operate Channel 7 terrestrial television, in association with the sister-in-law of Field Marshal Praphas, using spectrum and a transmission network owned by the Royal Thai Army. Bangkok Broadcasting and Television (BBTV) was set up to operate Channel 7, with financing provided by Chuan through the Ratanarak Group and in turn Chuan acquired a substantial majority of the shares. While banking remained the core of the group's business, BBTV, was to become an increasingly dominant force in Thai broadcasting and a source of significant revenue for the Ratanarak Group. By the early 1990s, BBTV's Channel 7 had become both the most popular and the most commercially successful station with more than 50% of the total audience share and over 30% of total TV advertising revenue; a position the channel retains to the present day. Chuan was instrumental in the success of BBTV providing extensive funding to invest in the broadcasting infrastructure. This move has been described as visionary in two senses: under the terms of the licensing agreement for the operation of the channel from the Royal Thai Army, the channel would operate independently but the broadcast infrastructure would remain the property of the Army. Chuan funded the development of a modern nationwide communications infrastructure, meeting a national security need and winning military approval. The investment was also visionary because Chuan foresaw the development of mass advertising and the importance of long term capital investment in high quality nationwide coverage to win audience share. As a result of this investment, in 1973, Channel 7 installed a network of relay stations in the provinces and in 1978 was the first to broadcast by satellite signal from Bangkok to its relay station network. As a result, Channel 7 gained an important first mover advantage building a loyal audience base across the country and a strong brand. Today, Channel 7 has 35 relay stations and its broadcast coverage extends to the entire territory of Thailand and to border regions of neighboring countries. Channel 7 was the first TV station in South East Asia to broadcast in color and is still the only TV station able to reach 100% of the Thai population. =Property and real estate= From the early 1960s, Chuan began to develop an extensive portfolio of investments in land and real estate. He invested in various property businesses and built a substantial land bank which included several hundred acres of premium development land in central Bangkok and significantly larger holdings in the rural provinces. Chuan also acquired substantial land holdings in Bangkok's Yannawa district which lies to the south of the Sathorn business district, recognizing that Bangkok's long-term development would lead to expansion of the business district into this area. In 1990 Chuan started construction of Ploenchit Tower on Ploenchit Road in central Bangkok with construction completed in 1993. In 1991 construction started on an office tower that would be the new headquarters for Bank of Ayudhya on riverfront land on the Rama III road in the Yannawa district. Construction was completed in 1996. =Hong Kong= Chuan maintained close ties to the Teochew Chinese community in Hong Kong and between 1950 and 1980 built up a variety of investments and business interests in Hong Kong. At one time these included an interest in the Bank of Canton and in numerous real estate and property investment projects. =Other businesses= Among other businesses Chuan at various times owned are Siam Flour Mills, later sold to Metro Group, and investments in sugar and warehousing businesses. =Asian financial crisis and its aftermath= By the 1980s, the Thai banking groups, while not the only powerful section of private capital in Thailand, had become the section that was obviously dominant. Around 30 families dominated this period and the banking groups towered above them all. The man who started working life as a docker, now headed one of the three most powerful banking families in Thailand. The Ratanarak Group controlled enterprises in industry, commerce and finance with Bank of Ayudhya at the core of the group. By 1993 when he died, Chuan led a powerful diversified business group. Its growth had been financed largely by retained earnings with most of the group companies having little or no financial liabilities . Chuan's conservative approach to business and banking reflected his command of financial detail across all the businesses and meant that the Ratanarak Group had a strong financial foundation when in 1997 Thailand was hit by the Asian financial crisis. The robust financial position of the Ratanarak Group companies at the time Chuan died in 1993 meant that the family group, now under the control of Chuan's son and heir Krit, was one of very few to prosper despite the crisis. The group emerged from the crisis with the Ratanaraks retaining their position in the top five business families in Thailand, and one of three of Thailand's most powerful business families along with the Sophonpanich and Lamsam families. While other banks closed or were nationalized, the Ratanarak family successfully completed a recapitalization of Krungsri Bank without losing control and the bank continued to improve its performance in the post-crisis aftermath. In 1996 before the crisis the bank had a market value of US $4 billion in 2013 prices, and this had risen to US $7 billion in 2014. The family shareholding in the bank was reduced in 2007 from 35% to 25% to comply with a reduction in the maximum permitted holding under new banking regulations which came into force in 2008. The reduction in the family's holding was taken up by GE Capital whom the family brought into the management of the bank in 2007 to install best practice. In 2013 GE Capital held just under 25% of the bank's equity and were part-way through a process to sell their remaining holding following losses incurred in the 2008 banking crisis and a change in strategy by GE to reduce their exposure to financial services. In 2013 the Ratanarak family controlled 25% of the bank's equity and was the bank's largest shareholder. The family also successfully recapitalized Siam City Cement, in the process selling part of the family's equity to Holderbank (later to become Holcim) in 1998. Contemporary newspaper reports wrongly suggested that the sale of equity to Holderbank was used by the family to raise the funds required to recapitalize Bank of Ayudhya. However, as part of the terms of the sale, the full proceeds received by the family from Holderbank – as well as additional funds from the Ratanarak Group - were reinvested in Siam City Cement via a rights issue to recapitalize the business and the capital injected by the family into the bank came instead from contingency reserves In 2013 the Ratanarak family controlled 47% of the equity in Siam City Cement which had a market value of US $3.2 billion and no significant debt with Holcim holding 27.5% of the shares. In 1998, prior to the deal with Holderbank, the family had controlled slightly more than 50% of the company. Personal life and legacy Chuan married Sasithorn in the 1940s and they had 6 children; one son, Krit, and 5 daughters. He also took Krit's son, Chachchon, under his wing. In the early years Chuan worked from a modest office in the Chinatown branch of Bank of Ayudhya on Yaowarat Road and although he would move to larger modern offices as the business grew, he would remain a very private and family oriented individual who, unlike many other prominent overseas Chinese businessmen, would seldom be seen at social functions or events. Chuan was extremely hard working, often to be found at his desk at home working late into the night studying company documents or checking accounts on his abacus. A gifted businessman, Chuan was a highly respected and admired figure in Thailand's business community with a reputation for diligence and assiduous attention to detail and was well known among Thailand's Teochew community. Chuan was also known for his generosity and philanthropy, particularly where he saw the long term benefit for Thailand. Among other projects he set up an education foundation and financial support from Chuan was critical to the establishment of Sasin business school and its later development. He was loyal to those who remained loyal to him. The staff in the group businesses were reported to be ‘very fond’ of him and ‘would work their hearts out’ for him, and many of his associates and colleagues became wealthy in their own right as the Ratanarak Group flourished. In an interview in 2013, Professor Krishnamra, the head of Sasin Business School at Chulalongkorn University said of Chuan: “He had many good friends and he helped his friends to the end. That is why he had many business colleagues. He had above all a warm personality. I also remember that his mind was very rapid. He was sincere, and when he said yes he meant yes. He had good friends and firm friends. Nowadays there is no-one like Khun Chuan. His warmth would bound over every obstacle”. In business, Chuan combined a powerful intellect with imagination and ambition and would perceive and pursue long- term opportunities that would frequently defy conventional wisdom [23]. Chuan left behind a considerable legacy beyond the business empire. During his working life he was responsible for considerable sums of investment made by Chinese businesses into the Thai economy financed by loans from the Ratanarak Group. In the 40 years from 1945 investment by Thailand's Chinese community far exceeded inward investment from overseas sources in both volume and in its impact on Thailand's development and Chuan played a major part in Thailand's early development trajectory and economic modernisation, particularly in the period from 1960 to 1985 before overseas investment became more significant for Thailand's economic growth. Chuan is recognized as one of the last great self-made Thai business Titans. Although he achieved a position of considerable wealth and power, he remained modest, engaging and always true to his principles. When news of his death broke in 1993, the newspapers were filled with personal messages of condolence and tributes to his achievements and character placed personally by many of the leading figures in Thailand's business and political community in recognition of the position of respect Chuan had achieved within Thai society.

Etymology The name sudra is Aramaic and is the word from which the Latin word , is derived from which means 'cloth' or 'handkerchief'.Wiktionary: סודרא However, according to the Babylonian Talmud, the word is a contraction of the phrase \\"Secrets are revealed to those who fear the Holy Name.\\" Shabbat 77b History The sudra is believed to be thousands of years old and referred to in the Bible. Ancient Hebrews wore a headgear that was similar to either a keffiyeh, turban or a stocking cap. There are many ways of tying the fabric to make these different designs. The sudra has been mentioned directly and indirectly in ancient Jewish religious texts, including the Babylonian Talmud. Targum Ruth has interpreted different words in the Book of Ruth, such as ( ) mean the Sudra. In Jewish tradition, the sudra was a twisted scarf worn around the neck Taanit 24aThere is also evidence of Jews wearing the sudra on their heads like a keffiyeh or turban in Tractate Berakhot, Tractate KiddushinKiddushin 29b, and Tractate Shabbat Shabbat 77b in the Babylonian Talmud. Removing the Sudra to let another hold it was also seen as a sign of symbolic trust during a monetary deal.Bava Metzia 7a =Religious and cultural significance= Sudra around the 'guf' or body and around the neck like a snake in accordance with the description of the Shulchan Aruch The Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim gives a specific exemption for a sudra in regards to tzitzit, despite the fact it is a four cornered garment.Shulchan Aruch Orech Chaim 10:11 There, he talks about the appropriation of the Sudra by Arabs into what he says is commonly known as the 'shid.' He describes the Sephardi custom as being over the shoulders like a scarf and the Remo states that Ashkenazi custom as covering more of the body when worn in its scarf form, comparing it to coiling round the body like an Egyptian Snake and noting that some wear it like what he calls the 'Kaftanis' of the Tatars when worn on the head.ibid 10:12 This may be the origin of the shrtreimel for when cloth was exchanged for fur. =Decline= Amongst Ashkenazi Jewry, the Sudra quickly fell out of favour over time in favour of the streimel and the spodik, which was used as a means of humiliating Jews by forcing them to wear animals instead of cloth in the style of the Sudra. Other more European style hats, such as the Borsalino came into favour due to assimilation. =Revival= Online stores such as \\"Sudra collection\\" and Zionist figures such as Rudy Rochman have publicly stated their desire to revive the Sudra as an act of decolonisation. It is unclear how popular this effort has been.

Career Simone Ritscher studied acting at the Theaterhochschule \\"Hans Otto\\" Leipzig from 1980 to 1984.(bad link) After that she played in various theater plays. She developed a passion for acting in front of an audience and is still part of several plays to that day. In 2008, she was seen in Der Fall Winslow in Hamburg in a guest role. =Verbotene Liebe= Ritscher was first seen in the soap opera Verbotene Liebe in October 1995. She took on the role as Cecilia de Witt. A recurring role that served as an assistant in a scheme to antagonist Clarissa von Anstetten, played by Isa Jank. The role lasted a few months and Ritscher was last seen in February 1996. In 2002, she shortly was seen as Christina Hansen before guesting as Raphaela Klemm in 2007. In the fall of 2008, Ritscher was cast for another role in Verbotene Liebe. This time she took on the contract role of Maria Galdi, a private secretary to a princess. However it was later revealed that Maria Galdi is actually Maria di Balbi, unknown mother of Ansgar von Lahnstein, played by Wolfram Grandezka. Ritscher debuted on-screen in January 2009 and was well received by fans. Maria took the identity of her late sister Francesca to secure her place in the Lahnstein family, made an enemy in Ansgar's wife Tanja von Lahnstein (Miriam Lahnstein), was almost killed by Tanja and then tried to kill herself and Ludwig von Lahnstein (Krystian Martinek) in a fire. Maria was then send off to a mental hospital with Ritscher last appearing in January 2011. Shortly after her departure, the character was killed off off-screen, which angered many fans. Over the course of sixteen years, Ritscher played four different roles, with one major. That is a record for the soap opera. None of her roles have a known connection with one another. =Sturm der Liebe= In 2011, after her departure from Verbotene Liebe, Ritscher was cast in the long-running telenovela Sturm der Liebe. The successful format brought Ritscher on as the new antagonist for their new season. Her role as Doris van Norden revealed that she has twins with Hotel director Werner Saalfeld (Dirk Galuba), whom she later married. Doris killed several people and finds an archenemy in Werner's ex-wife Charlotte (Mona Seefried). In 2012, she was included in the cast for another season. Ritscher then was announced to be leaving the telenovela in July 2013.

The program was introduced by the FHA as a way to speed up the home refinancing process. By reusing the original loan's paperwork, the process to refinance a home was reduced from a few months to only a few weeks. Streamline refinancing has become more popular because reuse of the original home's appraisal may be the only way someone underwater on the property can refinance it at all. Streamline refinancing is an option for borrowers who want to take advantage of low interest rates, get out of an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) or graduated payment mortgage (GPM). Both the FHA and VA offer streamline refinancing for home mortgages.  Risks  Banks are taking the risk that the home will not sell for more than is owed against it if they must foreclose on it. Streamline refinancing programs may allow at-risk borrowers to stay in their homes, but it does not solve the underlying problem of people who bought far too much house for their budget. The streamline refinancing process typically does not require verification of the level of income, only that someone has income. Permitting someone to live on Social Security Disability or unemployment to refinance the home may make the payments manageable, but the debt will be paid off more slowly and the borrower may be better off in the long run moving to a cheaper locale. FHA and VA streamline is a true no cost loan. The costs are paid with the funds obtained from the new servicer of the loan; as FHA and VA (no income/no credit) streamlines are designed that way. Since the rate is higher than the market is offering, the future servicers will pay more for that loan--and those extra funds are what pays the customer's costs in these cases. If the fees are added into the loan then the customer has to qualify again; as it is not considered a streamline. While the FHA does not require a credit report to refinance an FHA loan, FHA approved lenders are free to set minimum credit scores.  Benefits  The Federal Housing Administration and VA do not permit the refinancing of a home unless there is a net benefit to the borrower. This net benefit is a reduction of five percent or more in the monthly house payment, including principal, interest and mortgage insurance. Adjustable rate mortgages are dangerous because their interest rate could spike to five or ten percent, especially for sub-prime borrowers whose loans started with low teaser adjustable rates but compensate by charging several times the official interest rate later. The only exception to this net benefit rule is when someone refinances to a fixed rate mortgage from an adjustable rate mortgage. In that case, the new interest rate may actually be higher than the ARM interest rate. Streamline refinancing reuses the original paperwork from a home loan, allowing someone to refinance the property before private mortgage insurance (PMI) or insurance rates rise. The FHA streamline refinancing program requires no repairs be made to the property except for the removal of lead-based paint. For example, repairs to a roof, foundation or electrical wiring are not required for an FHA streamline refinancing. The FHA streamline refinancing program does not permit home owners to receive equity back as cash. The borrower can receive no more than $500 in minor adjustments in closing. Sellers are allowed to contribute up to 6% of the sales price of the home to the closing costs. There are additional loans available for making energy efficiency improvements or repairs to the property. The 203(k) is a rehabilitation mortgage. The 203(k) mortgage has a cap of $35,000 for making repairs to a property.  Concerns  The Federal Housing Administration has been continually changing the mortgage insurance rate it charges. The up front mortgage insurance premium and ongoing mortgage premiums the FHA charges are partially based on the loan to value (LTV) ratio of the loan as well as dependent on the number of loans the FHA has seen default. In this case, the FHA streamline refinancing program's PMI and up front mortgage insurance rates are set by factors borrowers cannot control. And the FHA changed its terms to make mortgage insurance last at least eleven years for those with a loan to value ratio of 90%, while those with a loan to value ratio greater than 90% will pay mortgage insurance over the entire life of the loan. The FHA loan changes that went into effect June 2013 mean that the mortgage insurance on these loans can no longer be cancelled when the borrower has reached 22% equity. The VA does not have the same mortgage insurance mandates as the FHA, though it does have closing costs. The net benefit rule means that borrowers cannot refinance from a 30-year note to a 15-year note even if the monthly house payment would be the same, though such a change would allow them to build equity much faster. This is true for both the VA and FHA. The up front mortgage insurance premium or UFMIP the FHA charges is due at closing. The FHA UFMIP is partially refunded if the borrower refinances through the FHA streamline refinance program. This can lead people to refinance with the FHA to avoid refinancing costs, though better deals may be available on the open market. You cannot use the FHA streamline refinancing program if you are delinquent on the mortgage. For those who are behind, programs like HARP and HARP 2 may be the only option. The Veteran's Administration streamline refinancing program has high refinancing fees, but these fees can be waived for disabled veterans and the surviving spouses of deceased veterans.  Limits  Borrowers are only eligible for a mortgage streamline refinance without credit verification if they have owned the home for at least six months. If the borrower has lived in the house for at less than a year, the mortgage payment history must be perfect to be considered for a streamline refinance. Furthermore, borrowers cannot use the streamline refinance program for at least 270 days after a previous refinancing. The VA only permits veterans or the surviving spouses of veterans to use the streamline refinancing program. When a veteran divorces, he or she can refinance the home in their own name, but the ex-spouse who is not a veteran cannot take over the mortgage.

The Orpheum was renamed The State theater in 1920 when it switched from vaudeville acts to motion pictures; it had made money for Wilmer's and Vincent. They wanted to open another theater to increase their profits.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762-1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987 The Ochs Construction Company from Allentown was the general contractor for the building. The Colonial was designed by Philadelphia architects Hoffman and Henon, who were turning out drawings for the dream palaces of motion pictures. The building was a concrete and steel three-story building in the Beaux-Arts style. Wilmer and Vincent wanted this to be primarily a movie theater and not a vaudeville house. The interior had a three-story auditorium with two balconies. The marble used was rose Tavernell imported from France. The three grand chandeliers lit the long center ramp that swept up to the interior doors. Set in the marble arches of the columns were baskets of flowers, gifts from Wilmer's and Vincent's many clients in the theater world. It also contained both ground-floor retail shops as well as second and third-story professional offices for attorneys, insurance agents and other small businesses, including rehearsal rooms for musicians and acting troupes. =Golden era= The Colonial had its opening night on October 11, 1920. Its first film was \\"The Idol Dancer\\" by D.W. Griffith. Also on the bill were a Pathe newsreel and a comedy starring silent screen favorite Harold Lloyd entitled \\"High and Dizzy\\" Matinee prices for the orchestra and balcony seats were 25 cents, but box seats on Saturday evening would be 65 cents, a high price by the standards of the time. Main auditorium Interior of the theater after its renovation in the early 1960s For most of the next 50-odd years, the Colonial was one of the most profitable and popular theaters in Allentown. Although designed primarily for films, it also was on occasion a performing arts theater. It was also host for traveling jazz spectaculars, specializing in touring groups from Harlem's Cotton Club. In 1929, the theater installed sound equipment for talking pictures. In February 1935, it was the site of a live national radio network broadcast of \\"Amos and Andy\\". It was remodeled in 1937; seats were added, new projection equipment installed and a new air conditioning system put in place, just in time for a big event of 1938. By that time Walter Vincent was chairman of the board of Hollywood film studio Republic Pictures. It was his idea to make a film about the city called \\"Allentown On Parade\\". Along with a Republic Pictures romance called \\"Army Girl\\", the film on Allentown premiered on the night of August 18, 1938. Before a capacity crowd on the flag-draped stage of the Colonial Theater, a coast-to- coast phone conversation between Allentown community leaders and the stars of \\"Army Girl\\" was broadcast throughout the theater. In an era when a cross- country phone call was a big deal, hearing the live voices of Hollywood stars was quite an event. In 1944, the property was sold to Fabian Theaters, Inc., which operated a chain of thirty theaters in New York and New Jersey. =Decline= After World War II, the Colonial gradually became a cinema-only facility; however, it continued to host an occasional stage show until the 1960s. But the advent of television in the 1950s caused revenues to decline as more and more people began to stay home and watch entertainment in their living rooms. Nevertheless, in 1954 the screen was replaced with one capable of showing CinemaScope widescreen films. In the early 1960s, the theater was closed for a major renovation. Its front facade was cleaned and painted, the lower facade re-tiled, and a new marquee was installed. Inside, new theater seats were installed on the first floor, along with new carpeting and gold and blue draperies; the walls were re-plastered and a new ceiling was installed. Two new lounges were added to the main floor and a new RCA stereo sound system was added. The grand opening in October 1962 was the film Barabbas. During the 1960 and early 70s, the Colonial was the premiere theater in downtown Allentown, showing such films as Cleopatra; Mary Poppins; Doctor Zhivago; Guess Who's Coming to Dinner; Midnight Cowboy (The only \\"X\\" rated film ever shown there); M*A*S*H; The Godfather, and The Godfather Part II.The Morning Call, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Microfilm reels at the Allentown Public Library In 1973, United Artists Eastern Theaters Inc. purchased the building from the Fabian movie chain. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, the multi-cinema mall theaters and also the decline of the Allentown Central Shopping district on Hamilton Street led to austere times for the Colonial, along with other Hamilton Street theaters in Allentown. The Rialto Theater at 10th and Hamilton closed in the late 1970s, the Eric Twin, which opened in 1969 about a block east, was renovated into a multi-cinema of six screens, all of which were capable of projecting 70mm films, while the Colonial was a single-screen capable of only 35mm film projection. This meant that many of the Hollywood blockbuster films of the era were shown at other theaters. By the mid-1970s, the theater was reduced to charging $1.00 admissions to second and third-run films. The end was reached in 1982 when the theater closed on September 23d, 1982. =Mark Mendleson= After it closed, it was announced that it was a temporary closure until a new owner could be found. Also it was only the cinema part of the building which was closed, as the professional offices and some retail space remained open. However negotiations with several cinema chains fell through and the theater remained closed for several years. Photo of the Colonial Theater on December 9th, 2001, showing its derelict condition after a decade of neglect. The theater was torn down in 2005. In 1988, the property was sold to Mark Mendleson, an investor from Philadelphia. In the time while it was closed, the building sustained water damage from a leaking roof. Again in need of renovation and losing money, Mendleson closed the building for \\"temporary repairs\\" that shuttered the professional offices and retail space.One man is behind Allentown's nightmare: Mark Mendelson, The Morning Call, November 24, 2002 However, instead of renovating the property, property records also show that in spite of their inactivity and deterioration, the Colonial, along with other properties owned by Mendleson, were used as collateral for tens of millions of dollars in loans for other projects he was involved in. The closed theater, judged as viable as an operable business by the City of Allentown in 1987, began to structurally deteriorate. Mendelson, in turn, laid the blame for his troubles in Allentown on the city's economic woes and on city officials who he said tortured him with unfulfilled promises and turned their backs when he needed help. For the better part of the next 15 years, Mendleson and the City of Allentown were at loggerheads with regards to the Colonial and his other properties, all of which were deteriorating. When Allentown gained national infamy in 1990 by making the very bottom of Money Magazine's ranking of 300 places to live in the United States, the Colonial Theater illustrated the city's ignominy with a single photograph. The picture was captioned A vacant movie theater in Allentown. Interior photo of the Colonial Theater, taken on March 5th, 2005. The photo illustrates the condition of the theater auditorium, showing the deteriorated condition of the interior as it was being torn down. The condition of the building had deteriorated to the point that there was nothing salvageable of the architectural details of the theater worth preserving. In 1994, with nearly $5 million in liens against his properties in Allentown, the Colonial went to a tax sale. Mendelson gambled that no one would bid on the property — thus becoming responsible for the unpaid bills — and won. At that time, Mendelson began to make amends by paying some of the Colonial's back taxes. In 2001, the City ordered the Colonial Theater sealed to keep vagrants out of the property, and Mendleson was ordered to repair its roof and make other structural repairs due to the deterioration of the property and to prevent structural collapse. The city fought for years to take control of the long-blighted theater, and obtained a court order in 2003, prying it from the grip of the Mendelson Family Trust. The Colonial Theater was demolished by the city in March 2005. Along with the Colonial theater building, the city also razed some vacant early 20th century buildings known as the \\"Colonial Annex\\" and the former Allentown Trust building at 527 Hamilton which were next to the former theater building. Once one of the city's largest banks, it was built about 1905, In June 1931, the bank had 12,000 depositors and one million dollars in assets. The run on the banks during the Great Depression forced the bank to close and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took over the affairs of the failing bank in June 1932. The building was then used for many years afterwards as offices for Lehigh County until being shuttered about 1988. With the demolition of the vacant properties, a large empty lot was created between the Old Lehigh Country Courthouse and Law Street. The city then graveled over the empty lots and the land remained vacant for several years.Allentown authority weighing Colonial Theater proposals, The Morning Call, June 25th, 2013 The legal issues around the former Colonial Theater building remained for several years until 2008, when the Mendleson Trust settled its dispute with the city over the value of the seized property and payment of city tax liens on that and other properties connected to Mendelson.Settlement reached on Colonial Theater, May 09, 2008By Paul Muschick Of The Morning Call Once the settlement was reached, the large empty lot on the north side of Hamilton Street was offered for sale by the city. After several attempts by the city to sell the vacant lot to several developers, in July 2013 an agreement was made to sell the property to the City Center Development Corporation. Allentown picks City Center to develop Colonial Theater lot, July 23, 2013By Scott Kraus, Of The Morning Call =Redevelopment= In April 2014, construction began on Three City Center, a seven-story, $50 million office/retail building on the former Colonial theater and Allentown Trust Company sites as announced by the City Center Corporation. The Three City Center building is a five-story building that includes 110,000 square feet of retail and office space. It was designed to blend in with surrounding architecture and has two fronts, one on the 500 block of Hamilton Street and the other facing the city's Arts Park. It opened in May, 2015.Allentown's Colonial Theater site building to house major law firm See also * Historical and Notable Sites in Allentown, Pennsylvania References * Colonial Theater * Colonial Theater Demolition, 2005 External links Category:History of Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures in Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Theatres completed in 1920 Category:Music venues completed in 1920 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2005 ","title":"Colonial Theater (Allentown, Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"39778592","text":"Die zärtlichen Verwandten (The Tender Kinsfolk, The Tender Relatives) is a 1930 German comedy film directed by Richard Oswald and starring Harald Paulsen, Charlotte Ander, and Felix Bressart.Kasten & Loacker p.170 The film's art direction was overseen by Franz Schroedter.

Built around Jimmy Johnson's notion of \\"upfield pressure\\", it is a penetrating, swarming defense, with a \\"get there firstest with the mostest\\" mentality.Johnson and Hinton, pp. 87–88.Golenbock, p. 735. The focus is to cause opponents to make mistakes, even if the defense might give up a big gain or two.Bramel. Compared to older 4–3 defenses, such as Tom Landry's 4–3 inside, the defensive line assignments are simpler. Linemen don't read then react, they act then read. Linebackers fill the gaps the linemen leave behind, ignoring gaps away from the play.Patterson, Brandon, What is a “Gap-Sound” Defense? Pt. 3 . May 20, 2013. retrieved June 25, 2013. Coverages are simple, and the playbook small and easy to learn. Miami 4–3, Shade front. Yellow triangles are defensive linemen, yellow squares are linebackers, yellow circles are defensive backs. The base Miami front is an \\"over\\" front, with a nose tackle shaded weak side to the center, a defensive tackle shaded outside the strong side guard, a defensive end shaded outside the tight end, and the weakside end outside the offensive tackle. Each lineman is assigned one gap. Linebackers are stationed about 4 to 4.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage.Simons and Freeman, pp. 14–15. This differs from the old Landry 4–3 defenses, in which linebackers are within 1.5 yards of the line of scrimmage.Lombardi, p. 175-183. The Miami 4–3 uses smaller, faster players than other standard defenses.Brown.Simons and Freeman, pp. 10–13. Defensive ends for the Miami 4–3 are often former linebackers.Johnson and Hinton, p. 44. Outside linebackers are often converted safeties. Players are chosen for speed and aggression more than size and power. The middle linebacker is the one true linebacker, the tackles the two true linemen in this defense. Influence of the new defense Once people realized it could be used to stop the college offenses of the day and also was successful at the NFL level, it became very popular, and started a resurgence in the use of the 4–3.Vanderlinden, p 78.Simons and Freeman, p. 9. College coaches that felt overmatched by the increasing size of offensive lines often switched.Novak. The Miami front influenced all other 4–3 defenses that followed, including the Cover 2 and the Tampa 2 schemes. By some accounts it is the most popular 4–3 played today, due to the simplicity and utility of the scheme. References Bibliography *Bramel, Jene, Guide to N.F.L.

A recipient of 1931 Guggenheim Fellowship for creative work in theatre and drama, and one of the initial members, in 1935, of the Communist Party-founded League of American Writers, he won first prize for Thunderbolt, also referenced as Thunder-Clock, which was judged in a University of Chicago competition to be the \\"best unproduced long play of the year 1935\\".\\"Emjo Basshe dead; Playwright was 40; Won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1931—Also a director\\" (The New York Times, October 29, 1939) Work with Provincetown Playhouse Born in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, then a part of the Russian Empire, Emjo Basshe immigrated to the United States in 1912, at the age of 14. Graduating from Columbia University in 1919, he began his theatrical career with the Provincetown Playhouse on Greenwich Village's MacDougal Street and, in 1920, went to Massachusetts, working with Boston's Peabody Playhouse, then Chelsea Arts Theatre and Cambridge's Castle Square Players, all during 1920–22. Returning to Provincetown Playhouse, he remained until the premiere, on November 6, 1925, of his play, Adam Solitaire, directed by Stanley Howlett, and featuring 19-year-old John Huston among the production's eighteen Provincetown Players, named after and connected with the founders and players of Massachusetts' Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod. Closing night, after 17 performances, was two weeks later and Basshe moved to Pennsylvania, becoming director of the Stage Repertory of Philadelphia, where his three short plays, The Bitter Fantasy, The Star and Soil were presented. Co-founder of the New Playwrights Theatre Again returning to New York, Basshe co-founded, with four others, the New Playwrights Theatre, initially finding a temporary home at the 52nd Street Theatre, where it premiered, on March 9, 1927, his new play, Earth, directed by Russell Wright and Hemsley Winfield. Closing night, after 24 performances, was at the end of the month. Eight months later, On November 29, 1927, in the theatre's home base at another Greenwich Village address, 38 Commerce Street, Basshe's new play, Centuries, set among Jewish residents of a New York City tenement house, had its premiere. Directed by the author, the production had a cast of 27, including future film star Franchot Tone, and lasted for 39 performances, closing in January. Continuing as a director, Basshe next helmed the Playhouse's production of Upton Sinclair's prison-based drama, Singing Jailbirds, which featured future character star, Lionel Stander, as one of the prisoners. Premiering on December 6, 1928, the play lasted 79 performances, closing in February. Provincetown Playhouse dissolved in April 1929 and Basshe pursued his career as a Broadway director at other venues, co-supervising North Carolina playwright Paul Green's musical drama, Roll, Sweet Chariot, set, according to its description, in \\"A Negro Village Somewhere in the South\\". The production, with 51 cast members, premiered at the Cort Theatre on October 2, 1934 and lasted 7 performances. Another Green play directed by Basshe, Turpentine, opened at the Lafayette Theatre on June 26, 1936 and closed in August, following 62 performances. On May 13, a month before the premiere of Turpentine, Basshe's anti-war satire, The Snickering Horses, with a cast of 34, was staged at Daly's 63rd Street Theatre as the concluding presentation of Works Progress Administration's Federal Theatre Project Experimental TheatreRice, Elmer. \\"THE FEDERAL THEATRE HEREABOUTS; Mr. Rice, the Local Regional Director, explains the Aims of the WPA's Drama Activities\\" (The New York Times, January 5, 1936) three-performance cycle of three one-act plays,\\"NEWS OF THE STAGE; Sidney Kingsley, Producer—'Sho-Window' Closes—Third Week for Mr. Hampden's 'Cyrano'\\" (The New York Times, May 5, 1936) with the other two being George Bernard Shaw's Great Catherine: Whom Glory Still Adores and, condensed into one act by Alfred Saxe, Molière's The Miser.\\"NEWS OF THE STAGE; Again the WPA, This Time with Some One-Act Plays—Other Matters Near and Far from Times Square\\" (The New York Times, May 13, 1936) In its synopsis of The Snickering Horses, New Theatre Magazine describes \\"..the horses who pull the stuck artillery out of the mud, and are blown to bits,—with the soldiers—only the horses are smarter.

Each possible outcome of a particular experiment is unique, and different outcomes are mutually exclusive (only one outcome will occur on each trial of the experiment). All of the possible outcomes of an experiment form the elements of a sample space. For the experiment where we flip a coin twice, the four possible outcomes that make up our sample space are (H, T), (T, H), (T, T) and (H, H), where \\"H\\" represents a \\"heads\\", and \\"T\\" represents a \\"tails\\". Outcomes should not be confused with events, which are sets (or informally, \\"groups\\") of outcomes. For comparison, we could define an event to occur when \\"at least one 'heads'\\" is flipped in the experiment - that is, when the outcome contains at least one 'heads'. This event would contain all outcomes in the sample space except the element (T, T). Sets of outcomes: events Since individual outcomes may be of little practical interest, or because there may be prohibitively (even infinitely) many of them, outcomes are grouped into sets of outcomes that satisfy some condition, which are called \\"events.\\" The collection of all such events is a sigma-algebra. An event containing exactly one outcome is called an elementary event. The event that contains all possible outcomes of an experiment is its sample space. A single outcome can be a part of many different events. Typically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event (i.e. all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite (most notably when the outcome must be some real number). So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events. Probability of an outcome Outcomes may occur with probabilities that are between zero and one (inclusively). In a discrete probability distribution whose sample space is finite, each outcome is assigned a particular probability. In contrast, in a continuous distribution, individual outcomes all have zero probability, and non-zero probabilities can only be assigned to ranges of outcomes. Some \\"mixed\\" distributions contain both stretches of continuous outcomes and some discrete outcomes; the discrete outcomes in such distributions can be called atoms and can have non-zero probabilities. Under the measure-theoretic definition of a probability space, the probability of an outcome need not even be defined. In particular, the set of events on which probability is defined may be some σ-algebra on S and not necessarily the full power set. Equally likely outcomes Flipping a coin leads to two outcomes that are almost equally likely. Up or down? Flipping a brass tack leads to two outcomes that are not equally likely. In some sample spaces, it is reasonable to estimate or assume that all outcomes in the space are equally likely (that they occur with equal probability). For example, when tossing an ordinary coin, one typically assumes that the outcomes \\"head\\" and \\"tail\\" are equally likely to occur. An implicit assumption that all outcomes are equally likely underpins most randomization tools used in common games of chance (e.g. rolling dice, shuffling cards, spinning tops or wheels, drawing lots, etc.). Of course, players in such games can try to cheat by subtly introducing systematic deviations from equal likelihood (e.g. with marked cards, loaded or shaved dice, and other methods). Some treatments of probability assume that the various outcomes of an experiment are always defined so as to be equally likely. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a set of equally likely outcomes-- for example, if one were to toss a thumb tack many times and observe whether it landed with its point upward or downward, there is no symmetry to suggest that the two outcomes should be equally likely.

It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple - South Side View History The original temple in the complex, identified as one of the oldest temples of Karnataka, dates back to the early 9th century. The earliest inscriptions referring to the construction of the temple for Shiva, according to the Archaeological Survey of India, are from Nolamba dynasty ruler Nolambadiraja and the Rashtrakuta emperor Govinda III dated c.806, and copper plates of the Bana rulers Jayateja and Dattiya of about c.810. The temple was later under the patronage of successive notable South Indian dynasties: the Ganga Dynasty, the Chola dynasty, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire. In the post medieval era, the local chiefs of Chikaballapura and the rulers of the Mysore Kingdom (Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan) controlled the region before it eventually came under British rule after the death of Tipu Sultan in c.1799. The architectural style is Dravidian. The temple is located at a distance of 60 km from Bangalore. The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. Structure Hoysala era to the Uma-Maheshvara shrine at the Bhoga Nandeeshwara temple complex The temple complex has two large shrines: the \\"Arunachaleswara\\" shrine to the south built by the Gangas of Talakad, and the \\"Bhoga Nandeeshwara\\" shrine to the north built by the Cholas. It has the sculpture of a king considered to be that of Rajendra Chola. In between there is a small intervening shrine called with \\"Uma-Maheshwara\\" shrine with a kalyana mantapa (\\"marriage alter\\") supported by ornate pillars in black stone with reliefs depicting of the Hindu gods Shiva and his consort Parvati, Brahma (the creator) and Saraswathi, Vishnu (the preserver) and his consort Lakshmi, the god of fire Agni and his consort Swaha Devi, and decorative creepers and birds in bas-relief. This is typical to Hoysala architecture. According to the art historian George Michell, the temple is a typical 9th-10th century Nolamba construction with pilasters on the outer walls of the shrines, perforated decorative stone windows which contain figures, of a dancing Shiva (south wall of the Arunachaleshwara shrine) and Durga standing on a buffalo head (north wall of Bhoga Nandeshwara shrine). Pyramidal and tiered towers (shikhara) rise from the two major shrines. Each major shrine has a large linga in the sanctum (the universal symbol of the god Shiva) with a sculpture of Nandi (the bull) in a pavilion facing the shrine. According to Michell, during the 16th century Vijayanagara period, a pavilion with elegant pillars was added in between the two major shrines. The pillars crafted out of grey-green granite have relief sculptures of attendant maidens. Michell feels the minor \\"Uma-Maheshwara\\" shrine was added in between the two major shrines (behind the pavilion) during the post Vijayanagara rule of the Gowdas of the Yelahanka dynasty. The minor shrine has a procession of deities and sages in wall relief. The wall that links the two major shrines was cleverly constructed so as to be in- distinguishable from the two original shrines. A spacious pillared hall was also added in front of the two major shrines.Michell, George (2013), Southern India: A Guide to Monuments Sites & Museums, Chapter: Karnataka, Section: Bengaluru, Sub-section: Nandi, Roli Books Private Limited, Miller, Sam (2012), Karnataka: Chapter from Blue Guide India, Chapter: North Bangalore, Section: Bhoganandishwara, Blue Guides,, Kalyani (Pushkarni) - Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple The \\"Arunachaleswara\\" and the \\"Bhoga Nandeeshwara\\" forms of Shiva represent, according to Hindu legend, two stages in the life of the god Shiva: childhood and youth. The \\"Uma-Maheshwara\\" shrine has reliefs depicting the third stage, Shiva's marriage to the goddess Parvati. Hence this shrine is popular with newly weds who come to seek blessing. The Yoga Nandeeshwara temple on top of Nandi hills represents the final \\"renunciation\\" stage in the life of Shiva and hence this temple is devoid of any festivities. The large shrines each have a sanctum (garbhagriha), a vestibule (sukanasi) and a closed hall (navaranga or mantapa). The vestibule and hall are provided with perforated stone screens called Jali. Each shrine has a nandi mantapa in front (hall with the sculptured image of Nandi the bull) facing the sanctum. The outer bounding wall (prakara) of the complex has two minor shrines for Devi, the female form of divinity (\\"divine core of all Hindu goddesses\\"). To the north of the shrines is a second compound with a navaranga mantapa (pavilion) with Yali pillars. Beyond this compound is a large stepped temple tank (kalyani or pushkarni), locally called \\"Sringeri Teertha\\" (the mythical source of the Pinakini river) where lamps are lit on certain festive days.

Desmaisières grew up around several European monarchs since her brother - whom she travelled with - was an ambassador to such courts though she later decided to take care of girls and women of a poorer socio-economic background which extended to the care of the ill. The sainthood cause opened on 19 August 1902 under Pope Leo XIII - she was titled as a Servant of God - while Pope Pius XI named her as Venerable on 11 June 1922. The same pope beatified her in 1925 and canonized her as a saint in 1934. Life Portrait c. 1846. Micaela Desmaisières López de Dicastillo was born in 1809 in Madrid during the War of Independence to Miguel Desmaisières Flores and Bernarda López de Dicastillo Olmeda; her brother was Diego (1806–55). Her father was a high-ranking officer in the armed forces and her mother was an attendant to Queen Maria Luisa de Parma. Her mother died in her childhood. Her brother's daughter - her niece - was Maria Diega. The Ursulines oversaw her education. Her social connections led her to having cordial relationships with the French and Spanish monarchs as well as Belgian monarchs. She spent most of her childhood with her brother Diego - the Spanish ambassador to the monarchs. Dances and all sorts of social gatherings and horse riding were the norms for her. She received the title of \\"Viscountess of Jorbalán. She tended to ill people during a cholera epidemic in 1834. It was around this period that she searched to find the direction she should give her life. She had inherited from her father a warrior's temperament which prepared her for the hard battles in her later life as well as a generous nature. Her heart was both sensitive and compassionate and her mother guided her towards charitable works towards the poor and the ill; she alternated between this apostolate and the normal life that her social class imposed upon her. She was also fond of spending time before the Blessed Sacrament and it was her love for Jesus Christ in this that it inspired the future of her work. Antonio María Claret served as her confessor from 1857 until her death following the death of her Jesuit confessor José Eduardo Rodriguez who had served as such since 1847. In 1844 she paid her first visit to the Saint John of God Hospital in Madrid on 6 February 1844 where she met a girl - a banker's sole daughter - who had become drawn into prostitution through deception and was now marginalised and facing economic hardship. This girl's experience - as well as others - convinced her that something had to be done to help these women. She began making use of her social connections and set about establishing a shelter where these women could come for help. The shelter was opened on 21 April 1845 and innumerable girls and women knocked at the doors seeking assistance. This uncovered a great need which lead her to found the Handmaids of the Blessed Sacrament on 21 April 1845; it received diocesan approval on 25 April 1858 and then papal approval from Pope Pius IX on 15 September 1860. From 1847 until 1848 she was in both France and Belgium and she tried to enter the Vincentian Sisters in Paris but she did not after the opposition of her confessor. Desmaisières died in Valencia on 25 August 1865 when she fell victim to the cholera epidemic whilst attending to some of the women - and fellow sisters - in the area infected. Her order spread to places such as the United Kingdom and Japan and in 2011 had 1119 religious in a total of 158 houses. Her remains were later relocated in 1891 to the motherhouse of her order. Sainthood The sainthood process opened under Pope Leo XIII on 19 August 1902 and she became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of her life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius XI to name her as Venerable on 11 June 1922. The same pope also confirmed two miracles attributed to her and so beatified her on 7 June 1925 while the confirmation of two more allowed for him to canonize her as a saint on 4 March 1934.

The book was first published on April 1, 1994 through Coffee House Press and follows an African- American family's life and daily struggles in a North Philadelphia inner city.  Plot  In the novel, Absalom Goodman is dying from brain cancer in the hospital where his thoughts drift in and out of the past and present and to his two grown children's lives. Absalom's difficult relationship with his father led him to strive for his children to know gentleness, hard work, and respect but he worries that they have lost sight of these values. His son, Sonny, has moved far away from home and works in white corporate America while his daughter, Rainy, still lives in the family's first home with her boyfriend, aspiring to become a singer and helping her boyfriend deal drugs meanwhile. The novel is the story of this family and their hope in the midst of struggles.  Reception  Critical reception for Losing Absalom has been predominantly positive and MELUS issued a positive review that called it an \\"appealing representation of the African American family.\\" Publishers Weekly praised the novel and wrote that \\"Pate's restrained writing steers clear of the maudlin while gracefully illuminating both the contemporary and timeless aspects to his tale.\\" Philly.com also gave a positive review and stated that \\"its value transcends racial or cultural boundaries.\\" In contrast, the Library Journal criticized the book as being a \\"heavy, overwritten\\" novel. = Awards = *Minnesota Book Award *Best First Novel by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association  References  Category:1994 novels Category:Novels set in Philadelphia Category:1994 debut novels ","title":"Losing Absalom"},{"id":"39779287","text":"Qarujenag (, also Romanized as Qarūjenag; also known as Qūrūchnak and Qūrūch Nak-e ‘Olyā) is a village in Kanduleh Rural District, Dinavar District, Sahneh County, Kermanshah Province, Iran.

Established in 1919, Birdsall provided services to private and public clients throughout the tri- state area, including government agencies, healthcare facilities, developers, industrial and construction managers, architects and attorneys. In June 2013, most of the assets of the now bankrupt firm were purchased by California-based Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (Partner), a national environmental and engineering consulting firm focusing on real estate due diligence. BSG is continuing most of its civil engineering, MEP, regulatory compliance and environmental consulting services under the new company name.  Corporate structure  In 1919, Birdsall Engineering, Inc. was founded by Claude W. Birdsall in Monmouth County. The company provided engineering services to public clients including local municipalities, government agencies and public authorities. In subsequent years, Birdsall significantly expanded its services and client markets by acquiring a number of companies that added new capabilities, including: LGA Engineering, Inc. (Land Development) in 1996, Johnson and Associates (MEP) in 1997, DiStasio & Van Buren, Inc. (Structural) in 1999 and John C. Morris Associates in 2001, which Birdsall combined with Johnson and Associates to form Morris, Johnson & Associates, Inc. (Mechanical/Electrical/IT) in 2002. In 2008 Birdsall purchased PMK Group, Inc. (Environmental, Geotechnical, & Energy) and in 2010 acquired select assets of CMX/SCHOOR DEPALMA (Surveying/Water Resources) and CMX NY, Inc. Initially these firms operated as independent subsidiaries to Birdsall, but in 2010 they were merged to create one cohesive company, known as Birdsall Services Group (BSG). BSG was one of New Jersey's biggest engineering firms, headquartered in Eatontown with seven additional offices in various locations across New Jersey, New York City, and Philadelphia.  Divisions  BSG's key environmental, design and engineering services included: * Civil Engineering * Environmental Engineering * Marine * Mechanical, Electrical, & Plumbing (MEP) * Geotechnical Engineering * Planning * Structural * Sustainable Energy * Transportation * Waste Management * Water Resources * Regulatory Compliance  Key projects  * Pocono International Raceway: Birdsall provided energy and geotechnical consulting services for the Pocono International Raceway, the world's largest solar powered sports facility. BSG worked with NASCAR, Pocono Raceway and photovoltaic specialists at Evolution Energies to develop a 3-megawatt, ground-mounted photovoltaic solar energy system. The 25-acre solar array, which consists of 40,000 photovoltaic modules, is tied into the grid, and provides enough power to operate the entire raceway and 1000 homes nearby. It will produce 72-million kilowatt hours of energy over the next 20 years, enough to offset more than 3100 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. CNN video created a video video about the Pocono Solar Project. * NJSE Award: In 2012, BSG received a “Project of the Year” award from the New Jersey society of municipal engineers (NJSME) for its work on the Hawk Rise Wildlife Sanctuary Ecological Walkway and Trailsystem in Linden. The 2012 Honor Place Award in the category of Municipal Projects involving Intergovernmental Cooperation recognized Birdsall's efforts in transforming the former landfill site into the key greenway which serves as an important part of the city. * Rebuilding Our Backyard: Birdsall was actively involved in post-hurricane Sandy relief efforts, establishing the Rebuilding Our Backyard program to help restore the New Jersey shoreline. Many BSG staff volunteered their time and expertise to help rebuild the Belmar Boardwalk destroyed by the hurricane. At the time Andrew Raichle, former BSG Principal, explained that it was “time to put our coastal and structural experience to use. We need to rebuild our backyard in a responsible manner to make sure we don’t end up here again, because frankly we can’t afford to end up here again”. On November 5, 2012 Birdsall cancelled its annual league party, donating the $35,000 event costs to hurricane relief efforts in the area. BSG was listed on ENR’s Top 200 Environmental Firms at #189 in 2010 and #198 in 2012.  Pay-to-play scandal  In March 2013, seven BSG executives were charged on suspicions of involvement in a scheme to circumvent New Jersey’s so called pay-to-play laws. Prosecutors allege that the executives routinely made – or asked employees to make- illegally reimbursed donations to secure public contracts. By bundling multiple personal political contributions worth less than $300 (which by NJ law do not have to be disclosed) the scheme avoided disqualification under state laws that prohibit public contracts being awarded to firms that have made corporate political contributions to the campaigns of public officials responsible for granting those contracts. On March 26, 2013, a court order authorized the state Attorney General’s office to freeze Birdsall’s assets, then valued at $41.6 million, prompting the firm to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The following month, Birdsall Services Group agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle a civil forfeiture action brought by the attorney general’s office so it could access its bank accounts and pay employees who had temporarily been furloughed. On June 13, the firm pled guilty and was ordered to pay an additional $1m in penalties, fines and institutions. Edwin Stier, who was appointed by a federal bankruptcy judge in April to lead the company, said that “This guilty plea is an acknowledgement on behalf of (Birdsall) of the serious wrongdoing that occurred and accepts the consequences of those actions while still protecting the interests of the innocent employees, clients and creditors”. Individual cases against the seven executives are pending.  Acquisition by Partner Engineering and Science  On June 5, 2013 the United States Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of most of Birdsall Services Group to Partner Engineering and Science, a national engineering and environmental consulting firm with New Jersey offices in Ramsey and Red Bank. The acquisition was finalized on June 21. Partner's President Joseph Derhake has said that the company will not engage in any pay- to-play activities. “We have a track record of winning work based solely on the merit of our professionalism and commitment to excellence, and we are confident that we will be successful doing business in New Jersey with integrity. If we can’t win the work based on merit alone, we don’t want that work.\\" Partner paid $5.6 million for select assets including their accounts receivable, physical assets, select contracts, existing project files, select intellectual property, and license agreements. The activated bankruptcy process protects Partner from any liabilities associated with the pay-to-play case. BSG will continue operating and providing service to its clients largely as previously under the Partner name. The firm has said it will retain as many of Birdsall's staff as possible. The combined firm now has 3 offices in New Jersey, plus 22 more offices across the country providing services including Environmental Due Diligence; Subsurface Investigations and Remediation; Regulatory Compliance; Industrial Hygiene; Building Engineering and Consulting; MEP and Structural Design; Marine and Development and Consulting; Public and Transportation Engineering; Waste Management; Water Resources Management; Construction Risk Management; Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Building Consulting and Design; Land Surveying; and Zoning Reports.

She was to have sung the title role in the first ever staged performance of Mussorgsky’s incomplete opera Salammbô (in the version revised and edited by Zoltán Peskó) in March 1983 at the Teatro San Carlo, Naples, but unforeseen problems in obtaining an exit visa meant that she had to be replaced at a very late stage by the African American soprano Annabelle Bernard of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.\\"Cambiano i cantanti per «Salammbô».\\" L’Unità, 10 marzo 1983, p. 13 (text in Italian).

From 1942 to 1943 she executed some 1,500 Soviet partisans and their family members by machine gun. Makarova was caught by the Soviet KGB in 1976 and executed three years later. Early life Antonina Makarova was born in a small village in the Sychyovsky Uyezd of Smolensk Governorate as Antonina Parfenova. On her first day at school, Parfenova's name was written down as Makarova, from her father's first name, Makar, as the shy girl had forgotten her last name. Later, Makarova studied in Moscow, and when the war broke out she joined the Red Army as a volunteer nurse. Makarova also took courses to learn how to use a machine gun.Antonina Makarova biography Retrieved 26 June 2013. Collaboration with Nazi Germany In the Autumn of 1941, Makarova was separated from her troops. Three months later, in January 1942, she was recruited by the local authorities at the town of Lokot, which was the capital of the Lokot Autonomy, an collaborationist statelet established by the Nazis in October 1941. Makarova was hired as a machine gun shooter. Her job was to execute Russian POWs and partisans including their families. Usually Makarova was ordered to execute a group of 27 people, which was the number of prisoners the local jailhouse could hold. In the evenings Makarova spent time with German officers along with local women who were working as prostitutes. In the summer of 1943 Germans found out that Makarova and the other women had a sexually transmitted disease and they were sent to a hospital in the rearguard. Post-war life As the Red Army entered the Lokot region they found remains of about 1,500 people whom Antonina had executed. Soviet troops captured and killed many Nazi collaborators, but Makarova, who was at a remote hospital, was not among them. In 1945, Makarova married a Russian war veteran named Viktor Ginsburg who was a Jew by origin. His whole family was executed by Germans and Soviet collaborations during the war. They settled in Lepiel, a town in Soviet Belarus, and had two daughters. Antonina and her husband lived as respected citizens enjoying all the privileges granted to war veterans. Trial and execution The KGB kept the case open for many years but could not find the whereabouts of the \\"right\\" Antonina Makarova. In 1976, a Soviet Army officer named Parfenov was registering some documents of his relatives in order to get a visa. He found out that everyone in his family had the last name Parfenov save one: a woman named Antonina Makarova (Ginsburg after marriage). She was later recognized by several witnesses who had known Makarova during the war. The KGB arrested Makarova and the court sentenced her to capital punishment in November 1978. Antonina Makarova was executed by shooting on 11 August 1979. She was one of only three women legally executed by the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin.

Among Spanish-speakers, the plant is known as lagrimas de la virgen (\\"tears of the virgin\\"). Like other Eleutherine species, E. bulbosa has a bulbous rootstock; a large subapical cauline leaf; and small, white, stellate, evening-blooming flowers. E. bulbosa grows in southern Mexico and in the Amazon rainforest, within the borders of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, in addition to the Brazilian states of Amapá and Acre. It is widely cultivated for its medicinal properties. Like E. latifolia, E. bulbosa has a basic chromosome number of x=6 (2n=12); it also has a similar bimodal karyotype, which is distinctive to this plant tribe (Tigridieae); all other genera of the tribe have x=7. Usually, E. bulbosa has a heteromorphic long chromosome pair, the result of a pericentric inversion in one of the long chromosomes, which makes it sexually sterile.Peter Goldblatt and Neil Snow. 1991.

Wacław Król (1915–1991) was a Polish military pilot and an air colonel of the Polish Air Force. A veteran of the Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain during World War II, he served with distinction alongside the Royal Air Force and rose to the rank of wing commander. He also became one of the Polish fighter aces of the war (ranked 15th on Bajan's list). After the war he became a successful historian and author of numerous books. Life Wacław Król graduated from the Polish Air Force Academy of Dęblin in 1935 and joined the Polish Air Forces. A deputy commander of the Polish 121st Fighter Escadrille, he scored his first aerial victory on the very first day of World War II (a Henschel Hs 126, shared with Corporal Paweł Kowala). During the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland, he downed one additional Heinkel He 111 bomber. After September 17 he escaped with his unit to Romania. Interned there, he managed to escape and reach France, where he re-joined the Polish Air Forces. Temporarily attached to the French Groupe de Chasse II/7, he took part in the Battle of France. During the German invasion of that country he shot down two enemy bombers (Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17) and a probable kill of another Do 17. Evacuated to North Africa and then to Great Britain, he joined the Polish units stationed there and took part in the Battle of Britain as member of the No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron. During the battle, he shot down one Messerschmitt Bf 109 over London and one Junkers Ju 88 (shared with two other pilots). For the remainder of the war he served with various other Polish units. First with No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron (one Bf 109 and one Focke-Wulf Fw 190), then with No. 315 Polish Fighter Squadron and eventually with the Polish Fighting Team, better known as \\"Skalski's Circus\\" in North Africa. While there he downed two German Messerschmitts Bf 109 and one Italian Macchi C.202. Upon his return to Europe in October 1943 he rejoined the 302 Polish Fighter Sqn as its commanding officer, eventually rising to the rank of CO of the entire 3rd Polish Fighter Wing (10 March 1945) and the No. 1 Polish Wing (July 1945). Altogether during the war Wacław Król flew 286 missions, is credited with 8.5 or 9 confirmed shootdowns of enemy planes with 3 additional probable kills. After the war he returned to communist-controlled Poland and took a series of menial jobs. After the end of Stalinism he was allowed to join the Polish Army and eventually rose to the rank of Colonel. Retired, he became a successful author of over 30 books documenting the history of Polish World War II air units.

It serves Etawah and the surrounding areas. Etawah stands near the confluence of the Yamuna and the Chambal. History The East Indian Railway Company initiated efforts to develop a railway line from Howrah to Delhi in the mid nineteenth century. Even when the line to Mughalsarai was being constructed and only the lines near Howrah were put in operation, the first train ran from Allahabad to Kanpur in 1859 and the Kanpur–Etawah section was opened to traffic in the 1860s. For the first through train from Howrah to Delhi in 1864, coaches were ferried on boats across the Yamuna at Allahabad. With the completion of the Old Naini Bridge across the Yamuna through trains started running in 1865–66. In 2015, Etawah railway station was developed into a Junction after completion of Etawah–Bhind–Gwalior & Etawah–Mainpuri railline. The first passenger train on this route was started on 27 February 2016. The Etawah–Mainpuri railway line is also operational since 2017.

It is an art-historical monument that, over time, has undergone multiple architectural changes to its structure based on existing trends. The original church dates from 1487 and was built in the Gothic-Mudejar style. In that same century it was remodeled and between 1541 and 1564, Fray Bernardo Manrique, the then bishop, carried out further expansion, building the tower at this time. Significant changes were made during the Baroque period, traces of which still remain. Further reforms were carried out in the late eighteenth century. This involved the decoration of the sacristy, an extraordinary piece, built in 1789, and attributed to José Martín de Aldehuela. Its portal is accessed through a lobby with Evangelio nave, has fine stucco decoration with vegetal elements and apocalyptic symbols. The main changes carried out to the original church were done between 1853 and 1860, by Bishop Juan Nepomuceno Castellana, from which it acquired its neoclassical imprint. These works were commissioned by attorney Federico Vahey, then minister of Grace and Justice under Isabel II. He ordered the construction of the funerary chapel to be dedicated to the worship of San Federico, now known as the Cristo de las Vigías.

Known for a vintage sound that incorporates elements of doo-wop, classic R&B;, garage psych, and surf, Shannon and the Clams has drawn comparisons to both Buddy Holly and 1960s girl groups. They are also said to love \\"music from '50s oldies to '80s punk\\". The band includes vocals from bassist Shannon Shaw, guitarist Cody Blanchard, and keyboardist Will Sprott, along with drums by Nate Mahan. Shaw and Blanchard met at the California College of the Arts, where they began performing together. Shaw is also a member of queercore punk outfit Hunx and His Punx. Shannon and the Clams' debut album, I Wanna Go Home, was released in 2009. In 2011, the group followed up with their sophomore effort, Sleep Talk. Their third album, Dreams in the Rat House, was released in May 2013. Their album, Gone by the Dawn, is described by Still in Rock as \\"the most beautiful manifestation in recent years of what I would call the 'Elvis Presley culture'\\".

Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held white-only pre-primary elections to be unconstitutional. It was the last in a series of court cases addressing the system of white primaries designed to disenfranchise African-American voters in the southern United States. In the first of these cases, Nixon v. Herndon (1927), Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim. After Texas amended its statute to authorize the political party's state executive committee to set voting qualifications, Nixon sued again; in Nixon v. Condon (1932), the Court again found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following this decision, the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases. The Court reversed course, however, with Smith v. Allwright (1944), another of the Texas primary cases. In United States v. Classic (1941), the Court had ruled that primary elections were an essential part of the electoral process, opening Grovey to review. Under this reasoning, the Court found that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, overturning Grovey. Terry v. Adams formed the last of these cases. The petitioners, qualified black voters in Fort Bend County including John Terry, Willie Melton, and Arizona Fleming, sued an organization known as the Jaybird Democratic Association, which since 1889 had organized white-only pre- elections for county offices; the winners of these pre-elections invariably won the subsequent official elections. The Court found for the plaintiffs but reached no majority opinion. Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Harold H. Burton found that an election that effectively excluded black voters violated the Fifteenth Amendment, while Tom C. Clark, Stanley F. Reed, and Robert H. Jackson found in a concurring opinion that the Jaybirds effectively formed an auxiliary of the Democratic Party, bringing the case within the scope of Smith v. Allwright. Justice Sherman Minton dissented.

Likewise superficially, and frequently in ironic or contradictory ways, the series references various traditions, including Christianity (e.g., The Seven Deadly Sins, the Ten Commandments) and the Arthurian legend (e.g., in naming Meliodas, Escanor, Merlin, Diane, Gowther, King, and Ban). The contradictory nature of the names given to the groups and characters is reflected in the emergence of the title group as the protagonists and the group of \\"Holy Knights\\" as the antagonists of the series. In accordance with the medieval theme, many of The Seven Deadly Sins are depicted as knights, broadly construed, who are clad in stylized variations of medieval armor, many of whom perform magic. The five major clans in the series are Humans, Giants, Fairies, Goddess, and Demons, all of which possess powerful abilities and magical powers. In naming the characters, the manga offers a wide variety of further mythical, historical, geographical, and cultural allusions, e.g., King Arthur, Merlin, Gowther, Zaratras (Zoroaster), Dreyfus, Gustaf, Frisia, Jericho, Galand, Derierrie, Albions, The Vampires, and Zhivago. Main characters =Meliodas= is the leader of the Seven Deadly Sins, who bears the sin of wrath as a Dragon symbol on his left shoulder. Despite being called the Sin of Wrath, displaying it whenever those dear to him are endangered or killed, Meliodas conceals his rage under the façade of a mellow trickster who is often seen fondling Elizabeth one way or another. When found by Elizabeth at the start of the series, who seeks his help in reuniting the Deadly Sins after their disbandment ten years prior, Meliodas reveals to be doing the same thing. Despite his adolescent appearance, Meliodas is actually a Demon who is over three thousand years old. Meliodas is later revealed to be the son of the Demon King and original leader of the Ten Commandants, possessing the fragment of his father's soul embodying Love. But Meliodas turned his back on his people when he fell in love with the Goddess Elizabeth, killing two of his fellow Commandments and causing the Holy War to occur. The Demon King allowed the Supreme Deity of the Goddess race to curse Meliodas with immortality, with the Demon King cursing Elizabeth with perpetual death and reincarnation to make his son suffer every time he is reunited with her. Due to the curse's nature, Meliodas' soul ends up in Purgatory with the Demon King feasting on his emotions before reviving him, gradually reverting to his former self as a result. After Elizabeth begins regaining her memories as the goddess Elizabeth, Meliodas resolves to become the new demon king to break their curses. He disbands the Deadly Sins and enters an alliance with Zeldris after promising to use his status to release his brother's love Gelda, revealing to have absorbed the Commandment of Pacifism and intending to absorb the other commandments. Despite becoming a vessel for the Demon King before managing to force him out of his body, Meliodas freed him and Elizabeth from their curses though he would leave the living world because his power as a demon king. But the victory is short-lived as the Demon King possesses Zeldris and restores Elizabeth's curse, prompting the Sins' final battle with the Demon King. After killing his father, Meliodas sacrifices his demon king powers to completely destroy the commandments to prevent the Demon King from reviving. As Seven Deadly Sins' captain once revered by his kin as the most powerful demon, Meliodas is immensely powerful and agile. His signature ability is called , which reflects magical attacks back at the attacker with far greater power, the only drawbacks being that he can only use it as a counter and that it is ineffective against physical attacks. Meliodas can also tap into his demonic power, manifesting versatile dark energy from his body to increase his offense and defense at the cost of entering a berserk state. Meliodas initially carried a sword hilt called the Dragon Handle before it was stolen by Helbram and later revealed to be a fragment of the Coffin of Eternal Darkness, which was used to seal away the Demon clan. He later regains his Sacred Treasure , a curved short-sword that allows him to create up to four weaker clones of himself that compensate for their lack in power by using Full Counter to its full potential. =Elizabeth Liones= : is originally from the Kingdom of Danafor before it was destroyed. She was adopted by Baltra Liones as the third princess of Liones. She becomes an ally of the Seven Deadly Sins when seeking their help after the Great Holy Knights seized control of the kingdom, serving as a waitress in Meliodas' bar. Despite being frail and not a fighter, Elizabeth is very courageous and willing to protect others at the cost of her own health, like allowing Hendrickson to acquire her blood to free the Demon Race from the Coffin of Eternal Darkness. Still, being only a teenager, she is fairly gullible and easily influenced, often tricked by Meliodas' jokes. She doesn't seem to mind how often he caresses, molests, or harasses her sexually, however, and has even fallen in love with him due to a sense of familiarity with and nostalgia for him. Elizabeth is later revealed to be the 107th reincarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, Meliodas' first love and daughter of the Supreme Deity of the Goddess Race. But their forbidden romance ended with her killed and cursed by the Demon King to reincarnate endlessly as a means to further punish Meliodas by forcing him to watch Elizabeth endlessly die in various ways and find her all over again. This enables Elizabeth to miraculously heal the living through her right eye's tears, later manifesting abilities that only those of the Goddess Race possess at times of great stress. Elizabeth eventually regains full memory of her previous incarnations and her full Goddess power is unleashed, activating her curse to kill her three days as the New Holy War is able to commence. This forces Meliodas to take a gambit of acquiring his father's power to break Elizabeth's curse, with Merlin briefly restoring the curse in secret as a means to force Meliodas to kill his father. =Hawk= : is a talking pig and Meliodas's pet/companion, introduced as the Boar Hat's 'captain of the Order of Scraps Disposal' as he eats the disgusting table scraps. Hawk found Meliodas in a ditch sixteen years prior, and the two established a mobile bar together, having been together ever since. They often engage in harmless banter, with Hawk frequently seen scolding Meliodas for his perverted actions towards Elizabeth. Though mostly serving as comic relief by acting overly arrogant, he yet aids Elizabeth and the Sins several times, utilizing headbutts and other modest attacks on weaker enemies and transporting wounded allies. In the Kingdom Infiltration Arc, Hawk sacrifices himself to block a fatal attack of Hendrickson's aimed at Meliodas, and his death caused much anguish for Elizabeth and the Sins. But Hawk mysteriously revives from his remains as a piglet before regaining his normal size through excessive eating. Besides Meliodas, Hawk gets particularly well along with Ban and Merlin. Later, the latter equips him with a Balor Power Eye that allows him to detect the power level of anyone he sees. During his training in Istal, Hawk learns that he temporarily acquires the traits of whatever magical creature he eats, obtaining their powers until he digests them. It is later revealed that Hawk is a denizen of Purgatory and the younger brother of Wild, the latest of the creatures that the Demon King used as a means of spying on Meliodas from Purgatory. The Seven Deadly Sins The were the strongest and cruelest order of Holy Knights in the kingdom, formed by Meliodas and six other brutal criminals from various races who were branded symbols of beasts to symbolize the sin that motivated their crimes. Each of the members of the group had the highest Holy Knight ranking, Diamond. They were branded as traitors to Britannia, having allegedly abetted the assassination of the Great Holy Knight Zaratras. The Deadly Sins are eventually absolved of their crimes after liberating Liones from rule of the Holy Knights. =Diane= : :, standing thirty-feet tall, is a 750 year-old member of the Giants' Clan from the land of Megadoza, who bears the Sin of Envy, symbolized by a Serpent symbol tattooed on her left thigh. Unlike her more violent kinsmen who make a living as mercenaries, Diane dislikes fighting. Having run away from home, she came upon King by chance, and the two spent centuries together before he erased her memories of him, and she returned to her tribe soon after. She later became an apprentice of her chieftain Matrona, alongside Dolores, and accompanied Matrona when she was hired by a Holy Knight unit under the command of Gannon, who actually intended to kill the giants and make name for himself. It ended with Matrona seemingly dying from being poisoned and slaughtering the knights with Diane ending up in Liones' custody and falsely excused of both the knights' slaughter and murdering Matrona in an act of envy. She was recruited by Meliodas before her execution could be carried out. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, Diane hid in the Forest of White Dreams before Meliodas and Elizabeth recruit her, Diane having feelings for the former for treating her like an equal and being initially jealous whenever he flirts with Elizabeth. But after being impressed with Elizabeth's selflessness before regaining her memories of her time with King, Diane becomes very good friends with Elizabeth. :As a Giant, Diane is incredibly strong with a deep connection to nature which allows her to manipulate the earth with her race's ability . Diane retains her strength and agility even when human-sized while participating in a fighting festival under Matrona's name, quickly defeating ten men and hardening her skin, thereby making it as hard as iron to enhance her durability and strength. Her sacred treasure is Gideon, a 2200 pound war- hammer that enhances Diane's earth manipulation powers to a point where a single swing can lift a mountain into the air. =Ban= : :, is a member of the Deadly Sins and bears the Sin of Greed, symbolized by Fox symbol tattooed above the left side of his waist. Despite being a good-natured person, he is the Sins' most immoral member and infamous as a legendary bandit. At times, the team thinks of him as annoying and very immature. He had taken to a life of thievery at a young age under the tutelage of Zhivago (for example he stole clothes). Years later, Ban learned of the Fountain of Youth and attempted to become immortal so he would live long enough for \\"something good to happen to him\\". However, Ban changed his mind when the fountain's guardian Elaine revealed the forest would die if he drank the liquid. He fell in love with the fairy over seven days. She was grateful for him, as her brother had left her alone for seven hundred years prior to meeting Ban. A red demon appeared soon after and in an attempt to kill it, Ban and Elaine were fatally wounded. However, Elaine saved Ban by giving him the liquid from the fountain through a kiss. As she was dying, she gave him an Almoca Seed, which he uses to create a new Sacred Tree. Ban was falsely accused by the Liones Kingdom of destroying and stealing from the previous fountain; he was later recruited by Meliodas after surviving numerous executions. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, Ban allowed himself to be captured and held captive within Baste Dungeon, which he escaped occasionally so he could tend to the Sacred Tree. He was later nicknamed “King Ban” by the fairy race for his actions. He eventually rejoins the Deadly Sins and serves as a cook in the Boar Hat, whilst getting into occasional confrontations with Meliodas and King. During the New Holy War, after returning from Purgatory with Meliodas' emotions, Ban uses his experience there to transfer his immortality into Elaine to save her life. : Being immortal, Ban is unaffected by fatigue or need of sustenance. Ban heals from any wound, regardless of the severity. In addition, his blood has healing properties due to his immortality. His trademark ability is , which allows him to rob others of their possessions and even physical abilities as he can temporarily sap another's physical strength and speed. Ban also shows some skill with weaponry in the present, particularly with a three-section staff very similar in appearance to a nunchaku. His sacred treasure Courechouse is a four-sectioned staff that was ironically stolen from him during the Deadly Sins' disbandment. =King= : :The child-like King , his real name being , is the 1300-year-old member of the Fairy Race who bears the Sin of Sloth, symbolized by Grizzly bear symbol tattooed just above his left ankle. He is portrayed as the group's 'straight man' while often getting caught up in the others' shenanigans. Originally the third king of the Fairy King's Forest, King forsook his duties when he left his domain to rescue his friend Helbram from human abductors and he was saved by Diane after being inflicted with amnesia-inducing injuries. Centuries after regaining his memories and realizing his amnesia was caused by a maddened Helbram, King is forced to kill his friend to cease his human killing spree. He then erased Diane's memories of him before being sentenced by Liones to a 1000-year imprisonment for failing to stop Helbram in time and abandoning his duties as king, with the Fairy King's Forest eventually being destroyed by a demon that would kill his sister Elaine. After joining the Seven Deadly Sins, King would occasionally disguise himself as a slovenly over-weighted man to keep Diane from remembering him. Following the Deadly Sins' disbandment, King finally learned of his homeland's destruction while believing Ban was responsible. He crosses paths with the Sins when they heard he took refuge in the Necropolis, reluctantly rejoining the group once learning the truth behind his sister's death. Despite Diane's affection towards Meliodas, King remains devoted to her as she eventually regains her memories of their time together. :Like members of the fairy race, King has the ability to levitate and float through the air, as well as being able to levitate certain objects and manipulate their trajectory without the need of making physical contact. King also possesses a sacred treasure called . A spear crafted from a sacred tree only found in the Fairy Realm, it is much stronger than steel and possesses the mysterious qualities of the tree, which King's ability, , draws out. At will, King can instantly change Chastiefol into one of several different forms, including a pillow which can act as a shield, different forms of spears (one of which can turn an enemy to stone), a massive flower sprouted from the earth that projects an enormous energy beam, and even a large stuffed grizzly bear. But despite his impressive magical abilities and able to move at speeds while in midair, King is physically weak and unable to hold his own in a fight while unarmed. :King was voted the most popular character by a large margin in a Weekly Shōnen Magazine character poll for the series, with close to four times as many votes as Ban, who came in second place. =Gowther= : : is a member of the Deadly Sins who bears the Sin of Lust, symbolized by the Goat symbol tattooed above his breast; he is an androgynous and bespectacled bookworm with pink hair who originally clad himself in a massive suit of armor Merlin designed to stabilize his power due to his unstable mind. He is first seen as emotionless and analytically stoic while also very socially inept as his curiosity often has him performing highly questionable actions, such as manipulating the memories of others. At the time he was discovered, being a skilled actor when he feels like it, he was living under the alias Alan and traveling with a Holy Knight named Dale whom he clad in his armor on to contain the knight's transformation into a demon. : Gowther is later revealed to be an animated doll created by his namesake, a demon sorcerer forced to bear the Demon King's soul fragment bearing , which causes those inflicted by it to lose their sense of self. While modeled after his creator's lover Glariza to serve as his proxy in the Ten Commandments. Gowther received free will before helping his creator end the Holy War by rewriting Mael's identity. Gowther disappeared afterward, found centuries later in the cellar of Liones Castle by Batra's sister Princess Nadja, whom Gowther fell in love with. While Nadja returned the sentiment, she died from an illness while resting against Gowther. Gowther tried reviving her with his magic heart, a charm that he was told gives him his emotions, but it failed to resurrect her while making it appear that he sadistically murdered her. Gowther accepted the blame out of guilt while discarding his magic heart to render himself emotionless to no longer feel the pain of losing Nadja. It was only after learning that King and Diane were searching for his magic heart that Gowther learned that it was only a placebo to begin with and begins accepting his emotions, allowing him to be more sociable while using his power to its full extent without trouble. :Gowther's special ability, Invasion, is a versatile ability that enables him to invade a person's mind and manipulate it in various ways that include memory alteration, forcing opponents to relive their worse moments, and telepathically relaying coordinated battle plans to his allies almost instantaneously. As a doll, Gowther has shown a high level of resilience to attacks normally fatal to humans like decapitation. His sacred treasure is Herritt, which takes the form of twin bows made of light which greatly enhances the spread and range of his Invasion. Like Hawk, Gowther is equipped with a Balor Power Eye that allows him to detect the overall power level of anyone in his vicinity. =Merlin= : : a cool and calculative member of the Deadly Sins who bears the Sin of Gluttony, symbolized by the Boar symbol tattooed above her neck, normally in the form of an attractive raven-haired woman in skimpy clothing, Merlin is a 3000-year-old witch known as the Daughter of Belialuin as her true name is unpronounceable by humans. Trained by her father the chief sage and the demon wizard Gowther, Merlin possessed vast magical potential and was raised as a weapon for her peoples' use against the higher ranking goddesses and demons. She fled Belialuin and crossed paths with Meliodas whom she fell in love, motivating her to assume an adult form and use a combination of the Infinity and spells to render herself an ageless immortal. She bore no animosity towards Meliodas and Elizabeth when they fell in love with each other, treating the latter like a sister. Merlin lives up to her sin with her obsession of filling the void in her heart when she learned of Chaos and resolves to release the entity from its seal, causing Belialuin's destruction when exploited the recruitment attempts of the Demon King and the Supreme Deity to increase her power with added immunity to their factions' powers. : After enlisting the giant Dabuzu to create the Coffin of Eternal Darkness in order to seal away the Demons and the Supreme Deity, Merlin wandered Brittania before reuniting with Meliodas and helping him establish the Seven Deadly Sins as a means to eliminate either the Demon King or the Supreme Deity to cause the imbalance needed for her agenda. When the Sins were accused of killing Zaratras, Merlin knocked Meliodas out to extract most of his power as a precautionary measure due to the wrath and destruction Meliodias released upon the death of one of Elizabeth's reincarnations. Before returning to the Sins, Merlin positioned herself as mentor to a young Arthur Pendragon. While on somewhat friendly terms with the other Deadly Sins, Merlin seemed to particularly enjoy Escanor's unrequited feelings for her. Following the death of the Demon King, having influenced events of the group's final battles by reactivating Elizabeth's reincarnation curse, Merlin reveals her true reasons for aiding the Sins when she conducts a ritual to resurrect Arthur as a vessel of Chaos. The other Sins feel betrayed after learning Merlin's story from the Lady of the Lake. : Merlin has mastery over a vast repertoire of spells with flight, illusions, and telekinesis among them. She can maintain any spell indefinitely regardless of its mana cost through her ability Infinity. Through the Demon King's and Supreme Deity's boons, with immunity to being manipulated by goddesses and any form of curse, Merlin acquires spells exclusive to the Demon and Goddess races like Perfect Cube, a Demon spell which encases and traps a small area in a cube-like barrier that is impervious to virtually any attack. Merlin's Sacred Treasure is a crystal ball known as , which allows her to perceive anything or transfer her consciousness into it, which she makes use of when her body is temporarily turned to stone by Galand's commandment. =Escanor= : :, a member of the Deadly Sins who bears the Sin of Pride, symbolized by the Lion symbol tattooed on his back, the middle-aged Escanor was originally a prince of the Kingdom of Castellio until he was disowned and driven from his homeland due to his inability to control his monstrous strength, with a woman named Rosa helping him escape via the sea in a barrel. He had been traveling alone ever since, helping wherever he goes but driven off by fearful townsfolk. He later ended up joining the Seven Deadly Sins as their final member when he ended up in Liones, making him feel welcome as he fell in love with Merlin and later played a role in devastating Edinburgh Castle during the Deadly Sins' battle with the vampires. Following the group's disbandment, Escanor opened a secret tavern in the mountains where he remained until Ban found him by accident. Escanor rejoins the Deadly Sins soon after and lives in the aftermath of the group's final battle against the Demon King. :For reasons unknown, Escanor acquired Archangel Mael's Grace , which increases his physical strength depending on the position of the sun at the cost of making him overconfident. Escanor reaches his full power for one minute of noon when the sun is at its zenith, exceeding every living being on the planet as power incarnate known as \\"The One\\". Escanor can also use this ability to emit sunlight from his body so as to destroy nearly everything in close proximity. Escanor's sacred treasure is Rhitta, a massive ornate one-handed axe with a crescent blade created by \\"the maiden loved by the sun\\". At night, he cannot even lift the weapon off the ground, but he can easily grasp with a single hand the moment it becomes dawn. He can summon Rhitta to his side at a moment's notice and is able to store sunlight within it for later use. Demon Clan Demons are a race of beings who were at odds with the Goddess race 3,000 years ago until Meliodas' actions caused his people to wage war against the Goddesses and Stigma, an alliance of the Human, Giant, Fairy races. The demons were sealed away, only to be released into Britannia through the machinations of the demon Fraudrin. The high-ranking Demons possess seven hearts, making them difficult to kill. =Demon King= : The is the ruler of the Demon Clan, and being the father of Meliodas and Zeldris as well as the one who cursed Elizabeth with reincarnation. Like the Supreme Deity, he was created by the entity Chaos whom they sealed away. Due to his power being potent enough to wipe out Britannia, he is physically forced to remain in Purgatory. He is also the creator and leader of the Ten Commandments, handpicking its members and granted them their Commandments to condition them as potential vessels to transfer his spirit once one among them absorbed all the Commandant sigils. During the New Holy War, the Demon King manages to possess Meliodas when he absorbed the Commandants and engages his son in the metaphysical battle while battling his comrades and mortally wounding Zeldris. Though purged from Meliodas, the Demon King's spirit was able to take over Zeldris's body with Cusack's help before engaging the Seven Deadly Sins in an epic battle. The Demon King is eventually exorcised from Zeldris, forcing the entity to create a body from the surrounding countryside before Meliodas destroys his father for good. However, the Demon King's death causes an imbalance that weakened the he and the Supreme Deity placed on Chaos. =The Ten Commandments= Ten elite demons selected personally by the Demon King, they were originally led by Meliodas 3000 years prior before he fell in love with Elizabeth, which caused the Holy War. Each of the Ten Commandments can make use of a curse which plays on the virtue that they represent. The Commandments are named after virtues they are branded with, later revealed to be fragments of the Demon King's soul, which play on the nature of their curses. A commandment's sigil passes to whomever defeats the current holder or receives it willingly, with the one who possesses all ten sigils gaining power equal to the Demon King's yet subject to becoming his vessel. The Commandment sigils are eventually destroyed when Meliodas permanently destroys the Demon King. ; : :The Ten Commandments' acting leader and Meliodas' younger brother, bearing the sigil of Piety which turns those who turn their back on him into obedient servants to him and the Demon King, by extension. This ability relates to Zeldris' resentment towards Meliodas before betraying their father despite the Demon King's still wanting his older brother to become the new Demon King. Though having acquired the other sigils, Zeldris gives them to Meliodas after his brother promised to use his power as Demon King to revive the vampire Gelda whom Zeldris developed feeling for. But Zeldris realizes the truth of the Demon King's succession as he is mortally wounded helping the Deadly Sins save Meliodas from the Demon King's possession. But Cusack unknowingly makes Zeldris his father's new body in the aftermath of the New Holy War. Luckily, the Deadly Sins manage to free Zeldris as he and a revived Gelda take their leave after the Demon King is destroyed. ; : : An upper-class demon resembling a spiked giant with a mouth on his chest, he was previously a general during the ancient war before being promoted to a substitute Commandment following Gowther's disappearance, despite not receiving the Demon King's soul fragment representing Selflessness. Fraudrin is the cause of the Danafall Kingdom's destruction, having accidentally been released from the Coffin of Eternal Darkness together with other low-class demons, only to be nearly killed when Meliodas' rage vaporized the kingdom after Fraudrin murdered Liz. This forced a weakened Fraudrin to possess the body of Dreyfus when he and Hendrickson were sent to investigate the ruins, using the two humans in a scheme to get revenge on Meliodas while bringing the rest of the demons back to Britannia. Pretending to be Dreyfus until the Ten Commandments were freed, he developed an emotional attachment to Dreyfus' son Griamore as a result; Fraudrin rejoins the group to replenish his strength while revealing his substitute status while in the Pleiades of the Azure Sky's custody. During the Commandments' attack on Liones, Zaratras and Hendrickson eventually exorcise Fraudrin with the demon ending up fighting Meliodas. Fraudrin attempts to self-destruct and take Liones with him but stops at Griamore's pleas, realizing Meliodas' motivation for betraying their people and allowing him to end his life. ; : : The normally laid-back adopted brother of Zeldris and Meliodas, possessing a version of the latter's Full Counter ability that allows him to reflect physical attacks. Estarossa is later revealed to be originally Archangel of the Goddess Race who possess the Grace which increases his power while exposed to sunlight. Being among those who slaughtered unarmed demons at the start of the Holy War, Mael's identity was rewritten by the Commandant Gowther to have him take Meliodas' place in the Ten Commandants as the holder of the Demon King's soul fragment representing , enabling him to nullify any damage by those with hatred in their hearts. But traces of Estarossa's former identity linger as retain his love with Elizabeth and his deep-seated grudge toward Meliodas for stealing her heart, which strengthened his false memories. : Being easily defeated by a fully powered Escanor during the siege of Liones since his opponent did not harbour any hatred towards him, Estarossa learns of Zeldris's alliance with Meliodas to make the latter the new Demon King and acts against them by taking Galand and Monspeet's Commandments. Through restored to his true identity after absorbing them, the commandments drive Mael mad as he kills Derieri for her Commandment and then Oslo before being defeated. After Gowther helps him expel the commandments, Mael uses a spell to enable Oslo and Derieri to reincarnate with their memories intact. Mael then joins the Deadly Sins to end the new Holy War and stop the Demon King to atone for his role in the previous Holy War. ; : :A gangly and arrogant demon with blood-lust who is clad in armor and armed with a halberd, Galand possesses the fragment of the Demon King's soul representing , which petrifies whomsoever lies to him. A power which would also consume him should he break his own promise. After being revived, through not yet back at full power, Galand decides to attack Camelot as a warm-up upon learning Meliodas is there. Subjecting Merlin to his commandment's power when she attempts to stall for time after he killed most of Camelot's knights, Galand takes his leave after Gowther manipulates him into thinking that he killed the Deadly Sins and Slader. After being easily overpowered by Meliodas after he regains his full powers, Galand accompanies Melascula to Raven, where they begin to hunt Ban, Jericho, and Elaine. The search takes the demons to Escanor's bar, with Galand showing his love for alcohol and challenging Escanor to a \\"game\\" in which the two would take turns hitting each other with their weapons until one would end up dead. Despite being split in half by the Sin of Pride, he regenerates and uses his most powerful ability \\"Critical Over\\" to try and finish off Escanor, only to see that his attack barely managed to scratch him. Galand ignores Melascula's warnings out of pride before attempting to flee as Escanor was about to finish him and is petrified as a result. Galand remained conscious and is later found by Estarossa, who shatters him in order to acquire his Commandment. ; : :A sophisticated, human-looking demon with a thin moustache and purple hair. He's a gentleman of sorts and is usually close to Derieri. He represents the Commandment of Reticence. He is seen utilizing long-ranged fire-based magic in the form of birds. He and Derieri are beaten by Meliodas' shortly after he re-awakened, and later seen relaxing in a small cabin, hiding their identities as Demons and ignoring the summons from Zeldris, implying that they no longer wish to partake in fighting. It is revealed that his Commandment prevents him from revealing his true feelings, when he implies that he loves Derieri but also points out that he cannot actually say it to her, due to his commandment. :He is killed by Estarossa while protecting Derieri from a surprise attack. ; : :A female demon with spiky, unruly hair who is naked save for a few patches of darkness covering parts of her body. She has a crude, yet carefree personality. Derieri always prefaces her comments with \\"to say from the ass\\" which Monspeet often expands on in a long- winded fashion. She represents Purity in the Ten Commandments. She is a formidable physical combatant, gaining additional power the longer she launches consecutive blows at an enemy. She expresses a deep-seated hatred towards the Goddess clan for one of them killing her older sister among several noncombatant demons that they held hostage. As a result, she and Monspeet each gave up six of their seven hearts, increasing their power but placing them at a greater risk of dying compared to other demons. She and Monspeet are later beaten by Meliodas, shortly after he re-awakened and are seen later relaxing in a small cabin, hiding their identities as Demons. Having lost her will to fight, Derieri decides to go to Camelot and return her Commandment to Zeldris, but Estarossa finds them first. Monspeet manages to save her from being killed by launching her away from Estarossa, conveniently sending her to where the assault team composed of Holy Knights, the Four Archangels, and the Seven Deadly Sins are fending off a demon attack. :When Estarossa spirits Elizabeth away, Derieri offers her help to King, Sariel, and Tauriel in retrieving her. She comes up with a plan to hold Estarossa once he is revealed as Mael from the Goddess clan by working as a team with Gowther, King, and the rest. However, she dies after Mael blows out her last heart in the battle, which results in her commandment being absorbed as well. In the afterlife, she is thankful to Elizabeth as she finally learns about Monspeet's feelings for her. After Mael is saved from the commandments, he uses a spell to allow Oslo's and Derieri's souls keep their memories of their previous lives in their next reincarnation. ; : :A female demon with the appearance of a dainty woman with long, pink hair. She has a calm, yet mocking personality and represents Faith in the Ten Commandments, which means that anyone who loses faith or doubts their convictions in her presence will have their eyes set on fire. She uses her aura to summon the souls of the dead in order to create a zombie army to wipe out humans and can summon lesser demons as well. She uses this ability to resurrect Elaine to fight on her behalf. When Elaine overcomes her control, she and Galand confront Ban. She rips Ban's soul from his body in order to consume it, only for Zhivago to sacrifice himself in Ban's place. :When they stumble into Escanor's bar, Galand convinced her to drink, and the two quickly become inebriated. Melascula watches the duel between Galand and Escanor, and becomes horrified by Escanor's power. She watches helplessly as Galand is turned into stone by his own Commandment after he fails to inflict any damage on Escanor whatsoever, even with his strongest attack. She then tries to kill Escanor by taking his soul and eating it, but Escanor's Sunshine ability burns her to ashes from the inside and she falls into a chasm. She is later revealed to have survived, but her entire body is blackened and charred and her hair is missing. She's healed by Gloxinia, and when she tries to take Meliodas' soul, Ban, who is teleported to their location with the help of Gilfrost, snaps her neck (which ends up dislodging her jaw) and rips out every heart in her body save one, thereby falling short of killing her. She is later employed to keep a barrier around Camelot, preventing it from being detected, and when the Seven Deadly Sins attempt to dispel the barrier, she traps Meliodas in her Dark Cocoon, from which he only manages to break out by fully embracing his demonic powers. :It is later revealed that she was never a true demon, but in fact a snake that collected large amounts of Demonic energy within its body. This energy is eventually drained from her by Merlin, and she is reduced to her original state of a tiny little snake with no special powers. In this state, Merlin traps her in a test tube in order to study her. ; : :Drole is a giant with four arms and grayish- blue skin that covers his face with a bag. Underneath it, he has a human-like face with dark hair covering the left side of his face and a large scar over his gouged-out left eye. He is the founder of the Giants' Clan and is known as Balor to humans. According to the legends of the Giant Clan, he is recognized as a God by some and created a sacred dance with deep connections to nature and earth; despite this, he was shunned during his youth due to his unusual appearance even by giants' standards. He was only accepted in his adulthood due to his valor in battle, which the relatively primitive Giants' Clan praises more than anything. He, alongside Gloxinia, turns Vaizel into a gigantic labyrinth in order to gather fighters to attract the Seven Deadly Sins. His power over Creation is so great that it even dwarfs Matrona's. He represents Patience in the Ten Commandments. He and Gloxinia show King and Diane their memories of 3,000 years prior in order to explain why they joined the Demon clan, and eventually abandon their positions as part of the Ten Commandments after realizing the error of their ways as King and Diane, placed in their bodies, end up making choices different from those they themselves made; for Drole, it was when Zeldris made him choose between a position in the Ten Commandments or death: in his place, Diane chose to simply run away. He is killed by Chandler while he and Gloxinia try to protect the Seven Deadly Sins. ; : :Grayroad is a queen-caste low-class demon composed of multiple dwarf- sized Gray Demons shrouded in a miasma-like mass, able to shape-shift into any form and turn humans into low-level demons. She possesses the fragment of the Demon King's soul representing Pacifism, causing anyone who kills in her presence to forfeit their remaining years and immediately grow old and die of old age. She also commands powerful cursing magic that automatically returns her target to the location at which she cursed them, preventing them from escaping her. Grayroad ends up becoming one of Merlin's test subjects when the witch proves herself to be immune to Grayroad's commandment and is captured in a test tube after attempting to flee. ; : :An effeminate demon who was originally the first Fairy King and member of Stigma, who was assumed to have been killed by the Demon King during the Ancient War. In reality, Gloxinia allied himself with the demons after believing his unconscious sister Gerharde was killed by a human ally named Rou, whom he killed after some Stigma members attacked his homeland. Gloxinia replaces a previous Commandant Meliodas killed as holder of the fragment of the Demon King's soul representing Repose. He wields the Spirit Spear Basquias, which constantly covers him in the form of tentacles and that has a versatile set of abilities similar to those of King's Chastiefol, but at a much higher level of potency and destructiveness. He and Drole show King and Diane their memories of 3,000 years prior in order to explain why they joined the Demon clan and eventually abandon their positions as Ten Comandments after realizing the error of their ways as King and Diane, being placed in their bodies, end up making choices different from those they themselves made. In King's case, he spares Rou's life out of comparing Rou and Gerharde to Ban and Elaine. He and Drole are killed by Chandler when they try to protect the fleeing Seven Deadly Sins. ; : : A Demon sorcerer and Merlin's mentor who was forced to bear the Demon King's soul fragment representing Selflessness and subsequently imprisoned for five centuries when he refused to fight for the Demon King. Prior to his imprisonment, he created a proxy body in the likeness of his lover Glariza to observe the outside world until he used the Ancient War to orchestrate his escape with the intent of ending the conflict through a ritual to alter the identity of Archangel Mael into Estarossa, selecting him for being Glariza's killer. But the large demand of magical energy needed for the ritual's success kills Gowther, passing his commandment and name on to his creation who joins the Seven Deadly Sins three millennia later. =Original Demon= is a centaur-like demon that Demon King had created as his adviser and ended up splitting into two separate beings as punishment for attempting to overthrow him during a revolt. The two halves of the Original Demons, Chandler and Cusack, are instilled with the need to mentor the Demon King's sons Meliodas and Zeldris as the Demon King's heirs with both unaware of how the succession works. The Original Demon is briefly restored during the New Holy War when Chandler and Cusack regain memories of their original self, before Mael's attack splintered him back into two components. ; :An extremely powerful high-class demon and Meliodas' former mentor, titled as the \\"Pacifier Demon\\" from apparently sucking the marrow from his victims' bones. Chandler showing an obsession for Meliodas as he blames Elizabeth for his apprentice's betrayal while refusing to acknowledge anyone else as the next Demon King. He normally appears as an old man with a demon mark on the right side of his face, extremely proficient in magic and having taught Meloidas the Full Counter technique. While enraged, he becomes immensely muscular with his hair and eyes blackened and dragon-like wings sprouting from his back. In this form, Chandler is powerful to overwhelm the Deadly Sins on his own and conjure the daylight obscuring \\"True Night\\". Chandler is killed in the aftermath of the New Holy War by Cusack after the two briefly merged back into their original form. ; :An extremely powerful high-class demon and Zeldris' mentor, titled the \\"Napping Reaper\\" with his power imposing enough to instill fear in Excalibur. Cusack generally appears a relatively young man with a long mustache, having a somewhat condescending demeanor as he usually fights those who interest him or provide a challenge. Much like Chandler, Cusack is obsessed with Zeldris to the point of love. In his true demon form, his hair whitens as he sprouts dragon's wings while his arms lengthen with his hands enlarged enough to hold his two swords with only one. Cusack kills off Chandler in the aftermath of the New Holy War and is later killed by the Demon King after unknowingly turning Zeldris into his vessel. =Lower Class Demons= ; :The lowest class of demons seen thus far, they are massive red obese-looking creatures that can breathe Purgatory Fire, which has far greater potency than normal fire. They also possess two hearts, making them difficult to kill. A red demon was first seen invading the Fairy King's forest twenty years prior, where it burned down the forest and killed Elaine before Ban slew it with it the aid of his newly acquired immortality. Its corpse was eventually found by Hendrickson, who uses its blood to create Holy Knights with the powers of demons, a process perfected in the New Generation. ; :These demons have thick gray-coloured carapaces that make them extremely durable, faces surrounded by pointed petal-like protrusions vaguely resembling a stylized sun or flower, and wings. In addition to breathing Purgatory Fire, they can utilize various darkness-based attacks, such as \\"Dark Snow\\", an attack that consists in conjuring up black snow-like particles which kill instantly. After being cornered and nearly defeated by five of the Sins, Hendrickson consumes the blood of a Gray Demon to vastly increase his strength and continue the battle. ; :Bird-like demons with muscular physiques, they are known for their speed. Four of them summoned by Melascula's powers, they are eventually all killed off. ; : Demon-made golems that served as war machines during the Holy War, rendered dormant when the Demons were sealed until they reactivate when the Ten Commandments are released. They have a power level of 5500, making them effectively as strong as Hendrickson after he acquires the powers of the Gray Demon. Like the lower-class Demons, they can breathe Purgatory Fire. They can also sprout additional appendages from their heads to launch additional attacks. Their only weakness is a core embedded in their chest. Two of them have appeared so far: a fat one that attacked Camelot, which Meliodas destroys and a taller, thinner one with long limbs that appeared at the revived Fairy King's forest before it is destroyed by King's unleashed Chastiefol. The Vampires of Edinburgh A Vampire Clan who had a treaty with the Demon Clan, but were sealed in a sarcophagus by the Demon Zeldris 3000 years prior, and 12 years prior to the inception of the story, they broke their seal and took over the Kingdom of Edinburgh, killing all of its inhabitants or turning them into vampires, including the Holy Knights. Since their presence threatened Liones and all of Britannia, The Seven Deadly Sins were sent to deal with them. It turns out that it was the Vampire King Izraf who broke the treaty by rebelling against the Demon Clan and Zeldris was intended to be the executioner, but instead, he sealed them since he was in love with the Royal Vampire Gelda. Supporting characters ; : :Hawk's mother is a massive green pig who transports the Boar Hat on her back. When she finds a suitable location to place the bar, she burrows away underground, leaving only the bar peeking out from the surface. Unlike Hawk she is unable to speak, but surprisingly powerful and able to beat Red and Grey Demons with ease and even consume Monspeet's fiery attack without any ill effects. Hawk's Mother would later be revealed to a shell of moss that the Demon King and the Supreme Deity used to seal Chaos within, known as the Mother of Chaos from which numerous monsters and the vampire royalty were birthed from. Once the seal was broken and Arthur became the King of Chaos, Hawk's Mother breaks apart as Chaos transferred into the human. ; : :Elaine is a princess of the and King's sister, as well as the Guardian Saint of the Fountain of Youth. Elaine held this post for 700 years after King had left in search of his best friend, Helbram. She has the power to control Nature and the wind in her environment. During her time protecting the fountain, she met Ban, who coveted the fountain, but they ended up growing close to each other. Both she and Ban were mortally wounded by a demon that destroyed the Fairy King Forest, and Elaine used gave Ban the water of the fountain, so he could survive and create a new forest for her people. After her death, Elaine's soul resides in the dimension until she is revived by Melascula; consumed by her regret and unable to control her actions, she attacked Jericho as she did not look kindly upon her feelings towards and the time she was spending with Ban. But Jericho and Ban manage to help Elaine break free of her negative emotions, with remaining among the living due to Melascula's spell. Like King, Elaine grows a pair of wings as a sign of her power growth as she helps the Sins defeat Melascula. :After Ban goes to purgatory to find Meliodas' emotions, she fights along with Holy Knights as she waits for Ban; in the midst of the battle, she starts dying again, but Ban uses his new powers to fully resurrect her at the cost of his immortality. ; : :The young king of Camelot, who is being mentored by Merlin, Arthur possesses a great power that even allowed him to fight Hendrickson, but even he is not really sure what this power consists in. He offers Meliodas the position of Great Holy Knight in his kingdom, but Meliodas puts his offer on hold until the kingdom is saved (and he still has to run the Boar Hat). He later joins the Seven Deadly Sins in their mission against the Ten Commandments, acquiring his familiar Cath in the process. Having admired Meliodas all his life, Arthur becomes disillusioned upon learning he sided with the demons. This spurs him to claim the Holy Sword Excalibur, which gives it chooses the power and skill of its previous users from the past. Each time a person uses it, their soul moves into the blade making it stronger, and making sure that the next person had to be strong enough to wield it. As such, it showed Arthur's true potential as a \\"King among Kings\\" by being chosen by Excalibur. Though Arthur acquires Excalibur, he lacked the skills to properly use it as Cusack uses his Resonant to manipulated Arthur's body into impaling himself with Excalibur. The Demon King's death, Merlin conducts a ritual to resurrect Arthur as \\"King of Chaos\\" with the power to manipulate reality from becoming a vessel of Chaos. ; : :A mysterious cat-like creature that Arthur acquired as a familiar during his training in Istal, keeping him alive while in constant physical contact. But Cath actually is a spawn of Chaos named , an embodiment of avarice and destruction that cannot be killed by any means. Cath desires to become the King of Chaos and only protected Arthur in order to eat him once he was resurrected as the vessel of Chaos. Cath devours Arthur's arm to acquire a fragment of Chaos with the Deadly Sins keeping him at bay until Arthur decides to use his power to absorb Cath back into the Chaos he was created from. ; : :A Black Hound and is King's pet, he is able to alter his size, with his mouth serving as a portal, while his growling can be understood by King, Elaine, and Hawk. Oslow would later be revealed to be the reincarnation of , a human from three millennia ago who infiltrated Stigma to seek revenge on them for destroying his village years prior. But his rage wavered when he protects a mortally wounded Gerheade, who reminded him of a girl he loved, and allowed himself to be killed by an enraged Gloxinia. Rou reincarnated into Oslo soon after to continue his vow of protecting Gerheade. Oslo sacrifices his life when Mael tries to attack King with a blast, however, his soul is enchanted by Mael so he can retain his memories of his previous life in his next reincarnation. ; : Also known as the , she is a being of chaos who is bound within the confines of Lake Salisbury and is said to have bestowed the sword Excalibur to king Carfen. Following the Demon King's death, Merlin brings Arthur's body to Lake Salisbury to be revived by the Lady as a \\"King of Chaos\\". After Meliodas demands answers for Merlin's actions of reviving Arthur as a vessel of chaos, the Lady reveals the witch's full story and goals to him and the other Sins. =Liones Kingdom= The Liones Kingdom is the setting for most of the story with its being among the most powerful knight orders in Britannia. Sometime before the beginning of the series, via the machinations of the demon Fraudrin, Hendrickson orchestrates a coup d'état and takes control of Liones. This caused the kingdom to fall into a state of distress as citizens from towns and villages surrounding the kingdom were enslaved or forcefully recruited into joining the Holy Knights in preparation for a Holy War. Under the rule of the Holy Knights, death was the penalty for insubordination. Following Hendrickson's defeat and Dreyfus's disappearance, Baltra pardoned most of the knights as he preferred they atone for their actions. ; : :Bartra Liones is the King of Liones and Elizabeth's adoptive father, who is held captive by the Holy Knights after their coup d'état. He possesses a power known as Vision, which allows him to see into the future, whence he knows about the Holy War. After Hendrickson's defeat, he forgives the Holy Knights since he knows they were being manipulated and that their strength would be needed in the upcoming Holy War. His name is romanized \\"Baltra\\" in the first fanbook, but this is changed to \\"Bartra\\" in the second fanbook and volume 22. ; : :Margaret is the First Princess of Liones and Elizabeth's eldest adoptive sister. Ten years prior to the beginning of the story, she witnessed the murder of Zaratras at the hands of Hendrickson and Dreyfus and told Gilthunder about it. Unfortunately, Hendrickson found out and she allowed herself to be imprisoned by the Holy Knights, who used her as a means to force Gilthunder into obeying Hendrickson. She is later possessed by Archangel Ludoshel due to her latent magical abilities for the upcoming war against the demon clan. ; : :Veronica, is the Second Princess of Liones and Elizabeth's elder adoptive sister. She is described as a tomboy. As a child, she used to play swords with boys, which her father scolded her for. Despite sharing the Holy Knights' views on enslaving citizens, she deeply cares about Elizabeth. She sacrifices herself to protect Elizabeth, but eventually, she recovers thanks to Elizabeth's power. ; ; :Zaratras was the former Grand Master of the Holy Knights and the strongest of his order, who was assassinated ten years ago by the demon Fraudrin when he possessed Zaratras' half-brother Dreyfus and enlisted Hendrickson's assistance, with the Seven Deadly Sins framed for the murder. Gilthunder's father and Grimaore's uncle, he and Dreyfus are both Druids and possess the power of Purge which can destroy any evil soul. :Zaratras is temporarily revived after the Ten Commandments take over Britannia, furious with himself for not realizing that Dreyfus and Hendrickson were being manipulated. Despite his power and rank, he's rather quirky. He stumbles upon the Boar Hat and shows Elizabeth and Hawk memories of how he and King Baltras first met Meliodas. Zaratras uses his remaining power to exorcise Fraudrin from Dreyfus' body, telling his brother and Hendrickson to stop blaming themselves for his death as he returns to the afterlife. ; : :Gilthunder is a Holy Knight, Griamore's cousin, and Dreyfus's nephew who is the son of Zaratras'; he has the ability to use magic to generate and manipulate lightning. When Gilthunder was younger, he looked up to the Seven Deadly Sins and wanted to be just like them as he was trained by Meliodas. When Gilthunder learned of his father's murder by his uncle and Hendrickson, he was forced to follow the latter when Vivian uses her familiars on him and Margret to force him into compliance. He has since become emotionless while pursuing the Sins, cryptically hinting to Meliodas that he needs his help. Once Meliodas destroys the familiar following Margret, Gilthunder joins the Sins in fighting Hendrickson. After Hendrickson's defeat, he, Howzer, and Griamore investigate the Demon clan's return to Britannia and later join forces with the Seven Deadly Sins to fight the Ten Commandments. ; : :A Holy Knight whom the Sins first encounter at the Necropolis when she placed herself in a state of near-death to pursue them with her spirit, she is dedicated knight whose power of Explosion allows her to create powerful explosions. Guila joined the Holy Knights to be someone her little brother Zeal could be proud of after their father Dale mysteriously abandoned his post. Guila later learns that her father was subject to Hendrickson's experiments with demon blood, with herself being one of his New-Generation Holy Knights; she sides with the Sins after Diane risks her well-being to save Zeal from Helbram's attack. ; : : Initially an apprentice Holy Knight under the Weird Fangs, Jericho is a skilled swordswoman who initially dressed herself up as a young man due to her low self esteem in an attempt at being taken serious by her male peers. But after being humiliated by Ban and accepting Hendrickson's proposal of becoming a New Generation Holy Knight, she embraces her femininity while resolute to make Ban suffer. But Jericho beging to develop feelings for Ban after he saves her from being consumed by the demon blood in her body and has been following him ever since; unwelcome in the new Fairy King's Forest, she later witnesses Ban's reunion with his father, Zhivago. When a revived Elaine attempts to kill her, she snaps the fairy of her jealous rage by expressing her love for Ban as unrequited. Jericho then refuses to abandon Ban and Elaine after they are trounced in battle by two of the Ten Commandments, carrying them off in an attempt to save them before stumbling upon Escanor's bar. :After the death of her brother, Gustaf, Jericho discovers that she possesses ice magic, just like he did, and decides to carry out her brother's will. ; : :A Holy Knight with the rank of Platinum and dominion over magic that allows him to generate and manipulate wind, he is also a childhood friend of Gilthunder's. Despite being hot-blooded and self-confident, he also believes in the honor of the Holy Knights and looks up to Dreyfus. He fights at the Vaizel annual fighting festival and is defeated by Diane. After realizing the identity of the Seven Deadly Sins and witnessing Diane saving an innocent civilian, he begins to wonder whether they are really as bad everyone says they are. After witnessing many cruelties on the part of his fellow Knights and seeing Diane protecting Guila's brother, he sides with the Sins and protects Diane from Dreyfus, despite being grossly outmatched. Later, it is hinted that he harbours romantic feelings towards Diane. :After Fraudrin's defeat, he is surprisingly named Great Holy Knight by King Baltra in Gilthunder's absence. Despite his initial doubts, he accepts. ; : :The current Great Holy Knight alongside his best friend Hendrickson, he is also Zaratras' younger brother, Griamore's father, and Gilthunder's uncle. He is a dignified and diligent person, very dedicated to his duties, even willing to capture his king and enslave citizens to help with the military efforts in order to prepare for the Holy War. It is revealed that he and Hendrickson murdered Zaratras and blamed the Seven Deadly Sins, as he was jealous of his brother. Despite everything he has done, he loves his son deeply and believes Hendrickson's plan of reviving the Demon Clan is insane. When he is affected by Gowther's Nightmare Teller, it is shown that he feels a lot of remorse for betraying his brother. He ends up admitting to his crimes and agrees on a temporary truce with the Sins in order to stop Hendrickson. Unfortunately, he is unable to defeat his former friend and rival and killed by Hendrickson's Acid Down skill, while his son, Griamore, watches helplessly. :He possesses the power Break, which is capable of shattering the opponent's techniques and has great destructive potential. He easily defeated Diane and remained unscathed by the combined attacks of Howzer and Guila. :It is revealed that his body was being controlled by the Demon Fraudrin, who used him and Hendrickson in order to fully revive the Demon Clan. He is finally freed by the combined efforts of Hendrickson and Zaratras. ; : : A Grand Master Holy Knight and good friend of Dreyfus', he also was his accomplice in the murder of Zaratras. He possesses the power Acid, which deteriorates the opponent's body upon being struck with a weapon infused with it, unless he is defeated or it dispelled by strong magic. Hendrickson also has knowledge of forbidden Druid techniques, such as Enslavement of the Dead, which can reanimates a corpse twice with their abilities reduced and the reanimation turning them into a mindless puppet. :Later revealed to having been manipulated by the demon Fraudrin, Hendrickson became dishonourable and manipulative since he murdered Zaratras as he resolves to cause a new Holy War by releasing the Demons race so the Holy Knights would once again have meaning and purpose. Hendrickson later acquired the corpses of Helbram and a demon that destroyed the Fairy King's Forest, learning that the latter's blood can enhance humans, a technique perfected in the New Generation of Holy Knights, whose demon blood he can activate at will with his Blood Awaken ability — which he does during the Sins' assault on the capital, turning the New-Generation knights into monsters that work havoc until the Sins manage to rid them of the demons possessing their bodies. :Hendrickson drinks a vial of demon blood after Gilthunder mortally injures him, reattaching his severed arm as he becomes a youthful version of himself with some of Meliodas' powers as he kidnaps Elizabeth to complete his plan and seemingly kills Dreyfus. After being cornered by the Sins, Hendrickson reveals to also possess the body of a Gray Demon as he uses its blood to become a true demon before being defeated by Meliodas. Hendrickson survived and was healed by Fraudrin using Dreyfus' body, restored to his original self and spared by the demon while witnessing the Demon Race's return to Britannia. A repentant Hendrickson later comes to aid Gilthunder, Howzer, and Griamore in defeating a Gray Demon, aiding the Seven Deadly Sins in their mission to face the Ten Commandments despite King still resenting him for using Helbram. ; : :A Holy Knight and Dreyfus's son who was assigned Veronica's bodyguard at a young age, He possesses the ability to create spherical barriers that are effective against most attacks. Griamore is very devoted to Veronica to the point of opposing the Holy Knights of Henderickson's faction when they threatened to harm her if he refuse to hand Elizabeth over to them. After taking a seemingly dead Veronica to Pernes for a proper burial at Elizabeth's request, Griamore was reported dead before returning at the last minute to aid in Hendrickson's defeat. He accompanies his cousin Gilthunder and Howzer in their search for answers regarding his father's research, only to gain Hendrickson as an ally when they face a Gray Demon. :Griamore is later cursed to revert into his childhood self by the ability of a monster that he and Slader fight during their training in Istal, ultimately playing a role in Fraudin's defeat as the demon grew to care about him. Griamore eventually returned to his true self when Veronica, whom he is in love with, broke the spell by kissing him. ; : :A Cardinal-ranked Holy Knight and Hendrickson's second-in-command, Helbram is ruthlessly cruel and sadistic with the ability to disguise himself as an imp named Love Helm. He also uses a skill called Link that allows him to use the powers of those who willingly give him their power, which also allowed him to transfer damage dealt to him to them to evade fatal attacks at the cost of some of their lives. Helbram is eventually revealed to be a member of the Fairy race and an old friend of King's; he was originally interested in humans until he and his fellow fairies were kidnapped by a human named Aldrich, who wanted to sell their wings. Helbram was traumatized by watching his friends die, losing his sanity thinking Aldrich had killed King, and wound up killing Aldrich as a result, assuming his form to maintain his immense misanthropy as he went on a murderous rampage, killing humans — determined to kill them all —, until King reunited with him 500 years later and killed Helbram, honouring an old promise to stop his former best friend in the event that such a fate should befall him. But fairies' corpses never decompose, and Helbram's body ended up in Henderickson's possession and was reanimated by a curse, each revival further eroding Helbram's mind. :After King kills him again, it is revealed that the helmet of his Love Helm guise was meant as a gift for him; Helbram is reanimated a second time as a semi-mindless shell, retaining enough of his consciousness to force King to completely destroy his body with his spirit bound to the helmet which King takes. The helmet is eventually destroyed when Helbram offers it to Diane while she was possessed by the spirits of a village he destroyed ages ago, allowing him to pass on. King salvages the helmet's remains to use them as a decoration in his new outfit. ; : :An enigmatic Holy Knight who served under Hendrickson and was previously Merlin's apprentice, regarded as Liones' greatest mage. She expresses a disdain for Merlin, as well as pigs, shown when she teleports Hawk away upon coming across him. Vivian is also obsessed with Gilthunder, subjecting him and Margaret to her familiars to keep them apart and under Hendrickson's control. Following Hendrickson's defeat, Vivian is exiled from Liones and outfitted by Merlin with a cursed non-detachable ring that would kill her if she were to try and use her magic on Gilthunder. Merlin also gave Gilthunder a secret word that would allow Vivian to become completely subservient to him. Vivian later assumed the guise of a male mage named Gilfrost to infiltrate Liones as an ally until the Ten Commandants conquer the city, when she spirits Gilthunder away to a tower high above the skies so she could keep him forever. But Vivian is soon killed by Ludoshel after Margaret allowed the archangel to possess her so she could save Gilthunder. ; : :Jericho's older brother, who used to work for Helbram and is able to use magic that allows him to control ice. He and Jericho had not been in good terms since the time he told her she could never become a knight like him, but the reason for this turns out to be his concern about her. When Jericho turns into a Demon, Gustaf begs Ban to save his sister. He later participates in defending Liones from the Ten Commandments; fatally stabbed by one of the Holy Knights under Zeldris' control, he uses his remaining strength to prevent his sister and Zeal from being turned into demons by Greyroad. Weird Fangs The are Holy Knights in charge of , who aided in the capture of Ban whom they kept prisoner there. Following the destruction of Baste Prison, the surviving Weird Fangs leave Liones before later returning, only to learn of the chaos that occurred in their absence. ; : :A Holy Knight with the ability to manipulate insects, uncaring towards whom she hurts in the process as long as she kills the enemy. Freesia teams up with Ruin to defeat the Seven Deadly Sins, but when Ruin's plan fails, Freesia is defeated by Diane. After a long absence, she and Ruin are revealed to have gone into hiding, only to be found by inhabitants of a village who serve the Demons and procure souls for them in exchange for their lives being spared. After witnessing Fraudrin consume Ruin's soul, she's pinned down by the villagers, with her soul eaten as well. ; : :A Holy Knight with the ability to turn himself invisible, Golgius tends to be a coward that uses underhand tricks to win his fights or to escape. He forces Dr. Dana to poison Meliodas while he is healing him. Golgius is later defeated by Meliodas and runs away. After returning to Liones to find the kingdom's countryside overrun with demons, an injured Golgius escapes and stumbles upon the Boar Hat. After being nursed back to health, Hawk recognizes his scent, but Elizabeth admits that she holds no grudge towards him and lets him off. ; : : Ruin is the Leader of Weird Fangs, who possesses illusionary and hypnotic abilities, the source of which is a little bell mounted at the top of his staff, as well as the ability to harden his body. Of all the Weird Fangs, Ruin is shown to be the cruellest as he beats an unarmed Elizabeth and appears to enjoy it. Apparently killed, Ruin and Friesia go into hiding, only for Fraudrin to later consume his soul before he is able to react. ; : :A Holy Knight and one of the four Weird Fangs of Baste Dungeon who aided in the capture of the Deadly Sin, Ban. He tortured Ban mercilessly while keeping him imprisoned. Jude is believed to have been killed by Ban when he escaped. Roar of Dawn are a group of independent Holy Knights known for their tenacity to see their missions through to the very end. They first encounter the Deadly Sins while tasked with decapitating the Armoured Giant and bringing his head to Helbram, with Gowther ending the conflict peacefully. The group later dwindles to two members after the other three were killed by Fraudin while escorting Dreyfus to prison. ; : :The Roar of Dawn's leader, a tall, long-haired, and effeminate man who wears an iron mask and wields a saw-toothed sword. Slader is fully loyal to Baltra, who rescued him from savages as a youth, while also expressing an admiration towards Merlin. His ability is \\"Overpower\\", which allows him to momentarily freeze an enemy in place through sheer intimidation. He later accompanies the Seven Deadly Sins in their mission against the Ten Commandments as the caretaker of an unstable Gowther. ; : :Seemingly the youngest member of the Roar of Dawn, Simon is a young long-haired boy who wields a long katana-like blade and wears a samuraiesque armor. ; : :Weinheidt is the Roar of Dawn's archer, able to engulf his arrows in energy and create an illusionary double of himself as a decoy.

She is killed by a possessed Dreyfus, alongside Weinheidt and Hugo. ; : :The largest member of the Roar of Dawn, Hugo is covered from head to toe in armour and wields two weapons similar in appearance to saw-blades on a stick. He is killed by a possessed Dreyfus, alongside Weinheidt and Jillian. Pleiades of the Azure Sky ; : :The leader of the Pleiades of the Azure Sky and younger brother of King Baltra Liones, Denzel Liones possesses the ability , that uses the opponent's guilt to conjure up the souls of the people they killed to haunt and \\"judge\\" them.

He challenges Meliodas to a fight since he did not believed in his strength. After being easily defeated, Deathpierce mentioned that he lost a friend in the battle against Hendrickson. When he recklessly kills a servant turned demon in the presence of Grayroad, the curse of the Commandment drains his life and kills him. ; : :A Platinum- ranked Holy Knight and member of the Pleiades of the Azure Sky, Waillo is also the brother of the late apprentice Holy Knight Twigo. He is greatly infatuated with Deldry, but whether this is genuine affection or an effect of her Love Drive is unknown. =Goddess Race= One of the five races of Britannia that are Demon Race's equals and are led by the Supreme Deity, a being created by Chaos alongside the Demon King before they sealed their creator away. Three millennia ago, as a result of Elizabeth falling in love with Meliodas, the Goddess Race declared war on the Demon with support from the humans, the giants, and the fairies. Though they won the war by using the Coffin of Eternal after the demon mage Gowther altered their memories that Mael was killed, the Supreme Deity was sealed away while the other members of the Goddess Race lose their physical forms. Following the return of the Demons, members of the Goddess Race begin to resurface and gather for a new Holy War. ; ; :One of the Four Archangels of the Goddess Race who possesses the Grace , allowing him to move at speeds that make him appear to be teleporting. While polite with a desire for peace, Ludoshel hates demons enough he lied to Meliodas of wanting peace between their peoples and willfully using Elizabeth as a distraction so he and her brother Mael can slaughter the unarmed demons they took hostage. Like his kin, he was made to believe Mael was killed by Estarossa. In the present day, Ludoshel was sealed within a altar before he possesses the body of Margaret Liones by promising to help her rescue Gilthunder. He then proceeds to gather new Stigma members for the new Holy War. :He eventually leads Merlin, Escanor, Hendrickson and Gilthunder in order to stop Meliodas becoming the new demon king. He even states that he can not allow Meliodas to live after their victory. He fights Zeldris and defeat him as he teams with Escanor. But once remembering Mael and Estrarossa are the same person, Ludoshel ends being purged from Margaret's body when Hendrickson took advantage of the Archangel's moment of weakness. Though Hendrickson offer his body for Ludoshel, he heals the human instead and continues fighting in his partially restored physical form against the Original Demon before reuniting with Mael as sacrifices himself and Deadly Sins fight the Demon King's attack and fades away soon after the battle ends. ; ; :A three-headed member of the Four Archangels who possesses the Grace , allowing him to conjure ocean to snare his opponents or liquefy his body. Three millennia after the ancient war, Tarmiel ended up sealed within the staff of Arbus whom he possessed after the man was killed by demons and joins Ludoshel in forming a new Stigma.

Three millennia after the ancient war, Sariel ended up sealed within the flute of a girl named Solaseed. Sariel tricks Solaseed into allowing him to use her body until he is able to reconstitute enough of his physical form, tricking her with the promise of curing her illness. Sariel then joins Ludoshel in forming a new Stigma.

Despite Denzel's sacrifice allowing her to take possession of his body, she shows no care for or empathy towards humans. When confronted by Derieri for her brutal murder of demon hostages, she shows cowardice by claiming that she just followed orders and tries to flee. This enrages the Commandment and Nerobasta begs for her life, only for the demon to kill her along with Denzel. =Other supporting characters= ; : :Cain Barzad is an elderly man who led the Deadly Sins to the Vaizel annual fighting festival which he also participates in, revealed to be a Danafall knight and an old comrade from Meliodas's time in Danafall. During their match, having assumed he was fighting Meliodas's son, Cain goes all out while demanding why he destroyed their kingdom.

When she and Diane were hired by a group of Liones Holy Knights, the knights deceived them and tried to kill them to gain prestige. She saved Diane from a poisonous arrow and used the last of her strength to take down the Holy Knights before supposedly dying. However, she somehow survived and appears just in time to save Diane from Galand and Monspeet. Though the incident cost her her right leg (which she replaced with a peg leg), she was rescued and nursed to health by Zalpa, a barbarian that Diane had spared prior to the incident with the knights.

It was founded in 1861 in Winona, Minnesota. The first from Winona to Stockton, Minnesota, were completed by the end of 1862, making the it the second operational railroad in Minnesota, after the St. Paul and Pacific Line from Saint Paul to St. Anthony Falls. Five years later its track reached Owatonna, Minnesota, connecting with the main line of the Minnesota Central Railroad, predecessor of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway line between Saint Paul and Austin, Minnesota. In 1885 the railroad was involved in the Supreme Court case Winona & St. Peter Railroad Co. v. Barney. The language of the land grant extensions needed to be clarified as to where the two railroad land grants interfered. The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (CN&W;) purchased the controlling interest in the Winona and St. Peter in 1867. The line would reach Watertown, South Dakota, with the financial backing of the CN&W.; In 1900 it became the Minnesota Division of the C&NW.; History The Transit Railroad Company was chartered March 3, 1855, by the Minnesota Territorial Assembly and was required to complete the railroad by March 3, 1867. The Transit Railroad Company was sold on June 23, 1860, and reorganized as the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company. It was founded with a capital of $5,000,000 () as a loan from the territory. The 34th United States Congress passed a land grant act to the Territory of Minnesota for the purpose of constructing railroads.Act making a Grant of Land to the Territory of Minnesota, in alternate Sections, to aid in the Construction of certain Railroads in said Territory, and granting Public Lands in alternate Sections to the State of Alabama, to aid in the Construction of a certain Railroad in said State. Mar 3, 1857. United States Congress, Library of Congress In response to the act, the Minnesota Territorial Assembly allocated lands for four rail projects in 1857, with the Transit railroad among them. The other three were: *The Minnesota and Pacific (a predecessor of the Great Northern railroad, eventually to be the St. Paul and Pacific) *Root River and Southern Minnesota (the predecessor of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Southern Minnesota line, as well as the Minnesota Valley line) *Minnesota and Cedar Valley (later the Minnesota Central, the predecessor of the CStP&M; line from Saint Paul to Austin) The four railroads received land sections designated by odd numbers in width on side of the roads and their branches. The Transit Railroad received $500,000 in bonds (). It was unable to complete the venture of selling stock to start work. The financial Panic of 1857 saw railroad stock values peak and credit dry up. The Transit company forfeited its property to the newly formed State of Minnesota in 1860. Little construction was accomplished until after end of the American Civil War. The St. Paul and Pacific line, which had received the old Minnesota and Pacific charter, completed its line from Saint Paul to St. Anthony in 1862. The Winona & St Peter Railroad Company was organized March 10, 1862, and completed its line from Winona to Rochester, Minnesota, in 1864. In August it reached Owatonna. In 1867 the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company purchased the controlling shares in the Winona and St Peter. Further railroad milestones were: Janesville, Minnesota, in 1870, St. Peter in 1871, New Ulm (via Nicollet and Courtland) in 1872, and the western boundary of the state in 1874. The Winona Mankato and New Ulm Railroad Company was organized in 1870 and a railroad was built from New Ulm to Mankato and afterwards acquired by the Winona and St Peter. In December 1870, the Mississippi River was bridged by the Winona Rail Bridge, a temporary span that connected with the La Crosse, Trempealeau & Prescott Railroad. Reprint of an article that originally appeared on November, 11, 1936, in the Winona Republican-Herald, a predecessor of the Winona Daily News. The La Crosse, Trempealeau & Prescott, another enterprise of the C&NW;, chartered to build from a point across the river from Winona to connect with the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad at Winona Junction in Wisconsin near La Crosse. This connection allowed through railroad traffic from Chicago into Southern Minnesota, without having to ferry cars. The swing span for the bridge was opened in May 1871. The Winona and St. Peter also continued to lay tracks across southern Minnesota and into Dakota Territory. The line turned northwest at Tracy, continued into Dakota Territory, and reached Lake Kampeska and Watertown, South Dakota in 1873. The Long Depression starting in 1873 did not bankrupt the C&NW; nor the W&StP.; Towns established along these tracks provided a ready market for goods manufactured in Winona and channeled agricultural products into the city, spurring Winona's growth as an industrial and shipping hub from 1870 to 1900 and making it the third largest city in Minnesota for three decades. Planned route The route designed for it by the 1857 legislative act was from Winona, Minnesota, via St. Peter, Minnesota, to a feasible point on the Big Sioux River south of the 45th parallel north. It also included the route from that point to any point on the Missouri River south of same parallel. This act was passed at a special session called by Minnesota Territorial Governor Willis A. Gorman. This was in response to a U.S. Congress railroad land grant act to the Territory of Minnesota on March 3, 1857. Legacy The portion of the rail line from Winona to Tracy still is in use in the 21st Century.

The game was developed using Unreal Engine 3 and funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which doubled its fundraising goals within its first two days. It is inspired by earlier 3D platformers such as Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon and Psychonauts. The game was self-published for Microsoft Windows and macOS in October 2017, and by Humble Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles two months later. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released in October 2019.  Gameplay  A Hat in Time is a platform action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The gameplay style has been described by several editors to be similar to Nintendo 64 platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. The player travels between four open levels (along with 2 extra levels via downloadable content), which can be freely explored without time limits. The player can collect various items, solve puzzles, and use an umbrella to combat enemies. The primary objective is to collect \\"Time Pieces\\", 40 of which can be found in the game, which unlock additional levels as more are collected. After being defeated, the enemies drop \\"Pons\\", currency that can be used to unlock additional challenges and purchase badges that increase Hat Kid's abilities. The player can collect Yarn Balls in each level, which can be stitched into new hats to wear. Each hat grants Hat Kid a different ability, such as a faster sprint or brewing explosive potions. Other collectibles include \\"Relics\\", which can be used to unlock \\"Time Rift\\" bonus levels, and \\"Rift Tokens\\", which can be exchanged at a machine for bonus materials such as music remixes and additional cosmetics. Initial actions taken earlier in the game have an effect on later levels, as the main character revisits each area several times before the game is finished. = Death Wish = Death Wish is a challenge mode. It was released with the Seal the Deal downloadable content pack in September 2018. This mode comprises various challenges that use already existing levels. The player interacts with Snatcher, a contract- obsessed ghost who first appears in the third chapter of the base game. The player takes on a challenge to earn a stamp upon completion. The player can also earn two more stamps by completing two challenges along with the main objective. If you fail three times you can activate \\"Peace and Tranquility\\" which will either increase your time to do a task or make that task easier but it will not always allow you to activate it for challenges with a limit of lives. Plot A Hat in Time follows Hat Kid, a little girl trying to return to her home world via spaceship. While on her journey, she passes over a planet, and a member of the planet's Mafia comes to collect a toll for the Mafia Town government. When Hat Kid refuses to pay, the Mafia man busts the spaceship door open, causing Hat Kid and all of her \\"Time Pieces\\", magical hourglasses that power her ship, to fall to the planet below. Hat Kid lands in Mafia Town and meets Mustache Girl, a local troublemaker who hates \\"bad guys\\". Mustache Girl agrees to look for the missing Time Pieces in exchange for Hat Kid's help fighting the Mafia, and the two defeat the Mafia Boss. When Mustache Girl realizes the Time Pieces can rewind time, she wants to use them to become a time-traveling superhero, but Hat Kid refuses due to the dangers of manipulating time. Angered, Mustache Girl declares the two enemies and sets off to find the Time Pieces on her own. Hat Kid ventures across the planet looking for Time Pieces, encountering and befriending many foes that included two rival bird directors DJ Grooves and the Conductor competing for a movie award and a group of mountain villagers called Nomads infected by a dangerous plague, ultimately befriending them all. Hat Kid also outwits a malevolent spirit called the Snatcher into becoming her best friend after he tried to kill her after tricking her into doing his dirty work in Subcon Forest. The game's DLCs also have Hat Kid searching for Time Pieces while working in the Arctic Cruise and under the employ of the Nyakuza crime boss Empress, the latter ending with Hat Kid forced to flee Nyakuza Metro after a bounty was placed on her head. Mustache Girl exploits Hat Kid's absence to break into her ship and steals the collected Time Pieces, using them to turn the planet into a fiery inferno where her word is law. Hat Kid confronts her, but Mustache Girl uses the Time Pieces to open a time rift and make herself all-powerful. The enemies Hat Kid has fought come to her aid in battle, some sacrificing themselves so that Hat Kid can use their dropped Pons to power herself up. Hat Kid finally defeats Mustache Girl and uses the Time Pieces to restore the planet to normal and revive all those who were lost. The player can then choose whether Hat Kid should hand over a Time Piece to Mustache Girl for protection or not. Though her former foes are sad to see her leave, Hat Kid restores the Time Pieces to her vault and resumes her voyage home. In a post- credits scene, Hat Kid is shown sleeping in bed surrounded by toys resembling the other characters. Development The initial idea for A Hat in Time was started by director Jonas Kærlev, who graduated with a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the Aalborg University in Denmark. He launched the project as an answer to his feeling of an ongoing shortage of 3D platformers, specifically developed by Nintendo. Some inspirations include Psychonauts, Spyro the Dragon and Banjo-Kazooie. In an interview with Polygon, Kærlev revealed that he and Gears for Breakfast initially did not expect the Kickstarter success A Hat in Time eventually received. Kærlev thought that there would be little demand for the game due to Donkey Kong 64's effects on the genre, which he perceived as overwhelming the player with too much collecting. Development for the game started in August 2012 and was planned for a Q2 2013 release but was significantly delayed. At the start of development, Kærlev was the sole developer of the game but over time the development grew into Gears for Breakfast, a team spanning four countries and entirely volunteer-based. Through the Kickstarter campaign the game surpassed the initial goal of $30,000 with a final total of $296,360. In July 2013, it was announced that the game had been greenlit for release via Steam. The soundtrack was mostly composed by Pascal Michael Stiefel, with several guest composers such as Grant Kirkhope contributing additional tracks to the game. A port of the game for Nintendo's Wii U console was in the developer's minds ever since the Kickstarter's announcement, considering that the game is heavily inspired by Nintendo-published platformers, but actual development did not materialize. Upon various requests for it to be ported for the Nintendo Switch, Gears For Breakfast initially claimed on Twitter that such a port will not happen, which was met with mixed reactions. However, during Gamescom in August 2018, a Nintendo Switch port was confirmed and it was later released on October 18, 2019. The two DLCs released for PC were also ported to the Switch version at a later date. = Downloadable content = In March 2018, an update added mod support via Steam Workshop. The first DLC, Seal the Deal, was released for the PC version on September 13, 2018, and was available at no charge for 24 hours after its release. The DLC was later released alongside the game's Nintendo Switch launch on October 18, 2019. It added the new Arctic Cruise chapter, a new challenge mode known as \\"Death Wish\\", six additional Time Rift stages, as well as new cosmetics and photo mode filters. In addition, local splitscreen co-op was also added, featuring the new character Bow Kid. The DLC is currently exclusive to the PC and Switch versions; Gears For Breakfast has announced progress for PS4 and Xbox ports, though there is no conclusive information as to if it will be added. The second DLC, Nyakuza Metro + Online Party, was announced on April 25, 2019 and released on May 10 on PC. It was released for the Nintendo Switch on November 21, 2019. Its new, titular chapter is set in a Japan-inspired underground city, where Hat Kid becomes a member of a cat-themed street gang. A baseball bat weapon is introduced, as well as new badges, cosmetics, and stickers (which can be used as emotes, and used to decorate the player's weapon). A new online multiplayer mode was also introduced, where groups of up to 50 players can play in a single world at once. Online Party will only be available through Steam and is \\"one of the first games to premiere\\" using Valve's Steam Networking API 2.0. The DLC is available at no charge for those that had backed the game's Kickstarter campaign.  Reception  A Hat in Time received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Chris Carter from Destructoid gave the game an 8.5 out of 10, calling it an \\"impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back\\". PC Gamers Dominic Tarason rated the game 86/100 saying, \\"Some scuff-marks aside, A Hat in Time is a creative, playful, and polished tribute to a genre that doesn't get nearly enough love on PC.\\" Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of The Escapist was highly positive towards the game, deeming it his 2nd favorite game of 2017. = Sales = Two weeks after its release, A Hat in Time had sold 50,000 copies. By July 2018, the game had sold over 500,000 copies. By December 2018, the game had sold over 1 million copies. = Accolades = The game was nominated for \\"Best PC Game\\" in Destructoids Game of the Year Awards 2017, for \\"Best Platformer\\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, and for \\"Game, Original Family\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.
