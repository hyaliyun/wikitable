He was born in a Zamindar family in Baleshwar (Bengal Presidency), now in Odisha, and is honoured in Odia literature with the title Kabibara. , accessed 25 December 2007 In his early life, he composed in both Odia and Bengali languages, but later he shifted his writings in Odia only. He was born on 28 September 1848, at Kedarpur village in Baleswar district, Odisha. He has contributed verses and poetry for Odia literature in the nineteenth century. Role in the Odia language Though the medieval Odia literature was rich and distinct literary tradition and history, some of the Bengali educationalists wanted to abolish Odia language as the medium of teaching from schools. As Bengal was under by British rule much before Odisha, the Bengalis had the privilege to motivate the Anglicist scholars to prove Odia as a branch of Bengali language. However, John Beams, a British officer of East India Company first tried to prove that Odia is more ancient language than Bengali, and it had a richer literature which Bengali had not. In the Odisha division, there were only seven Odia School teachers; Bengalis formed the majority of teachers, even in the remote areas. Consequently, Bengali text books were prescribed for Odia students. At that time, Radhanath was one of prime figure along with Fakir Mohan Senapati, who fought against the expansionism of Bengali educationalist to eradicate Odia language from Odisha. He was the Inspector of Odisha Schools Association and along with Fakir Mohan Senapati and Madhusudan Rao, he tried to promote text book writings. Major works Radhanatha Ray's first major work was Kabitabali, a collection of poems in Bengali written at the age of eighteen. It featured in most of the major newspapers and journals in Kolkatta during that time. His other Bengali poem was Lekhabali. Later, he switched over to Odia language, and wrote famous Kavyas like Kedara Gauri, Nandikeshwari, Chilika, Mahajatra ‚Äì Jajatikeshari, Tulasistabaka, Urbashi, Darabara, Dasaratha Biyoga, Savitri Charita and Mahendra Giri. Additionally, he wrote more than fifteen essays. Apart from his original works, he is also known for his translations and adaptations from the Latin Literature. They include Usha, Chandrabhaga and Parbati., accessed 25 December 2007 Father of Odia Modernism  His writings were inspired by many English Litt√©rateurs like Keats, Scott and Wordsworth. He has contributed to Odia poetry by introducing new forms. He has penned blank-verses, satire inspired by writings of Dryden and Alexander Pope, denunciation of despots, tyrants and oppressors, concern with social problems, a spirit of protest against conventional morality, a disbelief in the power of gods and goddesses, and patriotic sentiments, which finally brought him trouble from his employers. He was viewed as a national poet of the first order in Odisha.Mayadhar, Mansingha :History of Oriya Literature : Sahitya Akademy, Delhi Controversy  Though Radhanatha contributed a lot to Odia literature, however he was not accepted by the contemporary conservative readers of his time. Soon, he was dragged into a controversy. Sudhala Dev, the then king of Bamanda awarded the poet the title 'Kabibara', and the gesture made some of the critics and poets jealous. Some critics wrote that Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja is more powerful than Radhanatha, and these arguments turned into a serious topic of controversy like modernity versus tradition. Two of the literary journals The Indradhanu and The Bijuli engaged in this controversy, and later all the intellectuals got entangled in this discussion. However, this literary controversy ended with a letter of Radhanath.History of Oriya Literature by Dr. Natabar Samanta Ray) See also * Odia literature * Odia language  References Category:1848 births Category:1908 deaths Category:People from Balasore district Category:Poets from Odisha Category:Odia-language poets Category:19th-century Indian poets ","title":"Radhanath Ray"},{"id":"14882242","text":"Olfactory receptor 5M3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OR5M3 gene.

Its main selling point at that stage was the political upheaval in Serbia at the time with parliamentary elections being held following a government's fall after the unilateral declaration of independence by the Serbian province of Kosovo, all of which led to the Los Angeles Times publishing a large piece about the movie written by its staff writer Tracy Wilkinson. Predictably, geo-political overtones in light of current political situation in Serbia dominated the piece. In June 2008, another American publication took notice. The review in Variety by Alissa Simon also touches on politics as she sees the movie as \\"a postmodern allegorical tale\\" which \\"succeeds in poking fun at various Serbian national myths and symbols with its strong, lusty, independent women, eager-to-fight men and sacrilegious shenanigans in a hearse and among tombstones\\".

It is a member of the Alabama Rural Electric Association of Cooperatives (AREA) and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.  History  Wiregrass Electric Cooperative, a PowerSouth Cooperative, was organized in October 1939 and began distribution in 1940. Taking its name from the Wiregrass Region which it serves, it was created to serve rural customers not serviced by the large power companies. The system is made up of around 3,200 mileshttp://www.dothaneagle.com/news/government/grove-park-resident-wants- city-electric-service-in-west- dothan/article_6f656222-3a1c-11e5-b232-471e545cf02e.html of line and more than 27,000 consumer/member homes and businesses. Howard Haygood was the first manager of the cooperative. He served until 1958. Subsequent leadership was as follows: ‚Ä¢ B.L Woodham, general manager, 1953 ‚Äì 1968 ‚Ä¢ Bruce Dyess, general manager, 1969 ‚Äì 1985 ‚Ä¢ Jerry Mosley, general manager, 1985 ‚Äì 2005 ‚Ä¢ Michael McWaters, CEO, 2005 ‚Äì 2013 ‚Ä¢ Les Moreland, CEO, 2014 ‚Äì present  Organization  At Wiregrass Electric Cooperative, the consumer/member is the basis of the organization. Each person receiving electric service must be a member of the cooperative. Annual membership meetings are held where members receive reports on the operation of the system and elect trustees to handle the affairs of the organization. Nine members compose the board of trustees at Wiregrass Electric Cooperative. These people must be members of the cooperative to be eligible to serve. The service area is divided into 9 districts, and the elected trustee must reside within the district he or she is to represent. These trustees, as a board, decide the policies under which the cooperative must operate. The board is responsible for the hiring of a Chief Executive Officer. This CEO reports to, and is directly responsible to, the board of trustees. He must operate the system within the framework of policies set forth by the board. The Chief Executive Officer of Wiregrass Electric Cooperative known as the CEO, he hires and directs all of the employees of the local cooperative. Employees report to their department heads, who report to senior staff members, who in turn report to the CEO. The cooperative's service area covers most of the rural areas of Houston and Geneva counties. The cooperative also serves portions of Dale, Coffee and Covington counties. The main office of the cooperative is located on Highway 167 in Hartford. All records are kept at this location. In addition to the headquarters, the cooperative operates customer service centers in Ashford, Dothan and Samson. These offices are full-service locations where members can pay bills, apply for service, report problems with their account or conduct any other routine business that is normally handled by the main office. Since the cost of wholesale power is the biggest portion of its expenditures, Wiregrass Electric Cooperative diligently looks for ways to reduce power expenses. Through a power supply pooling arrangement, PowerSouth, the power supplier owned by WEC and 21 other member systems in central and south Alabama and the Florida panhandle, initiated a power supply plan that could reduce wholesale power expenses and ensure the future stability of rates. Under this arrangement, PowerSouth will be responsible for supplying the electricity, which will continue to be delivered over Alabama Power Company's transmission system  Power companies in Alabama  There are 22 rural electric cooperatives that distribute electricity in Alabama. All of these are organized locally as separate cooperatives with their own membership, boards of trustees, management and employees. Policies, rates and provisions of service differ among each cooperative. Nineteen of these 22 distribution co-ops and the one G&T; co-op have banded together to organize the Alabama Rural Electric Association of Cooperatives (AREA). This is more commonly referred to as the Statewide Association. As an association, AREA is funded by the member cooperatives through a dues structure. The statewide association, or AREA, is controlled by a board of directors. The board is composed of the manager and one trustee from each of the member cooperatives. The board employs the manager or CEO who, in turn, hires and directs other employees. This association also performs various services for the member cooperatives. It works closely with the legislature and other state agencies on matters that affect all co-ops in Alabama. It produces the Alabama Living magazine mailed to all rural electric consumer/members. It also operates a print shop for custom printing required by its member co-ops. There are more than 1 million rural electric consumers in Alabama. These consumers use approximately 1,200 kilowatt hours per month. There are approximately 6.5 consumers per mile of line on Alabama cooperatives. Currently, Wiregrass system is made up of more the 3,074 miles of lines and serves more than 27,000 members in portions of five counties, including Houston, Geneva, Dale, Coffee, and Covington.

Here, the route has a junction with the eastern terminus of PA 864. Past Picture Rocks, the road winds northeast along the banks of Muncy Creek through forested areas. US 220 enters Sullivan County and intersects PA 42 in Beech Glen. The two routes run north together until Muncy Valley, where PA 42 splits to the northwest. US 220 continues northeast concurrent with PA 42 Truck through more forests to Laporte, where it has an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 42 and PA 42 Truck. A short distance north of Laporte, the route encounters the southern terminus of PA 154. The road passes through more rural areas before PA 87 joins in from the west prior to reaching Dushore. In Dushore, PA 87 splits to the east. US 220 heads north through a mix of fields and forests as it continues into Bradford County. The route passes through New Albany before continuing north through more forests. In Monroe, the road has an intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 414. US 220 heads northeast through more rural areas before bypassing Towanda to the west. The two-lane undivided bypass has an interchange at Patterson Boulevard that provides access to the borough. The route curves west then northwest as it comes to a diamond interchange with US 6. Past this, US 220 continues north as a two-lane undivided road through a mix of farmland and woodland along the west bank of the Susquehanna River, passing through Ulster and Milan. South of Athens, the route intersects the southern terminus of PA 199 before turning into a four-lane freeway that bypasses the Penn-York Valley boroughs of Athens, Sayre, and South Waverly to the west. US 220 crosses the Chemung River and comes to a diamond interchange at West Pine Street that serves Athens. The highway continues between the river to the west and developed areas to the east before it reaches an interchange at Mile Lane Road that serves Sayre and South Waverly. The route enters South Waverly and comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-86/NY 17, which is maintained by the state of New York despite being in Pennsylvania. Past the northern terminus, the road crosses the New York border and ends a short distance later at Chemung Street in Waverly. US 220 northbound in Towanda History Up until the late 1960s US 220 continued through Milesburg northeastward to Howard and beyond. In the late 1960s the federal government planned a dam in the Bald Eagle Valley, which would flood most of the original alignment through Howard. It was at this time when US 220 was realigned to break away from the original alignment just before Milesburg, pass to the north of Bald Eagle State Park and reunite with its former alignment about 1 mile east of Beech Creek. In 1978 the alignment was again moved, this time bypassing the park entirely. With the 2-lane expressway from I-80 to Mill Hall, US 220 would now break off the second alignment near Milesburg and follow I-80 to mile marker 178, where it would break off and continue north. After about 5 miles one can see the original alignment off to the left of the expressway. Future PennDOT plans to upgrade the interchange with Interstate 80 in Bellefonte to a high-speed expressway-grade interchange, bringing I-99 to Interstate Highway Standards. The project is expected to start in 2022, following the completion of a related project for a local I-80 interchange with PA 26.

In 1988, as the result of the efforts of a number of Macau residents and the Government of Macau, the School was established. As an international school, it provides an internationally oriented English and Chinese educational program for both expatriate and local families. The school currently has approximately 600-700 pupils, of whom about 70% are from Macau while the remaining 30% represent approximately 35 different nationalities. The parents of these expatriate students, for the most part, are in Macau for employment, working in Macau's private and public sectors. A very-wide-angle view of the school. History The School of the Nations is an internationally oriented educational institution, licensed by the Government of Macau, as a non-profit organization. It originally opened in 1988 with 5 students, all of whom were enrolled in kindergarten. It came about as a result of efforts from a number of Macau residents who saw the need in the community for an English medium school. By the end of the 1989-1990 school year, the original premises in the Seng Vo building were filled to capacity. The demand for new enrollments however, continued to rise. It was decided to acquire additional property on the fourth floor of the Lei San building as an interim measure while a more permanent solution was sought. These premises were occupied for the school year 1990-1991 allowing the school to enroll approximately 200 students (a 100% increase over the preceding year). A 35% increase for the academic year 1991-1992 and a 29% increase for the 1992-1993 school year brought the school to a critical condition of overcrowding. To accommodate the influx of new students, in 1994 the school began to lease commercial properties and convert them to classrooms. In 1997 all of Asia experienced a severe economic downturn, and enrollment to the school dropped. The decision was made to return all leased property, reduce overhead and limit enrollments to the number of students that could be accommodated in the properties belonging to the school. From that period until 2008, the school maintained a steady population of about 260 students. In 2008, construction of the School of the Nations building was completed. The building is located on Rua de Minho, on Taipa Island, not far from the Nova City residential complex. This new facility has greatly increased the school's capacity, allowing for a major increase in student capacity. Since then, the school has grown to approximately 600 students with around 100 staff. Facilities As a result of Macau's limited amount of land, the school was initially located in rented properties within residential buildings. Normal classes were held in modified apartments. Physical education and other outdoor activities were carried out in the nearby facilities of a government school as well as public facilities where the School had access to basketball and mini-soccer courts and swimming pools, while space in the Macau Cultural Center was used for school gatherings. In 2006, Macau's Education Department gave the school a grant of 2,500 square metres of land on Taipa Island, as well as substantial financial support for the construction of the new campus.School of the Nations, Macau, receives land grant from government Taipa, Macau 6 July 2006 (BWNS) The present school building is located on these grounds. The current school campus spans 7 floors. The ground floor is home to the school's library and some kindergarten classrooms, while the 1st floor is home to the cafeteria and more kindergarten classrooms. The 2nd floor consists entirely of primary school classrooms. The 3rd floor consists of middle school classrooms, one science laboratory, and the school's arts wing (two art classrooms, a drama studio, and a music classroom). The 4th floor consists of secondary school classrooms, an upperclassmen lounge, two science laboratories, as well as the school auditorium. The 5th floor houses the school's gymnasium, while the 6th and 7th floors (Roof and Upper Roof) are outdoor activity areas used for sports and recreational activities. Curriculum Character development, the development of the spirit of social service and cooperation as well as environmental awareness,Atlas of Student Action for the Planet UN.org Cyberschoolbus is a strong theme in the educational program of SON. Despite retaining a 2-section naming system (\\"Primary\\" and \\"Form\\" a.k.a. Secondary) the school uses a 3-section system to divide its grades internally - primary school, middle school and high school. This is in order to cater to the different needs of students in each grade better. The school's current standard curriculum for the lower grades (Primary 1 up to Form 2 a.k.a. Grade 8) consists of:The Educational program of the School *English *Mandarin *English Literature *History *Computer Science *Geography *Combined Science (integrating Biology, Chemistry and Physics) *Mathematics *Physical Education *Art *Drama The character training program was awarded first prize in 1997 for innovation in curriculum by the Department of Education and Youth Services of Macau. It was also awarded 3rd prize by the International Schools Services in their worldwide competition for community service programs. =IGCSE Program= The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) is an English language curriculum offered to secondary students to prepare them for the International Baccalaureate, A Level and BTEC Level 3 curriculums. It is based on the older GCE O-Level and is recognized internationally as being equivalent to the British GCSE. Students begin studying for the IGCSEs in Form 3 (Grade 9) and generally take the examinations at the end of the school year in Form 4 (Grade 10); however, high-achieving students in the English and Mathematics courses are permitted to take the examinations in said courses one year early (at the end of Form 3/Grade 9). School of the Nations currently offers courses in the following subjects for the IGCSE Exams: *Biology (0610) *Physics (0625) *Chemistry (0620) *English - First Language (0522) *English - Literature (0486) *First Language Chinese (0509) *Computer Science (0478) *Mathematics (0580) *Additional Mathematics (0606) *Global Perspectives (0457) *Drama (0411) *Art (0400) *Music (0410) The School of the Nations is currently the only school to offer the Drama IGCSE course in Macau. When starting the IGCSE program in Form 3, students choose to study either Art, Music, or Drama as their arts subject; in Form 4, they make a further choice on whether to continue to study and sit the exam for their chosen arts subject or study/take exams for Global Perspectives instead. The average grade achieved by a secondary student studying in the IGCSE program in SON is an A; most students achieve several A/A* grades. =I.B. Diploma Program= The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a two-year educational programme primarily aimed at students aged 16‚Äì19. It is taken by all students starting from Form 5 (Grade 11) and ending in Form 6 (Grade 12) with the examinations. The program provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognised worldwide. The School of the Nations is currently one of only two schools in Macau to offer the IB Diploma Program as a part of its curriculum (the other being The International School of Macau). The School of the Nations offers the following subjects for the IB Diploma Program (further subjects are also available for online study through Pamoja; those are not included in the list below): Group 1 - Studies in Language and Literature *English Language & Literature HL/SL Group 2 - Language Acquisition *Chinese B HL/SL *Mandarin Ab Initio SL Group 3 - Individuals and Societies *Business & Management HL/SL *Psychology HL/SL Group 4 - Experimental Sciences *Chemistry HL/SL *Biology HL/SL *Physics HL/SL Group 5 - Mathematics *Mathematics HL/SL *Mathematics Studies SL Group 6 - The Arts *Visual Arts HL/SL *Music HL/SL Students in the IBDP also have to write an Extended Essay not longer than 4000 words in a subject of their choice and complete CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) experiences as a part of the program. Scholarships The school offers a scholarship to students who are in financial need and who have consistently and diligently demonstrated high academic merit. Scholarship recipients must also be noted for their cooperative behaviour, friendliness, helpfulness, respect for teachers and fellow students, and obedience to school rules. The scholarship is funded through ongoing fundraising efforts within the school.

The award is named for Saint Barbara, the patron saint of artillerymen. The Feast Day of Saint Barbara falls on December 4 and is traditionally recognized by a formal Dining-In or military ball, often involving presentations of the Order of Saint Barbara. Background thumb Saint Barbara, the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat, was tortured and executed after her father discovered she had converted to Christianity. Legend has it that after her father executed her, he was struck down by lightning in divine retribution. Because of this, she soon was regarded as the patron saint in time of danger from thunderstorms, fires and sudden death. She became the patron saint of artillerymen from early on in the development of artillery pieces as early cannons were unreliable, and at times would explode wounding and killing their crews. Saint Barbara was invoked by these early cannoneers in the hope she would protect them from this fate. Levels The Order of Saint Barbara is awarded through the U.S. Field Artillery Association (USFAA) and the Air Defense Artillery Association (ADAA) and has two levels: * The Honorable Order of Saint Barbara is awarded to those individuals who have demonstrated the highest standards of integrity and moral character, displayed an outstanding degree of professional competence, served the Artillery with selflessness; and contributed to the promotion of the Artillery branch. The approval is reserved for O-5 Field Artillery commanders when no O-6 commander is available. They may approve the award for those in or associated with their commands. When there is no such Field Artillery commander available, the Commanding General of the United States Army Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill is the approving authority. * The Ancient Order of Saint Barbara is reserved for those members of the artillery community who have achieved long- term, exceptional service to the artillery surpassing even their brethren in the Honorable Order of Saint Barbara. The approving authority for this award is the Commanding General, United States Army Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill. Saint Barbara medallion Order of Saint Barbara Medallion Those awarded the Order of Saint Barbara receive a medallion attached to a red ribbon. The medallion for the Honorable Order is silver, the Ancient Order has a gold colored medallion. One side of the medallion has a cannon, the other a likeness of Saint Barbara standing by a tower with three windows. The medallion will be worn with the cannon side facing the chest and the bust of Saint Barbara facing out and in view. The Order of Saint Barbara should be worn only at Artillery functions such as Saint Barbara‚Äôs Day celebrations, Artillery balls or Artillery dinings-in and dinings-out. Commanders, O-6 and above, may designate other occasions for wear as appropriate. Molly Pitcher The Artillery Order of Molly Pitcher is also bestowed by the U.S. Field Artillery Association (USFAA) and the Air Defense Artillery Association (ADAA) to recognize military spouses (historically women) who have voluntarily contributed in a significant way to the improvement of the U.S. Field Artillery or Air Defense Artillery Communities. The approval is reserved for O-5 Field Artillery commanders when no O-6 commander is available. They may approve the award for those in or associated with their commands. When there is no such Field Artillery commander available, the Commanding General of the United States Army Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill is the approving authority.

Johnson was a first baseman who played in the Major Leagues from 1974 to 1982 for the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers. A right-handed batter and thrower, Johnson stood tall and weighed . On perhaps the best day in his career, on June 19, 1977, against the A's, Johnson sang the National Anthem before the game, and followed up with two homers, the only White Sox hits on the day, as the Sox won 2-1. Coaching career Lamar's coaching career began in 1988, when he was hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as a minor league hitting instructor. He coached in Milwaukee's minor league system through 1994, serving as the hitting coach for their AAA affiliate, the Denver Zephyrs, in 1991 and 1992, and as manager of their highest A ball affiliate, the Stockton Ports, in 1993 and 1994. In December 1994, Lamar Johnson was named by manager Phil Garner as the hitting coach for the Brewers big league club. After having scored only 547 runs in 1994, the club scored 740 runs in 1995, and then 894 runs in 1996, a franchise record. After the offense stagnated over the next two seasons, Johnson was fired by the Brewers in August 1998. But just three months later, the Kansas City Royals hired him to serve in the same capacity. With the Royals, Johnson again had a remarkable amount of initial success. After having scored 714 runs in 1998, the team scored a club record 856 runs in 1999, and then broke that record again in 2000 by scoring 879 runs, which remains the franchise record today. Of Jermaine Dye, who emerged in those years as a star player, beat writer Joe Posnanski wrote \\"Dye used to have a loopy swing. Now, thanks in part to hitting coach Lamar Johnson, the swing is as compact as a Honda.\\" But Johnson was fired again nonetheless after the 2002 season, in which the Royals finished 11th in the American League in runs scored. In 2003, Johnson served as hitting coach for the Seattle Mariners who, despite playing in a pitchers park, had one of the better offenses in the American League that season, winning 93 games. But Johnson was not retained in 2004 despite this, as the offense slumped over the last month of the season. Since 2005, he has worked in the Mets organization, first as a roving hitting instructor, then as minor league hitting coordinator. With Johnson overseeing the development of young hitters, the Mets farm system has produced enough talent that on April 26, 2011, the team fielded a starting lineup of all homegrown players for the first time since 1971. On May 26, 2014, Johnson was made the new hitting coach for the Mets, replacing Dave Hudgens.http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/05/mets-release-jose-valverde-fire- hitting-coach.html He served through the end of the season, then was reassigned as a minor league hitting instructor in the Mets' organization. He was replaced by former Yankees' coach Kevin Long for the 2015 season.

Personal life Klein was born in 1910 in Montreal, Quebec. His parents were real estate agents who immigrated from Hungary. He was one of five children. He was educated at Fairmont High and at Strathcona Academy, and obtained his law degree from Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1933.An MP who loved to dance, who championed French , Montreal Gazette, January 6, 2008 Klein eloped with his late wife, Dorothy Ruby, on New Year's Eve, 1935. They had two children. He was active in the Jewish community and was a member of the executive council of the Canadian Jewish Congress and a co-chairman of the Israel Bond Organization. His wife, Dorothy, died in 1991. Political career Klein was drafted as the Liberal candidate in the largely Jewish riding of Cartier when incumbent Liberal MP Leon David Crestohl died suddenly during the 1963 federal election campaign.Garth Stevenson, Community Besieged: The Anglophone Minority and the Politics of Quebec, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1999, , page 93 He served for two terms, in the Parliaments elected in 1963 and 1965. He retired before the 1968 federal election when the riding of Cartier was abolished due to redistribution.The Regenstreif Family of Canada , accessed December 25, 2007 During his time in Parliament, he served twice as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs, Human Rights and Citizenship and Immigration. In 1964, Klein introduced a private member's bill which would have been Canada's first hate crimes legislation had it been passed. Bill C-21 proposed the death penalty for anyone who committed murder with genocide in mind and a mandatory 10-year sentence for anyone who, with genocide in mind, caused bodily harm or deliberately inflicted conditions designed to bring about the physical destruction of a group.William Kaplan, \\"Maxwell Cohen and the Report of the Special Committee on Hate Propaganda\\" in Law, Policy, and International Justice: Essays in Honour of Maxwell Cohen, McGill-University Press, 1993, p. 246. The bill was intended to \\"outlaw not only Nazi-type hatred, but all hatred.\\". However, it died on the order paper when Prime Minister Lester Pearson called the federal election of 1965. In January 1965, the federal government appointed the Special Committee on Hate Propaganda in Canada, chaired by Maxwell Cohen and including Pierre Trudeau (at that time a law professor at the Universit√© de Montr√©al) The Committee's mandate was to study the issue of hate propaganda and make recommendations on legislation. One of the first things the Committee did was to meet with Members of Parliament who were interested in the issue, including Klein, to co-ordinate the work of the committee and the members of Parliament.Kaplan, p. 248. In 1966 the Cohen Committee reported in favour of legislation. The Pearson government then introduced a bill to amend the Criminal Code, making it an offence to advocate genocide, similar to Klein's draft bill. The bill also created an offence of publicly inciting hatred in a way likely to induce a breach of the peace, and a third offence, of wilfully promoting hatred. The government bill took four years to wend its way through Parliament, but in 1970, it was passed by the federal government of Pierre Trudeau, now Prime Minister.Kaplan, pp. 259-264.An Act to amend the Criminal Code, Statutes of Canada 1969-70, c. 39, adding s. 267A, s. 267B and s. 267C to the Criminal Code (now s. 318, s. 319 and s. 320 of the Criminal Code, Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, c.

The legislation originally protected members of an \\"identifiable group\\" distinguished by \\"colour, race, religion or ethnic origin.\\" The definition of \\"identifiable group\\" has been expanded over the years, and now protects groups distinguished by \\"colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or mental or physical disability\\". Klein was also a proponent of bilingualism and French immersion in schools and was an advocate of the new maple leaf flag during the Great Flag Debate.

The IEC Technical Committee 57 (Working Group 03) have developed part 6 to provide a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems which is compatible with ISO standards and ITU-T recommendations. Related Standards These standards include: * IEC 60870-6-1 Application context and organization of standards * IEC 60870-6-2 Use of basic standards (OSI layers 1‚Äì4) * IEC 60870-6-501 TASE.1 Service definitions * IEC 60870-6-502 TASE.1 Protocol definitions * IEC 60870-6-503 TASE.2 Services and protocol * IEC 60870-6-504 TASE.1 User conventions * EC TR 60870-6-505 TASE.2 User guide * IEC 60870-6-601 Functional profile for providing the connection- oriented transport service in an end system connected via permanent access to a packet switched data network * IEC 60870-6-602 TASE transport profiles * IEC 60870-6-701 Functional profile for providing the TASE.1 application service in end systems * IEC 60870-6-702 Functional profile for providing the TASE.2 application service in end systems * IEC 60870-6-802 TASE.2 Object models National Networks A typical national power grid includes a hierarchy of control centres to manage the generation, transmission, and distribution of power throughout the grid: * one or more system control centres, responsible for scheduling of power generation to meet customer demand, and for managing major network outages and faults. * generation control centres, responsible for managing the operation of generating plants (coal-fired, natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, etc.), and for adjusting the power generated according to the requirements of the system control centre. * transmission control centres, responsible for the transmission of power from generating stations to network distributors. * distribution control centres, responsible for the distribution of power from the transmission networks to individual consumers. Prior to the development of electronics and telecommunications networks all co-ordination between control centres was carried out by telephone. However, the development of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems allowed remote control and monitoring of electrical plant from centralised control centres. Initially individual SCADA manufacturers developed their own proprietary \\"closed\\" protocols for communicating from a control centre to electrical equipment in the field. These were followed by the development of \\"open\\" industry-standard protocols such as DNP3 and IEC 61850. However, none of these communication protocols were suited to the requirements of communicating between control centres. To meet these special requirements for communication and co-ordination between control centres the IEC developed the IEC 60870 set of standards. Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol The Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP or IEC 60870-6/TASE.2) is being specified by utility organizations throughout the world to provide data exchange over wide area networks (WANs) between utility control centers, utilities, power pools, regional control centers, and Non-Utility Generators. ICCP is also an international standard: International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Telecontrol Application Service Element 2 (TASE.2). =Background= Inter-utility real time data exchange has become critical to the operation of interconnected systems in most parts of the world. For example, the development of electricity markets has seen the management of electricity networks by a functional hierarchy that is split across boundaries of commercial entities. At the top level there is typically a system operator with coordination responsibilities for dispatch and overall system security. Below this are regional transmission companies that tie together distribution companies and generating companies. In continental power systems there is now considerable interconnection across international borders. ICCP allows the exchange of real time and historical power system information including status and control data, measured values, scheduling data, energy accounting data and operator messages. Historically there has been reliance on custom or proprietary links and protocols to exchange real time data between systems. ICCP began as an effort to develop an international standard for real-time data exchange within the electric power utility industry. A working group was formed in 1991 to develop a protocol standard, develop a prototype to test the specification, submit the specification to the IEC for standardisation and carry out interoperability testing between developing vendors. The initial driver was to meet European Common Market requirements in 1992. The official designation of the first protocol was TASE.1 (Telecontrol Application Service Element-1).http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60870-6-501%7Bed1.0%7Db.pdf The second protocol TASE.2 http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60870-6-503%7Bed3.0%7Db.pdf making use of the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) appears to be the version that has become the most popular. In the US, ICCP networks are widely used to tie together groups of utility companies, typically a regional system operator with transmission utilities, distribution utilities and generators. Regional operators may also be connected together to co-ordinate import and export of power between regions across major inter-ties. =ICCP Functionality= Basic ICCP functionality is specified as ‚ÄúConformance Blocks‚Äù listed below. The objects that are used to convey the data are defined in various parts of IEC 60870-6. Block Description Data Examples: #Periodic System Data: Status points, analogue points, quality flags, time stamp, change of value counter, protection events. Association objects to control ICCP sessions. #Extended Data Set Condition Monitoring: Provides report by exception capability for the data types that block 1 is able to transfer periodically. #Block Data Transfer: Provides a means transferring Block 1 and Block 2 data types as block transfers instead of point by point. In some situations this may reduce bandwidth requirements. #Information Messages: Simple text and binary files. #Device Control: Device control requests: on/off, trip/close, raise/lower etc. and digital setpoints. Includes mechanisms for interlocked controls and select-beforeoperate. #Program Control: Allows an ICCP client to remote control programs executing on an ICCP server. #Event Reporting: Extended reporting to a client of error conditions and device state changes at a server. #Additional User Objects: Scheduling, accounting, outage and plant information. #Time Series Data: Allows a client to request a report from a server of historical time series data between a start and end date. =Protocol Architecture= ICCP is based on client / server principles. Data transfers result from a request from a control centre (client) to another control centre (server). Control centres may be both clients and servers. ICCP operates at the application layer in the OSI model. As such any physical interfaces, transport and network services that fit this model are supported. TCP/IP over Ethernet (802.3) seems to be the most common. ICCP may operate over a single point-to-point link between two control centres; however, the more general case is for many control centres and a routed wide area network. The logical connections or ‚Äúassociations‚Äù between control centres are completely general. A client may establish associations with more than one server and a client may establish more than one association with the same server. Multiple associations with same server can be established at different levels of quality of service so that high priority real time data is not delayed by lower priority or non real time data transfers. =Access Control= ICCP does not provide authentication or encryption. These services are normally provided by lower protocol layers. ICCP uses ‚ÄúBilateral Tables‚Äù to control access. A Bilateral Table represents the agreement between two control centres connected with an ICCP link. The agreement identifies data elements and objects that can be accessed via the link and the level of access permitted. Once an ICCP link is established, the contents of the Bilateral Tables in the server and client provide complete control over what is accessible to each party. There must be matching entries in the server and client tables to provide access to data and objects. =Interoperability= The wide acceptance of ICCP by the utility industry has resulted in several ICCP products being on the market. Although interoperability is not regarded as a high risk area, the standard is such that an implementation does not have to support all conformance blocks in order to claim compliance with the standard. A minimal implementation only requires Block 1. Only those blocks necessary to achieve the required functionality need be implemented. It is also not necessary to support all objects defined in the standard for any particular block. Extensive interoperability testing between products of some of the major vendors has been a feature of ICCP protocol development. Independent reports are available, as no doubt are reports from vendors. An ICCP purchaser must define functionality required in terms of conformance blocks required and the objects within those blocks. Application profiles for the ICCP client and server conformances must match if the link is to operate successfully. =Product Differentiation= ICCP is a real time data exchange protocol providing features for data transfer, monitoring and control. For a complete ICCP link there need to be facilities to manage and configure the link and monitor its performance. The ICCP standard does not specify any interface or requirements for these features that are necessary but nevertheless do not affect interoperability. Similarly failover and redundancy schemes and the way the SCADA responds to ICCP requests is not a protocol issue so is not specified. These non protocol specific features are referred to in the standard as ‚Äúlocal implementation issues‚Äù. ICCP implementers are free to handle these issues any way they wish. Local implementation is the means that developers have to differentiate their product in the market with added value. Additional money spent on a product with well-developed maintenance and diagnostic tools may well be saved many times over during the life of the product if use of the ICCP connection is expected to grow and change. =Product Configurations= Commercial ICCP products are generally available for one of three configurations: #As a native protocol embedded in the SCADA host. #As a networked server. #As a gateway processor. As an embedded protocol the ICCP management tools and interfaces are all part of the complete suite of tools for the SCADA. This configuration offers maximum performance because of the direct access to the SCADA database without requiring any intervening buffering. This approach may not be available as an addition to a legacy system. The ICCP application may be restricted to accessing only the SCADA environment in which it is embedded. A networked server making use of industry standard communications networking to the SCADA host may provide performance approaching that of an embedded ICCP application. On the application interface side the ICCP is not restricted to the SCADA environment but is open to other systems such as a separate data historian or other databases. Security may be easier to manage with the ICCP server segregated from the operational real time systems. The gateway processor approach is similar to the networked server except it is intended for legacy systems with minimal communications networking capability and so has the lowest performance. In the most minimal situation the ICCP gateway may communicate with the SCADA host via a serial port in a similar manner to the SCADA RTUs.

Its eastern terminus is at a diamond interchange with the U.S. Route 33 (US 33) expressway approximately northwest of Logan. Route description Along its path, SR 180 travels through northeastern Ross County, the extreme southeastern corner of Pickaway County and the northwestern part of Hocking County. No portion of this highway is included within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of routes determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History The SR 180 designation was applied in 1927. Prior to this time, the stretch of highway that SR 180 currently occupies through Ross, Pickaway and Hocking Counties was designated as SR 27\\\\. With the designation of the US 27 in that year, SR 27 was replaced by SR 180\\\\.

Geographically, it was separated from Wiechs am Randen by a wide strip of Swiss territory. It was absorbed into Switzerland in 1967 after diplomatic negotiations between Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland. The history of Verenahof Today \\"Verenahof\\" is merely a street name In 1522, Emperor Charles V and his brother, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria purchased Verenahof along with other territories in the vicinity (Tengen, Kommingen, Wiechs am Randen) from Count , who expressly wished not to sell these possessions to the Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen. In the 17th and 18th centuries there were repeated disputes between Tengen and the adjacent Schaffhausen over the access roads and the exact delimitation of the enclave. Residents of Verenahof were Catholic at that time whereas the inhabitants of B√ºttenhardt were Protestant. On Catholic holidays Verenahof denied the inhabitants of B√ºttenhardt rights of transit. In 1806, the Grand Duchy of Baden inherited sovereign rights over Verenahof, which became an enclave within the canton of Schaffhausen. In 1815 and 1839 Swiss attempts to obtain Verenahof were unsuccessful.Schaffhauser Staatsgebiet und Hoheitszeichen In 1829 a schoolhouse was built in Wiechs am Randen where the children from the Verenahof enclave could attend school. By 1855 inhabitants of Verenahof were also Protestant as were their B√ºttenhardter neighbors; they had become a small Protestant minority within the otherwise completely Catholic community of Wiechs am Randen. In the 1920s, there were several attempts to integrate the Verenahof into Switzerland but the Baden Ministry of the Interior repeatedly rejected these. In the 1930s, the border markers around the exclave were updated. On 30 April 1945, four German officers sought refuge within the enclave. The Swiss police, however, expelled them. By 1964 a treaty was concluded between Germany and Switzerland, which entered into force on 4 October 1967.

Verenahof now forms part of the Swiss municipality of B√ºttenhardt. At the same time the exclave of B√ºsingen am Hochrhein continued to remain however administratively part of Germany and following the land swap involving Verenahof it is part of the Switzerland- Liechtenstein customs area since the treaty came into force on 4 October 1967 and as such no border checks have been carried out between B√ºsingen and Switzerland since. At the Wiechs am Randen town hall there are some remaining border markers that became obsolete with the land swap in 1967; and in B√ºttenhardt, at the old school house, some old border markers from the 1930s have been used to frame bushes planted around the enclave.

As overburden conveyor bridges, they transport the overburden which lies over the coal seam. The cutting height is , hence the name F60. In total, the F60 is up to high and wide; with a length of , it is described as the lying Eiffel tower, making these behemoths not only the longest vehicle ever made‚Äîbeating Seawise Giant, the longest ship‚Äîbut the largest vehicle by physical dimensions ever made by mankind. In operating condition, it weighs 13,600 metric tons making the F60 also one of the heaviest land vehicles ever made, beaten only by Bagger 293, which is a giant bucket-wheel excavator. The first conveyor bridge was built from 1969 to 1972, being equipped with a feeder bridge in 1977.

The 1st Shock Army was created in late 1941 and fought in the northern areas of Russia and the Baltic States until the surrender of Germany in 1945. The Army was created in accordance with prewar doctrine that called for Shock Armies to 'overcome difficult defensive dispositions in order to create a tactical penetration of sufficient breadth and depth to permit the commitment of mobile formations for deeper exploitation.'Keith E. Bonn (ed.), Slaughterhouse, p.306 However, as the war went on, Shock Armies lost this specific role and reverted, in general, to ordinary frontline formations. History The 1st Shock Army was formed as part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK, the Stavka reserve) at Zagorsk (now Sergiyev Posad) in the Moscow Military District in November 1941. Taking part in the Battle of Moscow in December 1941, on 1 December the Army consisted of the 133rd Rifle Division, 29th, 44th, 47th, 50th, 55th, 56th, 71st, and 84th Rifle Brigades, 17th Cavalry Division, two tank battalions, an artillery regiment of the Stavka reserve, and other support units.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army , 1 December 1941 (Russian) All the rifle brigades were formed from the naval personnel of the Pacific Fleet. 1st Shock Army was then airlifted to Staraya Russa and fought at Demyansk in 1942. Fighting in the north-central areas of the front, the 1st Shock Army again fought near Staraya Russa in 1944. From 1942 through 1944, the army took part in many attacks such as the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod, Pskov-Ostrov, Tartu, and Riga offensives.

Willem Hunthum was a Dutch merchant and the last legally recognised Dutch owner of Tortola in what later became the British Virgin Islands. Hunthum was regarded as either Patron or \\"Governor\\" of the Territory from 1663 to 1672 when control of the islands passed to the British in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Hunthum died at some point between 1672 and 1678. Life Details of Hunthum's life are actually relatively scant. Control of the islands was to pass to the British not long after Hunthum's acquisition of them, and the British asserted root of title to the islands dating back to certain patents granted to Earl of Carlisle for Tortola (as well as certain other islands) by King James I approximately 30 years earlier. Accordingly, records relating to Hunthum's title were at best ignored by the British, and possibly destroyed in support of their competing claim made against the Dutch throne later. Ownership of Tortola Hunthum was a Rotterdam merchant, who purchased the property right to Tortola, and possibly certain other of the Virgin Islands, from the Dutch West India Company during the 1650s. It is believed that Hunthum's interest in the Territory related (or became related) primarily to the nascent trade in slaves rather than the agricultural opportunities to grow sugar and cotton. In The Virgins: A Descriptive and Historical ProfilePearl Varlack and Norwell Harrigan. Published by The Caribbean Research Institute College of the Virgin Islands (1977) it is asserted that after receiving a charter from the Danish crown, Erik Neilsen Schmidt, a Danish sea captain, took possession of neighbouring St. Thomas in 1666. Then \\"Hunthum, a Dutchman from Tortola, is reported to have landed in force on St. Thomas to break up the Danish occupation.\\"At page 14. No primary sources are cited. The same text goes on to assert that in the same year \\"Dutch buccaneers were drive out of Tortola by a similar band of adventurers calling themselves English.\\" The British seized control of the islands in 1672 at the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. By the end of the hostilities in 1678, Hunthum had died. It was not until 1684 that the Dutch ambassador, Arnout van Citters, formally requested the return of Tortola, and he did so (curiously to British eyes) based the claim on the private rights of the widow of Willem Hunthum. But Tortola was never actually returned to the widow. Part of the problem was that Sir Nathaniel Johnson, the new Governor of the Leeward Islands, was ordered to restore the island to such person or persons who have \\"sufficient procuration or authority to receive the same...\\" However, there was no one apparent to restore the island to. In the event, Johnson did nothing. Later, November 1696 a subsequent claim was made to the island by Sir Peter van Bell, the agent of Sir Joseph Shepheard, a Rotterdam merchant, who claimed to have purchased Tortola on 21 June 1695 for 3,500 guilders from Hunthum's estate. Legacy Although Hunthum's interest in the islands was only very limited, he nonetheless achieved a form of legacy in the name of modern-day Hunthum's Ghut, a channel which divides Great Mountain from Fahie Hill, and also lends its name to the region of Road Town at its base. There is also a ruin of a grand house higher up within the Ghut, accessible only by foot, and it is possible to conjecture that this was the grand house built by Hunthum to oversee his interests, although it is not clear that he ever actually stayed there.

Jacobsen painted more than 6,000 portraits of sail and steam vessels, making him \\"the most prolific of marine artists\\".Maddry, Larry. \\"Maritime Artist Finally Gets Brush with Success\\", The Virginian-Pilot, December 17, 1994.

In conjunction with the exhibition, the museum published a volume by Harold S.

On February 19, 2006, Fetching The Mark, an unsigned painting of the racing yacht Dreadnought attributed to Jacobsen, was sold at auction for $281,000, more than triple the highest price previously paid for one of Jacobsen's works. The piece had been brought to an Antiques Road Show event in Tampa, Florida, and had originally been thought to be a work of Jacobsen's contemporary James E.

This report was refuted by the Arunachal Pradesh Information and Public Relations department in a tweet which read \\"This is to clarify that Arunachal Pradesh has got only 1 COVID-19 positive case till date.The reporting by Zeenews is false and does not carry any authenticity.\\" = Mahua Moitra criminal defamation case = Zee News telecasted a show featuring editor-in-chief Sudhir Chaudhary where he claimed that Trinamool Congress legislator Mahua Moitra had plagiarised author Martin Longman in her maiden speech after being elected to the Lok Sabha. Moitra accused the channel of false reporting and submitted a breach of privilege motion against Zee News and Sudhir Chaudhary. Martin Longman responded and stated that the legislator did not plagiarise him. Subsequently, Moitra filed a criminal defamation case against Chaudhary. = Coverage of 2020 Delhi election results = The 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election were held on 8 February 2020. The exit poll results predicted the Aam Aadmi Party to retain their government in National capital territory of Delhi. The Zee News telecast of the exit poll results featured Sudhir Chaudhary who indulged in polemic commentary against the voters of the election. He stated that the people of Delhi had chosen Pakistan over Hindustan and that the rule of Mughals will now return. He further alleged the people of Delhi are lazy and only concerned about \\"freebies\\" and that issues like Ram Mandir, Balakot airstrike and Revocation of Article 370 do not matter to them which is why they have rejected the Bharatiya Janata Party. The telecast resulted in backlash and mockery of Zee News and Sudhir Chaudhary on social media. =Ban in Nepal= On 9 July 2020, Nepal's satellite and cable television operators banned Zee News and some other Indian privately owned news channels, citing \\"propaganda and defamatory report against Nepal government\\".

It lies just east of the small town of Craven Arms, on the other side of the River Onny. It was once the centre of a separate civil parish, but is now part of the civil parish of Craven Arms, which was formed by merging the parish of Halford with that of Stokesay. These two older entities continued as parish wards, however a review of the governance of Craven Arms in 2012 concluded that these two wards will be abolished from May 2013.Shropshire Council Governance Review - Craven Arms Until the 19th century, Halford was a detached part of the parish of Bromfield. The detached part ran up Long Lane, on the other side of the River Onny. Being part of Bromfield brought it into the hundred of Culvestan and from c. 1100 that of Munslow (Lower Division).

Retrieved on January 5, 2008.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, Official PSIA Webpage. Retrieved on January 5, 2008. Any investigation conducted by the agency needs to go through the Public Security Examination Commission (PSEC) in order to determine if there is a justification to investigate and clamp down on an organization's activities.https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file- attachments/Tatsumi_%20Japan%27s_Security_Policy_Infrastructure_Final_Version.pdf As the national agency with the role to collect intelligence information, the PSIA contributes to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations. It is also known that the PSIA is responsible for conducting surveillance and intelligence-related work on Zainichi Koreans on Japanese soil. The PSIA's findings are released publicly through the annually-published Naigai Jousei no Kaiko to Tenbo (Situation in Public Security inside and outside Japan and their prospect) as well as regularly-published Kokusai Terrorism Youran (International Terrorism Report). According to Philip H.J. Davies and Kristian Gustafson, the PSIA operates similarly to the British security agency MI5 since officers have no rights to arrest anyone during a law enforcement operation nor force anyone to be involved in an investigation. History PSIA officers make an inspection to a suspected Aum Shinrikyo building in 2012. The Public Security Intelligence Agency was established with the enforcement of the Subversive Activities Prevention Law on 21 July 1952, initially known as the Public Security Investigation Agency before it changed to its current name. The PSIA took over the role of the SIB, which was established by the Allied Forces during the occupation. Most of the recruits came from the disbanded Tokumu Kikan and led by officials from the pre- occupation Ministry of Justice. Initially focusing on threats from far left groups such as the Japanese Red Army during the days of the Cold War, it began to conduct intelligence work on the Aum Shinrikyo after the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, with criticism that the PSIA did not monitor the group, especially with their attempt to acquire and stockpile biological weapons on Japanese soil.Japan's Growing Intelligence Capabilities, Andrew Oros. Retrieved on June 9, 2008. The PSIA had cooperated with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau in investigating Aum Shinrikyo for a number of years. When asked about their investigation on the cult, a PSIA report had said \\"There has been no change in its dangerous nature. Strict surveillance is essential.\\" The PSIA had investigated Aum Shinrikyo when it was revealed that the group had established software firms that could pose security risks to Japan. Chongryon has been under PSIA surveillance for a long time, suspecting it of supposedly performing espionage activities in Japanese soil. The Ministry of Justice has sought ¬•270 million to fund the PSIA on conducting intelligence against North Korean espionage activities. Its facilities were also raided by the PSIA while sentencing for its leaders were underway in 2004. The PSIA had been supposed to be integrated with Naicho in order to reorient the agency to a post-Cold War and to enhance its resources, but the proposal was not adopted. An investigation into French Al-Qaeda terrorist Lionel Dumont had been the responsibility of the PSIA in 2004 based on rumors that he was supposed to establish a Japanese Al-Qaeda cell.Al-Qaeda agent lived quiet life in Niigata  The Japan Times The PSIA raided the headquarters of Fumihiro Joyu's Hikari no Wa on May 10, 2007.Cult group of former Aum official inspected by public safety agency. Retrieved on May 10, 2007. Despite insistence from Joyu that his group had ended ties with Aum Shinrikyo, PSIA officials have warned that his group has ties to Shoko Asahara after conducting raids. In the wake of Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, the PSIA reported that they are undertaking intelligence work on North Korea by conducting intelligence work towards Chongryon, as they had remitted money and gifts to North Korea before sanctions were imposed. In 2015, the PSIA offered university students a one-day immersion to work alongside veteran PSIA officers. On July 14, 2016, the PSIA sent officers to Sapporo to investigate Aleph's Shiroshi Ward facility under the Act on the Control of Organizations Which Have Committed Acts of Indiscriminate Mass Murder. In January 2017, Okinawa press reported that the PSIA has conducted investigation into pro- Okinawan independence and anti-USFJ bases activist groups for potential links to China. In December 2019, an anti-Aum Shinrikyo video was created by the agency in order to raise public awareness that the group is still a threat to public safety.https://www.arabnews.jp/en/japan/article_7245/ In recent years, the PSIA is eyed as the basis for the creation of a new foreign intelligence agency should Prime Minister Abe go through with plans. =Operations= While the PSIA is known to conduct its operations on domestic soil, there are suggestions that they have conducted limited operations overseas. In the 2000s, the PSIA was reported to have conducted undercover operations at the Chinese-North Korean border by distributing flyers to locals in obtaining information regarding Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea. From 2005 to 2016, reports of Japanese nationals being arrested throughout China for taking photos of sensitive installations or conducting illegal activities under cover of legal occupations suggests that the PSIA has recruited expats working/living in China to conduct limited HUMINT ops. These allegations have never been officially confirmed. According to a National Police Agency official, the PSIA has done a bad job in China if reports do prove that the expats arrested were covertly recruited by the agency.

Born in Oslo, he took a cand.philol. degree at the University of Oslo. He was appointed at the Lillehammer University College in 1975, became associate professor in 1978, and was promoted to professor in 1993. Pryser has specialized in several fields. In the field of Norwegian nineteenth- and twentieth-century history, his 1985 tome Norsk historie 1800‚Äì1870. Fr√• standssamfunn til klassesamfunn is influential. In 1999 it was republished in an abridged version, Norsk historie 1814‚Äì1860, Fr√• standssamfunn mot klassesamfunn, as volume four of Samlagets norske historie, a series on Norwegian history spanning the years 800 to 2000. As the title indicates, Pryser's book has a social perspective on the period. In the field of Norwegian labor history, his publications include Klassebevegelse eller folkebevegelse? En sosialhistorisk unders√∏kelse av thranittene i Ullensaker (1977, an expanded version of his master's degree thesis)Entry at BIBSYS and Klassen og nasjonen 1935-1946 (1988, volume four of Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge). The 1991 work Arbeiderbevegelsen og Nasjonal Samling explores the connection between parts of the worker's movement and Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian Fascist party which during the German occupation of Norway from 1940 to 1945 was the only legal party in Norway. Other war-related publications include Fra varm til kald krig (1994) and Hitlers hemmelige agenter: tysk etterretning i Norge 1939-1945 (2001). Pryser also contributed to the Norsk krigsleksikon 1940‚Äì45, an encyclopedia published in 1995.List of authors of Norsk krigsleksikon 1940‚Äì45 Following Hitlers hemmelige agenter in 2001, Pryser has done his research mainly on foreign intelligence in Norway during and after the Second World War. His project mainly led up to Tyske hemmelige tjenester i Norden, a large work on German intelligence in the Nordic countries which was released in late 2012. By-products of the project include the books Kvinner i hemmelige tjenester: etterretning i Norden under den annen verdenskrig (2008, translated into Swedish), USAs hemmelige agenter : den amerikanske etteretningstjenesten OSS i Norden under andre verdenskrig (2010), Svik og gr√•soner: norske spioner under 2. verdenskrig (2010) and \\"Varulven\\" og andre agenthistorier: svik og gr√•soner under 2. verdenskrig (2011).List of publications in BIBSYS As a historian of Norway during World War II, Pryser has been critical to several historiographical aspects of the period. The importance of several resistance members, hailed as heroes after the end of war, has, according to Pryser, been exaggerated for nation-building purposes. He has also stated that several companies went largely unpunished for their economic cooperation, so-called \\"economic high treason\\", with the German occupants.

History ADC was created to allow an extensible protocol and to address some shortcomings of the Direct Connect protocol. It was initiated by Jacek Sieka, under the influence of Jan Vidar Krey's DCTNG draft. The first revision of ADC came in 2004 and the first official version in 2007-12-01.  Design and features  ADC is structured around clients that connect to a central hub, where the clients (users) can chat and download files from other clients (users). The hub provides routing between clients for chat, searches and requests for connections. The actual file transfers are between clients. The protocol itself is split in two parts: a base protocol that every client and hub respectively must follow and extensions that are optional. The protocols allow signalling of protocol features (such as bloom filters), and messages can be constructed to only be routed to those who support that particular feature. Each hub has their own rules and are commonly governed by hub operators. Hubs may define different capabilities for hub operators. The hubs themselves do not regulate discussion and files, but the hub operators. The hub regulate minimum share and maximum amount of simultaneous hubs; things that are sent by the client, rather than the user. Lists of hubs exist where a hub's name, description, address and rules are specified. With the hub list, users can choose hubs that are similar according to the user's liking of discussion topics and files. The peer-to-peer part of the protocol is based on a concept of \\"slots\\" (similar to number of open positions for a job). These slots denote the number of people that are allowed to download from a user at any time. The slots are controlled by the user of respective client. ADC require that all text must be sent in UTF-8, which means that users with different system encoding (say, Russian and Chinese) are able to chat with respective native characters. The protocol natively supports IPv6. There are two modes a user can be in: \\"active\\" or \\"passive\\". Clients in active mode can download from anyone else on the network. Passive mode users can only download from active users. Passive clients will be sent search results through the hub, while active clients will receive the results directly. An active searcher will receive (at most) 10 results per user and a passive searcher will receive (at most) 5 results per user. NAT traversal exist as a protocol extension, which allow passive users to connect to other passive users. The base protocol does not require encryption, but extensions exist to provide encryption with TLS. Files in client connections are identified by their hash, most commonly the Tiger Tree Hash. The hash algorithm is negotiated with the hub and used throughout the client-hub session, as well as subsequent client-client connections. Protocol The ADC protocol is a text-based protocol, where commands and their information are sent in clear text, except during password negotiation. The client-server (as well as client-client, where one acts as a \\"server\\") aspect of the protocol stipulates that the client speak first when a connection has been made. For example, when a client connects to a hub's socket, the client is the first to talk to the hub. The protocol requires that all text must be sent as UTF-8 encoded Unicode, normalized in form C. There are no port defaults, for hubs or clients. Hub addresses are in the following form: adc://example.com:411, where 411 is the port. During hub-client protocol information exchange, the client offers a set of hashes it supports. The hub will select one of these hashes, and that hash will be used throughout the hub-client session. If the hub deems that the client doesn't support an (arbitrary) appropriate hash set, an error is raised. The global identification scheme is based on the hash set producing two end-hashes, where one of them depends on the output of the other. During hub-client information exchange, the client will send these end-hashes, encoded with base32, which the hub will confirm to match. One of these base32 encoded hashes will be further sent to other clients in the network. The global identification scheme is this last string. The client may change its end-hashes on a hub-to-hub basis. Each user, during a hub session, is assigned a hash that only lasts that particular session. This hash will be used for all client references in that hub. There is no dependency on nicks. Each client information notification is incrementally sent. An incoming request for a client-client connection is linked to an actual connection, with the use of a token. Searches use a token, as well, to identify each result of a search. There is no out-of-the-box ability for a client to kick or redirect another client from a hub. The hub, however, can kick and redirect arbitrarily. The hub can also require that all other clients in the hub must terminate their transfers with the kicked/redirected client. If a client is redirected to another hub, the redirecting client must use a referrer, similar to the HTTP referrer. The kicked/redirected client is not required to receive a notification message. The peer-to-peer part of the protocol is based on a concept of \\"slots\\" (similar to number of open positions for a job). These slots denote the number of people that are allowed to download from a user at any time. These slots are controlled by the client. Automatic slot allocation is supported by the protocol. The token in the client-client connection decides who should be allowed to download first. Downloads are transported using TCP. Searches can be transported using TCP or UDP. An active client has a listening port for TCP and another for UDP, though the ports don't depend on each other. Protocol delimiters are ' ' and ' ' (space). The character '\\\\' is used as an escape sequence. Allowed escape sequences are \\" \\" (new line), \\"\\\\s\\" (space) and \\"\\" (backslash). The protocol allows for extensions such as compression with bzip2 or encryption with TLS. While the protocol does not mandate that these extensions be implemented, hubs may require them.

It is surrounded by numerous smaller volcanic centers and volcanic necks with extensive lava- covered mesas and valleys to the south. The largest mesa is long and about wide, with an upper elevation of above the surrounding plain, and is capped with about of lava. The ancient lava flows extend southward into the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range Province and consequently that border of the Colorado Plateau Province is ill-defined. The principal structure of the southwestern Datil-Mogollon Section is the Mogollon Rim in Arizona. It extends approximately from northern Yavapai County eastward to near the border with New Mexico. =East= The Datil-Mogollon Section is bounded on the east by basins of the Rio Grande rift, which are part of the Mexican Highland Section of the Basin and Range Province. Along the eastern edge of the Datil- Mogollon, the Mexican Highland extends northward along the Rio Grande depression to the Southern Rocky Mountains. The boundary between the depression and the uplifted Colorado Plateau is sharply defined by the westernmost faults of the depression. The transition has several large structural basins and block-faulted ranges. =North= To the north are other physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau Province.

Released almost two years after Reagan left office, the book reached number eight on The New York Times Best Seller list. Content The book is composed of 748 pages, describing Reagan's life from his birth in Tampico, Illinois, to his acting career, marriages, entrance into politics, years as Governor of California, loss in the 1976 Republican primary, and finally his years as President of the United States. Reviewer John O'Sullivan says of Reagan, \\"[H]e shows a tendency, where other people's feelings are concerned, to gloss over unpleasantness in a way which ... detracts ... from his value as a historian.\\" He told his side of events that led to his 1976 presidential candidacy, as well as his relationships with members of Congress and his views on the world and the Cold War. =Personal life= Reagan was married twice: the first to actress Jane Wyman (1917-2007) from 1940 to 1948. Reagan only mentions her in one paragraph in the book, saying \\"it didn't work out\\", but that the marriage \\"produced two wonderful children.\\"Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 92 He married Nancy Davis in 1952, saying in the biography \\"Sometimes, I think my life really began when I met Nancy.\\"Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 123 =Presidency= Although covering most of the events that occurred during the Reagan presidency (1981-1989), the book's most notable omission is the rejection of Robert Bork as a Supreme Court justice, with very little mention made of Reagan's judicial appointments. One of Reagan's more controversial enactments as president were his economic policies, dubbed \\"Reaganomics.\\" From the autobiography's point of view, everything about them were successful except that \\"the vested interests that hold sway over Congress prevented us from cutting spending nearly as much as I had hoped to, or as the country required.\\" Also in terms of economic policy, one of Reagan's main regrets was his ultimate failure in creating a federal balanced budget. With regards to the Iran‚ÄìContra affair, a major administration scandal that involved the diverting of funds being shipped to Iran to the contras in Nicaragua, An American Life says, \\"None of the arms we'd shipped to Iran had gone to the terrorists who had kidnapped our citizens.\\" Of the scandal, Reagan writes, \\"[Bud] McFarlane, [John] Poindexter, [Bob] Casey, and, I presume, [Oliver] North knew how deeply I felt about the need for the contras' survival as a democratic resistance force in Nicaragua. Perhaps that knowledge... led them to support the contras secretly and saw no reason to report this to me.\\" The autobiography goes on to claim that, \\"[a]s president, I was at the helm, so I am the one who is ultimately responsible.\\"Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 486-487 The book also discusses Reagan's political rivalry and personal friendship with former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill. Reviews When the book was first published, it reached number eight on The New York Times bestsellers list. Some authors, journalists, and reviewers agreed that the book presented a fair picture of Reagan's life, while others seriously questioned its historical value and purpose.

The results of the study showed no adverse effects with marked and sustained reductions in blood pressure similar to the use of two blood-pressure medications given in combination. NUCCA and Migraines In 2015 NUCCA published a study on migraine sufferers performed at the University of Calgary. The study used a supine phase contrast MRI to track venous and arterial flow in and out of the brain, as well as the fluid dynamics of cerebral spinal fluid. Subjects were examined by a neurologist and completed baseline migraine-specific outcomes. The presence of atlas misalignment allowed study inclusion, permitting baseline MRI data collection. The Subject were re-evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks and revealed clinically significant improvement in symptoms with a decrease in headache days.

The Iron Range & Huron Bay Railroad (IR&HB;) is a defunct railroad constructed to haul iron ore in Michigan's Upper Peninsula during the 1890s. Financial and engineering problems prevented the railroad's operation; it remains an unusual example of a railroad which was completed but never used.  Background  Rich iron ore deposits were first discovered in the Upper Peninsula in the 1840s, and remain a significant source of wealth for the state. By the 1890s Michigan was the largest supplier of iron ore in the United States. Railroads would haul ore from the mines to great ore docks on the Great Lakes in places such as Escanaba and Marquette, where it would be loaded on ore freighters and transported to the rest of the country. The Huron Mountains west of Marquette were known to be rich in ore deposits, particularly around Lake Michigamme (near Michigamme, Michigan), and were believed to contain marble, granite, silver, gold, lead, graphite, asbestos, and silica.Barnett (2007), 46.  History  The IR&HB; was formed on June 27, 1890 by seven businessmen, all from Michigan's Lower Peninsula and all but one from Detroit. Milo H. Davis, also of Detroit, was engaged as chief engineer. The company proposed to construct a line from Champion, near the Lake Michigamme ore fields, to a new ore dock on Huron Bay (in Arvon Township), which connected to Lake Superior. From there the ore would be shipped by freighter through the Soo Locks.Barnett (2007), 47. = Construction = The terrain for the line proved forbidding. The country was hilly and broken; grading the roadbed proved an expensive and intensive activity. By June 1891 an initial workforce of 500 men had swelled to 1,500, which strained the local transportation network. The builder, Wallace Dingman of Battle Creek, Michigan, ran out of money in August and abandoned work, leaving the IR&HB; with unpaid bills and swamping Marquette County's limited poor relief resources. New contractors were hired and the grading was finally finished in the summer of 1892, reportedly at the cost of $400,000-well above the $265,000 budgeted for the project. One major obstacle was a cut near Mount Arvon, from which of rock were removed. The rails were laid between July and November 1892.Barnett (2007), 48‚Äì9. The ore dock was built on the shores of Huron Bay for $170,000 under the supervision of John Munro, Jr. It measured in length and required of lumber. A sawmill was constructed to process the vast amounts of timber necessary for the project.Barnett (2007), 47‚Äì9. = Failure = Although the IR&HB; completed the lineBarnett implies 35 in his calculates; Dompier claims 42, as does the Times article cited below. between Champion and Huron Bay and purchased two 4-8-0 \\"Mastodon\\" steam locomotives from the Brooks Locomotive Works, no trains were ever operated. The completion of the line coincided with the Panic of 1893, which reduced the demand for iron ore. Additionally, the ore mines around Lake Michigamme-which the IR&HB; had intended to serve-began to play out. There were richer mines in Ishpeming to the east, but the IR&HB; lacked the wherewithal to construct such a line, which would have spanned . In places the IR&HB; line exceeded a grade of 5%, which would have made the haulage of freight difficult.For a standard-gauge non-rack rail railroad like the IR&HB;, 3% was \\"excessive\\" and anything over 4.5% unheard of. Some sources claim the IR&HB; exceeded 8% in places. See Barnett (2007), 49‚Äì50. By 1893 the IR&HB; found itself in serious financial difficulties. In 1890 it had begun with $1,400,000 in capital through an initial stock issue coupled with the sale of bonds. Additional bonds worth $600,000 were sold to cover construction overruns and keep the railroad afloat, but its debts mounted. Finally, in 1900, the company's owners sold it outright to the Detroit Construction Company for $110,000.Barnett (2007), 50.  Legacy  Following the sale the Detroit Construction Company dismantled the entire line. The rails were re-used in various interurban schemes in the Lower Peninsula, including the Grand Rapids, Holland and Lake Michigan Rapid Railway and the Detroit, Lake Orion and Flint Railway. The two locomotives were sold to the Algoma Central Railway. The great ore dock was dismantled and shipped to Detroit.Barnett (2007), 51. Davis, the chief engineer, fled to Mexico to escape allegations of fraud. According to the New York Times, the state took possession of the right-of-way and other property as compensation for unpaid taxes; Marquette County purchased the section within its borders in 1902 for $1,600 and converted it into a roadway. In 1905 the Lake Superior Southern Railway proposed to construct a new line from Huron Bay to Madison, Wisconsin; the company failed to attract financing and dissolved in 1908.

It is not known when Wang Hongyi was born, but it is known that he was from Hengshui. He was known as a hoodlum in his youth, and on one occasion, when he begged for melons from a farmer but the farmer refused, he falsely reported to the county magistrate that there was a white rabbit‚Äîthen considered a sign of good virtue for the emperor‚Äîin the melon field; the magistrate sent soldiers into the field to hunt try to find the white rabbit, and the melon field was destroyed. On another occasion, when he went through the region of Zhao (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, part of modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Bei (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei), he happened to see the country people putting on a vegetarian feast for Buddhist monks, and he falsely reported that they were plotting a rebellion. More than 200 people were killed. As of 690, Wu Zetian, then empress dowager and regent over her son Emperor Ruizong, was poised to take the throne herself, and by that point, she had given Wang a general title, and then made him an assistant censor. On one occasion, when Wang Anren () the commandant at Sheng Prefecture (ÂãùÂ∑û, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) was accused of treason, Empress Dowager Wu sent Wang Hongyi to investigate. Wang Anren put himself in stocks to try to show his loyalty, but Wang Hongyi was not persuaded, and had Wang Anren beheaded even as he was in the stocks; he also beheaded Wang Anren's son. As he was returning to the eastern capital Luoyang, he went through Fen Prefecture (Ê±æÂ∑û, roughly modern L√ºliang, Shanxi), where the military advisor to the prefect, a man named Mao, held a feast for him. For reasons unknown, however, during the feast, he ordered Mao to leave the table and beheaded Mao. He put Mao's head on a spear and entered Luoyang with it, and everyone who saw the sight shivered. At that time, the prison for political prisoners were inside the Lijing Gate (), and as political prisoners entering that gate would thus rarely be able to leave alive, Wang jokingly referred to the Lijing Gate with two different characters, ‰æãÁ´ü, also pronounced Lijing but meaning \\"the end.\\" In 692, Wang falsely implicated the chancellors Li Youdao, Wang Xuan, Yuan Zhihong, Cui Shenji, and Li Yuansu, and other officials Kong Siyuan () and Ren Linghui (), and all of them were removed from their posts and exiled to the Lingnan region. In 694, Wang was accused of corruption and exiled to Qiong Prefecture. He pretended to receive an edict from Wu Zetian recalling him to Luoyang, but as he reached the north bank of the Han River, he encountered the censor Hu Yuanli (). Hu interrogated him and found out that he falsely claimed to be recalled by edict. Unable to defend himself, Wang pleaded with Hu, stating, \\"I am but similar to you, sir.\\" Hu responded, \\"When you, sir, were a censor, I was the sheriff of Luoyang. I am now a censor and you are now a prisoner. Where is the similarity?\\" He had Wang caned to death. He had had brother Wang i have no idea killed.

Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987, p. 172 In 1906, it appeared in Cather's first published collection of short stories, The Troll Garden. Plot summary A young Bostonian named Clark receives word that his Aunt Georgiana is coming to visit from Nebraska to settle an estate. As a young woman, Georgiana had been a talented music teacher at the Boston Conservatory until, during a trip to the Green Mountains, she met Howard Carpenter, ten years her junior. They eloped and moved to a homestead in Nebraska. Thirty years have passed since Georgiana has seen Boston. Clark recalls her kindness to him when, as a boy, he visited Nebraska and she introduced him to Shakespeare, classical mythology, and the music she played on her small parlour organ. Clark takes his aunt to a symphony concert of music from Richard Wagner's Tannhauser, Tristan und Isolde, and The Flying Dutchman. She is intensely moved by the music and listens with tears running down her face. When the concert ends she says, \\"I don't want to go, Clark, I don't want to go!\\" Clark realizes that she has nothing ahead of her but the grim drudgery of life back on the Nebraskan plains. = Setting The story takes place in Boston, but Clark, the narrator, describes Nebraska in detail.

Stimulated by contemporary art movements, the original group of 14 artists, met in November 1944, they intended to raise standards of local professional art to something worthy of the artistic history of Norfolk, by mutual criticism and appraisal of work. On 8 January 1945, they named the Group ‚ÄúThe Norwich Twenty Group‚Äù and a constitution was signed. N20G continues to flourish with new members. Since 1944, over 270 artists have been members. Some of the artists have included Bernard Reynolds, Edward Barker, Leslie Davenport, Michael Andrews, Mary Newcomb, Hamilton Wood, Jeffery Camp and Cavendish Morton. Since 1945 and until the end of 2013, some 150 art shows have been organised. Shows have taken place in 97 venues in Norwich, 35 in East Anglia, 11 outside East Anglia and 7 in Europe. Many of the artists trained at the Norwich School of Art and Design, now Norwich University of the Arts, Royal College of Art, Slade School of Fine Art, and other well known art schools. Many have travelled widely, studying the arts of other cultures and have exhibited regionally, nationally and internationally. Current members include 88 artists, with three life members and four honorary members. Several NUA graduates are invited to join the group every year, for one year, under the Licentiate Scheme. Meeting challenges in today's contemporary art, N20G now encompasses artists working in all media from paint, sculpture, installations and digital, ever seeking to nurture new members and forms of art. .

Russian and Ukrainian Cossack forces under Vasily Borisovich Sheremetev and Bohdan Khmelnytsky engaged a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian army under Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki near Gr√≥dek Jagiello≈Ñski, which at that time was part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth‚Äôs Ruthenian Voivodeship (now Horodok, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine). Polish forces were defeated and forced to retreat, losing their supplies to the Russians. The Russians advanced, besieging Lwow, and Potocki with the remains of his army was soon forced to surrender to the invading Swedes. In August 1655, Russian- Cossack forces moved into Red Ruthenia, which at that time was one of few provinces of the Commonwealth still controlled by Polish forces, as in July of that year, Poland-Lithuania had been invaded by the Swedish Empire. Russian- Cossack forces were faced by a numerically inferior Polish Crown army commanded by Hetman Stanislaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki. The Poles were supported by light Crimean Tatar cavalry, but their forces were inadequate to stop the Russians, and were steadily pushed westwards by the invaders. Near Grodek Jagiellonski Russian cavalry forced their opponent to fight among swamps and ponds. First Russian charge was repulsed, and Polish cavalry followed the retreating enemy, getting between two columns of Cossack infantry. Hetman Potocki ordered a retreat, which turned into panic. Potocki managed to regain the control of his army, but Russian-Cossack forces were too numerous, and despite desperate resistance, they managed to capture Polish camp, chasing retreating Poles as far as Jaworow. After the victory, Russians and Cossacks besieged Lwow: to save itself, the city paid an enormous sum of money. The invaders then headed to Lublin, reaching as far west as the Vistula near Pulawy and Kazimierz Dolny. To save his army from complete annihilation, Potocki surrendered to King of Sweden Charles X Gustav, on October 28, 1655.

His brother is Simon Elmore, a Munich based Musician. Elmore- Meegan co-founded the International Community for Relief of Starvation and Suffering (ICROSS), an International aid agency operating in East Africa that describes itself as \\"a small international organisation working to fight poverty and disease in the poorest parts of the world.Meegan has challenged the Irish group of wasting money he raised on overhead, Google. Retrieved 5 November 2015.ICROSS profile, icrossinternational.org. Retrieved 5 November 2015. Meegan pursued money missing raised by him in 2005. The group argues that the money was raised on the back of publicity for his work and the proceeds of his books and should be released for use in his African projects. However, former associates who have broken with Dr Meegan over the allegations, are seeking to have the company wound up and its assets disbursed on other aid projects, they are under investigation for embezzling funds raised by him. ICROSS Ireland closed in 2012, causing ICROSS International, based in Kenya, to extend its own programmes.

He spoke French and Latin by the age of ten. In 1971, he moved to Dublin, attending Terenure College, Dublin, run by the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (the Carmelites), where he graduated in 1977. He entered the Roman Catholic Society of White Fathers - The Missionaries of Africa/Les P√®res Blanc - hoping to become a missionary. Due to a serious burn injury and keloid damage he left the White Fathers, instead completing a degree in Philosophy at the Jesuit Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy (awarded by the Holy See), following which he entered the Jesuit novitiate. Later, in 1989, he took an MSc in Community Health from Trinity College Dublin. Michael Meegan After Ecclesiastical training earning an Honours degree in Philosophy from the Holy See, Elmore-Meegan moved to Kenya at aged 20, where he settled in the Northern territories of the Great Rift Valley and began to perform development aid work among the local people. This was largely funded by his own inheritance and by close personal friends. In 1978 his early drafts of spiritual axioms, All Shall be Well, later to be a series of reflections on poverty was published by Collins in 1986 (Fount Religious paperbacks). He began sculpting at an early age, mostly working in clay and bronze. He still does private commissions in bronze. Since 1980, he suffered a series of serious illnesses in Africa, ranging from cerebral malaria and amoebic and bacillic dystentry to cholera. In 1992 and again in 1999 and 2019 he received the Catholic last rites on three occasions. He handed over his position in ICROSS during his illness in 2019. He has never married being a Catholic Celibate adhering to the divine Office, and in the mid-1980s he adopted two Kenyans; a Samburu, Lemoite Lemako and a Maasai, Saruni OleKoitee OleLengeny, later to become assistant CEO of ICROSS Kenya, a role he held until July 2014. Career Elmore-Meegan's first involvement in Africa was in Karamoja, Uganda and then with a number of health and development projects with Dr Robbie McCabe MD in Turkana. He then expended his work into sections of northern Mogadishu in Somalia, developing and interest in infant health and nutrition. He began to work among the Samburu and Maasai people to address villages devastated by diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis and the effects of repeated drought. He spent the 1980s mostly living amongst pastoral nomadic Turkana, Maasai and Samburu tribesmen in Uganda and Northern Kenya. A long-time friend of Wilfred Thesiger, he worked closely with traditional Samburu primarily north of Maralal. In 1979, Elmore- Meegan, with Dr Joseph Barnes, founded the Community for the Relief of Starvation and Suffering (CROSS) which, by 1984, he renamed the International Community for Relief of Starvation and Suffering (ICROSS), which began funding health projects in Africa and India. He was supported in this work by Dr Wilfred Koinange, Director of Medical Services of the Kenyan Ministry of Health. Together with Fr Paul Cunningham CSSp, Fr Brendan O'Brien CSSp, and Dr Evan Sequeira, he established a series of community health programmes. After 32 years Dr Sequeira retired from the Board of Directors and was replaced by Dr Allan Soita. By 1985 he had built health clinics and development programmes serving three pastoralist communities. Learning local tribal languages, Elmore-Meegan created a unique approach to community development, insisting that any planning had to be done by the members of the local communities in the local languages, not by others. He pioneered a series of grassroots locally appropriate health interventions as part of integrated community health strategies in close collaboration with leading research institutions including the Institute of Child Health, London. He developed a series of locally appropriate methods for reducing infectious diseases which have been widely adopted. In 1984 he established a branch of his charity in the USA. ICROSS East End expanded with the support of Norman Jaffe and Dr Kenneth Cairns MD, in Suffolk County, New York. ICROSS in Tanzania was established and quickly became self-supporting. Sir Wilfred Thesiger (left) and Elmore-Meegan His work extended into reproductive health and eventually HIV/AIDS programmes. Under Elmore-Meegan's leadership, ICROSS worked with a number of other organisations on a Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland led project, to develop a Solar water disinfection system that could be used by village households.( By the early 2000s, Elmore-Meegan had become a prominent, if sometimes controversial, figure in Ireland whose fundraising activities for ICROSS attracted the public support of former Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Garret FitzGerald and entertainment celebrities, including Elton John, Chris de Burgh, Caroline Corr, and Andrea Corr. His writing and charitable activity brought him Ireland's well-regarded 2003 International Person of the Year Award presented in a nationally televised ceremony by the Irish charity Rehab. Michael Elmore-Meegan and Manuel Scrima There has been much media coverage of Elmore-Meegan. In May 2005, Ireland's RT√â televised a documentary, When You Say 4000 Goodbyes. After the broadcast, Elmore-Meegan's charity ICROSS received some 400,000 euros in donations. On 19 November 2005, When You Say 4000 Goodbyes was shown at Harvard University's prestigious Magners Irish Film Festival. On 5 May 2006, the documentary won the Radharc Award 2006 for the \\"documentary programme of outstanding quality which addresses a national or international topic of social justice, morality or faith.\\" Elmore-Meegan worked with photographer and video maker Manuel Scrima on several projects and exhibited across Europe sharing Africa Awakes for ICROSS. The awareness advocacy exhibitions have been seen in 12 countries, Italy, Spain, Finland, Ireland, UK, Germany, Hungary, and France, as well as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.YouTube Manuel Scrima is producing a book with Elmore-Meegan in fall 2016, featuring over a hundred images, Africa Awakes. As part of his advocacy campaigning, he produced his latest book, Celebration, in collaboration with Finnish photographer Julius Konttinen. Manuel Scrima and Elmore Meegan are currently working on a book together titled \\"Africa Awakes\\" Controversies ICROSS has attracted controversy, in part because of concerns raised by Elmore-Meegan about the distribution of funds raised in Western countries in recent years by charities founded by him. The Irish branch of the organisation has been wound up as a result of his concerns. His qualifications have been questioned and those complaints disproved.Fitzgerald, Mary Anne. 1992. Nomad: Journeys From Samburu. London: Sinclair-Stevenson; . Elmore-Meegan litigated successfully against The Irish Daily Mail in 2010. The apology, read before the High Court Judge and Jury, stated \\"\\"The newspaper ought not to have published these allegations and had agreed not to do so. We apologise without reservation to Mr Meegan for the damage and distress caused to him as a result.\\" He later won a civil suit and received a settlement for damages and costs. In November 2014, Elmore-Meegan launched further defamation actions resulting from other publications in Ireland in the same year, which were successfully settled out of court. In July 2015, the Irish Examiner paid further settlement to avoid pending litigation. In July 2006, it was reported that Elmore-Meegan had misrepresented his credentials in a funding proposal when Duke University (USA) was attempting to secure a multimillion-dollar grant in the United States.

In horses it is encased by the hoof capsule. Also known as the distal phalanx, third phalanx, or \\"P3\\". The coffin bone meets the short pastern bone or second phalanx at the coffin joint. The coffin bone is connected to the inner wall of the horse hoof by a structure called the laminar layer. The insensitive laminae coming in from the hoof wall connects to the sensitive laminae layer, containing the blood supply and nerves, which is attached to the coffin bone. The lamina is a critical structure for hoof health, therefore any injury to the hoof or its support system can in turn affect the coffin bone. Despite the protection provided by the hoof, the coffin bone can be injured and fractured.Vogel (2006), p 189 For example, inflammatory conditions such as laminitis may lead to rotation of the coffin bone and associated permanent damage due to the coffin bone pulling away from the hoof wall as the laminar layer tears apart. Pedal osteitis is another common inflammatory condition. Fractures can also occur to coffin bones and, depending on the fracture, can cause severe lameness. Other conditions linked to the conformation of the horse, such as flexural contractures may also affect the coffin bone. For example, the coffin joint can become deformed and lead to changes of the coffin bone within the hoof capsule if the horse has an untreated club foot. Contracted heels can also affect the shape of the coffin bone, making it grow away from its normal, healthy shape. X-rays can diagnose injury, determine the position of the bone, and verify the type of damage that may have been received. Once injured, remedial shoeing can help protect the coffin bone from further trauma. Treatment of assorted disorders may also involve use of shoe pads, anti- inflammatory medication, and management changes.

The oval butterflyfish, red-finned butterflyfish or redfin butterflyfish (Chaetodon lunulatus) is a species of butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae). It is found in the Pacific Ocean from Eastern Indonesia to the Hawaiian islands. This is one species of a closely related group which includes the Blacktail butterflyfish, which is found in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and the Melon butterflyfish, which is found in the Indian Ocean.FishBase [2008]: Chaetodon lunulatus. Retrieved 2008-SEP-01.  Description and characteristics  The black-tailed butterflyfish (C. austriacus), melon butterflyfish (C. trifasciatus), and oval butterflyfish (C. lunulatus) are similar in coloration. The former has black caudal and anal fins, while the latter is an Indian Ocean species and has a more conspicuous back patch below the dorsal fin and a mainly yellow anal fin.Lieske, E. & Myers, R.F. (2004): Coral reef guide ‚Äì Red Sea. HarperCollins, London. Chaetodon lunulatus can grow up to 14cm long. It has about 13-14 dorsal spines, 20-22 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines, and 18-21 anal soft rays. Together with the black-tailed and melon butterflyfishes, and probably also the somewhat aberrant Arabian butterflyfish (C. melapterus), it makes up the subgenus Corallochaetodon. They are probably quite close to the subgenus \\"Citharoedus\\" (the name is a junior homonym of a mollusc genus), which contains the scrawled butterflyfish (C. meyeri). Like that group, they might be separated in Megaprotodon if the genus Chaetodon is split up.Fessler, Jennifer L. & Westneat, Mark W.

They are benthopelagic and can be found in coral reefs in the tropics. They can be found at a depth of 3 to 30 meters in coral-rich lagoons and semi- protected seaward reefs. Small juveniles are secretive and hide in corals.  Ecology and behavior  = Diet = The butterflyfish species feeds almost exclusively on hard corals.Pratchett, M.S. (2005).

Effects of coral bleaching  Coral bleaching has been shown to affect Chaetodon lunulatus. A 2004 study found a noticeable decline in the physiological condition of the oval butterflyfish before and immediately after a coral bleaching event, possibly leading to reductions in survivorship.Pratchett, M.S., Wilson, S.K. and Baird, A.H. (2006), Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. Journal of Fish Biology, 69, 1269-1280. doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2006.01161.x A 2006 study found a significant decline in the abundance of various species of butterflyfish (including C. lunulatus) after a bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef. Only obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes, such as C. lunulatus, and not facultative or non-coral feeders displayed reductions in abundance. It has been suggested that these declines were due to starvation and death resulting from a lack of coral prey. = Reproduction and mating = The oval butterflyfish is oviparous and has little sexual dimorphism.Yabuta, S.

PloS one, 13 (4), e0194465. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194465 Studies have found that heterosexual pairing predominates, most likely to facilitate reproduction. Partner fidelity appears long-lasting, with one study reporting that individuals remained paired for up to seven years. In these pair-bonds, females feed more frequently, while males tend to take the leading position when swimming in tandem. The pairs display a high level of parallel and proximate (1.5m) swimming, and almost always remain in close range (4m). = Territoriality = Butterflyfish defend their territories against conspecifics. A tail-up display is a common antagonistic behavior in the Chaetodon species.Yabuta, S. (2000). Behaviors in agonistic interaction of the butterflyfish (Chaetodon lunulatus).

LTS occur at low, negative, membrane depolarizations. They often follow a membrane hyperpolarization, which can be the result of decreased excitability or increased inhibition. LTS result in the neuron reaching the threshold for an action potential. LTS is a large depolarization due to an increase in Ca2+ conductance, so LTS is mediated by calcium (Ca2+) conductance. The spike is typically crowned by a burst of two to seven action potentials, which is known as a low-threshold burst. LTS are voltage dependent and are inactivated if the cell's resting membrane potential is more depolarized than ‚àí60mV. LTS are deinactivated, or recover from inactivation, if the cell is hyperpolarized and can be activated by depolarizing inputs, such as excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP). LTS were discovered by Rodolfo Llin√°s and coworkers in the 1980s. Physiology =Rhythmicity= Rhythmogenesis in a neuron is due to an instability associated with the resting potential. Such instability can be attributed to properties of low- threshold calcium currents. The current is activated at around ‚àí60 mV, making it able to generate a low-threshold spike at or near the resting potential. In a somewhat recent finding, cells maintained at a hyperpolarized level have been shown to exhibit intrinsic rhythmicity, resulting in spontaneous oscillatory behavior due to Ca2+ driven depolarizations. As a result, one or more short bursts of spikes occur, followed by hyperpolarization, and then repolarization before the next burst. =LTS kinetics= A study done by Gutierrez et al. examined the kinetics behind low-threshold spikes to better understand their significance towards normal functions of the brain. It has been determined experimentally that four ionic currents contribute to low- threshold spikes, generating three distinct phases after hyperpolarization. Transient outward K+ currents following action potentials can cause hyperpolariztion, allowing for low-threshold spikes. An initial ohmic leakage current composed of K+ and Na+ ions characterizes the first phase. This is followed by a hyperpolarization-activated \\"sag\\" current that contributes to slowly depolarizing the membrane potential. An inward Ca2+ current through T-type calcium channels is the last phase, and the main current responsible for the large transient depolarization. This overrides the other currents once T-type channels are activated. The other currents primarily affect the activation of the LTS. =T-type calcium channel= The T-type calcium channel is found in neurons throughout the brain. These channels produce particularly large currents in thalamic, septal, and sensory neurons. Due to their activation near the resting membrane potential, as well as their fast recovery from inactivation, they are able to generate low-threshold spikes, which results in a burst of action potentials. T-type channels play a secondary pacemaker role in neurons that have resting membrane potential between -90 and -70 mV as they have an important role in the genesis of burst firing. An excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) opens the channels, thus generating a LTS. The LTS triggers Na+-dependent action potentials and activates high- voltage activated calcium channels. =Low-threshold spikes generate burst firing= Evidence for low-threshold calcium current was first described in neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus (1981). This nucleus generates synchronous rhythmic activity, which under certain conditions is manifested as a tremor. Low-threshold calcium spikes have been described in neurons from a variety of brain nuclei, including the thalamic relay, medial pontine reticular formation, lateral habenula, septum, deep cerebellar nuclei, CA1-CA3 of the hippocampus, association cortex, paraventricular and preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, globus pallidus, striatum, and subthalamic nucleus. Thalamic relay cells show two types of responses. One response mode is a relay or tonic mode, in which the cell is depolarized and LTS are inactivated. This leads to tonic firing of action potentials. The second response is a burst mode, in which the cell is hyperpolarized and typically responds with LTS and their associated bursts of action potentials. In general, LTS cannot be triggered by depolarization of the neuron from the resting membrane potential. LTS is observed after a hyperpolarizing pulse is delivered to the neuronal cell, which is called \\"deinactivation\\" and is a result of channels recovering from inactivation. LTS are often triggered after an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) due to the fast recovery of T-type calcium channels during the IPSP and their opening, as there is a return to resting membrane potential. There is a strong correlation between LTS amplitude and the number of action potentials that result from a LTS. There is much more depolarization of T channels near the dendritic location of activated receptors than at the soma. The activation of either metabotropic glutamate or muscarinic receptors results in a hyperpolarizing shift in the relationship between LTS amplitude and the initial potential of the membrane. This affects the maximum LTS amplitude. This means that there is a dependency between the LTS amplitude and voltage, and therefore the resulting number of action potentials generated. =LTS is mediated by a Ca2+ conductance= When the hyperpolarization of the membrane in these interneurons is maintained at a certain level calcium conductance is reduced, if not completely inactivated. This results in the membrane polarization not being in the right range for single spikes and hence \\"bursts\\" result. The LTS therefore is dependent upon the conductance of calcium. =Serotonin inhibition of the low-threshold spike= The striatum, a nucleus in the basal ganglia, contains low-threshold spike interneurons. The basal ganglia serve many functions, which include involuntary motor control, emotions, and cognition. These interneurons produce nitric oxide and are modulated by neurotransmitters, specifically serotonin, released from the brainstem. Serotonin serves to inhibit these interneurons. This was studied using transgenic mice in which nitric oxide interneurons were labeled green using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Serotonin binds to serotonin receptors on the interneuron (5-HT2c), which increases potassium conductance and subsequently decreases the excitability of the neuron. Research Much of the research done on LTS has examined cells of a cat‚Äôs lateral geniculate nucleus. All thalamic relay cells experience these specific voltage-dependent calcium currents, and the cat has proven to be a useful model species to study. Different variations of current clamp methods, in addition to model simulations have shed light on many aspects of the phenomena. Recent research has also been conducted on the T-type calcium channel and how modulation of these channels may allow for the treatment of various neurological and psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, mania, and epilepsy. This is, however, still a new area of research. T-type calcium channels have been known to play a role in the spike-and-wave discharges of absence seizures. Antiepileptic drugs can control absence seizures by inhibiting the T-type calcium channels which prevents low-voltage calcium currents. =Amplitude of the Ca2+ spike= The amplitude of LTS has been shown to directly correlate with the size of the transient Ca2+ current that underlies the LTS in certain neuronal cells. They are triggered by a combination of a hyperpolarized membrane, or de-inactivation of Ca2+ channels, and a suprathreshold depolarizing input. The amplitude of the Ca2+ spike is therefore predominantly dependent on the level of preceding membrane hyperpolarization and the depolarizing input. However, it has been demonstrated that the LTS are all-or-none events due to the regenerative nature of the phenomenon. As with the action potentials that follow them, LTS vary little in amplitude or shape at different holding potentials. This dictates that suprathreshold depolarizing inputs do not affect the amplitude and only factor into the initial activation of the LTS. The amount of de- inactivation determines the conductance of Ca2+ channels and is the main factor that contributes to the amplitude of LTS. It has also been suggested that the activity of delayed rectifier K+ channels can affect the amplitude of LTS. Burst firing caused by LTS are therefore thought to be used as on/off signaling as opposed to tonic firing which is graded and more responsive to the intensity of depolarizing inputs. =Latency of the Ca2+ spike= The latency of a LTS is the amount of time between the depolarizing pulse and its peak. It has been shown that unlike amplitude, it is directly affected by the size of the initial depolarizing current. This is derived from the interaction between the initial, outward ohmic response, which is the leakage K+ ions out of the cell in response to change in membrane potential, and the voltage- dependent gating of the T-type calcium channels. Latency is decreased with an increased depolarizing current, which overruns the outward ohmic current and more quickly depolarizes the membrane. This more quickly activates the exponential growth of the Ca2+ spike. This reduction occurs more sharply with depolarizing currents closer to the threshold and more gradually as current injections are increased beyond threshold. Latency cannot be further reduced beyond a certain depolarizing current and becomes nearly uniform with any larger current. This has led to the hypothesis that burst signaling as a result of LTS with stronger activating inputs is more stable than LTS due to near-threshold activating inputs. =Parkinson's Disease= The thalamus is responsible for relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex. Therefore, much research has been conducted on low-threshold spikes in the neurons in the thalamus and how it could relate to Parkinson's disease and the corresponding loss of motor function. Hypo-bradykinesia, as seen in Parkinson's disease, is improved by medial thalamotomy; this suggests that it is caused by interference of thalamic LTS bursts with cortical functions. LTS have been found to occur in the human lateral thalamus during sleep; however, they fade as soon as the patient is awakened. Abnormal LTS bursting activities that have been noted in awake parkinsonian patients suggests a relation between the clinical condition and this neuronal activity.

The road is long, starting at the U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and New York State Route 9N (NY 9N) concurrency and ending at the peak of Prospect Mountain. Although the road is designated as New York State Route 917A, an unsigned reference route, by the New York State Department of Transportation, all maintenance on the roadway is performed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.  Route description  The Prospect Highway at one of the scenic overlooks along the mountainside The parkway begins at an intersection with Routes 9 and 9N (Canada Street) in the town of Lake George. The parkway passes through a gate, heading up the base of Prospect Mountain. The route is very scenic, with trees on both sides of the road. Route 917A parallels Birch Ave., a street in Lake George. Soon after, the parkway passes over Interstate 87 (I-87, named the Adirondack Northway). The road expands to several lanes after the Northway, coming to a tollbooth. After the toll booth, the parkway begins to head up the mountain. With large heavy, stabilized rocks on both sides of the road, used as a guard rail to prevent danger (such as running off of the road), the parkway curves around the mountain, intersecting with several specialized scenic overlooks. The road curves around the several peaks of Prospect Mountain, coming to an end at the main peak at , where a view can be seen. The furthest that can be seen are the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  History  Prospect Mountain originally had to use an incline railway car to access the house at the top where people could dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June 15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway. In 1932, the building at the top of the mountain burned down and was replaced by a steel fire tower. For 30 years, people studied what to do with the land, which was owned by the state, and in 1954, New York Governor Tom Dewey signed legislation to build a highway up the mountain. Twelve years later, in 1966, then-Governor Nelson Rockefeller made funds available for the highway. The Prospect Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway was opened in 1969, dedicated to war veterans and providing access to the summit with a view at its peak.

The band was saddened by the deaths of labelmates Sharon Jones in 2016 and Charles Bradley in 2017, with some members moving to other states and starting families. The members reconvened in 2019 to write and record their fifth album, Budos Band V. The album was further noted by critics for its diverse influences, being described by Kerrang! as \\"cinematic yet menacing, the soundtrack to a bad drug trip in the desert in a blaxploitation flick.\\" The album also received positive reviews from Rolling Stone and New Noise. The latter described the Budos Band as \\"one the best bands out there today. They bring a familiar vibe while standing defiantly unique.\\" Their sixth album, Long in the Tooth, was released on October 9, 2020.

Dominated by canyons (as the name implies) this section has four large upwarps between which are structural basins. Very little faulting is associated with the upwarps or basins. Other distinctive features of the Canyon Lands Section are the laccolithic mountains, like the Henry Mountains and the La Sal Mountains. These are structural domes. The turbid San Juan River flows into the region from the east, through a deep meandering gorge, which, with its tributaries, drains a far-reaching area, including the La Plata Mountains, the San Juan Mountains and other lesser ranges on the Continental Divide, the Chuska Mountains, and enormous areas of mesa land in the interior of the basin. From the Wasatch Range and Aquarius Mountains on the west come other, but lesser, silt-laden streams, all carving the deep, winding canyons which have given this country its name and developed a weirdly dissected landscape. The Colorado River is the largest such stream. In northeastern Arizona is Monument Valley, where sharp spires, obelisks, and tower-like masses of rock rise hundreds of feet above their surroundings. At the eastern margin of the Canyon Lands is the Mesa Verde, a huge cuesta that has been deeply dissected by streams. Here in great recesses in the canyon walls are found the ruins of ancient cliff dwellings. East of the Little Colorado River are the brilliantly colored areas known as the Painted Desert. Here the rocks show gorgeous colors in strata that are gently inclined and present a series of cliffs that are slowly migrating as weathering and erosion proceed. The area north of the canyon of the San Juan River has several surfaces varying from above sea level. There are bold escarpments bordering some of these plateaus, canyons with steep walls, and a group of mesas called the Tables of the Sun, and several national monuments containing natural bridges. The Canyon Lands terminate, approximately, at a third, intermittent barrier formed by the Paria Plateau, Black Mesa, and the Chuska Mountains mass. Geology Perhaps the dominant physical feature within the area is the San Rafael Swell occupying the majority of Emery County, Utah. This feature is a large northeast trending upwarp approximately long and wide that is part of a much larger, double- plunging anticline (e.g., dome) structure. This large, regional fold exposes rocks of Pennsylvanian through Cretaceous age. Resistant beds of sandstone are exposed as hogbacks on the steeply upturned east and west flanks of the anticline and are referred to locally as \\"reefs.\\" Three perennial rivers (the Muddy, San Rafael, and Price) flow eastward across the San Rafael Swell into the Green and Colorado River systems.

It is a sendup of Gone with the Wind, and features an early appearance by Elmer Fudd in his most familiar form. The cartoon's title is meant to evoke \\"Confederate money\\". Plot It is 1861 (B.Sea., that is \\"Before Seabiscuit\\"), and Colonel O'Hairoil, a literal blueblood in the literally bluegrass country of Kentucky, presides over rich tobacco and cotton plantations. His black workers slowly pick the cotton one boll at a time, and when one young lad takes two bolls of cotton and hands them to his recumbent father to place in the packing crate, he is warned, \\"Don't get too ambitious there, son.\\" The pride of the plantation is the Colonel's daughter, Crimson O'Hairoil, who is courted by many suitors, who leave in vain after having their horse parking ticket validated (for parking is charged by the hour). Crimson has eyes only for the \\"chivalrous, hard riding, square shooting soldier of fortune, Ned Cutler.\\" (Elmer Fudd). Ned arrives, and is just, with some difficulty, about to ask Crimson a question, when there is an explosion. The American Civil War has started. Ned must leave to join his \\"wegiment.\\" He leaves his horse in the paid lot, despite the warning of the attendant. The war drags on. The war is picketed on the grounds that it is unfair to the Union, while civilians are equipped with blue \\"Union suits\\" (uniforms). An officer addresses his men, warning that the other side is pitching Stoneball Jackson, \\"a southpaw\\" against them, and if they win, they will meet the South in the Cotton Bowl. A trumpeter sounds a call, but things degenerate into a jazz band. A nervous Confederate officer paces in a tent with information coming in by telegraph‚Äîit turns out to be race results. Ned shoots a cannon, whose ball acts like a pinball in a machine. Meanwhile, the horse and attendant await Ned's return. The Colonel is dispirited to hear, on the radio, that \\"The Yanks\\" have won again, announced before a victory for Brooklyn (and all others rained out), and curses the Yankees. Back at camp, Ned reads a letter and sighs. A signal rocket turns into an advertisement \\"After the battle eat Southern Fried Chicken at Mammy's Shack.\\" Crimson, having promised to burn a light in the window for Ned, does so with such enthusiasm with a searchlight that she alarms Paul Revere, who rides away giving his famous warning. Time passes (with the horse and attendant still in the lot) from 1861 to 1865, and the war ends. Crimson looks out her window, strewn with the remains of candles. At last, Ned returns, and finally asks Crimson the question‚Äîcan she validate his parking ticket? She stamps \\"REVOKED\\" across his forehead. This is the first of three cartoons featuring the black hunter from All This and Rabbit Stew. He appears as the slave who is waiting for Ned to pick up his horse.

It can contribute to the development or progression of certain conditions. Mechanisms  Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the innate immune system may be the result of either external (biological or chemical agents) or internal (genetic mutations/variations) factors. Research While SI may be induced by multiple external factors, research suggests that a lack of control by tolerogenic dendritic cells and T-regulatory cells (Treg) is possibly the primary risk factor for the development of SI. In functioning immune responses, T-helper and T-cytotoxic cells are activated by presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Chief among these are dendritic cells (DCs). When a DC presents an antigen to a Treg cell, a signal is then sent to the nucleus of the DC, resulting in the production of Indoleamine 2,3- Dioxygenase (IDO). IDO inhibits T cell responses by depleting tryptophan and producing kynurenine, which is toxic to the cell. Individuals susceptible to developing chronic systemic inflammation appear to lack proper functioning of Treg cells and TDCs. In these individuals, a lack of control of inflammatory processes results in multiple chemical and food intolerances, autoimmune diseases.

Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the Ancient Near East; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations. Dating historical events The use of descriptions of astronomical phenomena to date historical events began in the 16th century, a time of a renewed humanistic interest in history and of increasingly precise astronomical tables.Anthony Grafton, \\"Some Uses of Eclipses in Early Modern Chronology,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 64 (2003): 213-229. Eclipses in particular are relatively infrequent events and can be dated precisely. When the circumstances are not exact and descriptions leave ambiguities, one can often use other details such as the month of the eclipse or the position of other stars and planets to identify the specific eclipse.F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, \\"Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175\\", Journal for the History of Astronomy, 37 (2006): 55-69. Astronomical dating, like other forms of historical interpretation, requires care in interpreting the surviving written records. John Steele has proposed three questions that must be asked when dating an event: Does the record refer to an actual astronomical event, or is this merely a modern assumption? If it does refer to an actual astronomical event, is the source reliable? Can the record provide an unambiguous date without making unwarranted assumptions about ancient astronomical observational methods?John M. Steele, \\"The Use and Abuse of Astronomy in Establishing Ancient Chronologies,\\" Physics in Canada/La Physique au Canada, 59 (2003): 243-8, p. 247. Babylonian astronomical diaries provide detailed and unambiguous accounts of the positions of all the visible planets, often in relation to specific stars, that have been used to provide precise dates of events like the defeat of Darius III by Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela on 1 October 331 BCE and of Alexander's subsequent death on 11 June 323.Jona Lendering, \\"Astronomical Diaries\\" Since the success of this method depends on the reliability of the written sources and the precision of their accounts of astronomical phenomena, attempts to date literary texts which may describe astronomical events loosely or even as metaphors have led researchers to conclusions that appear precise, but rely on invalid assumptions and are consequently less widely accepted. Thus the attempts to date Vedic texts describing the Pleiades as rising \\"due East\\" to about 2300 BCE, which is the time when the Pleiades rose \\"exactly\\" due East, is complicated by the fact that poetic descriptions need not be taken as reflecting precise astronomical observations, while precession is a very slow process which makes only small changes in the azimuth of a star rising in the East.Michael Witzel, \\"The Pleiades and the Bears viewed from inside the Vedic texts,\\" Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies , 5 (1999), issue 2 Dating artifacts seven planets on 18 March 816. Among the artifacts that can most readily be dated by astronomical techniques are depictions of the positions of the celestial bodies at a particular time. Since the motions of the celestial bodies are all at different periods, it takes many centuries for all the planets plus the Sun and the Moon, to reach the same positions in the signs of the Zodiac. For a configuration accurate to ¬±15¬∞ (that is, within a single sign) the positions of these seven bodies will only return to the same configuration once in about 3700 years. A particular case involved a medieval illuminated manuscript which portrayed the position of these seven celestial bodies on 18 March 816; corresponding to the period when the manuscript was written. This calculation demonstrated that this illustration was not a copy of an earlier classical depiction of the position of the stars.Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, \\"Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the Leiden Aratea planetarium\\", Quaerendo, 20 (1999): 248-261; see esp. ¬ß 6. Reliability of the Dating Method, p. 258. The rapidly moving Moon is the most sensitive indicator for the exact time; if one can estimate the indicated position of the Moon to within a degree, the time of the diagram can be computed to within an hour.William D. Stahlman, \\"Astronomical Dating Applied to a Type of Astrological Illustration,\\" Isis, 47 (1956): 154-160, p. 158. A striking example of this method was an astrological portrait of Sir Christopher Hatton (1540‚Äì1591), which depicted the positions of the seven classical planets in the zodiac and noted the computed positions of the planets to the nearest minute of arc. Here the largest source of error in the date was the uncertainty of 16th-century astronomical calculations. The resulting time was about noon of 12 December 1581.Arthur Beer, \\"Astronomical dating of works of art\\", Vistas in Astronomy, 9 (1967): 177-223. Dating structures by their orientation A more controversial archaeoastronomical approach has been used to date structures that are believed to have been oriented on astronomical principles by measuring their orientation and computing the date in the past when a single specified celestial body, whether the Sun or a selected star, rises or sets at the measured azimuth. The astronomer, Norman Lockyer, applied this method to StonehengeNorman Lockyer and F. C. Penrose, \\"An Attempt to Ascertain the Date of the Original Construction of Stonehenge from Its Orientation\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 69. (1901 - 1902): 137-147. by measuring the orientation of the Stonehenge avenue and comparing it to the position of solstitial sunrise, which changes slowly due to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic. The archaeologist, F. C. Penrose, applied a similar method to ancient Greek Temples, attempting to establish their dates by relating their orientation to the appearance of stars on the horizon, the position of which changes slowly due to the precession of the equinoxes.F. C. Penrose, \\"On the Results of an Examination of the Orientations of a Number of Greek Temples with a View to Connect these Angles with the Amplitudes of Certain Stars at the Time the Temples were Founded, and an Endeavour to Derive therefrom the Dates of their Foundation by Consideration of the Changes Produced upon the Right Ascension and Declination of the Stars by the Precession of the Equinoxes\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, A, 184 (1893): 805-834. The wide variance of these dates from historically accepted ones led the architect and archaeologist, William Bell Dinsmoor, to mistrust dates established by the slowly changing obliquity of the ecliptic or by stellar alignments, which involve an arbitrary selection of a star that rises on the proper azimuth. Instead he proposed a method employing what was already known from historical records concerning the dates of construction of Greek temples, the festivals associated with specific temples, and the nature of the Greek Lunisolar calendar. Since the date of a festival in the Greek lunisolar calendar only recurs on the same date in the solar calendar every eight or nineteen years, Dinsmoor identified a festival connected with a specific temple and was able to determine the exact year near the historically recorded construction date when the Sun rose in alignment with the temple on the date of the festival.William Bell Dinsmoor, \\"Arch√¶ology and Astronomy\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 10 (1939): 95-173.

Stringing time Stringing a racquet can take up to an hour for a novice, or around twenty minutes for a skilled stringer; during professional tournament a very skilled stringer may be asked to string a racquet while the player is on court. These string jobs can take just 10 minutes for a seasoned tournament stringer. Stringing differences between sports =Tennis= Tennis strings are usually made up of gut, polyester or a hybrid of the two but have been known to consist of other materials including: nylon, metal, multifilament and Kevlar. Racquet tension can vary from anywhere from 30-70 lbs. Professional players tend to opt for the upper limit of the racquet tension range, however, an increasing number of recent players have been choosing lower tensions to favour power. =Badminton= Badminton strings are usually made up of microfilament, but historically used to be strung with gut. Racquet tension can vary from 18-36 lbs. Professional players tend to opt for the upper limit of the racquet tension range. =Squash= Squash strings are usually made up of microfilament or gut. Racquet tension can vary from 20-30 lbs. Professional players tend to opt for the upper limit of the racquet tension range. Types of stringing machines =Drop weight stringing machines= A drop weight stringing machine Drop weight stringing machines are inexpensive that use a weighted bar to achieve the desired string tension. Using only weight and simple laws of physics (torque = force x distance) they are very precise and also constant pull type of machines. They are the most maintenance-free type of machines and also the most affordable. As a result, these stringing machines are popular among those learning how to string a racquet or string on a casual basis. On the other hand, slow tensioning times are the main reason for stringers choosing more expensive machines. =Manual crank (lockout) stringing machines= Manual crank (lockout) stringing machines use a crank to achieve the correct tension, at which point the tension mechanism locks into place. These stringing machines allow racquets to be strung more quickly than with drop weight machines. The lockout action permits more tension loss than drop weight http://jfc- tennis.co.uk/category/stringing-machine/ and constant pull actions. =Electronic stringing machines= A Tecnifibre electronic stringing machine Electronic stringing machines control the tension with a computer-directed electric motor, resulting in fast paced stringing and exceptional accuracy. This is the most common kind of stringing machine found in racquet sport shops. Reliable constant pull stringing machines usually cost $3,000 and more. This type of stringing machine is found at nearly all professional tournaments. There are two types of electronic tension mechanisms: constant pull and lock out. Constant pull, as the name suggests, pulls the string and continues pulling until the desired tension is reached. The tension mechanism will ensure the string tension remains correct at all times, making stringing more consistent and accurate, as string stretching is taking into account. Lock out electronic stringing machines are similar to crank machines as they will pull to the desired tension but no longer monitor any reduction in tension over time. Constant pull technology will therefore offer greater levels of string accuracy. Most electronic stringing machines will offer many time saving and comfort features that include single action clamp bases, string measurer, electronic brake, height adjustable stand and color touch- screen. The most recent stringing machines include an automatic turntable tilt function that turns at a small but noticeable angle when weaving the cross strings of a racquet. These features substantially reduce stress on the shoulders and back for a stringer. While affordable (sub ¬£500) models offer a raft of productive features, the increased outlay and need for regular maintenance make it a harder investment to justify when getting started.

White designed many homes, armories, churches, and public buildings throughout Syracuse in Central New York, including the Hall of Languages at Syracuse University, the Oswego County Court House, Syracuse High School, the Weiting Block in Syracuse, Oswego's City Hall, and more.The man who changed the face of Syracuse : Horatio Nelson White by Elinore Taylor Horning. Mexico, NY: E.T. Horning, c1988. Published in conjunction with an exhibit on his works at the Onondaga Historical Museum. Early life White was born in Middleton, New Hampshire, on February 8, 1814 and was named after Horatio Nelson, the famous British Admiral and hero of the Battle of Trafalgar. Before moving to Syracuse in 1843, White worked as a carpenter and a builder in Andover, Massachusetts. Upon arrival in Syracuse, White immediately made a name for himself, earning high praises as the building contractor for the Church of the Messiah. Following business reversals, White moved briefly to Brooklyn, New York in 1847. In 1849, he set sail for San Francisco and worked in California during the 1849‚Äì1851 building boom and gold rush. Career The Third Onondaga County Courthouse, Syracuse. Completed 1857, demolished 1967 In 1851, White returned to his wife and daughter in Syracuse, paid off his creditors and established what became a highly successful architectural practice. In 1856, White was given the prestigious opportunity of designing the new Onondaga County Courthouse in Clinton Square. The resulting design was hailed as a resounding success and elements from it were utilized in several of his subsequent plans, including the designs for the Jefferson and Chemung County courthouses. White's reputation was growing as one of the best architects in Syracuse. Young architects came to Syracuse to study under him. One of these was Archimedes Russell, later to become a professor of architecture at Syracuse University from 1873 through 1881.Syracuse University Archives. Faculty Papers: Archimedes Russell. In 1867, White designed the original Onondaga Savings Bank (now the Gridley Building). White adapted this style to the Hall of Languages, the first building constructed on the campus of Syracuse University. White was engaged to design New York State armories in Syracuse, Dunkirk and Ballston Spa. He also designed Plymouth Congregational Church in Syracuse. White prepared designs for over 100 churches. While White designed many houses, his papers have been lost, therefore, the identity and attribution of most of them has been obscured. Accordingly, he is remembered mostly for his more monumental work. White's reputation remains to this day as one of the most distinguished architects to have been associated with Syracuse. White died in his home in 1892. His obituary referred to him as simply \\"the Venerable Architect\\".

Over years, the band would perform over 100 shows in the Eastern Canadian area, sharing the stage with notable acts including Propagandhi, Strike Anywhere, The Video Dead, Chixdiggit and Hostage Life, and would go on to record two full-length albums, their debut A Declaration of Intent, followed by The Infamous as well as a split 7\\" vinyl EP All These Lives and a NOFX tribute album, released on 7\\" vinyl, titled Don't Eat Meat. History =2004 - Band formation & recording / release of A Declaration of Intent= Soon after Phil Campeau and Franck Chevrier formed the band in 2004, the band quickly wrote and recorded their first album, A Declaration Of Intent with the help of The Sainte Catherines' Rich Bouthillier filling in on drums, and their guitarist Marc-Andre Beaudet behind the mixing console. Shortly after the independent release of A Declaration Of Intent, Rich Bouthillier's busy schedule with The Sainte Catherines made it clear he could not be Humanifesto's full-time drummer. Not long thereafter, former bandmate of Franck Chevrier's, Andrew McGrath was recruited on drums, and the band's longest-lasting line-up was established. =2006 - recording / release of All These Lives EP= The band's first EP consisted of the first three songs written with the band's new line up - All these lives, Yesterday's Headlines and Sitting Duck Hunt - and was recorded at the beginning of 2006. The title song All these Lives was later released as a single on the Make Trade Fair compilation album, released by Lower Left Records to raise awareness of alternatives to sweatshop labour. The two additional tracks Yesterday's Headlines and Sitting Duck Hunt were released on a split 7\\" vinyl with I Am The Cartographer, on Hip Kid Records in August 2007. =2006 - recording / release of Don't Eat Meat 7\\" EP= In the summer of 2006, the band returned into the studio to record a new EP, entitled Don't Eat Meat. This project was in fact a tribute to NOFX's Fuck The Kids EP, performing the music arrangements and vocal melodies from the NOFX disc, but replacing the original lyrics with Humanifesto-style left-wing political ones. After shelving the project for a year while working on other projects, Fat Mike of NOFX authorized Humanifesto to release the project on 7\\" vinyl. This disc was issued in spring 2008 by KOI Records in Texas. =2007-2010 - recording / release of The Infamous= The band's second full-length album was titled The Infamous (not to be mistaken with The Infamous studio album by Mobb Deep).http://www.punknews.org/review/9762/humanifesto-the-infamous The album was unique in its concept as every song title on the album including the album title itself, were an anagram of the band's name. Notable song titles included on this release were \\"Oh, Meat Is Fun!\\", \\"US Anthem of I\\", \\"Some Thai Fun\\", \\"Atheism of UN\\" and \\"South Famine\\". The original version of this album was written, recorded and mixed between 2007 and 2008 with the band's established three-piece line up (Phil Campeau, Franck Chevrier, Andrew McGrath) but due to growing discord between band members and friction with the studio where it had been recorded, the recording never made it to mastering and was eventually shelved and never released. This episode led to Andrew McGrath's departure from the band, and subsequent relocation to Malta in late 2009. It wasn't before a shuffle in line up, which saw Dan Audette join the band on lead guitar, and Justin Santora sit in on drums, that The Infamous was re-recorded and released on Koi Records in 2010. In May 2010, and in support of The Infamous the band toured Quebec and Ontario with bandmates Society's Ills, before drummer, Justin Santora, was forced to leave Montreal and return home to Chicago. =2010 - Elegy= The last official Humanifesto recording was a song called Elegy, the drum tracks for which were recorded by Andrew McGrath overseas in March 2010 at the Temple Studios in Malta, the same studio where Rammstein recorded platinum record, Sehnsucht. =Break-up= The last Humanifesto show was on June 12 of 2010, in Montreal at Cafe Chaos and featured Andrew McGrath back behind the drums. It was seen as a serendipitous reunion and highlighted an end to the discord which had permeated much of the period between 2007‚Äì2008. In January 2011, it was announced via the Humanifesto Facebook page that the band would be \\"moving on to new projects\\". The band has not recorded or performed since.

The settlement which flourished there was not fortified, and therefore does not qualify as an oppidum. However, what is known to date suggests that it was not only large (probably covering more than 400,000 square metres) but also a wealthy and powerful center for trade, culture, religion and political power between southern Bohemia and the Danube valley. Its inhabitants are likely to have been Boii, or belonged to a Celtic tribe that was under their direct influence. The site of the Celtic settlement on the southern slope of the Sandberg ridge, believed to have been densely populated in the 3rd century BC Location The Sandberg ridge (situated at ) separates the villages of Platt and Roseldorf in the district of Hollabrunn. It consists almost entirely of fertile L√∂√ü soil and has been subject to intense agricultural use for centuries. Its summit, although not high, offers a panoramic view far into the surrounding countryside, suggesting strategic considerations might have played a significant role in the selection of the location. While the inhabited area (as far as it has been delineated by surveys) was situated on the southern slope of the hill on the territory of Roseldorf, Platt has much better logistic connections and traditionally harbors the archeologists' base camp. Identification and primary characterization Although surface finds of Celtic coinsDembski G.: Die keltischen Fundm√ºnzen √ñsterreichs, NumZ 87/88; 37-73, 1972 (about 1,200 have found their way into the numismatics collection of the National Museum of Arts in Vienna) and other artifacts had been reported since the late 19th century, the true importance of the site began to be appreciated only by the 1990s. It was not before 1991 that the area was placed under legal protection as a cultural heritage site. From 1995 to 2000, geomagnetic surveys were carried outNeubauer W., L√∂cker K.: Arch√§ologisch-Geophysikalische Prospektion Roseldorf/N√ñ. Report by ZAMG ArcheoProspections, 2000 which covered 220,000 square metres and identified 450 distinct subterranean structures consistent with the remains of wooden houses, an enclosure in the south, and a cluster of three larger quadratic structures. Results from pilot prospections beyond this characterized area, as well as the history of surface finds and accounts from the local population, suggests that the settlement could have been at least twice as large. Excavations Excavation of the ditches surrounding one of the smaller sanctuaries (2007) Systematic excavations commenced in 2001, and initially probed only a very small (18 x 25 m) segment of what had been interpreted as a residential zone. The sunken foundations of three wooden buildings were confirmed. One was found to have been a barn, the remnants of which contained an appreciable amount of burnt grain which was identified as Einkorn wheat (Triticum boeoticum), Emmer (Triticon dicoccon) and Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum). A nearby pit contained an oven, and might have served as a bakery. Grape seeds tentatively suggest that the Sandberg people might have already grown and prepared wine. Pottery, bracelet glassware and fibulae were found in significant numbers, along with coins, a set of three dice carved from bone, and several pieces of Realgar, an arsenic sulfide mineral with uses in medicine and as an orange pigment. Most significantly, minting equipment offered proof for the suspected role of the settlement as a center for trade and commerce. From 2005 to 2007, the three quadratic structures (one measuring 25 x 25 m, the other two slightly smaller) were completely excavated, and confirmed to have been Celtic sanctuaries of a Western European type not yet found in Central Europe, with their design closely resembling the cult site at Gournay-sur-Aronde in northern France.Holzer, Veronika: \\"Roseldorf/Sandberg (√ñsterreich) ‚Äì Ein keltisches Heiligtum nach dem Modell von Gournay-sur- Aronde\\".

A large, irregular-shaped pit adjacent to one of the two smaller sanctuaries, impressively rich in finds, was opened for excavation in August 2007. Significance The excavations at the Sandberg site have probed only a few of the locations which the geomagnetic surveys had identified as containing interesting structures, and the archaeobotanical and other scientific follow-up work has only begun. What is known already indicates that the Sandberg city might have resembled La T√®ne culture settlements of a type and size known from France and Southern Germany, but so far not believed to have existed in Austria. The Museum for Prehistory in Asparn an der Zaya has constructed a life-size model of the large sanctuary.

He is best known as State Secretary in Stoltenberg's First and Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet (2000‚Äì2001 and 2009‚Äì2012) and county councillor in Troms County Municipality (2003‚Äì2006). He has also worked as a journalist in Dagbladet and Verdens Gang, and was the news editor in Nordlys. He has also been information or communications director in the Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine, Hurtigruten and Troms√∏ 2018.  Career  In his early career, Ingebrigtsen was a political adviser for the Labour Party parliamentary group from 1989 to 1991. In 1991 he had a short stint as a journalist in Dagbladet. He also served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from Troms during the term 1989-1993\\\\. In total he met during 9 days of parliamentary session. During Brundtland's Third Cabinet, from 1992 to 1996, Ingebrigtsen was a political adviser in the Ministry of Local Government and Work Affairs. In 1996 he was hired as a journalist in Verdens Gang. He went on to become information director in the Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine in 1998, and in 1999 he was the news editor in Nordlys. During Stoltenberg's First Cabinet, from 2000 to 2001, he was appointed as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Culture. He was then communications director for Hurtigruten from 2001 to 2003, before re-entering politics as county councillor in the county government of Troms County Municipality from 2003 to 2006. From 2007 to 2009 he worked as strategy and communications director of Troms√∏ 2018. He also chaired Troms√∏ Labour Party from 2006 to 2010, and the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra from 2009. In 2009 he was appointed to Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Care Services. He changed to the Ministry of Defence in 2010 and the Trade and Industry in September 2012.  Resignation from political positions  On 30 November 2012 he resigned his position as State Secretary after it was revealed that he in 2004 had a sexual affair with a fellow party member, 20 years his junior, who was 17 years old at the time the affair began. He also withdrew from the nomination process to the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election where he had been competing with Martin Henriksen for the top position on the Labour Party list in Troms.Geir Arne Kippernes, and others:Roger Ingebrigtsen innr√∏mmer seksuelt forhold til 17-√•ring VG, November 30, 2012 (in Norwegian) The nomination committee had nominated Henriksen for the first ballot spot, Tove Karoline Knutsen for the second and Ingebrigtsen for the third spot. The circumstance that the offended woman had first taken her revelation to Tonje Brenna, a party official who lives together with Henriksen, led to published speculations that the information had been deployed politically in favor of Henriksen's candidacy. Days after the story broke, a colleague of Ingebrigtsen stated that he had notified the Labour party about the affair one year before, but nothing had been done. On 4 December, yet another former youth politician came out and accused Ingebrigtsen of pressuring her into sexual relations. In response to these later accusations, the leader of the Labour party representatives in the Troms county parliament, Kristin R√∏ymo declared Ingebrigtsen persona non grata, saying that he was \\"not welcome\\" back into the party. On 6 December Roger Ingebrigtsen resigned from all posts locally, thereby effectively ending his political career altogether.

Plot While driving through New Mexico, the Henley family ‚Äì Jim, his wife Patty, their daughter Kate, son Matt, along with Matt's friend Ethan ‚Äì discover the whereabouts of Weaver, a ghost town, and decide to take a detour to it to take pictures. Stopping at a diner in the neighboring town of Two Wells, the family asks about Weaver but the patrons, all seeming dazed, claim not to have heard of the town, although a gas station attendant warns Jim to \\"stay on the pavement\\". The Henleys make their way to Weaver, where they find a wall with a mysterious symbol and a human-sized dried skin. They discover a videotape which shows previous visitors being taken by an unseen force, and then ending with a girl running from the unknown threat. Unnerved, the family try to leave but the SUV battery is dead and they are forced to spend the night in one of the abandoned buildings. The next morning, the family discovers their SUV missing, along with a flashlight and Jim's sweater. Deciding to split up, Kate, Patty, and Matt remain in the building while Jim and Ethan set out for the diner. The two discover a large expanse of glass in the middle of the desert, a plaque in the center revealing it to be a 1948 neutron bomb test site called \\"Ground Zero\\". Ethan walks just ahead of Jim over a ridge, and when Jim makes his way over the ridge, Ethan is nowhere to be seen. Jim glimpses a car graveyard in the distance. He rushes there, hoping to find Ethan but instead discovers his SUV parked with other cars in the same pattern as the symbol on the wall. Back in Weaver, Patty, away from the others to use the bathroom, senses something watching her, then falls through rotten boards into a mine shaft. She hears growling sounds from below, and climbs further up, discovering many discarded items including her husband's sweater. Matt and Kate search for their mother and Matt climbs down the mine to help her. The source of the growling rushes in the dark toward Patty and Matt. Patty fires a gun toward the sound which stops, although no body is discovered and it is uncertain if it was even harmed. In the vehicle graveyard, as Jim salvages a battery for his SUV from another vehicle, he is stalked by one or more unseen creatures. He manages to evade them and successfully puts a replacement battery in, driving back to Weaver. He rescues his family, only for a seemingly driverless school bus and truck to block their way, forcing Jim to drive them both through a clapboard outbuilding to escape. They stop to use a telephone at the diner, but it is useless. Jim and Matt spot a dust cloud moving in their direction from the vicinity of Weaver. Jim visits Sheriff Richards in the nearby town of Two Wells, telling him about Ethan's disappearance, the town of Weaver, where the townspeople vanished without a trace, and the unseen beings attacking them. Richards denies all knowledge of the town, but while he is away, Jim is pulled aside by an old inmate named Lester who says the town does exist and the unseen force is possibly the mutated, deformed offspring of the townspeople who refused evacuation before the bomb was dropped or the spirits of Indians interred in a burial ground under the town or even Area 51, although he doesn't believe aliens are not necessarily the explanation for the unseen forces in Weaver. It's unclear if any of this is true or simply the ramblings of a madman. Kate finds the girl from the video alive and working at the local Dairy Queen. When she returns with the rest of the family, the girl is nowhere to be seen and she told that she's \\"gone off-shift.\\" The sheriff agrees to search for Ethan the next day. The family stays in a motel, but when Kate senses one of the beings watching them from the window, the family decides to leave at once. Meanwhile, Sheriff Richards takes the inmate Lester to the desert, lights a fire, and leaves him for \\"the beings\\". As the Henleys attempt to flee, they are stopped by Sheriff Richards who tells them that he found Ethan. The four of them pick up Ethan from the Sheriff's, Jim noticing Lester's empty cell. As the five of them drive off, Ethan tells them he fell and does not remember anything else, while Matt questions the events. As Jim is distracted, the car hits an unseen creature, causing the SUV to flip over. The viewpoint of one of the unseen creatures makes its way to the wrecked car, and the Henleys are heard screaming. Six months later, Jim is now the gas-station attendant, while Patty works as a waitress in the diner, all of them in the same dazed state as the other members of the town of Two Wells. After Kate has served Sheriff Richards at the diner, the film ends with Kate feeding one of the crows as several bikers turn up at the diner, very possibly to begin the cycle all over again.

The film, which was written and directed by Boaz Yakin, debuted in 2008. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States on July 17, 2009. It was released on DVD in the United States on January 10, 2010. Plot In 1940s Nazi Germany, a young Jewish woman in a Nazi concentration camp saves her own life by seducing the young doctor who performs medical experiments on prisoners. Decades later in the year 1993, that same woman (Jacqueline Bisset) is living in New York City and married with two grown sons. The two siblings have developed differently under a mother with a long history of erratic behavior. The neurotic younger son (Lukas Haas) can't cope at all, for he still lives at home with his mother and father and is locked in a compulsive, co-dependent relationship with the mother. The older son (Josh Lucas) copes too well. The eldest son is 40 years old, he hides out from the world in erotic escapades with various women, and has a job at a fraudulent modeling agency and acting agency scamming the young and hopeful. He is good at them both... too good but he grows increasingly frightened as his sexual prowess and intellectual diatribes no longer make him feel better.Film details Sundance Film Festival Production The film was self-financed by its director Boaz Yakin. Yakin explained \\"This movie came out of a meeting with a studio...What they wanted to do and what I wanted to do were so far apart, I didn't feel I could continue. So I wrote this for a low-budget production. I ended up financing it with my life savings. No one else chipped in a cent. It's not the kind of thing I can afford to do often. But for this one time, I got to express what I wanted to in a way I found interesting. I feel I got to explore and try some things.\\"Interview: Boaz Yakin, Director of Death in Love Huffington Post. 16 July 2009 Yakin also described the role that the Holocaust plays in the film \\"For me, the Holocaust part and what it represents is specific. I saw it as a symbol for a certain kind of pain and violence that people keep inside and end up passing on from generation to generation. I saw it as more about love and its destructive power. The Holocaust is a metaphor for this recurring cycle of pain.\\" Jacqueline Bisset, who plays the mother, says: \\"Boaz asked me to play the role of the mother in the film as if she were a wild animal, and in other scenes to play her as moonstruck. This combination is one of the things about the film that captivated me.\\"Klein, Uri. \\"Truffaut preferred her to Audrey Hepburn\\" , Haaretz.com It was filmed in 25 days in New York City.Jacqueline Bisset, Actress with Legendary Film Pedigree, Stars in Death in Love Filmed, Set & Opening in NYC The Huffington Post. 23 July 2009 Release The film first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008.

He designed more than 250 buildings, of which more than 120 were built and survive. He was influenced by, and contributed to, the Arts and Crafts movement in architecture. Ward's work is in varying styles, but the houses most typically include crafts-like details such as decorative cutouts in shutters. His designs almost always include garages, gateways, and other small structures like gazebos. Syracuse architect Ward was born in Chicago. His decision to live and work in Syracuse was influenced by the presence of Gustav Stickley in Syracuse, who promoted the \\"Craftsman\\"-style of architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts in his magazine, The Craftsman. Gustav Stickley's own home in Syracuse is regarded as having the first Craftsman style residential interior dating to 1902 in the United States. Ward's wife's family was also in the Syracuse area. Ward worked with Horatio Nelson White in Syracuse for a short time. Ward's homes in Syracuse are concentrated in several neighborhoods which were upscale at the time of their development: Strathmore, Scottholm, Berkeley Park, and Sedgwick Farms. He designed other buildings in Syracuse, too, and outside Syracuse he designed buildings including Mohegan Manor in Baldwinsville, New York, originally built for the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and now used as a restaurant, and the Charles Estabrook Mansion.About Mohegan Manor, Mohegan Manor website, accessed January 23, 2010 Master craftsmen His work was part of an international movement, which used quality materials and \\"considered workmanship both an art and a craft.\\" Ward discovered two master craftsmen early in his career; Henry Keck, who designed stained glass windows, and Henry Mercer, who made Moravian handcrafted tiles in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Ward used the tiles to decorate the face of wood-burning fireplaces. Personal life Ward Wellington Ward - Architect - Moyerdale - Syracuse Post-Standard, December 16, 1911 He was married to Maude Moyer who was the daughter of local carriage and automobile manufacturer, Harvey A. Moyer and Rosamond Wilcox. She was raised in Liverpool, New York. The two met while she was attending the Boston Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and he was attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ward remodeled a farmhouse for his father-in-law, Harvey A. Moyer on Old Liverpool Road called Moyerdale and designed plans for a factory for the Moyer company on Wolf Street that is still in existence. In 1916, Ward built a home on a lot overlooking Onondaga Lake and named it LeMoyne Manor. The couple had one daughter, Peggy Ward Forgan, who relocated to Enumclaw, Washington after marriage to Peter Paul Forgan. He died in 1932 and Maude Moyer Ward later sold the house and moved to a house on her parent's Moyerdale property. She died in 1961. The Ward home was later brought out and changed into a restaurant and motel, but still resembles the original structure. Sadly, on August 29, 2018, LeMoyne Manor was demolished by the current owners of the property. Memorials Upon his death in 1932, Ward's remains were buried in the Moyer family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery, Grant Boulevard, Syracuse, in a lot unmarked by a stone. A headstone was placed on Ward's grave in a public ceremony on October 20, 2002, by members of the Arts and Crafts Society of Central New York.

He was awarded the Musgrave Medal by the Jamaican government in 1993 in recognition of his services to music.Larkin, Colin: The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, 1998. . Biography Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser started to play the clarinet at the age of 12. Around this time he met Ronald \\"Nambo\\" Robinson and Junior \\"Chico\\" Chin at a youthclub in Jones Town and the three boys would eventually form a brass section. Fraser took up saxophone at the age of 15. The trio became the foremost horn section in Jamaica in the 1980s. In 1977 he joined Lloyd Parks' We The People Band, backing Dennis Brown on several of his recordings for Joe Gibbs. Fraser's first album, 1978's Black Horn Man, was produced by Gibbs. This was followed in 1979 by Pure Horns and Double Dynamite, and in 1980 by Revolutionary Sounds for producer Donovan Germain. Fraser provided horns for Sly & Robbie in the 1980s, both on record and on tour. Fraser appeared at the 1981 Reggae Sunsplash, performing an instrumental version of the recently deceased Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\", which led to the 1984 album Pumping Air on Island Records' Mango label. Fraser went on to record two albums of Marley covers, Dean Plays Bob and Dean Plays Bob volume II. The digital era of reggae, defined by the use of computers and drum machines to create the backing track, did not affect his output since acoustic instruments such as the saxophone were still in demand. Fraser has released several more albums since and he is recognized as one of Jamaica's top musicians. He toured extensively with Luciano from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s,Van Pelt, Carter.

The department provides sporting coverage through a number of platforms including RT√â Radio, RT√â Television, RT√â.ie, RT√â Player Sport and RT√â Mobile. RT√â holds the television and radio broadcasting rights in the Republic of Ireland to several sports, broadcasting the sport live or alongside flagship analysis programmes such as The Sunday Game, Thank GAA It's Friday, Soccer Republic and RT√â Racing on RT√â Television, and Game On, Saturday Sport, and Sunday Sport on RT√â Radio. Traditionally RT√â Sport faced competition from British-based broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV which have always been present in Ireland; however, these broadcasters were primarily concerned with the British public and market. Domestically, RT√â had no competition until the late 1990s due to lack of competition in the Irish market. In latter years however a growth of variety in the Irish market opened competition between other broadcasters most notably with TG4 and Setanta Sports but also TV3. RT√â Sport is also in competition with other European broadcasters such as Eurosport, ESPN, Sky Sports, BBC Sport and ITV Sport. Despite competition in sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup final which is also available on the BBC and ITV, RT√â Sport remains Ireland's premier and most popular sports broadcaster. Ryle Nugent is the current head of RT√â Sport having been appointed in 2010. Television broadcasts On television RT√â Two is the home of live sporting action, broadcasting the majority of RT√â's sports content. Sport may also be broadcast on RT√â One, but this is mainly due to scheduling issues. =Football= The RT√â soccer panel at Croke Park RT√â Sport currently holds the rights to a large portfolio of football tournaments including: * FIFA World Cup finals * Republic of Ireland qualification matches for both World Cup finals and Euro finals * UEFA Champions League (women's (final only, from 2019‚Äì20) and men's) * FIFA Club World Cup * FAI League of Ireland * FAI Cup * FAI Women's Cup Final * UEFA Super Cup The Republic of Ireland matches were shown live on the channel for Euro 2004, the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, for all of which, they failed to qualify. Sky Sports got exclusive rights to Irish matches in the early 2000s and there were fears that National team matches couldn't be seen by fans so the government stepped in and now all Irish home and away qualifying matches have to be shown on Irish free to air TV, meaning either RT√â, TV3 or TG4, and have remained on RT√â as well as Sky Sports. Irish Home friendlies were exclusive to Sky from 2000 and from 2014 on Premier Sports?Setanta Ireland with highlights broadcast on either RT√â or TV3. RT√â Sport broadcasts a lot of association football tournaments. It showed 64 live games during the 2010 World Cup and that was 200 hours of programming. These were the team of association football pundits that RT√â Sport announced ahead of the 2010 World Cup. Apart from Ossie Ardiles, Dietmar Hamann and Kevin Kilbane, both made their debuts, and Liam Brady, who left his post assisting Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni, the rest were all regulars on RT√â Sport's association football programming. The 2010 FIFA World Cup was the ninth for both Bill O'Herlihy and George Hamilton. For the 2014 World Cup, the RT√â team was announced on 5 May 2014. The coverage was presented by Bill O'Herlihy, Darragh Maloney and Tony O'Donoghue. The pundits for the tournament were RT√â regulars John Giles, Liam Brady, Eamon Dunphy, Kenny Cunningham, Richie Sadlier and Ronnie Whelan. Guest pundits joining the coverage included Didi Hamann, Ossie Ardiles, Neil Lennon and Brad Friedel. Play-by-play came from George Hamilton, John Kenny, Stephen Alkin and Adrian Eames while colour commentators included Ray Houghton, Trevor Steven, Jim Beglin and Brian Kerr. This was Bill O'Herlihy's final World Cup for RT√â and his 11th World Cup for the broadcaster. Hamann and Ardiles both worked for RT√â at the last World Cup in 2010 while Lennon and Friedel both working for the BBC at the World Cup and Jim Beglin rejoined RT√â after leaving ITV in 2013. RT√â cover at least one match per week from the FAI League, these matches are usually hosted by Peter Collins or Tony O'Donohue with guests from Irish football such as Richie Sadlier, Kenny Cunningham, Roddy Collins. Commentary comes from Stephen Alkin, Adrian Eames, John Kenny, Ger Canning or George Hamilton. The Premiership was RT√â's flagship Premier League programme until 2008, when Premier Soccer Saturday was launched. The Premiership was shown on Saturday nights at 7.30pm. There were sometimes Premiership Specials which would normally be shown on a Sunday evening at 8.00pm or on a Monday night. These programmes are hosted usually by Darragh Maloney or Peter Collins with analysis mainly by Kenny Cunningham, Johnny Giles, Ronnie Whelan, Richie Sadler, Liam Brady, Trevor Steven, Graeme Souness or Matt Holland. Premier Soccer Saturday was dropped from RT√â's schedules from the 2013/14 season. Presenters (usually one per game): Darragh Maloney, Peter Collins Panels (usually two, three, or four per game): John Giles, Eamon Dunphy, Liam Brady, Graeme Souness, Ronnie Whelan, Richie Sadlier, Denis Irwin, Ossie Ardiles, Dietmar Hamann, Kevin Kilbane, Brad Friedel, Paul Clement, Neil Lennon, Michael O'Neill Commentators (usually two per game): George Hamilton, Ray Houghton, Gabriel Egan, Trevor Steven, Stephen Alkin, Damien Richardson, Adrian Eames, Matt Holland, Brian Kerr Former RT√â Sport personnel: Bill O'Herlihy, Con Murphy, Jimmy Magee, Graeme Souness The RT√â Sport football division has achieved cult status due to its unintentional humour. The main team of Bill O'Herlihy, Johnny Giles, Eamon Dunphy and Liam Brady is usually used for Irish matches and Champions League matches, with a usual big build up and long analysis afterwards which gain huge ratings. =Gaelic games= In 1926, RT√â broadcast the first field game in Europe. The GAA match was live on the radio, 2RN, RT√â's predecessor. RT√â Sport is probably the second most significant of the categories since often hundreds of thousands would watch The Sunday Game, with probably more than a million watching on the day of the All-Ireland Final. RT√â GAA coverage is the cornerstone of their sports coverage. RT√â previously held the exclusive rights for television and radio in the Republic for the entirety of the Championship compromising of interprovincial games, All Ireland Qualifying games and the All Ireland Championship series. The games were also available in Northern Ireland who although able to see Ulster games on BBC Northern Ireland, did not receive the breadth of coverage as available on RT√â. In 2008, however, TV3 won the rights to show 10 Championship games marking an end to RT√â's exclusivity. RT√â though remain the sole broadcaster on radio and retained the All Ireland series exclusively with 40 championship games available on television. Games are also available online at RT√â.i.e. RT√â also show highlights of club and National League games on their Sunday Sport banner through the winter and spring. In 2011 under a new deal BBC NI show all Ulster Championship matches mostly Live and some deferred shown in full, as well as live coverage of the All Ireland Championship if an Ulster team is playing. Under the 2011 deal TV3 showed 11 matches including both All Ireland minor finals with coverage on TV3 in English and sister channel 3e in Irish. In 2014 a new deal was announced with TV3 losing their coverage to Sky Sports, RT√â keep their share of the matches but Sky have 14 exclusive matches and other matches such as the All Ireland Semi Finals and Finals which are shared between RT√â and Sky. Under this deal BBC NI also get to show matches as long as RT√â also cover them. The All-Ireland Football Final traditionally attracts high ratings with it too attracting high ratings in previous years.http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2006/09/24/story17395.asp Coverage The Apres Match comedy series features after many of RT√â Sport's soccer matches. RT√â's championship games are broadcast through their The Sunday Game banner; for more information on their coverage see there. Among other sports, RT√â broadcasts the following on television (usually on RT√â Two): * The Sunday Game ‚Äì coverage of All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship games (May ‚Äì September) * League of Ireland Live ‚Äì coverage of League of Ireland matches * Against the Head ‚Äì review and discussion of rugby union games * RT√â Racing ‚Äì coverage of major Irish racing festivals * Pro Box Live ‚Äì coverage of professional boxing cards * Soccer Republic - highlights of League of Ireland on Monday nights Sports news bulletins are broadcast hourly on RT√â 2fm under the title RT√â Sport on 2fm. =Rugby union= RT√â's coverage of rugby remains popular, underlined by the fact that Ireland's Grand Slam decider versus Wales was the overall top rated programme of 2009 with a 68% share of the total audience watching television with 866,000 viewers.. RT√â's topprogrammes. The game was also shown on the widely available BBC One, but still ranks above other programmes exclusive to RT√â. In 2010 RT√â bought the rights for Celtic League rugby with TG4, BBC Northern Ireland and BBC Alba. In 2014 Sky Sports signed a non- exclusive deal to cover the Pro 12, under the new contract TG4 continue to show the tournament free to air for Ireland, BBC Wales and S4C continue to cover the tournament in Wales, BBC Scotland return to cover the tournament alongside BBC Alba and BBC Northern Ireland cover all Ulster Matches not being Broadcast by Sky. Under this new deal RT√â dropped the Pro12 Rugby but continue to show every game in the 6 Nations and all Ireland Autumn Internationals. RT√â showed the Heineken Cup for many years and after the coverage was snapped up by Sky Sports in 2004, RT√â still showed Live coverage until 2007 and then highlights afterwards but in 2011 TG4 took their highlights coverage of the Heineken Cup, Amlin Cup to add to their Pro 12 coverage and Rugby World Cup highlights. As of 2014 RT√â is the Home of International Rugby holding rights to the 6 Nations and Autumn Internationals signing a deal with Sky Sports to cover Ireland Autumn Internationals. The Rugby World Cup returned to RT√â in 2011 after an 8-year gap as the 2007 tournament was on TV3 Ireland. Their coverage was the same as TV3 in the sense they had only 13 live matches with every Irish match Live and every match from the quarter-final onwards with Setanta holding every Live match and TG4 had lucrative daytime deferred rights meaning they can show a full re run of a match in the afternoon. RT√â also broadcast highlights in primetime between 7pm and 10pm on RT√â Two. Their Live coverage was presented by Tom McGurk with analysis by Conor O'Shea, Brent Pope and George Hook. Highlights were presented by Daire O'Brien who hosts their Pro 12 coverage with analysis from Victor Costello, Shane Horgan, Frankie Shehan, Leinster coach Joe Schmidt and new signing from ESPN, Ben Kay who won the World Cup in 2003 with England. RT√â Commentary team consists of Hugh Cahill, Ryle Nugent, Donal Lenihan, Tony Ward, Ralph Keyes and Kurt McQuilkin. George Hamilton was supposed to be part of commentary but he had a heart attack so Darragh Maloney is instead commentating. Any highlights that did not have an RT√â voiceover instead featured the World Feed, one example was in the highlights show with an England match using Sky Sports Commentators who worked for ITV in 2007, Miles Harrison and Stuart Barnes. RT√â lost the rights to TV3 for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England. After they lost the rights to coverage of the Six Nations to TV3, RTE showed live Women's and U20's matches in 2018. Coverage was usually presented by Daire O'Brien, with analysis by the likes of Bernard Jackman and James Downey, with commentary from the normal team of Hugh Cahill, Donal Lenihan and more. =Golf= RT√â holds exclusive Irish rights to live coverage of the only professional golf tournament to take place in Ireland, The Irish Open, covering every day's play Live. In 2011 they had play everyday on RT√â One and Highlights on RT√â Two late at night. Sky Sports also show all four days of the Irish Open live. RT√â Radio also cover Saturday and Sunday's action live on Saturday and Sunday Sport. =Other sports= RT√â also screen a lot of horse racing, including the Galway Races and Punchestown they have their own coverage for Irish Racing with Treacy Piggott but they take Channel 4 coverage when covering the Grand National, The Derby and the Cheltenham Festival. Sport is shown on RT√â News. A programme for the Beijing Olympics was shown on RT√â Two before the games, called Ireland's Olympians. RT√â broadcast most of Ireland's candidates for the gold medal during the Olympiad, as well as the finals in which no Irish took part. From the 1970s through to 1997, RT√â's flagship television sports programme was Sports Stadium, which provided live football and racing coverage on Saturday afternoons along with coverage of other sports and classified football results, in a similar manner to the BBC's Grandstand or ITV's World of Sport. The programme was badly hit by the loss of live rights to Saturday afternoon Football League Division One matches after the beginning of the Premier League in 1992, and ended as part of RT√â's revamp of Network 2 into N2 in 1997, being replaced for one year by Saturday Sports Live (which only concentrated on one single football or rugby game. Since 1998 RT√â has not covered live sports on Saturday on a weekly basis on television, although major events such as the Six Nations Championship are still shown live. For many years, RT√â was the official broadcaster in Ireland of Formula One with its coverage presented by Peter Collins.  Radio Sport  RT√â's regular radio sports programming (usually on RT√â Radio 1) comprises:  Saturday Sport ‚Äì coverage of Premier League and other Saturday sports  Sunday Sport ‚Äì coverage of GAA and other Sunday sports Sports news bulletins are broadcast hourly on RT√â 2fm under the title RT√â Sport on 2fm. RT√â Sport also broadcasts an hour long sports programme Game On from 7pm Monday ‚Äì Friday on 2fm. Controversies When the 2012 RT√â Sports Person of the Year award was being given to boxer Katie Taylor viewers were instead shown an advertisement for the cosmetics and beauty company L'Or√©al, causing uproar.

It is proposed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation as one of five new stations that would be built for the line (along with , , Newington, and West Hartford). The three stations are not currently funded. The service began operation on June 16, 2018. Enfield and the other infill stations are planned to be complete by 2022. History =Amtrak= Thompsonville station on a 1909 postcard The Hartford and New Haven Railroad (H&NH;) opened from Hartford to Springfield in December 1844. Thompsonville station, located on the east side of the tracks just north of Main Street, opened with the line. It was replaced by a two-story brick station around 1870, with a wooden addition for the Railway Express Agency built later on the north end of the structure. In 1946, the second story - then rented out as apartments - and the wooden addition were removed. The modified station building was used until 1971, when Penn Central closed it shortly before Amtrak took over passenger service. Thompsonville remained a stop - daily ridership exceeded 40 on the Connecticut Yankee in 1974 - but passengers waited on the bare platform. Amtrak bought the line in 1976; after frequent vandalism and a January 26, 1980 fire, they proposed to remove the boarded-up century-old building. Although it was kept for several more years for the possibility of restoration and inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, the station and the adjacent freight house were demolished in early 1983. In 1980, Amtrak constructed several small shelters at Thompsonville station. It was part of a $12 million effort to improve the line, which included opening the North Haven station and buying twelve Budd SPV-2000 railcars to increase frequencies on the Connecticut Valley Service. The station was renamed as Enfield starting with the February 1981 schedule. Service to Enfield and North Haven ended on October 28, 1986 due to low ridership; Enfield averaged five daily passengers spread between eight trains. Compare to April 1986 timetable The shelters were subsequently removed, but the crumbling platform is extant. =Hartford Line= Former Thompsonville station platform and site of the future Enfield station photographed in 2014 In 2004, the Recommended Action of the New Haven Hartford Springfield Commuter Rail Implementation Study included the construction of a new Enfield station at Main Street. A preliminary design located parking lots on Main Street with a smaller lot east of the tracks. The station is proposed to be built on Main Street at North River Street in Thompsonville, near the downtown area. Access from I-91 will be possible via CT-220. The station will consist of two 180-foot high-level platforms, each with a 100-foot shelter, connected by an elevated pedestrian bridge. A small parking lot will be built on the west side of the tracks, with a larger lot shared with the Bigelow Commons development on the east side. The station is estimated to cost $6‚Äì9.5 million. In February 2017, the state announced an additional $50 million in funds, including money to complete design of Enfield station. Design will be completed by 2020. The state aims to construct all infill stations on the line by 2022. In April 2019, the town proposed to fund construction of an interim station - a single side platform on the west side of the single track. That proposal would allow service to Enfield to begin while the state searches for funding for full double-tracking and a permanent station. The town set aside $670,000 of the estimated $2.5 million cost in October 2019.

Caption from Popular Mechanics magazine 1910 The Cl√©ment-Bayard No.1, Bayard-Cl√©ment was a French military semi-rigid airship of 1908 developed by Astra Cl√©ment-Bayard, which was founded by industrial entrepreneur Adolphe Cl√©ment-Bayard, in response to a French Army decision to experiment with airship operations. Soci√©t√© Astra was contracted to build the envelope, while Cl√©ment-Bayard built the gondola and engines itself. The envelope's distinctive design featured four large lobes at the aft end, intended to provide directional stability. Testing commenced on 29 October with Henry Kapferer at the controls. By the end of the year, the airship had made nearly thirty flights, including long-range cross-country sorties of up to , breaking the national aerial endurance and speed records. In 1909 the airship was offered for sale to the French government, with an asking price of FF 500,000. However, this was considered too expensive, and the offer was declined. Later that year, Tsar Nicholas II decided to buy it for the Russian army. On 23 August, it was demonstrated to a Russian military delegation in Paris where it was piloted by Louis Capazza firstly to a record altitude of 1,200 m (4,000 ft) and then hours later to a new record of 1,550 m (5,080 ft). Upon landing, however, Capazza cut power to the engines before the ground handlers had full control of the craft. A gust of wind carried it into a grove of trees, lacerating the envelope and resulting in it sinking into the River Seine, but it was salvaged and repaired, and went on to serve with the Russian Army under the name Berkut (\\"Eagle\\").

The station has been funded for design but not yet construction, and is planned to open in 2020. The first North Haven station opened on Broadway in 1838 on the Hartford and New Haven Railroad. One of its replacements, built in 1867 and still standing, was served until around 1971 by the New Haven Railroad and Penn Central. Amtrak operated a station at the modern site from 1980 to 1986. History =Previous stations= The 1867-built North Haven station building in 2015 The Hartford and New Haven Railroad (H&NH;) opened from New Haven to Meriden in December 1838. A room in a private home on Broadway just east of the tracks served as North Haven station from then until around 1850, when a dedicated station was built nearby. The station, also used as the post office and a general store, burned on March 31, 1865. A nearby store appears to have been used as the station for the next two years. The H&NH; built a new brick station on the west side of the tracks in 1867. A wooden freight house was constructed nearby later in the century. The 1867 station was in use for just over a century; it was still served by several New Haven Railroad trains in the early 1960s, but was no longer a stop when Amtrak took over service on the line from Penn Central on May 1, 1971. The station and freight house are still extant, although the four chimneys and the canopy have been removed from the station. On October 26, 1980, the state opened a new North Haven station off Devine Street near the Route 40 Connector, to the south of the former station. Compare to August 1980 timetable The new station had two small wooden platforms and a 100-car parking lot. It was part of a $12 million effort to improve the line, which included buying twelve Budd SPV-2000 railcars to increase frequencies. The station was served by Amtrak's Connecticut Valley Service until October 26, 1986, when it and Enfield were abandoned due to low ridership. Compare to April 1986 timetable The station platforms were removed after closure, but the parking lot was repurposed as a park-and-ride lot for auto commuters. =Hartford Line station= The parking lot from the 1980s station, now used as a park-and-ride lot, will be reused for the new station In 2004, the Recommended Action of the New Haven Hartford Springfield Commuter Rail Implementation Study included the construction of a new North Haven/Hamden station as part of the Hartford Line (then just the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield Commuter Rail Line.) Such a station was estimated to cost between $6 million and $9.5 million. The station is proposed to be located off Devine Street in North Haven, adjacent to the intersection of State Street (US 5) and CT-40. Direct access from I-91 will be possible via Route 40, while commuters coming from the Wilbur Cross Parkway (which is intended for traffic bypassing New Haven) will have to use surface streets from the nearest exits. A preliminary design in 2006 located the station platforms between Devine Street and Route 40. A new parking lot west of Route 5 would have been shared between station and park-and-ride uses, with the existing park-and-ride lot dedicated for station parking. Revised plans released in 2012 replaced the new western parking lot with a lot east of the tracks to prevent riders from having to cross busy Route 5 on foot. The station will consist of two 180-foot high-level platforms, each with a 100-foot shelter, connected by an elevated pedestrian bridge. A larger parking lot would be built on the east side of the tracks to supplement the existing park-and-ride lot. On January 12, 2015, the state announced that $5.75 million in funding would be made available for environmental mitigation and design at ten Hartford Line and New Haven Line stations, including North Haven as well as , West Hartford and Newington. The funding also includes a location study for a future station separate from North Haven. In December 2015, funding for the Hartford Line was secured by the state, and the service launched on June 16, 2018. , design is half complete, with the intention to begin the 18-month construction phase in mid-2018. The state aims to complete all infill stations on the line by 2022. In February 2017, the state announced an additional $50 million in funds, including money to complete design of North Haven station.

Seifzadeh was a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Tehran, before he was forced to resign from his full-time academic position, due to his opposition to fundamentalism and belief in human dignity-rights, democratic process, the sanctity of human individuality Ilet's call anarchism (not at all chaotic, but the capacity not to need but favor values, such as) moral cosmopolitan perspectives. 22 of his written books received permission to be published and be used as textbook in various universities in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Six other books he wrote were recognized as politically \\"inappropriate\\", hence failed to receive permit for publish. He has also written 235 English and Persian academic papers, published in different academic journals. A few dozens of these articles were presented in seminars, conferences and symposiums around the world. Having been under increasing pressure by fundamentalists, due to his criticism of fundamentalism, he was forced to resign from his academic job from University of Tehran first and then from Islamic Azad University. As a result, he opted to emigrate to the United States. Unlike Iran, he was offered an adjunct position to teach at Montgomery College-Rockville, Maryland (2012-2018). In February 2018, he received an offer to teach at New York State University (SUNY)-Geneseo from Fall 2018. Hence, he moved to Rochester to start his teaching there. ŸêDespite the fact that SUNY was a very good educational place to teach, Sifzadeh had to return to Maryland once again. Hossein Seifzadeh is the younger brother of Mohammad Seifzadeh, yet differentiating in their approaches to politics and human rights. Mohammad Seifzadeh is a well-known Iranian lawyer, defending human rights' activists. Due to this, he had to serve many years of his life as political inmate. Both involved proactively in public sphere of civil life, to curb the incursion of human rights by either government or other oligarchs in society. Notwithstanding this proactive approach in expediting democratization in Iran, due to the ideational and situational differences, Hossein Seifzadeh avoids being involved with activists or even political parties. Instead, as a professor of Politics in University of Tehran and as an adjunct professor in the U.S., he favors developental approach and education to empower citizens and alert them to their human rights in one hand and the ways to protect it, in the other. Of course, thanks to both open political system (not only regime) and the independence and freedom of public sphere (academics, the Bar, and media) in liberal America, the situation is more in favor of developmental approach in the U.S. than in fundamentalist Iran, with the subordinated public sphere and restricted civil society.

Indianola Academy comprises an elementary school, a middle school, and a college preparatory high school. Indianola Academy is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit institution. It originated as a segregation academy. As of 2012 most white teenagers in Indianola attend Indianola Academy instead of the public high schools.Carr, Sarah. \\"In Southern Towns, 'Segregation Academies' Are Still Going Strong.\\" The Atlantic. December 13, 2012. Retrieved on March 29, 2013. History Indianola Academy in 1974 =Racial segregation= In the post Brown v. Board of Education era, white Americans in the Indianola area planned to establish a segregation academy. See: p. 178 Planning for the school began in 1964 with funding from the White Citizens Council. Classes started in 1965 with four sections in grades 1 and 2, with a total of 70 students. For the 1966-1967 and the 1967-1968 school years, classes were held at the First Baptist Church. In the fall of 1967 the school had nine grades, with a total of 241 students. The school conducted the 1968-1969 school year in a new building. During that year it served grades 1-10 and had 280 students.\\"Handbook 2010-2011.\\" ( ) Indianola Academy. 2/65. Retrieved on March 2, 2011. In April 1969 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the desegregation plan adopted by the Indianola Municipal Separate School District was constitutionally defective. Isabel Lee, then the sole African-American on the Indianola School District board, recalled that no white students showed up at Gentry High School on the following Monday. Once the U.S. v. Indianola Municipal School District court case ruling occurred on a Friday, the white townspeople almost immediately prepared to send their children to Indianola Academy, with classes beginning on a Monday. The school was not directly operated by a white citizens' council. J. Todd Moye, author of Let the People Decide, said that the school's \\"link to council ideology was direct.\\" Moye said \\"Indianola Academy's relatively quick organization and construction could only have been the result of massive organization on the part of white segregationists.\\"Moye, p. 179. Most of the white students enrolled at the Indianola Academy for the 1970 Winter semester, which caused the Academy's enrollment to grow \\"exponentially overnight.\\" Because the school did not yet have a single facility which could hold all of the White students, it opened satellite campuses to hold extra students. One was held at a Baptist church. Funerals held on weekdays sometimes interrupted the study halls at the church campus. The curriculum was mostly college preparatory, but \\"some adjustments were made to accommodate students who aren't going to college.\\" At the beginning of the 1969-1970 school year the school had about 600 students in grades 1-12. The school accepted about 900 students after the end of the first semester, giving the school a total of 1,500 students. In the 1970-1971 school year the elementary classes continued to be held at the area Baptist and Methodist churches, while the students in grades 7-12 moved to the Educational Plant at U.S. Highway 82 East. In 1970, about 200 white students left Indianola academy, but did not enroll in racially integrated public schools. In 1983, the school enrolled its first black student. In the same year, the school established a scholarship program for minority students. An NAACP representative claimed that the school had paid the family of the black student to enroll to avoid losing its tax exempt status. In 1990 the school system in Indianola was still essentially segregated, with most African- American students attending public schools and most white students attending the Indianola Academy. =Drug testing= In 1989 the Indianola Academy made national news with a plan to make drug testing mandatory for all students and employees of the school. Under the plan adopted by the school a positive result would mean a mandatory retest after 100 days. Further positive results would require notification of parents and exclusion of students from extracurricular activities. Students who refuse to take the test would be dismissed. Although the United States Supreme Court has ruled that mandatory testing of teachers and administrators in public schools is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, schools such as the Indianola Academy are exempt from scrutiny because they are privately run. At the time the plan was adopted it was most stringent school drug testing program in the United States. Joyce McCray, executive director of the Council for American Private Education, said of the plan that she had \\"never heard of anything like it. It's an unusual and unique program. It's also a little bewildering and sad. That doesn't sound like education.\\" Administration the headmaster, high school principal, and elementary principal are Sammy Henderson, Charles D. Mason, and Katherine B. Gibbs, respectively. Accreditation Indianola Academy is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Mississippi Association of Independent Schools, and the Southern Association of Independent Schools. Demographics For the 2009-2010 school year, according to the Private School Universe Survey, the school had 434 white students and 2 black students. Sammy Henderson, the headmaster, said in 2012 that for the 2012-2013 school year the school had 9 black students and that \\"we also have Hispanic, Indian, and Oriental students.\\" As of 2012, of the approximately 10,000 residents of Indianola, Mississippi, fewer than twenty percent of them were white. Admissions According to the student handbook, a prospective student should be among the top 30% of the takers of a student achievement test in order to gain admission to the school.\\"Handbook 2012-2013.\\" ( ) Indianola Academy. p. 26. Retrieved on March 29, 2013. \\"The applicant should have achievement test scores which are in the thirtieth percentile or above.\\" A participant of the Sunflower County Freedom Project who had a younger brother who considered applying to the school stated in an article in The Atlantic that, as paraphrased by article author Sarah Carr, \\"Applicants have to be top students and submit multiple letters of recommendation\\". Tuition and scholarships As of 2012 tuition ranges from $3,795 to $5,080 per year depending on the grade level. This includes money for books and other fees. Sammy Henderson, the headmaster, said that the school has annual budgets for minority scholarship and uses word-of- mouth and newspaper advertisements to spread awareness of these scholarships. He explained that a \\"minority scholarship committee\\" reviews applications to get into the school and awards money to prospective students who \\"meet the qualifications\\". Sarah Carr of The Atlantic said that Henderson did not specify what the qualifications are. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records state that in 2012 the school budgeted $6,500 for \\"minority scholarships\\". Carr said that IA has, as shown by the IRS forms, \\"raised a modest amount for scholarships in recent years\\". Carr said \\"Tradition and history partly explain why the scholarships aren't more widely utilized: Black families know their children could be isolated and shunned at the academy, and those with the means and desire to avoid the public schools have long relied on other -- more historically welcoming -- private schools, including a tiny, nearly all-black Christian academy in Indianola.\\" Restoration Ministries Christian Academy is the other private school in Indianola. Sam Wallis, who was a teacher at Gentry High School in 2012, and Katie Cooney, who was a former Gentry teacher that year, said that, as paraphrased by Carr, \\"some black students appear to be recruited at least partly because of their athletic abilities\\". Henderson said that this was not true and that several black students at IA do not play sports. Academics Students at the school, unlike students at public schools, are not required to take Mississippi state standardized tests. Interactions with government agencies In a two-year period ending in 2012, according to officials of the Indianola School District, IA received $56,000 in Title II professional development funds. Sarah Carr of The Atlantic said that Indianola residents told her that \\"apart from that exchange of money, there's little formal or informal interaction between the academy and the public school system\\". Athletics In the Mississippi Delta typically private academies play other private academies in interscholastic sports. Indianola Academy does not play Gentry High School, the public high school in Indianola. Throughout most of its history the school held control of an American football field adjacent to the former public junior high school, which now contains the public early childhood center. The academy places its \\"IA\\" logo on the buildings of the field and it has a barbed wire fence around the perimeter of the field. It does not share the facility with other agencies. Sarah Carr of The Atlantic said that the fence is \\"a stark reminder that outsiders should stay away\\" and that the logos are \\"like territorial markings.\\" Leaders in the City of Indianola said that the American Legion owns the land.

Typical for Danish hardcore sex comedies of the 1970s, the production was not blocked from hiring people from the mainstream film industry. The crew included cinematographer Morten Arnfred, also known as co-director of the TV miniseries The Kingdom (1994).

Retrieved 2008-SEP-01. Growing to a maximum of 20 cm (nearly 8 in) long, it is found on rich coral reefs and also on rubble and rocky areas. The monogamous adults swim in pairs and may be territorial and aggressive to other Chaetodon; juveniles are solitary. The Indian Vagabond Butterflyfish feeds largely on algae and coral polyps. They are oviparous. It belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it almost certainly is a rather close relative of the Threadfin Butterflyfish (C. auriga) and the Vagabond Butterflyfish (C. vagabundus). C. decussatus might be closer to the Threadfin Butterflyfish than to the common Vagabond Butterflyfish; as C. vagabundus has yielded abnormal DNA sequence data this is hard to say however.

Praenuculidae species lived from the early Ordovician, Arenig stage through the Early Devonian Emsian stage.The Paleobiology Database Praenuculidae entry accessed 11 January 2012 Praenuculidae fossils are found worldwide, present on every continent except Antarctica. Species in this family are thought to have been sessile, attached to the substrate in shallow infaunal marine water environments, where they formed shells of an aragonite composition. The family Praenuculidae was named by A. Lee McAlester in 1969. Description Praenuculidae first emerged in the early Ordovician and diversified from around 6 genera in the early Orodvician to a maximum of thirteen genera by the Late Ordovician. As a result of the Ordovician‚ÄìSilurian extinction event the family was reduced to three genera during the Silurian and by the end of the Devonian the family was entirely extinct. The family is composed of up to seventeen genera, most divided between the two described subfamilies erected by Teresa M. S√°nchez in 1999. The structure of the chevroned hinge teeth is the dominant feature by which members of Praenuculidae are divided between the two subfamilies. The majority of Praenuculidae genera possess teeth with a chevron concavity that faces towards the outer sides of the shell and a chevron point facing the umbo. These genera are grouped into the larger subfamily, Praenuculinae. Three of the genera are placed into the second subfamily, Concavodontinae, based on the teeth having chevron concavities which face in the reverse, towards the center of the hinge and points facing the outside edges of the shell. In the original 1999 description of the subfamilies, Cardiolaria was not placed into a specific subfamily due to the uncertain family affinities of the genus. Cardiolaria was placed in Praenuculidae by McAlester in 1969 with the original description of the family. It was suggested by John C. Cope in 1997 that the genus may belong elsewhere in the subclass Protobranchia, formerly called Palaeotaxodonta. Both Deceptrix and Cardiolaria are currently accepted as members of the family Cardiolariidae erected by Cope in 1997.The Paleobiology Database Cardiolariidae entry accessed 5 February 2012 The genus Eritropis was formerly included in the family, however it was moved to a new family, Eritropidae by John C. Cope in 2000. Genera *Concavodontinae Concavodonta Emiliodonta (syn.

EZDrummer 2 On March 13, 2014, Toontrack announced EZDrummer 2, a new and updated version of EZDrummer. It was recorded by the Grammy award-winning Chuck Ainlay, at British Grove Studios in London.http://www.soundonsound.com/news?NewsID=17059 It was released on May 6, 2014. It costs $179 for new buyers or $99 as an upgrade from EZDrummer. It contains EZDrummer‚Äôs sounds and kits, which are updated and modernized for this new release, two new sound libraries and a selection of percussion sounds. One of the new percussion sections contain cowbell, claps, snaps maracas, cabasa and a tambourine. It allows for the creation of new kits using sounds and instruments from previously installed expansion libraries. Its audio engine will be remodeled to provide real-time sample rate conversion, a greater number of individual hits per velocity layer, faster loading times and a feature for smoother sequenced hits called Multiple Hits Emulation. Its mixer, effects and graphics will differ and will be changed from those in EZDrummer. A new ‚ÄòTap2Find‚Äô feature will allow the tapping of a desired rhythm to find a list of close matches and to create patterns more quickly. A parameter called ‚ÄòAmount‚Äô will control the number of hits on a single drum or on the whole kit, in real time. This is done through an algorithm based on drum performances that adds and removes hits and play closer to what a real drummer would play. Any purchase of EZdrummer will automatically be eligible for a free upgrade to EZdrummer 2 from March 13, 2014 through May 6, 2014 (digital delivery only). Following this release, the first version of EZDrummer will no longer be available for sale since EZDrummer 2 will be replacing it.

He was famous in the St. Louis, Missouri community by writing a column for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and later with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Early Biography  Berger was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Julius Berger and Rae Cohen. He has Hungarian- Jewish ancestry on his father's side and Russian-Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. He graduated from Soldan-Blewett High School in St. Louis. His career ambition was to be a pharmacist.  Career  Just barely out of his teens, Berger was employed by the local branch of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a booker of films, while simultaneously entering management at the local Loew's Theatres. Subsequently, he joined 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation as Midwest advertising-publicity manager. His career then took off, when he became one of five young employees chosen by company chairman Darryl F. Zanuck to train as future leaders of the company. The launch-pad for Berger was an appointment as advertising publicity manager of 20th Century-Fox's far-flung operations in the Republic of South Africa, the Rhodesias and East Africa. He headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. After some time, he returned to the states to fill a marketing position at 20th Century-Fox's New York headquarters. He eventually accepted an offer of a marketing position with Paramount Pictures. He worked both in New York and Hollywood. His marketing expertise was employed on such motion pictures as \\"Barefoot in the Park\\" and Otto Preminger's \\"Hurry, Sundown\\" and \\"Advise and Consent.\\" Berger also worked with legendary producer Hal Wallis on \\"Becket\\". However, Berger struck up a close friendship with Otto Preminger, who once visited Berger, when the latter returned to St. Louis. He was also a press agent and publicist with such personalities as Joan Crawford, Rock Hudson, Leonard Bernstein, Liza Minnelli, Arthur Rubinstein, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Betty Grable, Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, and Rudolf Nureyev, among others. In 1968, Berger returned to St. Louis, where he joined the 12,000-seat Municipal Opera as operations director. Ten years later, he accepted the position as people columnist with the now-defunct St. Louis Globe-Democrat. After the newspaper folded, he joined the Pulitzers' St. Louis Post-Dispatch, where he continued to write daily columns and features for 24 years, while sporadically broadcasting entertainment reviews on television and Hollywood gossip on KMOX Radio, the CBS affiliate. He retired in 2004 and added a new credit to his dossier - marketing consultant. In 2009, Berger was banned from the Post-Dispatch building for inappropriately touching co- workers.https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2009/11/12/jerry-berger- banned-from-post-dispatch-for-inappropriate-behavior In 2013, Berger pled guilty to sexual misconduct, following an incident in which he groped a man in a check-out line.https://patch.com/missouri/crevecoeur/post-dispatch-gossip- columnist-jerry-berger-reportedly-admits-to-inappropriately-touching-man-at- creve-coeur-st-louis-fedex-store  References  * bergersbeat.com * Editor Letter Category:Journalists from Missouri Category:Writers from St. Louis Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American journalists Category:St. Louis Post-Dispatch people Category:St. Louis Globe-Democrat people Category:1933 births Category:Living people ","title":"Jerry Berger"},{"id":"14885181","text":"A Cargile membrane is a sterile membrane made from the peritoneum of the ox. It is used in abdominal surgery to interpose between raw surfaces and thus prevent the formation of adhesions. It was also used to envelop freshly sutured nerves or tendons, and to protect wounds. It was designed primarily to cover surfaces over which peritoneum has been removed, especially where a sterile membrane would lessen the formation of adhesion. The membrane is available in size of 4X6 inches and sometimes is used as packaging or protective sheath. The use of such material is currently limited. It was named for American surgeon Charles H.

The partially reconstructed part of the site consists of the Temple of Apollo (also, as alternatives Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus) below which is a stadium and a small theatre. It is included in a large park, Monte Smith, named for English Napoleonic admiral William Sidney Smith. Co founders the Dixon‚Äôs. History The island of Rhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese, an island group in the southeastern Aegean Sea. In 408 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War, three of the island's ancient cities merged to build an entirely new one ‚Äì the city of Rhodes ‚Äì on a site in the Ialysia region of the island. Admired for its beauty and luxury, the city flourished. After weathering a siege by Demetrios Poliorketes (the besieger) in 305‚Äì303 BC, Rhodes rallied and built the Colossus of Rhodes, a massive statue of the sun god Helios, to whom Rhodes is linked in Greek mythology. The Colossus is known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Following the great earthquake in 227 BC, which toppled the enormous harbor statue and devastated the city, Rhodes was rebuilt. It was later raided by Cassius in 42 BC and never recovered. Another catastrophic earthquake in AD 515 caused Rhodes to be reduced and confined to the area of Palais Polis, the present day Old Town. Over the next centuries, it was raided by the Persians and the Arabs and after holding off the Ottoman Empire in 1480, Rhodes was conquered by the Turks in 1522. During the Italo-Turkish War the Italians occupied the Dodecanese islands in 1912, which were not liberated until 1945, at the end of World War II. At that time the British oversaw the islands until their eventual incorporation into Greece 1948. Most recently Rhodes (the island) has become a popular holiday destination for tourists. Lindos - The Acropolis and the Medieval Castle pp. 5, 18‚Äì24 Excavation and restoration The original excavation was carried on by the Italian School of Archaeology at Athens from 1912 to 1945. Following World War II, the Greek Archaeological Service took over excavation and restoration of the ruins. This included extensive reconstruction of the Temple Pythian Apollo, which was extensively damaged by bombing and artillery installed there during the war. Excavation began in 1946 and continues today in the Acropolis archaeological park, which covers and is protected from any new construction.http://www.rhodesguide.com/travelguide/rhodes_monuments.php?ssp=12 Site The Acropolis is situated on the highest part of the city. The monuments were built on stepped terraces, with substantial retaining walls. = Temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus = Located at the northern extreme of the Acropolis in an east-west orientation, this stately temple was dominated by Doric columned porticos on all sides and originally housed the written treaties the Rhodians held with other states. The temple was bounded by a stoa to the east. Temple of Apollo = Temple of Pythian Apollo = Smaller than the Temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus, this structure boasts a similar east-west orientation but is located on the southern end, just west of a large rectangular terrace. Part of the northeast side of this porous peripteral temple has been restored. = Nymphaeums = Just southeast of the Temple of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus are four subterranean \\"structures\\" cut into the rock, featuring entrance steps, passages, a large opening in the central roof, along with water cisterns, foliage and interior niches for statuettes. These \\"caves\\" were used for worship and recreational purposes. = Odeon = thumb This small marble odeon held approximately 800 spectators. Situated northwest of the Stadium, it is believed to have been used for musical performances and rhetoric lessons of prominent Rhodians. = Stoa building = The impressive fa√ßade was visible from even the harbor. Today just one foundation wall remains. = Artemision = The Artemis cult's place of worship is situated on the northeast side of the hill, amidst the ruins of other structures of similar function. = Stadium = Stadium Located on the southeast side of the hill, the 210-metre north-south Stadium was initially restored by the Italians. Its surviving features include the sphendone (rounded end with turning post), proedries (officials' seats), and some of the spectator seating. The starting apparatus used in the athletic events has also been preserved. Athletic events of the Haleion Games, honoring Helios, were held here.

Locations =Jordan College= Map with list of fictional colleges from Lyra's Oxford. Jordan College is a fictional college. It exists in Oxford in a universe parallel to our own, and is the home of the trilogy's young heroine, Lyra Belacqua. The location and layout of Jordan College is analogous to the location of Exeter College, Philip Pullman's alma mater, at the University of Oxford. However, unlike the fictional college, Exeter College is not the oldest (it is the fourth-oldest), nor is it the largest or richest college at Oxford. Jordan College is an exaggerated version of the real Exeter College, rambling above and below ground in a motley arrangement of buildings, cellars and tunnels constructed over several centuries: :What was above ground was only a small fraction of the whole. Like some enormous fungus whose root-system extended over acres, Jordan (finding itself jostling for space above ground with St Michael's College on one side, Gabriel College on the other, and Bodley's Library behind) had begun, sometime in the Middle Age, to spread below the surface. Tunnels, shafts, vaults, cellars, staircases had so hollowed out the earth below Jordan and for some yards around it that there was almost as much air below ground as above; Jordan College stood on a sort of froth of stone. (Pullman, Northern Lights) The name 'Jordan' was inspired partly by the area of Oxford known as Jericho, through which the Oxford Canal passes; an area called 'Jericho' also features in Northern Lights as a mooring point for the Gyptians's boats. The location of Jordan College used for the film, The Golden Compass, was Christ Church, Oxford. The location used for filming Jordan for the TV series was New College. =Trollesund= In Lyra's world, Trollesund is the main port of the country of Lapland, which Lyra and her Gyptian protectors visit during their journey to Bolvangar. Trollesund has a witch consulate, which the Gyptians go to in order to get support from the witches. In Trollesund Lyra first meets Lee Scoresby, an aeronaut and prospector who has been stranded in the town as a result of a failed expedition, and Iorek Byrnison, an exiled armoured bear whom the townspeople had tricked into working for them as a metalworker with alcohol as payment. Both Lee and Iorek leave Trollesund with Lyra. =Svalbard= In Lyra's world, Svalbard is the location of the panserbj√∏rne palace and the centre of the ice bear government, Iorek Byrnison lives there, Svalbard takes its name from a Norwegian archipelago in our world. =Bolvangar= In Lyra's world, the far north location of the research facility where the Magisterium conducts experiments with intercision, a process which involves severing the link between a human and their d√¶mon, children are kidnapped and brought to Bolvangar for this to happen. The name Bolvangar means 'Fields of Evil'. In Old Norse, \\"b«´l\\" means bale or evil and \\"vangar\\" is a plural word meaning fields or meadows. =Citt√†gazze= Citt√†gazze, sometimes abbreviated to Ci'gazze (), meaning \\"City of the Magpies\\" in Italian, is a fictional city within a parallel universe which is reached through a \\"window-between-worlds\\" created by Lord Asriel at the climax of the first volume of the trilogy, Northern Lights. It is in Citt√†gazze that the two central characters, Lyra and Will, first meet in The Subtle Knife. The first reference to the city appears earlier, as 'the city in the sky', the city visible in the Aurora borealis, an occurrence which, according to the novel, thins the barrier between the universe in which Northern Lights takes place and the universe of Citt√†gazze. Lord Boreal describes it as having previously been a crossroads between all the worlds. Citt√†gazze is a seaside town, reminiscent of those near the Mediterranean, which seems to have Italian roots. Its main features are quaint restaurants, parasols hung over circular tables beneath trailing plants, wide cobbled roads, and ancient architecture. However, it also has electric lights, refrigerators and department stores, thus, this world appears to be similar to ours in many respects while inferior in others such as medicine and transport. Its most significant feature is the Torre degli Angeli (Tower of the Angels in Italian), in which the Subtle Knife is first encountered. The city is plagued by ghostly beings called Spectres. Spectres are invisible to pre-adolescents, but once individuals are old enough to see them, the Spectres eat away their d√¶mons, leaving them zombie-like and lifeless. Hence, the city is entirely devoid of adults, and populated only by small gangs of children. Spectres cluster around children approaching adolescence and consume them as soon as they come of age. The multitude of Spectres in the world of Citt√†gazze is due to the constant use of the Subtle Knife in its vicinity. The knife can create windows between worlds, but each window creates new Spectres. Asriel's opening of the passage from his world to Citt√†gazze caused a massive surge in Spectre population, swarming the Citt√†gazze world with the soul-devouring wraiths. =St Sophia's School and College= St Sophia's School is where Lyra goes to study the alethiometer after the events of The Amber Spyglass. She then goes on to study at St Sophia's College. Its location is approximately equivalent to Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. Worlds The following are the known worlds in the Multiverse: =Lyra's world= The world in which Lyra and most of the characters in His Dark Materials come from. Northern Lights takes place entirely in this world. There are six known planets in this world and the month of April has an extra day. =Will's world= Our own world. It is the setting for much of the early part of The Subtle Knife and features briefly at the conclusion of The Amber Spyglass. It is the home of Will Parry, his parents Elaine and John Parry, Mary Malone and several minor characters. While they still exist in this world, D√¶mons are invisible here. =The Citt√†gazze world= A modern Mediterranean world with beautiful seas and temperate weather. It is the setting for much of The Subtle Knife and parts of The Amber Spyglass. The Citt√†gazze world serves as the crossroads to the worlds because all the windows lead here. The spectres have been common in this world for generations. =Mulefa world= A world inhabited by the Mulefa and Tualapi. It has a savannah and prairie climate. The creatures here have a diamond-like skeleton. It is the setting for much of The Amber Spyglass. =The World of the Dead= The underworld in The Amber Spyglass. Lyra and Will are carried across a lake to reach its gate by a ferryman reminiscent of Charon of mythology. Within the books, anyone who has ever died from any world goes there eternally where their ghosts are guarded by Harpies. The Authority turned this world into a prison. =Republic of Heaven= The name given to the world in which Lord Asriel builds his army in preparation with war against The Authority. The only known inhabitants prior to the Asriel's forces are cliff ghasts, like those in Lyra's world. The land is mountainous and shows signs of volcanic activity. =Gallivespian world= The Gallivespian characters come from this world, but the trilogy itself never goes there. It is a world inhabited by humans and Gallivespians who are in conflict. =Minor worlds= * Three worlds are briefly glimpsed when Will is experimenting with the knife in The Amber Spyglass:  One contains a desert.  The second contains an industrial city where the factory workers are in chains.  The third contains a meadow inhabited by blue bison-like grazers. * Will, Baruch, and Balthamos escape from the Regent Metatron by cutting through to a moonlit beach in yet another world. * Will opens a world with a tropical rainforest when demonstrating the Subtle Knife's powers to Iorek Byrnison. While rescuing Lyra from Mrs Coulter's cave in the Himalaya of Lyra's world, he cuts through a world where the moon shines brightly over insect-infested ground the colour of bleached bone. * Will, Lyra, Tialys, and Salmakia reach the world of the dead from a world with what looks like a Dutch or Danish farmstead, where the villagers have just been massacred by armed soldiers and their village razed (this conflict is never explained).

Distribution This species is native to the shores of the North Atlantic Ocean, including Hudson Bay, Baffin Island, Greenland, and the Barents Sea, south along the American East Coast to Chesapeake Bay, and along the European coast to the Straits of Gibraltar. This species has also been introduced to San Francisco Bay, on the West Coast of the United States, where it was first observed in 1992. Shell description The shell in life often appears green with algae, but the shell itself can be white, red, or brown, sometimes with checkered lines. The shell has 4‚Äì5 whorls. Maximum recorded shell length is 19 mm.Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) Malacolog 4.1.1. A Database of Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca.Welch J. J.

File:Littorina saxatilis shell.pngApertural view File:Littorina saxatilis 003.jpgAbapertural view File:Littorina saxatilis001.jpgA series of shells of Littorina saxatilis Ecology =Habitat= This species frequently lives in salt marshes. it can also be found in crevices of intertidal bedrock, in empty barnacle shells, and under rocks. Like many other periwinkles, this species can survive long exposures out of the water. The species has been recorded alive from depth range 0 ‚Äì 46 m or up to 183 m (for shells only). In the exposed Galician coast in the Northern Spain, two well differentiated ecotypes are adapted to different shore levels and habitats. The RB ecotype (Ridged and Banded) lives on barnacles in the upper shore. This ecotype displays a larger and more robust shell to resist the attack from predators such as crabs, and a smaller shell aperture in order to reduce the desiccation due to high sunshine exposure. The SU ecotype (Smooth and Unbanded) is found at the lower shore living on mussels. This ecotype shows a smaller and thinner shell with a wider shell aperture to allocate a relatively larger muscular foot providing a higher ability to avoid the dislodgment caused by the heavy wave action. Both ecotypes coexist in an intermediate habitat at the middle shore. =Genetics= Littorina saxatilis has been shown to be an excellent model system for speciation genetics. In the seminal 2001 paper, Wilding et al demonstrated, using amplified fragment length polymorphism, that the low shore M form of the species were divergent from the high shore H form at number of loci despite gene flow between the forms. =Feeding habits= This snail is a herbivore which grazes on the surface of rocks and mud flats.  Life cycle  The marine snail Littorina saxatilis has separate sexes, internal fertilization, and a brood pouch with non-planktonic shelled embryos.

Born on 29 November 1890 at Decize, Ni√®vre as Maurice-Charles-Louis-Genevoix, Genevoix spent his childhood in Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Loire. After attending the local school, he studied at the lyc√©e of Orl√©ans and the Lyc√©e Lakanal. Genevoix was accepted to the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, being first in his class, but was soon mobilized into World War I in 1914. He was quickly promoted to a lieutenant. He participated in the bloody battles of the Les √âparges hill as well as along the road of Tranch√©e de Calonne to the south east of Verdun-sur-Meuse in late 1914 and early 1915. On the 25 April 1915 he was severely wounded in action in his left arm and side in the Tranch√©e de Calonne sector and returned to Paris. The battle in the Meuse in which he participated, especially those at Les √âparges left a profound influence on him, and he wrote the tetralogy Ceux de 14 (The Men of 1914), which brought him recognition among the public. Around 1919, Genevoix contracted Spanish influenza, causing him to move back to the Loire. He was quite prolific during his time in the Loire area, earning a Prix Blumenthal grant from the Florence Blumenthal Foundation to support him as a professional writer. It was this grant that allowed him to continue with some of his most celebrated works, R√©mi des Rauches and Raboliot, the latter of which earned him the Prix Goncourt. In 1928, his father died, and Genevoix moved to Vernelles in Loiret. At around this time, Genevoix started to travel abroad to Canada, Scandinavia, Mexico, and Africa. Canada and Africa were both admired by the writer, the latter of which he dedicated a 1949 essay to it, Afrique blanche, Afrique noire. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 24 October 1946 and was formally inducted the following year. In 1950, he returned to Paris and became secretary of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1958. In 1970, Genevoix, who was president of the program committee of French state radio, started a television series on French writers. He was also offered the Grand prix national des Lettres. He died on 8 September 1980. Genevoix presided the Friends of the Natural History Museum Paris society for ten years from 1970 to 1980.Yves Laissus, \\"Cent ans d'histoire\\", 1907-2007 - Les Amis du Mus√©um, centennial special, September 2007, supplement to the quarterly publication Les Amis du Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, n¬∞ 230, June 2007, ISSN 1161-9104 .

The shells had a high muzzle velocity and significant kinetic energy, allowing them to be fired from distances outside the range of the bombers defensive guns. The large explosive content of each shell almost ensured the destruction of any bomber that was hit. Rheinmetall was given a contract in 1943 to adapt the 50 mm 5 cm KwK 39 tank gun, from the Panzer III tank, for aerial use in the twin-engined Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse bomber destroyer. They were installed as Umr√ºst- Baus√§tze (\\"factory modification\\") 4 in the Me 410 A-1/U4, and, experimentally, in two Messerschmitt Me 262 A-1a/U4 jet fighter prototypes (though these were not used operationally),Ziegler, Mano, \\"Me 262: Hitler's Jet Plane\\", Greenhill Books, London, Stackpole Books, Pennsylvania, 2004, , pages 175-182. as the MK 214A cannon of similar caliber was not yet available. An experimental fitment of the BK 5 in an undernose Bola (or \\"dustbin\\") mount on a small number of Heinkel He 177A-3 heavy bombers was part of a small force of the bombers that was given the task of suppressing Flak on the Eastern Front near Stalingrad early in the winter of 1942-43 as the A-3/R√ºstsatz 5 version, allegedly nicknamed the Stalingradtyp. The semi-circular magazine of the BK 5 weapon system held 21 rounds. Approximately 300 were produced but saw only limited action, most notably in the Me 410 A-1/U4 aircraft that served with the II. Gruppe of Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). It was also mounted on the Junkers Ju 88. Intended for long-range shots, the cannon was given a telescopic sight in addition to the Me 410's standard Revi C12C gunsight, in order to make it easier to take long-range shots from outside a bomber's defensive perimeter, as a \\"stand-off\\" weapon system. This proved to be more of a hindrance than a help in the turning fights in which the Me 410s often found themselves when engaged by enemy fighters, as the manoeuvring targets easily escaped from the telescopic sight's small field of view, forcing them to use to normal sights instead. Since the BK 5 was almost useless against such small, nimble targets, the use of the telescopic sight was unnecessary in these situations anyway. As installed in the Me 262, with the muzzle protruding well beyond the nose of the fighter, the cannon was found to be prone to jamming, and if fired at night the muzzle flash tended to temporarily blind the pilot's night vision. According to the account of the engagements against the USAAF by II./ZG 26 from late February through mid-April 1944LuftArchiv.de the 53 Me 410 Hornisse of that Zerst√∂rergruppe equipped with the BK 5 claimed a total of 129 B-17 Flying Fortress and four Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, destroyed over five or six interceptions while losing nine of their own Me 410s.

The name New Philology was coined by James Lockhart to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.James Lockhart, \\"Charles Gibson and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico\\" in Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology. Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178 Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and Matthew Restall published a description of it in the Latin American Research Review.Restall, Matthew, \\"A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History\\", Latin American Research Review - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113‚Äì134 The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European medieval studies.M.

Historical Development Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.\\"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology\\" Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta. In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard. The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation. A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian Charles Gibson, whose Aztecs under Spanish Rule (1964)The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule> Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press and his earlier Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century (1952)Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called Nahuas) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was James Lockhart who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the Nahuatl language. His magnum opus was published in 1992, The Nahuas After the Conquest.,Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press. which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others. An early and important text in this vein was Nahuatl in the Middle Years (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist Frances Karttunen.Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period, Frances Karttunen & James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California. Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of Beyond the Codices (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.Beyond the Codices Arthur J. O. Anderson, Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press. Arthur J. O. Anderson, a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with Charles Dibble in publishing an English translation of the Florentine Codex by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents. In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or altepetl of Culhuac√°n.The Testaments of Culhuacan.

Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico. Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.\\"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan\\", Rebecca Horn. Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series. Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly Matthew Restall and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation \\"The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society\\" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.

Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used \\"Aztec\\" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than \\"Nahua\\", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Chenopodium murale) is a species of plant in the family Amaranthaceae known by the common names nettle-leaved goosefoot, Australian-spinach, salt-green, and sowbane. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and northern Africa, but it is widespread worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas due to the ease of it being introduced. It is a common weed of fields and roadsides. Description This is an annual herb reaching 70 centimeters in height with an erect stem which is usually red or red-streaked green and leafy with green foliage. The oval to triangular leaves are toothed and broad, smooth on the upper surface and powdery on the undersides. The inflorescences are powdery clusters of spherical buds. The buds do not open into typical flower blossoms but remain with the sepals covering the ovary as the fruit develops. Uses The seeds are edible, and the shoots, stalks, and leaves can be eaten as greens. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that common names include \\"Australian Spinach\\" and \\"Fat-hen\\". It also states that it is a \\"pot- herb\\", which may be utilised in the same manner as spinach. Care should be taken not to confuse this species with deadly black nightshade, which looks similar when young. The leaves of Chenopodium murale have a white mealy texture, and the axils have a red streak.

Views by denomination  = Anglican Churches = The Anglican theological tradition, including The Church of England, The Episcopal Church (United States), and others in the worldwide Anglican Communion as well as those who have broken away from communion but identify with the tradition, contains within it both Protestant and Catholic perspectives on this doctrine. On the Protestant side, the historic Thirty-nine Articles (1571) quoted in the Book of Common Prayer contain Article XI which states that \\"We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by faith and not for our work or deservings\\" (BCP, p. 870). Some Anglican Churches, such as the Church of England, still require clergy to affirm their loyalty to the Articles, while many others such as the Episcopal Church in the US do not see them as normative for clergy. In explaining this Anglican article of faith, John Wordsworth, former Bishop of Salisbury, says that \\"But by faith we understand not a dead but a living faith, which as naturally leads the believer to do good works for God as a good tree necessarily bears good fruit.\\" On the Catholic side, the 19th century Oxford Movement re-incorporated a broader understanding of justification into Anglican theology. The publication Tracts for the Times concluded in 1841 with commentary on Article XI in which justification by faith is affirmed as the \\"'sole internal instrument, not to sole instrument of any kind.' There is nothing inconsistent, then, in Faith being the sole instrument of justification, and yet Baptism also the sole instrument, and that at the same time, because in distinct senses; an inward instrument in no way interfering with an outward instrument, Baptism may be the hand of the giver, and Faith the hand of the receiver.' Nor does the sole instrumentality of Faith interfere with the doctrine of Works as a mean also.\\" In this way, without denying the justification by faith alone in a particular sense, Anglicans may also affirm the necessity of the sacraments (particularly Baptism) as well as works present in a Christian's life: > \\"First, it is the pleading or impetrating principle, or constitutes our > title to justification; being analogous among the graces to Moses¬í lifting > up his hands on the Mount, or the Israelites eyeing the Brazen Serpent,-- > actions which did not merit GOD¬íS mercy, but asked for it. A number of means > go to effect our justification. We are justified by CHRIST alone, in that He > has purchased the gift; by Faith alone, in that Faith asks for it; by > Baptism alone, for Baptism conveys it; and by newness of heart alone, for > newness of heart is the life of it. \\"And, secondly, Faith, as being the > beginning or perfect or justifying righteousness, is taken for what it tends > towards, or ultimately will be. It is said by anticipation to be that which > it promises; just as one might pay a labourer his hire before he began his > work. Faith working by love is the seed of divine graces, which in due time > will be brought forth and flourish¬ópartly in this world, fully in the next.\\" In 2017 the Anglican Communion affirmed the 1999 Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ) between the Catholic and Lutheran traditions. = Catholic Church = The Catholic Church teaches that both faith and good works are necessary for salvation: = Eastern Orthodox Churches = The Eastern Orthodox Churches teach the unity of faith and good works as necessary for salvation: =Latter Day Saint (Mormon) = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) view respects both faith and good works as essential, however it sees salvation as free, a gift from God based on the merits of Christ for ‚Äòthere is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise‚Äô (2 Nephi 2.8). As such salvation cannot be earned. Indeed, one purpose of writing the Book of Mormon was ‚Äòto persuade our children‚Ä¶to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do‚Äô (2 Nephi 25:23). Accordingly, faith is seen as a pre-requisite for this reconciliation opening the door to salvation. The LDS view of salvation is seen as life in one of the mansions or kingdoms Jesus prepared for his believers (Jn. 14.1-2). As Paul, they view the heavenly estate as divided into three glories likened to the sun, moon and stars (1 Cor.15.41). Though resurrection is seen as a gift for all mankind, no exception (1 Cor. 15.22), eternal life is conditional: ‚ÄòAnd, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God (Doctrine & Covenants 14:7). Once again, salvation is a gift, however, the quality of that gift or the degree of glory one attains to in the afterlife is determined by each individual here and now by the way he or she lives (Doctrine & Covenants 176.111). Of this earth‚Äîand subsequently all who eventually live on it‚Äîmodern revelation declared: ‚ÄòWherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power [light, eternal law] by which it is quickened, and the righteous [that is, those made righteous or justified] shall inherit it‚Äô (Doctrine and Covenants 88:11, 21‚Äì24, 26‚Äì28, 49). However, many denominations do not consider Mormons 'Christians', as they deny the Trinity and the absolute divinity of Jesus.https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/the-faqs-are-mormons- christian/https://web.archive.org/web/20070926211822/http://kutv.com/topstories/local_story_254185802.html\\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" Walter Martin (Revised 2003) Bethany House Publishers, Grand Rapids Michigan = Lutheran Churches and Reformed Churches = The Lutheran and Reformed principle of sola fide states that no matter what a person's action, salvation comes through faith alone. Ephesians 2:8-9 reads, \\"For by grace ye are saved through faith: and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.\\" (KJV) According to the Lutheran and Reformed tradition, salvation is God's gift at God's sole prerogative. Were it achieved by works, men could take pride in their efforts toward holiness, and God's gift of grace would be diminished in contrast to man's efforts. On the other hand, Paul says that God's chosen one who has been made holy by grace must show faith by actually loving (see ) and in this way obeying the law, i.e., the law or commandment of Christ and his Spirit (see ).New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those that appear in La Bible de Jerusalem‚Äîrevised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to James 2:14-26 In line with this, a more works-orientated perspective is presented by the Epistle of James, which concludes that \\"faith without works is dead\\" (). By works the author here appears to include both acts of charity and righteousness according to the \\"laws of the Spirit\\" (), as opposed to Mosaic Law. The sola fide view holds that James is not saying that a person is saved by works and not by genuine faith, but that genuine faith will produce good deeds, however, only faith in Christ saves.Zondervan NIV (New International Version) Study Bible, 2002, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA; footnote to James 2:14-26. = Methodist Churches = With regard to good works, A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts teaches: The Methodist Churches affirm the doctrine of justification by faith, but in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, justification refers to \\"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\\", rather than \\"being made actually just and righteous\\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through sanctification. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, taught that the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, as well as engaging in the works of piety and the works of mercy, were \\"indispensable for our sanctification\\". Methodist soteriology emphasize the importance of the pursuit of holiness in salvation. Thus, for Methodists, \\"true faith...cannot subsist without works\\". Bishop Scott J. Jones in United Methodist Doctrine writes that in Methodist theology: Bishop Jones concludes that \\"United Methodist doctrine thus understands true, saving faith to be the kind that, give time and opportunity, will result in good works. Any supposed faith that does not in fact lead to such behaviors is not genuine, saving faith.\\" Methodist evangelist Phoebe Palmer stated that \\"justification would have ended with me had I refused to be holy.\\" While \\"faith is essential for a meaningful relationship with God, our relationship with God also takes shape through our care for people, the community, and creation itself.\\" Methodism, inclusive of the holiness movement, thus teaches that \\"justification [is made] conditional on obedience and progress in sanctification\\" emphasizing \\"a deep reliance upon Christ not only in coming to faith, but in remaining in the faith.\\" Richard P. Bucher, contrasts this position with the Lutheran one, discussing an analogy put forth by the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley: = Oriental Orthodox Churches = The Oriental Orthodox Churches teach: The Coptic Orthodox Church says that a living faith should demonstrate good works, which are \\"the fruits of the work of the Holy Spirit within us and are the fruits requisite for the life of penitence which we should live.\\" Additionally, good works are \\"evidence of God's sonship\\". For Oriental Orthodox Christians, neither faith alone nor works alone can save, but both together, are required for salvation. = Evangelical Christianity = According to evangelical theology, good works are the consequence of salvation and not its justification.Robert Paul Lightner, Handbook of Evangelical Theology, Kregel Academic, USA, 1995, p. 214 They are the sign of a sincere and grateful faith. They include actions for the Great Commission, that is, evangelism, service in the Church and charity.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 524 They will be rewarded with the grace of God at the last judgment.Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 1296 Good works are claimed by some theologians as evidence of true faith versus false faith from the Epistle of James. A more recent article suggests that the current confusion regarding the Epistle of James about faith and works resulted from Augustine of Hippo's anti-Donatist polemic in the early fifth century. This approach reconciles the views of Paul and James on faith and works without appealing to Augustinian Calvinism's \\"evidence of true faith\\" view.

The station is owned by Starview Media, Inc. The station was started by Lewistown Broadcasting under the name Juniata-Perry Broadcasting Co. Lewistown Broadcasting owned WMRF (1490), WLTN-FM (97.9) and had majority ownership of WJSW-AM 1290 and WJSW-FM (100.1) Altoona, PA. WJUN-AM signed on with 250 Watts in September, 1955. Staff were DJs Don Lorenz, Tim Palm, Manager Ralph Parker and Engineer Ken Callahan. As a small market station (one of the smallest in PA at the time) the station had very little budget, so all equipment was used. The Studio equipment was from the former WLTN-FM, Lewistown, PA which the company had recently discontinued and returned the License. Tower and Transmitter were from WJSW, Altoona which had merged with WVAM after a fire destroyed the WVAM facility in 1951. In 1957 the power was increased to 1000 Watts. In 1970 Presunrise operation at 500 Watts was authorized. After the FCC authorized nighttime operation for many daytime AM station WJUN began nighttime coverage of sports events in 1986. For the first 25 years it ran a MOR (middle of the road) format and block programming consisting of country (6 - 7 am, 11 - 12 AM), Gospel 12:45 - 1:00 PM + weekends) Easy listening (5 PM - Sign off), Polka (12:30 - 1:00 PM Sunday) plus paid religion weekdays, weekends. Add to that mix Phillies Baseball, Mutual News and the local obituary column. In 1977 the station was sold to Mid-State Broadcasting, owned by Richard (Tab) Lyons and Bill Berry, both former employees of WKVA, Lewistown, PA. Together, Tab and Bill called their company \\"Billbat Broadcasting.\\" During their ownership they modernized much of the equipment and moved the format to a more mainstream Adult-Contemporary and discontinued the block programming. The format included Country hits in rotation but in the era of \\"urban cowboy\\" it played well. The FCC opened an FM allocation in 1986, which Mid-State applied for and was granted in 1987 for a Class A FM on 92.5. However they lacked the funds to construct the permit, so the station and CP were sold to Starview media who signed on WJUN-FM in July 1988.

The station is owned by WVNW, Inc. History WKVA signed on the air December 4, 1949 with 1000 watts of power, daytime only, and an omni-directional pattern from a single antenna tower at its transmitter site south of Juniata Terrace. In the early 1960s, WKVA applied for, and was granted, nighttime authority with a directional pattern at 500 watts and consequently constructed two additional towers to accommodate the change. Under the leadership of Robert Wilson, WKVA was home to an MOR format for much of its history. Announcers such as Fran Fisher, and Kerby Confer, 'cut their teeth' in the radio business at the controls of WKVA. In the early 1990s Wilson, whom by now was programming a country and western format on WKVA, eventually could no longer compete with the FM stations in the area, and eventually sold the station to the owners of a new competing FM country station, WVNW, Harry and Anna Hain. The Hain's had FM stations WVNW and WCHX in their portfolio of broadcast properties, and WKVA made a logical addition.

For survival, they surf together and only with other wave riders they absolutely trust (critical life- saving rescues from the tow-in watercraft are commonplace‚Äîthey take turns piloting the craft‚Äîtrust is paramount). Their preference is the tow-in surfing method (which they co-invented), which affords them the ability to catch the largest (and fastest) of ocean waves; their preferred location is the reef at Pe'ahi (pronounced pay-ah-hee) (commonly called \\"Jaws\\") on the northcentral coast of the Island of Maui (known for holding and breaking the largest waves on the planet); and their preferred riding style is \\"radical, late take-offs, forceful sweeping drops and turns across the face of 60+ footer waves, exiting over the shoulder of the wave at the end of the ride (to catch a tow ride back outside for another ride, of course)\\". Their extreme wave rides, chronicled in film and photographs, are daredevil conquests that do not seem possible (or wise!). They have survived near-death experiences in major \\"wipe-outs\\" under mountains of falling water.  Film appearances  Kalama appeared in the opening sequence of the James Bond film Die Another Day. In October 2006, Kalama, along with friend and celebrity waterman, Laird Hamilton, biked and paddled the entire Hawaiian Island chain‚Äîmore than 450 miles‚Äîin a week.

The battalion was formed in March 1941 as the 2nd Infantry Division Provisional Antitank Battalion, and on 15 December, was redesignated as the 602nd Tank Destroyer Battalion, in line with the reorganisation of the anti-tank force. It remained in the United States until 1944, when it was moved to the United Kingdom, deploying into Normandy in late August equipped with M18 Hellcats. It first saw combat on 9 September, fighting along the Moselle in the Lorraine Campaign and participating in the capture of Metz in November with the 26th Infantry Division. During the Battle of the Bulge in December it was sent north to Belgium to help stabilise the line, arriving near Bastogne on 21 December, and fought in the counterattack in January 1945 as part of the 11th Armored Division. Company C of the battalion was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its role in clearing the Harlange Pocket. After participating in the offensive through the Siegfried Line, the battalion was returned to the southern sector in March, and attached to the 89th Infantry Division on the 15th. It crossed the Rhine on the 26th, and advanced into Germany. On the 4 April, elements of Company A were the first to enter Ohrdruf, the first concentration camp to be liberated by American forces.

Pearce, \\"James Marvin Lockhart (1933-2014)\\" Historia Mexicana vol. 64. No. 1 (252)(Julio-Septiembre 2014), pp. 465-470 was a U.S. historian of colonial Latin America, especially the Nahua people and Nahuatl language. Born in Huntington, West Virginia, Lockhart attended West Virginia University (BA, 1956) and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (MA, 1962; PhD, 1967).John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Report of the President and the Treasurer (1977), p. 67. Late in life, Lockhart wrote a short, candid memoir.James Lockhart, \\"A Historian and the Disciplines\\" in Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History.Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, pp. 333-367. He joined the US Army and was posted to Germany, working in \\"a low-level intelligence agency,\\" translating letters from East Germany.Lockhart, \\"A Historian and the Disciplines,\\" p. 335. Returning to the US, he entered the graduate program at University of Wisconsin, where he pursued his doctorate in the social history of conquest- era Peru. His dissertation, published in 1968 as Spanish Peru, 1531-1560 was a path breaking approach to this early period. Less interested in the complicated political events of the era, he focused on the formation of Spanish colonial society in the midst of Spanish war with the indigenous and internecine struggles between factions of conquerors. With separate chapters on different social groups, including Africans and indigenous brought into the Spanish sphere, and an important chapter on women of the conquest era, his work shifted the understanding of that era. His main source for the people and processes of this early period were notarial documents, often property transfers and other types of legal agreements, which gave insight into the formation and function of Spanish colonial society. The work is now a classic and was published in a second, revised edition in 1994. While researching Spanish Peru, he compiled information on the Spaniards who received a share of the ransom of the Inca Atahualpa, extracted at Cajamarca. The Men of Cajamarca has both individual biographies of those who shared in the treasure, as well as a thorough analysis of the general social patterns of those conquerors. Both Spanish Peru and The Men of Cajamarca have been published in Spanish translation. He began to do research on colonial Mexico while at University of Texas, looking both at the socioeconomic patterns there and began learning Nahuatl. Fruits of these new interests were the publication of the anthology Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution (edited with Ida Altman) and Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period (with linguist Frances Karttunen). He moved to University of California, Los Angeles, where he spent the bulk of his teaching career 1972-1994, retiring early and continuing to collaborate with colleagues on research projects and mentor graduate students working on historical sources in the Nahuatl language and the colonial-era Nahua people. Among his many graduate students in colonial Spanish American social history and the philology of Mesoamerican indigenous languages, who earned doctorates under his mentorship are S.L.(Sarah) Cline, Kimberly Gauderman, Robert Haskett, Rebecca Horn, John E. Kicza, Leslie K. Lewis, Doris Namala, Leslie Offutt, Matthew Restall, Susan Schroeder, Lisa Sousa, Kevin Terraciano, John Tutino, John Super, and Stephanie Wood. He was a major contributor to a field of ethnohistory built on the study of indigenous-language sources from colonial Mexico, which he called New Philology. He collaborated with colonial Brazilianist Stuart B. Schwartz in writing Early Spanish America (1983), which is a foundational text for graduate students studying colonial Latin America. He was the series editor for the Nahuatl Studies Series, initially based at the UCLA Latin American Center and then jointly with Stanford University Press. Lockhart was honored by the Conference on Latin American History Distinguished Service Award in 2004.http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=188 He died on 17 January 2014 at the age of 80.Obituary: James Lockhart (1933-2014) Works *Spanish Peru, 1532-1560 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968; second edition 1994). *The Men of Cajamarca: A Social and Biographical Study of the First Conquerors of Peru (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1972). *The Social History of Colonial Spanish America: evolution and potential Austin, Texas: University of Texas Institute of Latin American Studies, 1972). *Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period (with Frances Karttunen, Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1976). *Beyond the Codices: The Nahua View of Colonial Mexico (with Arthur J.

It then moved to Andover, prior to being posted to France in May 1918 to form part of the Independent Air Force. The squadron later began re-equipping with the DH 10, however the armistice arrived before this was completed and the squadron returned home, first to Turnhouse and then to Crail where it disbanded on 30 June 1919. Eight flying aces served within its ranks, including future Rear Admiral Arthur Rullion Rattray, Jeffrey Batters Home-Hay, William Bottrill, Richard Gammon and W.

The squadron reformed again on 1 April 1941 at RAF Driffield, equipped with the Vickers Wellington and began night bombing operations in May as part of No. 4 Group RAF until February 1942. A squadron detachment was sent to Malta in October 1941, moving to Egypt in January 1942, shortly afterwards the home contingent of the squadron at Driffield was renumbered No. 158, whilst the remainder of the squadron in the Middle East remained No. 104. The squadron later moved first to captured airfields in Tunisia, followed by a move to the Italian mainland in December 1943. In February 1945 the squadron was re-equipped with the Consolidated Liberator, and then returned to Egypt in November 1945 where it converted to the Avro Lancaster. The squadron disbanded on 1 April 1947. =Postwar= In March 1955 the squadron reformed at Gutersloh equipped with the English Electric Canberra. Appointed as CO by April 1955 was Squadron Leader Edward Stephenson, an experienced flying instructor. The squadron became part of No. 551 Wing RAF, the Bomber Command Element of 2TAF: this consisted of Nos 102, 103, 104 and 149 Squadrons - each equipped with ten Canberra B2s. The squadron disbanded again in August 1956. The squadron was again reformed - as No. 104 (Strategic Missile) Squadron - on 22 July 1959, one of 20 squadrons associated with Project Emily. The squadron was equipped with three PGM-17 Thor Intermediate range ballistic missiles. and based at RAF Ludford Magna. In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the squadron was kept at full readiness, with the missiles aimed at strategic targets in the USSR. The squadron was disbanded on 24 May 1963, with the termination of the Thor Program in Britain.

Mental health literacy has been defined as \\"knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention. Mental health literacy includes the ability to recognize specific disorders; knowing how to seek mental health information; knowledge of risk factors and causes, of self- treatments, and of professional help available; and attitudes that promote recognition and appropriate help-seeking\\". The concept of mental health literacy was derived from health literacy, which aims to increase patient knowledge about physical health, illnesses, and treatments.  Framework  Mental health literacy has three major components: recognition, knowledge, and attitudes. A conceptual framework of mental health literacy illustrates the connections between components, and each is conceptualized as an area to target for measurement or intervention. While some researchers have focused on a single component, others have focused on multiple and/or the connection between components. For example, a researcher may focus solely on improving recognition of disorders through an education program, whereas another researcher may focus on integrating all three components into one program. = Recognition = An assortment of the various emotions humans experience. Recognition can be broken down into symptom or illness recognition. Symptom recognition is the ability to detect beliefs, behaviors, and other physical manifestations of mental illness, without knowing explicitly which disorder they link to. Specific illness recognition is the ability to identify the presentation of a disorder, such as major depressive disorder. The recognition of difference between knowledge and attitudes is a crucial part of the mental health literacy framework. While some efforts have focused on promoting knowledge, other researchers have argued that changing attitudes by reducing stigma is a more prolific way of creating meaningful change in mental healthcare utilization. Overall, both approaches have benefits for improving outcomes. = Knowledge = Knowledge is the largest component of mental health literacy, and important topics in Mental Health include: * How to get information: the networks and systems individuals use to get information about mental disorders. This may include friends, family, educators, or broader sources, such as entertainment or social media. *Risk factors: what factors put individuals at greatest risk for specific mental health disorders. Risk factors can be unemployment, low income, lack of education, discrimination, and violence. * Causes of mental disorders * Self-treatment or self-help: what individuals can do to help themselves recover without consulting with professionals, including the use of self-help books and media. Although many self- treatments are quite ineffective and even harmful due to lack of knowledge. * Professional help: where to get professional help and/or what professional help is available. = Attitudes = Attitudes are studied in two sub-components: attitudes about mental disorders, or persons with mental disorders, and attitudes about seeking professional help or treatment. Attitudes can vary greatly by individual, and can often be difficult to measure or target with intervention. Nonetheless, a large body of research literature exists on both sub-components, though not always explicitly tied to the mental health literacy. Recent research recognizes the varying attitudes across mental health professionals towards prognosis, long-term outcomes and likelihood of discrimination as more negative than those of the public. The attitudes of mental health professionals also differ towards interventions, but this variability is usually related to professional orientation.Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health, \\"Mental health literacy\\", 2007  Public outlook  Surveys of the public have been carried out in a number of countries to investigate mental health literacy.Jorm, A.F., Nakane, Y., Christensen, H., Yoshioka, K., Griffiths, K.M. & Wata, Y. (2005). Public beliefs about treatment and outcome of mental disorders: a comparison of Australia and Japan. BMC Medicine, 3, 12. Jorm, A.F., Angermeyer, M. & Katschnig, H. (2000). Public knowledge of and attitudes to mental disorders: A limiting factor in the optimal use of treatment services. In G. Andrews & A.S. Henderson (Eds.) Unmet Need in Psychiatry. (pp. 399-413). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Marie, D., Forsyth, D. & Miles, L.K. (2004). Categorical ethnicity and mental health literacy in New Zealand. Ethnicity and Health, 9(3), 225-252. These surveys demonstrate that the recognition of mental disorders is lacking and reveal negative beliefs about some standard psychiatric treatments, particularly medications. On the other hand, psychological, complementary and self-help methods are viewed much more positively. The public tends to prefer self-help and lifestyle interventions, opposed to medical, and psychopharmacological interventions. Implications surrounding public attitudes towards mental disorders include negative Stereotypes, Prejudice, or Stigma. As a result, this can influence help- seeking behavior or failure to seek treatment. In Canada, a national survey found that young adult males tend to manage their problems individually, and are less likely to seek formal help. Media influence plays a huge role in perpetuating negative mindsets towards mental illness, such as prescribing menacing qualities. A recent study highlights how the majority of participants note the media as the primary source of their beliefs about mental illness being associated with violence, and how this attitude is more prevalent towards serious mental illnesses. Fear and perceptions of danger related to mental illness have increased over the past few decades, largely due to serious mental illness such as schizophrenia being associated as potentially violent and harmful to others. These beliefs and attitudes are potential barriers to seeking individual professional help, and being supportive of others. An image of the many types of popular social media we are influenced by.  Measures  Researchers have measured aspects of mental health literacy in several ways. Popular methodologies include vignette studies and achievement tests. Vignette studies measure mental health literacy by providing a brief, detailed story of an individual (or individuals) with a mental health problem, and ask participants questions to identify what problem the individual is experiencing, and at times, additional questions about how the individual can help themselves. Achievement tests measure mental health literacy on a continuum, such that higher scores on a test indicate greater overall knowledge or understanding of a concept. Achievement tests can be formatted using multiple-choice, true/false, or other quantitative scales. Various scales have been created to measure the various components of mental health literacy, though not all are validated. Mental health literacy has been measured across several populations, varying in age range, culture, and profession. Most studies have focused on adult and young adult populations, though improving literacy in children has been a focus of prevention efforts.  Limitations  A statue of a man deep in thought. Low literacy within a population is a relevant concern, since at the most basic level, mental health literacy is linked to general literacy. Without this foundation, the beneficial effects of mental health literacy are challenging for those who face difficulties with reading and writing. Increased measures to increase literacy rates must be employed to empower and encourage the self-help components of mental health literacy. Populations can be diverse, which means barriers, such as cultural and social contexts, must be addressed. Within and across cultures, social, economic and political factors profoundly influence mental health. There are numerous socioeconomic and environmental determinants of mental health and mental illness, just as there are for physical health and physical illness. Social determinants of physical health including poverty, education and social support also serve as influencers. In order to encompass mental health literacy and diverse perspectives, further research in these areas are needed. Recognizing uncommon mental disorders is another hurdle that can disrupt mental health literacy within the public. Recent research shows that most studies are limited to identifying depression, generalized anxiety, and schizophrenia. In a recent Canadian study, most participants demonstrated good mental health literacy in regards to most mental health disorders, but a poor understanding of panic disorder.Catherine E. Gallagher & Margo C. Watt, \\"Mental Health Literacy in a Sample of Canadian Adults\\", 2019 An increased awareness surrounding underrepresented or more uncommon mental disorders is needed to widen public knowledge. A concluding limitation is the lack of research on child mental health literacy, as the majority of studies focus on adults and adolescents. If caregivers are not educated on recognizing and supporting mental disorders, this could create confusion and result in delayed treatment or wrongful prognosis for dependents. A child mental health literacy (CMHL) initiative could be implemented to target all adults in the general population, as well as parents, teachers, health professionals and/or children themselves.Lucy A Tully , David J Hawes, Frances L Doyle , Michael G Sawyer, and Mark R Dadds, \\"A national child mental health literacy initiative is needed to reduce childhood mental health disorders\\", 2019  Improvement approaches  A number of approaches have been tried and suggested to improve mental health literacy, many of which have evidence of effectiveness. These include: # Whole of community campaigns. Examples are beyondblue and the Compass Strategy in Australia, the Defeat Depression Campaign in the United Kingdom, and the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression in Germany. # School- based interventions. These include MindMattersMindMatters Evaluation Consortium (2000). Report of the MindMatters (National Mental Health in Schools Project) Evaluation Project, vols 1-4. Newcastle: Hunter Institute of Mental Health. and Mental Illness Education in Australia, and the Mental Health & High School Curriculum Guide in Canada #Individual training programs. These include mental health first aid training and training in suicide prevention skills.Pearce, K., Rickwood, D. & Beaton, S. (2003). Preliminary evaluation of a university-based suicide intervention project: Impact on participants. Australian e-Journal for the Advancement of Mental Health, 2, www.auseinet.com/journal/vol2iss1/Pearce.pdf. Initiatives that encourage empowerment and choice would also be beneficial, such as web-based self- directed therapy. # Websites and books aimed at the public. There is evidence that both websites and books can improve mental health literacy. However, the quality of information on websites can sometimes be low. #Rapport between mental health professionals and clients. By creating a partnership, professionals can promote competence, informed choice, and comprehensible knowledge for all levels of understanding, such as translating research findings into simpler language.

Built in 1817 and later given Gothic Revival styling, it was the first Episcopal Church in Vermont. On May 13, 1982, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is now owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont and maintained by a local nonprofit organization. Description and history Christ Church is set on a rise just south of Guilford's village center, overlooking Broad Brook and the junction of Melendy Hill Road and United States Route 5. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. Its front facade is dominated by a projecting square tower, which rises in two stages. The tall lower stage has the main entrance, which is framed by pilasters and topped by a semi-oval fanlight window, at the base, and windows topped by half-round fans above, and is topped by a cornice and parapet with pinnacles at the corners. The smaller second stage houses the belfry, with rounded louver openings on each face, and is crowned by a similar parapet and pinnacles. The parapet and pinnacle detail is repeated across the rest of the main facade's cornice line. The church was built in 1817 with local materials, and was originally a copy of an Episcopal church located in Greenfield, Massachusetts, which is no longer standing. The bronze bell was installed in 1830. In 1837 the building was given the overlay of Gothic Revival details it exhibits today. At that time the original raised pulpit was lowered to the dais, for which for of the original box pews were removed. The church congregation was first part of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts until the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont was created in 1832. It suffered a steady decline in size, reflecting that of the town itself. Christ Church ceased to be an active parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont before the 1900s, but has never been deconsecrated and is still used occasionally for Episcopal church services.St. Michael's Episcopal Church  history.

Patience games (also called patiences) can also be played in a head-to-head fashion with the winner selected by a scoring scheme.  Name  'Patience' is the earliest recorded name for this type of card game. The word is French in origin, these games being \\"regarded as an exercise in patience.\\" Although the name solitaire became common in North America for this type of game during 20th century, Parlett notes that a good reason for preferring 'patience' to 'solitaire' is that any game of patience may be played competitively by two or more players. In practice, although the term 'solitaire' refers to any one-player game, including board games, in North America it is often used totum pro parte to refer specifically to one-player card games, although sometimes the term 'card solitaire' is used for clarity. Meanwhile in other countries 'solitaire' specifically refers to the board game of peg solitaire. Both 'solitaire' and 'patience' are also sometimes used to refer specifically to the game of Klondike. Overview Patience-sized playing cards (bottom) are smaller than regular poker or bridge cards (top); this is because a game where cards are laid out may take up a large amount of table space The game generally involves manipulating a layout of cards with a goal of sorting them in some manner. It is possible to play the same games competitively (often a head to head race) and cooperatively. Patience games typically involve dealing cards from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on a tabletop, from which the player attempts to reorder the deck by suit and rank through a series of moves transferring cards from one place to another under prescribed restrictions. Some games allow for the reshuffling of the decks, or the placement of cards into new or \\"empty\\" locations. In the most familiar, general form of patience, the object of the game is to build up four blocks of cards going from ace to king in each suit, taking cards from the layout if they appear on the table. There is a vast array of variations on the patience theme, using either one or more decks of cards, with rules of varying complexity and skill levels. Many of these have been converted to electronic form and are available as computer games. The inclusion of Klondike Solitaire with Microsoft Windows from 1990 onward had an especially big impact in popularizing solitaire with the general public.\\"The Three Most Played Solitaire Card Games in the World\\". Retrieved 30 June 2020. History The game is thought to be German or Scandinavian in origin. The game became popular in France in the early 19th century, reaching Britain and America in the latter half. The earliest known recording of a game of patience occurred in 1788 in the German game anthology Das neue K√∂nigliche L'Hombre-Spiel. Before this, there were no literary mentions of such games in large game compendiums such as Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester (1674) and Abb√© Bellecour's Academie des Jeux (1674). Patience was first mentioned in literature shortly after cartomantic layouts were developed circa 1765, suggesting a connection between the two. This theory is supported by the name of the game in Danish and Norwegian, kabal(e). An 1895 account describes a variant of the game exclusively used for cartomancy. The first collection of patience card games in the English language is attributed to Lady Adelaide Cadogan through her Illustrated Games of Patience, published in about 1870 and reprinted several times. Other collections quickly followed such as Patience by Ednah Dow Littlehale Cheney (1869), Amusement for Invalids by Annie B. Henshaw (1870), and later Dick's Games of Patience, published by Dick and Fitzgerald. Other books about patience written towards the end of the 19th century were by H. E. Jones (a.k.a. Cavendish), Angelo Lewis (a.k.a. Professor Hoffman), Basil Dalton, Ernest Bergholt, and Mary Whitmore Jones.  Types  Patience games are commonly grouped together according to family, where related games such as Klondike games, Forty Thieves games, or Matching games are classified together. David Parlett instead adopts a system of classification based on the amount of information available about the cards at the start of the game (closed, open, or half-open), and based on the process of manipulating the cards (building, or packing). In most games of patience the overall aim is to arrange all thirteen cards of each suit in order in a \\"family\\" running from ace to king. Normally the ace forms the \\"foundation\\" on which a two of the same suit is placed, followed by a three and so on. This is known as \\"building\\" and all such games are, technically, builders. However, in many games the cards must be assembled in reverse order on another part of the layout called the \\"tableau\\". They can then be built in the right sequence on the foundations. This interim process of reverse building is called \\"packing\\", and games that use this technique are thus called \\"packers\\". Games that use neither technique are called \\"non-builders\\". There are also specials kinds of packer games which may be further sub-classified as 'blockades', 'planners' and 'spiders'. Patience games may be classified by the degree to which the cards are revealed. In \\"open\\" games, all the cards are visible throughout the game and the player has to use powers of analysis to solve the patience. In \\"closed\\" games, cards are drawn from a face-down stock and the player has to use judgement because the sequence of cards is unknown until they appear. In between is a hybrid group which Parlett calls \\"half-open\\". = Closed games = Closed games are those in which, throughout the game, not all the cards are visible. They require more judgment because the sequence of cards is unknown. As cards appear, if they cannot be played straight away they are put into a wastepile from which they may, potentially, not be accessible again. Closed games may be subdivided into the following categories: * Simple builders. Typically the aim of a simple builder is to build cards in suit sequence on the Aces which form the foundations. They are 'simple' in that the player has little or no choice in playing and just needs to watch for opportunities to build, any card that cannot be built being discarded to a wastepile where it may, of course, become inaccessible. Cards may be played from the wastepile or the hand and when the hand cards are exhausted it may be possible to 'redeal' by playing through the wastepile, usually for a limited number of times. * Reserved builders. An elaboration of the simple builder is to deal a number of cards to a 'reserve', thus increasing the number of cards available to play. * Simple packers. Packers enable cards to be built in reverse sequences on the layout - sometimes called 'auxiliary sequences', before playing them to the foundations in the correct sequence. Building in reverse sequence is known as 'packing'. * Reserved packers Reserved packers combine the features of having a reserve of cards and also the ability to pack in reverse sequence before laying off to the foundations. * Non-builders The aim of a non-builder is not to build suit sequences, but some other objective. In many of them the aim is to discard the entire pack or packs by pairing cards of the same rank or adding up to a given number. = Open games = In open games, the entire pack of cards is visible at the outset and continue to be visible throughout the game. These games require careful analysis (as in chess) to achieve success. Open games may be divided into the following categories: * Open builders. A family of builders in which all the cards are faced at the start of play. * Open packers. Likewise a family of packers in which all the cards are visible at the outset. * Open non-builders. A branch of open patiences in which the aim is other than build suit sequences. = Half-open games = Half-open games are those which start 'closed' and become 'open' as the game progresses. They may be divided into: * Half-open builders. These are games where the aim is to build up suit sequences without the help of packing in reverse order first. Unlike simple builders, there is no wastepile, but cards are added to the layout if they cannot be built until the game reaches a point where all the unbuilt cards are visible and the game becomes one of analysis. * Blockades. A small family of builders named after British Blockade in which the cards are only available if there is no card below (or sometimes above) it. * Planners. A large family of builders with a high skill level. Cards are played to the foundations or to several wastepiles, the top cards of which are always available to play. * Half-open packers. These are packers where, during the course of the game, all the remaining cards eventually become visible. * Spiders. A small family of games named after Spider Solitaire in which all the building takes place on the tableau and not to separate foundations.

The other choice was amalgamation with the City of Kelowna, with a previous ballot question offering the option of remaining unincorporated within the Regional District of Central Okanagan's former Westside Electoral Area. The vote was strongly split along geographical lines, with voters from Westbank, Glenrosa, and other areas farther from the City of Kelowna voting to incorporate in larger numbers and voters living closer to Kelowna typically choosing amalgamation. Rosalind Neis was elected as the first mayor of the newly incorporated area for a term of one year. On November 15, 2008, Doug Findlater was elected the second mayor of West Kelowna. Findlater served for three terms as mayor. On October 20, 2018, Gord Milsom was elected as the third person to serve as municipality's mayor.

The bulk of the film consists of footage of an elaborate theatrical performance for the Maharaj Arvind Singh Mewar at the City Palace of Udaipur, Rajasthan staged by Andr√© Heller. Production The film was made at Heller's request. Heller explains in the film that he sent several colleagues throughout India to find performers for the show, including dancers, musicians, contortionists, and magicians. About 10,000 performers were located, and of these about 2,000 were chosen to appear in the show, which lasted several hours on a single day. Herzog's footage was filmed at the actual show, with some segments filmed in the rehearsals in the previous days. Herzog's narration explains that the event was requested of the Maharana by a local wise man who saw the sinking of the city's palaces into the Pichola Lake as a sign that the local culture was deteriorating, and that the Maharana needed to stage the performance to reinvigorate interest in the various cultures represented.

It is a perennial species that grows in the mountains of Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k in the Czech Republic. It evolved through specialization of an isolated population of Campanula scheuchzeri, an Alpine species, which expanded to the area of the Sudetes during a colder period, probably the last ice age. It is closely related to Campanula bohemica, endemic to the Krkono≈°e Mountains. Sometimes it is even considered its subspecies and referred to as Campanula bohemica subsp. gelida. They all belong to the group of related species Campanula rotundifolia agg. Location The only known occurrence of Campanula gelida in its natural environment is at Peter's Stones in the Pradƒõd nature reserve, at an altitude of 1,438 metres above mean sea level, where it has to resist low temperatures, wind and snow. It grows on the southern and eastern slopes of the highest rock of Peter's Stones and in nearby grass vegetation consisting mainly of fescue, within 10 metres of the foot of the rock. The location is not accessible to the public. Description Campanula gelida grows in grass Campanula gelida is very similar to its nearest relative Campanula bohemica. Miloslav Kovanda, the first botanist who described Campanula gelida in 1968, later even reclassified it as its subspecies. Recently, most botanists consider it to be an independent species again. Campanula gelida can be distinguished from Campanula bohemica especially by its rich tufts, and smaller flowers and capsules. Flowers often grow independently or in racemes consisting of not more than four flowers. Stem is not longer than 20 cm. Ground leaves, forming a rosette, stay until the plant wilts. Growth and reproduction Campanula gelida usually grows in small fissures of rocky, acid ground. It prefers sunlit places, but some plants grow in shadow too. The species reproduces mostly vegetatively, because its possibilities of generative reproduction are very limited by the climatic conditions of its location. Flowers are produced from the middle of July until the end of August. Similarly to other bellflowers, its gynoecium develops after pollen has been set free from stamens, which prevents self-pollination. Endangered species Although Campanula gelida is critically endangered and was on the edge of extinction in the 1970s, at present the population of the species seems (despite their small number and limited area of occurrence) to have stabilized. Current threats include skiers trespassing in the protected area and expansion of other species including Tufted Hair-grass, Red Raspberry and Hypericum maculatum. Campanula gelida is on the list of particularly protected plants of the Czech Republic, and thus it is forbidden to be picked, dug or otherwise damaged or disturbed in its development. It was also included into the Red List of Endangered Plants of the Czech Republic, category C1 (critically endangered), the IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants and the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.

Tanbark is the bark of certain species of trees. It is traditionally used for tanning hides into leather. The words \\"tannin\\", \\"tanning\\", \\"tan,\\" and \\"tawny\\" are derived from the Medieval Latin tannare, \\"to convert into leather.\\" Bark mills are horse- or oxen-driven or water-powered edge mills and were used in earlier times to shred the tanbark to derive tannins for the leather industry. A \\"barker\\" was a person who stripped bark from trees to supply bark mills. Tanbark around the world Waterwheel at Combe House Hotel in Holford, Somerset, England. The overshot waterwheel was cast by Bridgwater ironfounder H Culverwell & Co in 1892 to replace an earlier wheel. It was used to grind oak bark for the tannery complex established here in the 1840s by James Hayman. When the tannery closed in 1900, the waterwheel was adapted to other uses, such as grinding grain for grist, cutting chaff, chopping apples for the cider press, and generating electricity. It also cracked stones in a nearby quarry. The gearing survives, too. In Europe, oak is a common source of tanbark. Quercitannic acid is the chief constituent found in oak barks. The bark is taken from young branches and twigs in oak coppices and can be up to 4 mm thick; it is grayish-brown on the outside and brownish-red on the inner surface.Oak on www.online-health-care.com In some areas of the United States, such as northern California, tanbark is often called \\"mulch,\\" even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word \\"mulch\\" may refer to peat moss or to very fine tanbark. In California, Lithocarpus densiflorus (commonly known as the tanoak or tanbark-oak) was used. In America, condensed tannins are also present in the bark of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). In New York, on the slopes of Mount Tremper, hemlock bark was a major source of tanbark during the 19th century. Around the Mediterranean Sea, sumach (Rhus coriaria) leaves and bark are used. In Africa and Australia, acacia (called \\"wattle\\") bark is used by tanners. One ton of wattle or mimosa bark produces about 150 lbs of pure tannin.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol II (1847), Charles Knight, London, p.873. Used tanbark is employed in horticulture and spread on flower beds and in glass houses to keep down weeds and protect plant roots.

He became deputy county mayor in 1984, and then county mayor in 1988. He lost the mayor post following the 1991 elections, but remained a county council member until 1995. At the nomination that year, he was not re-nominated at all, since the nomination committee prioritized Anne Margrethe √òvsthus on the ticket, and Fure refused to be placed lower than first place. Julius Fure was the older brother of historian Odd-Bj√∏rn Fure, and lived at Stadlandet.

It is located behind the University of Hawaii's Kauai Community College campus.  History  In January 1977, Island School began with 12 students ranging up to eighth grade. Within four years, enrollment was up to 68 and its high school had been established. By 1983, Island School had graduated only eight students and the high school was disestablished. In 1996, the high school was re-opened due to rising enrollment. Island School began graduating seniors again starting with the Class of 2000. Today, Island School is a fully accredited college preparatory institution. Graduates have been accepted at such institutions as MIT, Yale, Wheaton, Babson, and Ithaca in the East; Oberlin, Denison, Purdue and Creighton in the Midwest; Stanford, University of Southern California, Pomona College, Reed, Gonzaga, Lewis and Clark, Trinity College (Connecticut), University of the Pacific, University of San Diego, Loyola Marymount University, University of Idaho, and the University of Nevada in the West; the University of Hawai\`i, Hawai\`i Pacific University and Chaminade in Hawai\`i. In September 1991, the campus was moved from Kealia (on the east side) to its present location in Puhi. Island School used several portable classrooms at the Puhi campus, all of which were destroyed by Hurricane Iniki in September 1992. Other buildings were obliterated or severely damaged by the hurricane. The school re-opened 11 days later by utilizing various off-campus facilities scattered around the island. The permanent campus at Puhi was entirely restored within two years.  Academic Program  Island School's academic program takes its impetus from Howard Gardner's ideas of multiple intelligences. In other words, in addition to verbal and mathematical knowledge, each human is capable of realizing his or her potential in music and art, in self-understanding and social interactions, in physical strength and coordination (as in athletics), and in making discoveries (as in science). Island School divides its school year into three trimesters. In High School there are a variety of classes to choose from. For example, math classes range from Algebra through Calculus 2. = Hawaiian Studies = All students receive instruction in Hawaiian Studies. This includes the culture, language, history and music of Native Hawaiians as well as Hawaiian geography. The value of aloha is extended to include akahai (kindness), lokahi (unity), oluolu (pleasantness), haahaa (humility) and ahonui (patience). Participation in Native Hawaiian sports is emphasized during Makahiki (Thanksgiving). As early as fifth grade, students take overnight trips to the Big Island of Hawaii to study Hawaiian culture, as it was before the 18th-century arrival of foreign influences.

WHLQ is owned and operated by Ronnie D. Joyner Ministries, Inc. History =Pre-broadcast and launch= William Carlton Link and Thurman Louis Hardgrove, Sr. both applied for a new FM station for Lawrenceville, Virginia, in early 1988. Link already owned an AM station, WLES, in Lawrenceville. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held a hearing regarding the matter on January 14, 1988. More than two months later, on March 31, Link's application was approved, with the station to broadcast at 98.9 MHz. During the week of April 20, 1989, the FCC assigned the new station the WLES-FM call sign. The station launched on September 1, 1991, airing country and bluegrass music. During the week of November 30, the station call sign changed to WHFD. =History since launch= On November 12, 1992, the FCC announced that WHFD would move from 98.9 to 105.5, where it remains. The move took place on January 15, 1993. The station added gospel music to its format in 1995. Norfolk, Virginia-based Willis Broadcasting Corporation bought WHFD and sister station WLES from Link on March 22, 1999 for $350,000. Almost a year later, on January 10, 2000, sister-station WLES was sold to Chesapeake- Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation for $150,000. In 2001, WHFD switched from a hybrid country/bluegrass/gospel music format to solely gospel. WHFD and South Boston-based WHLF-AM were to be sold to J&J; Broadcasting Inc. for $250,000 on November 11, 2002, but for unknown reasons the sale did not take place. Station general manager Katrina Chase purchased WHFD, under the company name Lawrenceville Christian, for $100,000 on April 10, 2005. On February 9, 2011, WHFD was placed into receivership due to a $200,000 debt owned to a Woodstock, Virginia-based law firm. The station fell silent on March 9, 2011, returning to the air in early 2012. Todd Fowler of Fowler Media Consulting, LLC took over operations of the station on March 30, 2011. On July 18, 2011, the station's call sign was changed from WHFD to WHLQ. WHLQ was sold by Fowler to Jimmy Johnson of North Carolina on May 16, 2012 for $75,000. The sale closed on November 7, 2012. Once again, on April 14, 2014, the station was up for sale, this time to Lawrenceville resident Jeff Davis, who, under the company name Imperial Broadcasting Company, LLC, purchased WHLQ from Johnson for $199,000. Johnson, while still owner of WHLQ, filed to raise the station's transmitting tower height from 47 meters to 100 meters on May 9, 2014. The station's tower will remain in the same location and the wattage will remain the same as well. On July 7, 2014, the station's call sign was again changed, from WHLQ to WVNC. Logo used from September 22, 2014 until early January 2015. The sale from Johnson to Davis closed on July 14, 2014. Four days later, WVNC fell silent to make \\"changes [with] equipment and programming\\". A month previously, on May 20, a post on the station's new Facebook page alerted listeners that the station would take a new format of Conservative News/Talk programs. Davis said, in an interview on August 5 with the Brunswick Times- Gazette, that he hoped to have the station on the air \\"by the second week of August\\". He also said \\"a morning show featuring local guests\\" will be featured. WVNC returned to the air on August 19, 2014. The station, however, returned with a music format due to technical problems with the station's satellite dish. The news/talk format was delayed until the satellite dish was repaired. On September 22, 2014, the station debuted its Conservative News/Talk format. The station began streaming its programming online at December 16, 2014, but stopped four days later. On December 20, 2014, the station began airing Christmas music. Owner Jeff Davis began the process of selling the station back to previous owner Jimmy Johnson, on January 6, 2014. Johnson will operate the station, under the Brunswick County Broadcasting, Inc., with two other persons, John Trent and Terry Suggs. Trent's law firm filed suit against the station's previous owners in 2011. The sale represents a cancellation of debt, in the amount of $179,100, still owned by Davis to Johnson. As part of the agreement, the station's callsign will change back to WHLQ. The two companies also entered into a time brokerage agreement, allowing Brunswick to begin operating the station. The agreement went into effect on January 1, 2015. On January 13, 2015, the station's callsign changed to WHLQ. The sale of WHLQ was closed on April 9, 2015. A little under seven months later, on October 27, 2015, Brunswick County Broadcasting, Inc. began the process to sell WHLQ. The buyer, this time around, was Chesapeake-based Ronnie D. Joyner Ministries, Inc. The station was sold for $149.000, and the translation was consummated on January 6, 2016. At this time, translator station W236AD is not included in the sale.

He is best known as the second husband of Wu Zetian's powerful daughter Princess Taiping.  Background  It is not known when Wu Youji was born. What is known is that his grandfather Wu Shileng (Ê≠¶Â£´ËÆì) was an uncle of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian),The traditional historical sources internally conflict with regard to whether Wu Youji's grandfather's name was Wu Shileng (Ê≠¶Â£´Á®ú) or Wu Shirang. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 58 [Wu Shileng] with Old Book of Tang, vol. 183 [Wu Shirang]. The New Book of Tang, within a single volume, referred to the person as both Shileng and Shirang but used Shileng more than Shirang. See New Book of Tang, vol. 206. As, however, the more comprehensive Wu clan family tree in the table of chancellors' family tree listed Wu Youji as a descendant of Wu Shirang and not Wu Shileng and appeared to indicate that Wu Shirang and Wu Shileng were not the same person, \\"Shirang\\" will be used here. See New Book of Tang, vol. 74, part 1. and that he, like Wu Zetian's father Wu Shihuo (Ê≠¶Â£´ÂΩ†), had supported Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu and had been, for his accomplishments, created the Duke of Xuancheng and buried with honor near Emperor Gaozu's tomb. As of 690, Empress Wu was serving as empress dowager and regent over her son Emperor Ruizong, and Wu Youji was serving as a military officer. Empress Dowager Wu's only daughter Princess Taiping had been widowed since 688, when her husband Xue Shao (ËñõÁ¥π) was executed for participating in the rebellion of her cousin Li Chong the Prince of Langye against Empress Dowager Wu's authority. Empress Dowager Wu wanted to marry Princess Taiping to Wu Youji, who was however already married. Empress Dowager Wu therefore secretly had Wu Youji's wife assassinated, and then married Princess Taiping to him.  During Wu Zetian's reign  Later in 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, establishing Zhou Dynasty as its \\"emperor\\" and interrupting Tang Dynasty. She created a number of her Wu clan relatives princes, and, after posthumously created Wu Youji's grandfather Wu Shirang the Prince of Chu, she created Wu Youji the Prince of Qiancheng. In 691, she created him the greater title of Prince of Ding. At a later point, however, his title was reduced to Prince of Anding. Wu Youji was known for being unambitious and peaceful in his character, and, unlike Princess Taiping, who was very much involved in her mother's reign and often gave her mother advice, appeared to be largely uninvolved in Wu Zetian's governance. An exception was in 699, when Wu Zetian, in fear that after her death that her son Li Xian the Crown Prince (formerly emperor after Emperor Gaozong's death in 683 but who was quickly removed by her for disobedience in 684 in favor of Emperor Ruizong) and the Wu clan princes would not be able to coexist peacefully, had Li Xian, Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong), Princess Taiping, Wu Youji, and the other Wu clan princes swear an oath to each other and read the oaths to the gods. The oaths were then carved on iron and kept in the imperial archives.  During Emperor Zhongzong's and Emperor Ruizong's second reigns  In 705, a coup led by the officials Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji killed Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, overthrew Wu Zetian, and restored Li Xian to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Princess Taiping participated in the coup as well, and after Emperor Zhongzong assumed the throne, he credited both Wu Youji and his cousin Wu Sansi with participating in the coup as well, and he restored Wu Youji to the greater title of Prince of Ding and gave him the honorific title of Situ (one of the Three Excellencies). Wu Youji declined both, and subsequently, when Emperor Zhongzong reduced the Wu clan princes' titles in accordance with public sentiment, Wu Youji's title was reduced to Prince of Leshou. Emperor Zhongzong, believing that 16 officials, including Wu Youji, Wu Sansi, and the officials who actually carried out the coup, were contributors to his reign, granted them iron certificates that were supposed to guarantee that, except for treason, they would be pardoned from death 10 times. (However, Emperor Zhongzong subsequently turned away from these promises as to Zhang, Cui, Jing, Huan, and Yuan, as the five were falsely accused of crimes by Wu Sansi and exiled, and then died or were executed in exile.) In 707, during a drought, Emperor Zhongzong sent Wu Sansi and Wu Youji to the tomb of Emperor Gaozong and Wu Zetian (who had died later in 705) to pray for rain. When rain came, Emperor Zhongzong used this as the reason to restore the ancestral temple of the Wu ancestors and restore the tombs of Wu Shihuo and Wu Zetian's mother Lady Yang to imperial tomb status. In 710, Emperor Zhongzong suddenly died ‚Äî a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his wife Empress Wei and daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, as Empress Wei wanted to be emperor and Li Guo'er wanted to be crown princess. Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen was installed as emperor, but Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager. Less than a month later, a coup led by Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song, Li Dan retook the throne. After the coup, many Wu clan members who had supported Empress Wei were killed, and the survivors had their ranks reduced. Wu Youji's title was reduced to Duke of Chu. By 711, a power struggle between Princess Taiping and Li Longji (who was created crown prince) had become intense, and at the suggestion of the chancellors Song Jing and Yao Yuanzhi, Emperor Ruizong briefly sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji out of the capital Chang'an, to live in Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) to try to defuse the situation. Subsequently, when Princess Taiping complained, Song and Yao were demoted, and Princess Taiping and Wu Youji were recalled to Chang'an. Later that year, in order to please Wu Youji, Princess Taiping requested that Wu Shihuo's and Lady Yang's tombs be again returned to imperial tomb status. (They had been again stripped of their imperial tomb status after the coup against Empress Wei.) In 712, Wu Youji died. Emperor Ruizong posthumously honored him and created him the Prince of Ding, with the posthumous name Zhongjian (literally meaning \\"faithful and approachable\\"). In 713, after Emperor Ruizong had passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong and Princess Taiping's conflict came to a head. Emperor Xuanzong, suspecting Princess Taiping to be plotting to overthrow him, acted against her first, and, after he killed a number of her associates, he forced her to commit suicide. After her death, Wu Youji's grand tomb was destroyed.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 183. * New Book of Tang, vol. 206. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 204, 206, 208, 209, 210.

The first of two novels to be written from a woman's perspective, as well as the prequel to a later novel (The Haunted Bookshop), Parnassus on Wheels was inspired by the novel The Friendly Road by David Grayson (pseudonym of Ray Stannard Baker), and starts with an open letter to Grayson, taking him to task for not concerning himself (except in passing) with his sister's opinion of and reaction to his adventure. Radio adaptation Parnassus on Wheels was presented on Hallmark Playhouse January 20, 1949. The 30-minute adaptation starred Ruth Hussey.

The coalition is largely made up of members of the Radical Civic Union, a group of smaller parties and dissident Socialist Party members who support the governing Peronists led by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Former President N√©stor Kirchner proposed the coalition as a new centre-left force in Argentine politics. The smaller parties originally included the Broad Front, the Party of Victory, the Intransigent Party and the Christian Democratic Party. The leading former Radical supporting the Kirchners was Julio Cobos, who was elected vice president. Having been expelled from the Radicals, he set up his own party, which eventually settled on the name ConFe (Federal Consensus). Formally, the bloc's two senators are Senator Dora S√°nchez of Corrientes Province and Pablo Verani of R√≠o Negro Province, both former Radicals. Other leading members of the concertation, often termed 'Radicales K', are governors Miguel Saiz, Gerardo Zamora and Arturo Colombi and deputies such as Hugo Nelson Prieto. In the Chamber of Deputies, a similar bloc of five deputies named 'Of the Concertation' (de la Concertaci√≥n) exists, led by Prieto. The 'Plural Consensus' tag has been widely used in the media to describe the non- Justicialist elements of the ruling coalition. By the time plans were advanced in formalising the coalition, disenchantment and defections had set in. In 2008, Kirchner began to form plans to take the leadership of the Justicialist Party and reach an accommodation with those Justicialists who have opposed him, particularly the backers of Roberto Lavagna. This 'normalization' of Peronist politics left some Kirchner supporters outside Justicialist ranks uneasy, in addition to the government's tough line in the conflict with the agricultural sector. Some elements of the coalition began to peel away, notably Cobos who used his casting vote against the moves in the agricultural sector in the Senate and has since been shunned by the Kirchners. The Radical leadership began preparations to reach out to the Radicales K. In April 2009, the Radicals agreed to allow Cobos to rejoin at the end of his term as vice- president, and ConFe is lining up agreements with them and the Civic Coalition for the June elections.

He is notable for his oration delivered at the funeral of Black Buffalo in 1813. Big Elk led his people during a time of increasing changes, with threats from Sioux warfare, disease and European-American encroachment. He created alliances to protect his people and prepare for a future which he thought depended on a closer relationship with the United States. He was willing to exchange land for the promise of protection for his people but was often disappointed by the failures of the US government. History Chief Big Elk by George Catlin, 1832 Big Elk struggled to protect his people from encroachment by European Americans, but more importantly, from warfare by the Sioux. The Omaha suffered from smallpox epidemics in the early nineteenth century and were decimated because of poor immunity to the European introduced disease and also because of sporadic immunisation programmes to the indigenous peoples, even though they were most at risk. Big Elk was among the Native American allies of the United States during the War of 1812, through his relations with the French Creole trader Lucien Fontenelle from New Orleans, who served as an interpreter. The chief also was seeking United States aid for protection against the Sioux. Big Elk admired some aspects of European-American culture and made strategic alliances through the marriages of his daughters: two married prominent European-American fur traders. His mixed-race grandson Logan Fontenelle worked with the US Indian agent as interpreter for the Omaha from the age of 15. As the Omaha had a patrilineal kinship system, Logan Fontenelle was not considered to belong to the tribe because his father was white, a man of French-American ancestry from New Orleans. The Omaha classified Fontenelle as a white man. Melvin Randolph Gilmore, \\"The True Logan Fontenelle\\", Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64-65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011 In 1843 Chief Big Elk had designated his adopted son Joseph LaFlesche as his successor; LaFlesche was a M√©tis fur trader of Ponca and French-Canadian descent, who lived for many years with the Omaha. Highly assimilated to the tribe, as Big Elk taught him its culture and the role of chief, LaFlesche served as principal chief from 1853/1855-1888. He was one of the six chiefs who signed the 1854 treaty with the US that ceded the last major portions of Omaha land. He encouraged the Omaha to become educated and to adopt some European-American ways. Logan Fontenelle was increasingly important to the Omaha after 1853, serving as interpreter during their negotiations for land sales. Fontenelle served as interpreter to the chiefs in Washington, DC, during negotiation of their last treaty. He was one of the seven signatories to the 1854 treaty, perhaps because he was the only Omaha speaker who was fluent in English. Under this treaty, the Omaha ceded most of their land to the United States in exchange for annuities and goods. The whites considered Fontenelle a chief but, as noted above, the Omaha did not even consider him to be a member of the tribe. In 1855, he was killed by members of an enemy Sioux band while out hunting with Omaha men. Marriage and family George Miller of chief Big Elk's tipi. It was decorated with two painted river steam boats to symbolize his friendship with the Euro-Americans and his importance as a chief Big Elk was married to an Omaha woman. They had a son Standing Elk and several daughters, including Mitain and Me-um-bane. As with many other Native American tribes, the Omaha were used to absorbing captives, orphans and honored allies into their culture as adopted members. Similarly, Big Elk arranged or permitted two of his daughters to marry prominent European-American fur traders, with whom he wanted to make alliances to strengthen his family's connections. He admired some aspects of American culture and believed he could help his people by these alliances. In 1814, during the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, his daughter Mitain (also spelled Mitahne) married Manuel Lisa, recently appointed by the governor of the Missouri Territory as the US Indian agent on the Upper Missouri River. He had been a prominent fur trader in the Omaha territory for years, setting up Fort Lisa in what is now North Omaha, Nebraska. Lisa returned to the fur trade after the war's conclusion. Mitain was what was known as his \\"country wife\\", and they lived together when he wintered in the Omaha territory. At the time, Lisa was legally married to a European-American woman in St. Louis, where she lived full-time. After her death in 1817, he married a second woman of European descent in St. Louis.Chittenden, 134 Lisa and Mitain had a daughter Rosalie and son Christopher together.Chittenden, 127Kira Gale, \\"Escape from Death and a Sister‚Äôs Revenge: the Daughters of Omaha Chief Big Elk\\" , Lewis and Clark Road Trips, 13 April 2007, accessed 21 August 2011 In 1819 Lisa took Rosalie back to St. Louis with him for Catholic schooling, but Mitain refused to give him custody of Christopher. She was supported in this by Big Elk. About 1823‚Äì24, Big Elk's daughter Me-um-bane married the fur trader Lucien Fontenelle, from a wealthy French Creole family in New Orleans. He set up a trading post on the Missouri River near what is now Bellevue, Nebraska and lived full-time in the territory. They had five children together. Their first son Logan Fontenelle was born in 1825. He became an interpreter for the Omaha, beginning to work for the US Indian agent after his father's death in 1840. Some historians contend that the younger Fontenelle was elected a chief of the Omaha in 1853; he was documented as serving as interpreter to the chiefs during the negotiations for land sales that were taking place. While 60 Omaha chiefs had held council to negotiate with the Agent Greenwood in January 1854, Fontenelle accompanied a delegation of seven chiefs who went to Washington, DC later that year to complete negotiations for a treaty with the United States. He was one of two interpreters and the only one of the Omaha speakers to be literate in English. The Omaha ceded most of their land in exchange for annuities and goods, and resettlement on a reservation in what is now northeastern Nebraska. Big Elk formally adopted the trader Joseph LaFlesche as his son, thus incorporating him into the Omaha. (His mother Waoowinchtcha was a Ponca and reported as a relative of Big Elk.\\"Joseph La Flesche: Sketch of the Life of the Head Chief of the Omaha\\", first published in the (Bancroft, Nebraska) Journal; reprinted in The Friend, 1889, accessed 23 August 2011) LaFlesche was the son of Joseph LaFlesche, a French-Canadian fur trader with the American Fur Company, who had worked for many years with the Omaha and other nations between the Platte and the Nebraska rivers. The younger LaFlesche had started accompanying his father on trading trips at age 10, and began working for the AFC at age 16. In 1843 Big Elk designated LaFlesche as his successor, and LaFlesche seriously studied the tribal ways and customs to prepare for chieftainship. LaFlesche appeared to join the tribal council about 1849, after he had settled with the Omaha at the Bellevue Agency. LaFlesche was highly assimilated and cultured, and married Mary Gale, daughter of an American surgeon and his Iowa wife. LaFlesche served as principal chief of the Omaha from 1855 to 1888. During this period of major transition after the tribe moved to a reservation, he encouraged the Omaha to become educated in English, to accept Christianity, and to adopt some European-American ways. He and Mary encouraged education for their children, and several went to school and college in the East. They became prominent reformers and leaders among the Omaha: one of the daughters became the first Native American woman physician, another became an activist and reformer for Omaha rights, and a third became financial manager for the tribe. After Mary's death about 1855, LaFlesche married Tainne, an Omaha woman. Their son Francis La Flesche (born 1857) also became educated. He worked as an ethnologist for the Smithsonian Institution in a close partnership with the anthropologist Alice Fletcher; he wrote books and research about the Omaha and the Osage, and helped preserve their traditions.

He was a grandson of √çmar and a member of the U√≠ √çmair. Ragnall was most probably among those Vikings expelled from Dublin in 902, whereafter he may have ruled territory in southern Scotland or the Isle of Man. In 917, he and his kinsman Sitric C√°ech sailed separate fleets to Ireland where they won several battles against local kings. Sitric successfully recaptured Dublin and established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England. He fought against Constant√≠n mac √Åeda, King of Scotland, in the Battle of Corbridge in 918, and although the battle was not decisive it did allow Ragnall to establish himself as king at York. Ragnall's rule was immediately challenged by a group of Christian Vikings opposed to his paganism. This group tried to organise an alliance with √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians but this attempt was cut short by her death in 918. His reign saw three issues of coinage, although this was perhaps done on the orders of Hrotheweard, Archbishop of York. In 920 Ragnall and his neighbouring northern kings came to an agreement with Edward the Elder, King of the Anglo-Saxons, though it is a matter of dispute whether Ragnall recognised Edward as his overlord. Ragnall died the following year, whereupon the Annals of Ulster describe him as \\"king of the fair foreigners and the dark foreigners\\". He was succeeded as king by Sitric C√°ech. Background The ruling Vikings of Dublin were expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by M√°el Finnia mac Flannac√°n, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirec√°in, overking of Leinster.Downham, p. 26 Those Vikings that survived the capture of the city split into different groups; some went to France, some to England, and some to Wales.Downham, pp. 27‚Äì28; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 429; Annales Cambriae, s.a. 902; Brenhinedd y Saesson, s.a. 903; Brut y Tywysogyon (Pen. 20), s.a. 903; Brut y Tywysogyon (RBH), s.a. 903 Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied in the years immediately following this expulsion, perhaps indicating only the ruling elite were forced to leave.Downham, p. 27 However, Viking raids on Irish settlements continued, and in 914, a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford.Sawyer, p. 97; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 914; Chronicon Scotorum, s.a. 914; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 914 The arrival of this fleet marked the re-establishment of Viking rule over parts of Ireland, and was followed by more Vikings settling in Limerick the following year.Downham, p. 31 The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals. Some of the annals, such as the Annals of Ulster, are believed to be contemporary accounts, whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable. A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also complied at later dates, in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas.Radner, pp. 322‚Äì325 According to Downham: \\"apart from these additions [of saga fragments], Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records, albeit partisan in their presentation of events\\".Downham, p. 12 Biography Ragnall is presumed to have left Dublin with the rest of the ruling Vikings in 902.Hart It appears he settled in southern Scotland or the Isle of Man, and is described by some scholars as a King of Mann.Hart; Woolf, p. 148 He may or may not have ruled territory in western and northern Scotland including the Hebrides and Northern Isles, but contemporary sources are silent on this matter.Woolf, p. 148 The earliest mention of him in the Irish Annals is in 914 when he is described as defeating B√°rid mac Oitir in a naval battle off the Isle of Man.Downham, pp. 267‚Äì268 B√°rid may have been a son of Otir mac Iercne, the man who killed a son of Auisle in 883, or a son of Jarl Otir, who later accompanied Ragnall and fought alongside him in England.Downham, p. 248 Ragnall is mentioned in the annals again in 917 when he and Sitric, another grandson of √çmar, are described as leading their fleets to Ireland.Downham, pp. 31, 273‚Äì274 Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Gl√∫ndub, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. The Vikings fought against the men of the U√≠ N√©ill at Mag Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 917; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 917 This was followed by another at the Battle of Confey (also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait), against Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster, who died in the battle. Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland, and Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, where he established himself as king. The Annals of Ulster record Ragnall, with his kinsman Gofraid and two earls, Ottir Iarla and Gragabai, leaving Ireland in 918 to fight against Constant√≠n son of √Åed, the king of Scotland. According to the northern English historical tract Historia de Sancto Cuthberto (completed in the 11th century but probably with access to earlier material) Constant√≠n was assisting Ealdred son of Eadwulf, ruler of all or some part of Northumbria. The battle, known as the Battle of Corbridge, was indecisive, but this appears to have been enough to allow Ragnall to establish himself as king at York.Downham, pp. 91‚Äì95; Woolf, pp. 142‚Äì144 & 191. Ragnall moved quickly and soon imposed his authority on the Vikings there.Forte, Oram and Pedersen, p. 102 His position as king of Northumbria was immediately challenged by a group of Christian Vikings (York was mostly Christian by this time) who opposed Ragnall's paganism. This faction approached √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians, an Anglo-Saxon and a Christian, with an offer of submission, but negotiations were ended by her premature death in June 918.Forte, Oram and Pedersen, p. 103 Ragnall had three separate issues of coins produced while he ruled York, showing that the machinery of government in Northumbria continued to function, though it is possible that the day-to-day working of mints and collection of taxes rested with the Archbishop of York, Hrotheweard, rather than with Ragnall.Hart; Woolf, p. 191. The southern Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the Elder, made some manner of agreement with Ragnall and the other northern kings in about 920, the exact nature of which is unclear. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that they \\"chose him [Edward] as father and lord\\",Woolf, pp. 145‚Äì147; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 920 perhaps indicating that Ragnall acknowledged Edward's overlordship, although many scholars have contested this as unlikely.Hart; Woolf, pp. 145‚Äì147; Downham, pp. 95‚Äì97. Ragnall died in 921, and is described as \\"king of the fair foreigners and the dark foreigners\\" by the Annals of Ulster.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 921 It may be that he was already dying in 920 when the Irish annals note the departure of Sitric from Dublin, replaced there by Gofraid. Sitric succeeded Ragnall as king of the Northumbrians at York. Family In the annals Ragnall is identified by the use of \\"ua √çmair\\", meaning \\"grandson of √çmar\\", but never with a patronymic. As such, it is not possible to identify which of the three known sons of √çmar (B√°rid, Sichfrith or Sitriuc) ‚Äì if any ‚Äì was the father of Ragnall. One possible reason for the lack of a patronym might be that Ragnall was the child of a son of √çmar who never ruled Dublin, or who spent most of his time outside Ireland, thus making Ragnall's legitimacy to rule Dublin dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his father. Another possibility is that Ragnall was a grandson of √çmar through a daughter, again with his right to rule dependent on his grandfather.Downham, p. 34 Sitric's kinsmen √çmar, Sitric, Amla√≠b and Gofraid are the other known grandsons of √çmar identified by the use of \\"ua √çmair\\". All except for Amla√≠b ruled as either King of Dublin or King of Northumbria at one time or another.Downham, p. 29 An individual identified as Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals may have been Ragnall's son, though no name is given.Downham, p. 64 In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week he was killed by Matud√°n, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king.Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 942; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 942 The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.Downham, p. 64; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 942 =Family tree= Notes References =Citations= =Primary sources= * Accessed via Internet Archive. * Accessed via Internet Archive.  * Accessed via Internet Archive. * * =Secondary sources=  * Subscription or UK public library membership required.  * * External links * * CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork.

Plot Toby Michaels (Oliver Robins) and his father are monster fanatics and his room is full of monster movie memorabilia. When a new neighbor moves in, Toby investigates to see if there are new children in the neighborhood. He meets the neighbor Emile Bendictson (Ralph Bellamy) who notices Toby's monster interest and his vast collection through the window. In the course of the conversation, Bendictson reveals that he is a vampire but Toby does not believe him because Bendictson is outside during daylight and vampires - according to lore - cannot be outside in the sun. Bendictson laughs and Toby goes home to tell his parents. They dismiss his story. Toby decides to spy on Bendictson, who has enough strength to lift the front end of his car while polishing it. Toby gets caught by Bendictson and tries to protect himself with garlic and a crucifix. Emile laughs again and tells him that most of what he has read about vampires is not accurate. To illustrate this, Bendictson treats the boy to a garlic-filled Italian dinner, and tells Toby he wishes to live out the rest of his days. Later, Toby goes back to his house and finds hospital bags of blood in the bottom of a closet. Then Toby begins to get sick which his parents think is a case of the flu. Bendictson comes to Toby's window and invites him to go for a walk. They go to the cemetery and he explains to Toby the truth about vampires. He tells him that they are like people who are infected with a thirst and Toby doesn't quite understand. Bendictson also explains that after he changed he had to move constantly and says that the presence of vampires incites a genetic mutation in average humans. He pulls Toby closer and Toby sneezes incessantly to illustrate his point. Humans have a genetic aversion to \\"his kind\\" as he puts it, thus he can't stay in one place too long as nearby humans will mutate and try to kill him. Before they leave the cemetery, he shows Toby how to enjoy lightning bugs in the cornfield, as it was something he had learned as a boy. Toby becomes even sicker and so do his parents, and it turns out all the neighbors in a five block radius are becoming ill. After midnight, Toby and his parents begin to change, mutating into the monsters Bendictson described. Bendictson seems to know that his end is coming so he leaves his front door open and is killed by a pack of monsters that enter his house. The next morning, Bendictson's battered body is being loaded into an ambulance. The neighbors all mourn his passing and do not realize that it was they who killed him. That night, Toby takes his dad and shows him the lightning bugs in the field and his dad sneezes.

History  The IAC began at a seminar in Dakar in 1984 with a focus on fighting harmful practices relating to female genital mutilation (FGM), childbirth, nutrition and food, early marriage; and promoting traditional practices considered beneficial, such as breastfeeding and baby massage.Momoh, Comfort. Female Genital Mutilation. Radcliffe Publishing, 2005, p. 163. Fighting FGM is the main focus of their work. Now based in Addis Ababa, the IAC also has 32 national branches (known as National Committees) in 28 countries in Africa. It has a liaison office in Geneva and 15 affiliates in Europe, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and USA. In 1990, the IAC adopted the term \\"female genital mutilation\\" to describe the procedure previously referred to as \\"female circumcision\\". According to a 1995 publication, the main focus of their strategy for eliminating FGM is through education.

History In conjunction with its introduction to the market, the Weidner Multi-Lingual Word Processing System was first reported on in 1978 in the Wall Street Journal as ‚ÄúQuadrupling Translation Volume‚Äù and the Deseret News as ‚Äúhalving translation costs and of increasing output by at least 400 percent.‚Äù This new technology was demonstrated to translation experts on September 12, 1978 at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Thomas Bauman and Leland Wright of the American Translators Association who had arrived on September 11, 1978, in Provo, Utah to view a demonstration of the Weidner Multi-Lingual Word Processing System. After attending the demonstration Thomas Bauman said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been so converted to anything so fast in my life.‚Äù He subsequently extended an invitation for Wydner to attend the annual meeting of the American Translators Association that following October where the Weidner Machine Translation System hailed a hoped-for breakthrough in machine translation. (Geoffrey Kingscott, 1992) The Weidner \\"Multi-Lingual Word Processing System\\" is based on the research and work of Bruce Wydner, as demonstrated in his copyrighted text books. The Fastest Way To Learn Spanish Is To See IT! (Learn to read Spanish in 24 hours) ¬©1971 and 1975. This technology is the basis of the Weidner Multi-Lingual Word Processing System, and was programmed for processing human languages on the low-cost computers of the late 1970s and as part of machine translation and word processing software today. The Weidner Engine works by mapping the approximately 460,000 words in the English Dictionary (as in other target languages) to 10,000 \\"Root\\" words/thoughts (an Interlingual Lexicon). Additionally, inflected, conjugated word changes and endings are automatically parsed from the root words by a parsing engine, then associated to a specific word type by language rules based on the sense of sight. Each word (or expression) is parsed, compared to the spell-check lexicon and mapped to the interlingual lexicon for subsequent translation to the target language. If the target language is the same as the inputted language the language rules result is a word processed document in the original language. Tools included an aid for spelling and alternate word look- up. Translated experts at the Commission of the European Union, said that this (to them) \\"new translation system\\" of Bruce Wydner \\"renewed\\" their \\"hope\\" for Machine Translation that would lead them to \\"Better Translation for Better Communication.\\" (G. Van Slype, 1983) Translation Associates and Eyring Research Institute The company responsible for the production of the Weidner Multi-Lingual Word Processing System included Bruce Wydner and his friends (Warren Davidson, Dale Miller, and Lowell Randall) who formed, the Inns of the Temple, Inc., a 501(c)3 Corporation, dba Translation Associates. Bruce Wydner (who legally had his last name changed to be pronounced properly), representing his company, made an exclusive marketing contract with his brother Stephen Weidner, the contract restricted the transfer of any development rights to his brother's company, and Bruce Wydner made a 15-year non-compete non-circumvent contract with Eyring Research Institute in Provo, Utah to engage their computing services in the creation of the Weidner Multi- lingual Word Processor, and for the programming skills of Eyring's bi-lingual programmer employee Bruce Bastian, Bruce Wydner paid Eyring Research Institute $25.00/hr for programming time of which $5.00/hr went to pay Bastian. Machine translation In 1982 Stephen Weidner began to have financial problems over a Research and Development Tax Shelter he had created, as a result Weidner Communications Inc. suffered, disputes over Weidner's assets were taken to court. In 1984 Stephen Weidner's original Company was purchased by Bravis International, one of Japan‚Äôs largest translation companies, as part of a settlement of the court ordered liquidation of Weidner Communication‚Äôs assets, but Weidner Communications Inc. still maintained offices in Chicago and in Paris. During the mid-1980s Weidner Communications, Inc., (WCC), was the largest translation company by sales volume in the United States. (Margaret M. Perscheid, 1985) Later the Japanese sold Wydner‚Äôs technology to Intergraph Corporation of Alabama who later sold it to Transparent Language, Inc. of New Hampshire. Bruce Wydner, the principal agent for the Inns of the Temple Inc., that retained the research and development rights to the Weidner Multi-lingual Word Processor, separated himself from his brother in early 1979 and no longer supplied any updated software developments. Weidner had offended his brother over a matter of having Eyring Research Institute send their bi- lingual employee to remove Wydners intellectual property from his home, of which Wydner claims was stolen from him. (Wydner vs Novell, WordPerfect, Ashton, Bastan, et. all, 2003) =SDL International, Enterprise Translation Server= The Weidner Engine is the basis of the website freetranslation.com. The original Weidner Engine was recently (2001) bought by SDL International of London, England. =Lionbridge, iTranslator= A copy of the Weidner Multi- Lingual Word Processing software was requested by the German Government for the Siemens Corporation of Germany in September 1980 and was nicknamed the Siemens-Weidner Engine (originally English-German). This revolutionary multi- lingual word processing engine became foundational in the development of the Metal MT project according to John White of the Siemens Corporation. (The Deseret News, Friday, Aug. 22, 1980.) After the Metal MT development Rights to the Siemens-Weidner Engine were sold to a Belgium company, Lernout & Hauspie. The Siemens copy of the Weidner Multi-lingual Word Processing software has since been acquired through the purchase of assets of Lernout & Hauspie by Bowne Global Solutions, Inc., which was later acquired by Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. and is demonstrated in their itranslator software. Word Processing =Microsoft Word= Lernout & Hauspie sold a copy of Wydner's language technology (The Siemens/Weidner Engine) aka Lernout and Hauspie Speech Products N.V. to the Microsoft Corporation to be used in Microsoft Word. =WordPerfect= Eyring Research Institute was a development bed to Bruce Bastian (co-founder of WordPerfect) who was one of the original programmer helpers for Bruce Wydner in the production of the original Weidner Spanish-English Multi-lingual Word Processor, a foundation to the Wordperfect Mono-lingual Word Processor, produced first for English then for Spanish. (Utah Weekly, 2003) Ronald G. Hansen, the President of the Eyring Research Institute, reportedly asked Bruce Wydner the following in 1978: \\"Bruce Bastian says that this Multilingual Wordprocessor of yours has a lot more uses than just translating languages. He says that it could be used to produce monolingual word processors and wants to know if you will let him do that.\\" (Utah Weekly, 2003) Alan Ashton said that, ‚ÄúBruce Bastian did all of the formatting of the Word Processor Program, the main part of the Program that makes it work so well.\\" That Format was expressed in that 1989 WordPerfect Users Manual as, \\"If you want to compose the Rules to process all of the words in a language, you must start with the Rules to process the most-used words.\\" =Intelligent Systems Technology (ARPA) and (SISTO)= Eyring Research Institute was instrumental to the U.S. Air Force Missile Directorate at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah to produce in top military secrecy, the Intelligent Systems Technology Software that was foundational to the later named Reagan Star Wars program. After the ALPAC Report in 1966, President David O. McKay of the LDS Church, apparently, approached one US Government operation that continued seeking the technological advances in Human Language Technology, the Missile Directorate of the US Air Force, at Hill Air Force Base, to fund the transfer, in Top Military Secrecy, of any such technological advances, from the BYU Linguistics Department‚Äôs Project to ERI facilities, in order for it to try to take any Human Language Technology from there to make it, through collaboration with the US Defense Department‚Äôs Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and its Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office (SISTO), into Missile Guidance Software that would be superior to any producible by the Soviet Union.

He has been awarded on numerous occasions for his work, and is nowadays a respected literary personality in the Basque Country. In the early 80s, he was member of the Basque separatist group ETA. In 1985 he escaped from prison and since then he lived underground for decades while continuing to create and publish. In November 2016, it was revealed that he lives in Cuba, where he holds a position as lecturer at the University of Havana. Biography He earned a Basque Philology PhD from the University of Deusto, Bilbao and started working as a Basque language teacher. He taught phonetics in the Bergara center of the UNED and also in the Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea and wrote pieces for Zeruko Argia, Anaitasuna, Jakin and Oh Euzkadi magazines. He started the Pott Banda group along with Bernardo Atxaga, Manu Ertzilla, Ruper Ordorika, Jon Juaristi and Joxemari Iturralde. He also created the Ibaizabal magazine. He worked with short narrations and also translated books, notably Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. In 1980, while a member of ETA he was arrested by Spanish police and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Since then the realities of prison have appeared in his writings. In 1985 on San Fermin day (July 7) he escaped from prison with I√±aki Pikabea as there was a concert in the jail with Basque singer Imanol Larzabal. They hid themselves inside a loudspeaker. The Basque Radical Rock group Kortatu created the song Sarri, Sarri in honor of this. The escape was planned with theater critic Mikel Albisu, who would become the leader of ETA. During three months, the two fugitives and Antza were hiding in a flat in San Sebasti√°n, before moving to France. Since that day he has lived in secret and the topic of banishment/exile is foremost in his writing. In his novel Lagun Izoztua (in Basque The Frozen Friend) he writes about banishment. He has written books and poems which have been sung by different Basque singers as Jexuxmai Lopetegi, Mikel Laboa, Ruper Ordorika and Fermin Muguruza. There is also an audio book called Hau da ene ondasun guzia with his voice reading poems and many songs performed by different singers. On 3 October 2011, he was awarded the Euskadi Prize for Essay in Basque for his work Moroak gara behelaino artean? (Are we Moors in the fog?) on the miseries of colonialism; however, the Basque Government withheld the prize sum of 18,000 euros until the author's status was resolved. On the same day, judges and lawyers interviewed by Cadena SER confirmed that Sarrionandia could not be prosecuted by Spanish law, as more than 20 years had passed since his original prison sentence and his escape. While terrorist acts have no time limit, the provision applies only if there was at least one victim. After a month and a half, the Spanish High Court confirmed to the Basque government that Sarrionandia was 'clean', with no criminal or civil liability. The prize amount was handed over to his family. According to Spanish counter-terrorism sources, the writer has been hiding in Cuba. In 2014, he accepted the invitation of Mondragon University to give two lectures in Eskoriatza. It would have been his first public appearance since his escape in 1985. However, he cancelled the trip because he did not obtain the traveling permissions he needed. Even though the Cuban government has not acknowledged his presence, El Mundo reported in 2015 that Sarrionandia went to the Spanish consulate to regulate his status. Bernardo Atxaga divided Sarrionandia's works in four distinct chronological phases. In the first phase, a young Sarrionandia wanted to be a part of Basque literature through a literary magazine. In the second phase, the imprisoned poet talked about suffering (La literatura y la revoluci√≥n). In the third phase, after his escape, his themes were exile and homeland (Geograf√≠a, He llegado a casa casi a medianoche). In the current phase, \\"the brightest of them all,\\" Sarrionandia is more serene, with a sense of humor and irony.

The school is part of the New York City Department of Education school system.  School Building and Campus  The school building located on 44th Road (in Long Island City) was built on the former site of a metal plating factory and is leased by the New York City Department of Education. That has cte academies  History  Information Technology High School opened in 2003 and graduated its first class in 2007. The school has gone through many principals. The first principal, Jeffrey Levin, was let go after the first school year. Nora Lee Montemerano was then brought in as principal. After her first year, Ms. Montemerano took almost an entire year off because of a medical situation. During that time, (the third year of the school), Assistant Principal Joseph Reed took over as interim principal. Ms. Montemerano returned towards the end of that third year. Ms. Montemerano served as principal during the schools fourth year, but did not make it through the fifth year. She resigned in April and did not complete the fifth year. Dr. Nancy Casella was brought in as Interim Acting principal to finish the schools fifth year and replace Ms. Montemerano. Dr. Casella was awarded the job as principal for the school's sixth and seventh year. Dr. Casella was relieved of her position about 3 months into the schools eighth year (article). Ms. Patricia Martin was named the Interim Acting principal upon Dr. Casella's departure. Her term lasted less than two years. Joseph Reed, who has been an Assistant Principal at the school since its second year was named principal for the start of the school year in September 2012, and remains principal. Through Reed, the school has gone through many changes; some negative and some positive. In 2014, former assistant principal Cedric Hinds was found guilty of organizing an exam cheating scandal to benefit his son. (article) Sports The school has established many sports programs over the years, including baseball, basketball, bowling, football, fencing, cross country, indoor and outdoor track, wrestling, volleyball, and soccer. However, none were as popular as football and basketball in the earlier years of the school. = Basketball = The basketball team has had the most success in their playoff runs even though there were multiple coaching changes. Head Coach Jose Ferrer currently holds the longest tenure with the team leading the boys varsity team to the playoffs. They had many successes, but have not won finals yet. The Girls varsity basketball team has made the playoffs every year under Head Coach Geoffe Serrano. The team's record during the season varies each year, but through it all Playoffs is always an accomplished goal. = Football = Football has also had its share of success. The team has been recognized as a predominant contender in the PSAL Cup Division for every year since the team's 2006 inception. However, the team did not reach the playoffs until the 2009-2010 season. The Blackhawks successful run came to a halt in the semi final game against Automotive High School (20-0). Despite the loss, the team's defense has been ranked number one every year since it began. As of the 2011-2012 season, David Kent, who had been the Assistant Head Coach since the start of the program, is currently the head coach.

Though Wong was only tall, he excelled, and was known as one of the finest Chinese American basketball players in the 1940s. He was nicknamed Willie \\"Woo Woo\\" Wong by a local sportswriter because fans would shout \\"Woo Woo\\" when he scored. Early life, education and sports career Wong was the third of seven children, and his family lived across the street from Chinese Playground, where he learned to play basketball. A sister, Helen Wong Lum, would also go on to stand out as a basketball and tennis player. Wong received his first basketball as a gift in 1939 from an uncle he had never before met. He studied at the St. Mary's School, and then starred at Poly and Lowell high schools in San Francisco, being named to the All-City team in 1945. Wong served in the Army after graduating from high school. Wong played for an all-Chinese American basketball team sponsored by the H. K. and Frank Sports Shop (aka the Chinese All-Stars) in 1946 and 1947. The Chinese All-Stars played a series of exhibition games against Santa Cruz city league teams; the first, held March 8, 1946, saw the Santa Cruz Sportsman's Shop team win by the score of 50‚Äì46. The Santa Cruz Sentinel-News reported the \\"Chinese scat cagers\\" were \\"[t]errific crowd pleasers\\" and \\"made swell passes and plenty of nice baskets\\" but \\"couldn't beat the backboard control of the Sportsmen\\". In the second, which was held three weeks later on March 29 at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium to benefit the local Red Cross, the Chinese All-Stars prevailed, 50‚Äì41. The Sentinel-News noted the Chinese All-Stars featured \\"a smooth passing, fast dribbling\\" attack and had Chinese numerals on their jerseys \\"which gave the scorers and announcer a tough time.\\" The Chinese All-Stars returned to Santa Cruz to play the Hotel team, preseason favorites for the Santa Cruz City League title, on December 16, 1946, winning by a score of 39‚Äì34. The Hotelmen won the next match on February 21, 1947, 49‚Äì44 in overtime. Willie Wong scored to tie the game at 42 with ten seconds left in regulation, and led the All-Stars with sixteen points for the game. The team from San Francisco, then renamed the Chinese Saints, beat the Hotelmen in their third final game on March 21, 1947, by a score of 46‚Äì39. Wong scored 20 for the winners. In 1947, the Saints won the first Oriental-American basketball championship by defeating the Hawaiian All Stars 48‚Äì43. Willie Wong scored 27 for the Saints. The Saints repeated their championship in 1948, defeating the Berkeley Nisei 49‚Äì45. Wong scored 16 points to lead all scorers. In 1948, Wong was invited to fly to Shanghai to try out for the Chinese Olympic basketball team. Sign for Willie \\"Woo Woo\\" Wong Playground at 830 Sacramento St He was recruited to the University of San Francisco (USF) in 1948 by Pete Newell, where he played off the bench for the 1949‚Äì50 varsity squad. USF attended the NIT in 1950, and Wong became the first Chinese American to play in Madison Square Garden. After playing for USF, Wong continued to compete at various local and national tournaments as part of the Saints. Wong died on September 5, 2005 of leukemia at the age of 79 in Fremont, California. Legacy To honor Wong's athletic achievements, local Chinatown residents successfully petitioned the City and County of San Francisco to rename the \\"Chinese Playground\\", where he played as a child and developed his basketball skills, to \\"Willie \\"Woo Woo\\" Wong Playground\\". The University of San Francisco posthumously inducted Wong into its Hall of Fame in the spring of 2007. Wong's family accepted the honor on his behalf.

The ravens appear in traditional Danish folksongs, where they are described as originating from ravens who consume the bodies of the dead on the battlefield, as capable of turning into the form of a knight after consuming the heart of a child, and, alternately, as half-wolf and half-raven creatures. Folklore According to Danish folklore recorded in the late 1800s, when a king or chieftain was killed in battle and not found and buried, ravens came and ate him. The ravens became valravne. The valravne that ate the king's heart gained human knowledge and could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were \\"terrible animals\\".Kristensen (1980:132). In another account, a valravn is described as a peaceless soul in search of redemption that flies by night (but never day) and can only free itself from its animal countenance by consuming the blood of a child. This is reflected in a Danish traditional song that describes how, after refusing offers of riches, the Valravn makes an agreement with a maiden to take her to her betrothed after she promises the valravn her first born son. After the agreement, the valravn flies away. In time, the couple have a child and the Valravn returns, and asks the maiden if she has forgotten her promise. The valravn takes the child away, and tears into the chest of his won wager and consumes the blood contained within the child's heart. As a result, the valravn transforms into a knight. This traditional song was reinterpreted by the electro-folk band Sorten Muld and became a hit for them in 1997, under the title Ravnen. Other accounts describe valravns as monsters that are half- wolf and half-raven.Olrik (1909:43‚Äì46). Interpretations and theories According to 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm, the \\"vilde ravn or vilde valravn\\" (\\"wild raven or wild Valravn\\") take \\"exactly the place of the diabolical trold\\" in Danish folk songs. Grimm proposes an Old High German equivalent to the Danish valravn; *walahraban.Grimm (2004:997). Modern influence The Valravn has inspired occasional pop culture references, including an early 20th century book of short storiesStuckenberg (1908). as well as the Faroese musical group bearing the name, who play a form of traditional music.Valravn online: Valravn was the title of a Danish Germanic Neopagan magazine published from 2002 to 2007.Valravn magazine online: All issues for download: The name is also mentioned in Danish children's books.For example Bjerre (1991:10). The 2017 video game Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice features Valravn as \\"god of illusion\\", a stage boss the player must defeat to proceed in the game. Valravn appear as an enemy in the 5th bestiary of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, using Grimm's Vilderavn moniker for the creature.

Odbody is loosely based on \\"a stranger\\", a character in Philip Van Doren Stern's 1943 booklet The Greatest Gift. In 1977's It Happened One Christmas, a remake of the 1946 film, a gender-reversed Clarence appeared as Clara Oddbody, played by Cloris Leachman. The 1986 musical A Wonderful Life features Odbody, who was played by David Hyde Pierce in its 2005 rendition. Biography On Christmas Eve, 1945, George Bailey, an honest businessman in the town of Bedford Falls facing financial ruin and disgrace, is contemplating committing suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river because he mistakenly believes the payout on his life insurance policy would solve the problems confronting his business and family. Two celestial beings observe this, and decide to send an angel to save George. Unfortunately, the only angel available is Clarence Odbody, an AS2 (Angel Second Class), who after 200 years has yet to win his wings. To prepare for this assignment, Clarence is shown several scenes from George's life that show some of his selfless acts. Sent to Earth, Clarence finds George standing on the bridge about to leap into the river. Before George can jump off, Clarence jumps in the water, which prompts George to dive in to rescue him. Clarence introduces himself as they are drying out in the tollhouse keeper's shack. George expresses a wish that he had never been born, and Clarence grants his wish in order to show George what the world would be like if he had never existed. George discovers that his war-hero brother, Harry, had drowned in a frozen lake as a child, as George was not there to save him. He finds his wife Mary unmarried and childless, and then sees that the town and its businesses have turned to a raucous lifestyle. As George comes to realize the positive effects that he has had on others' lives, he regrets his hasty wish, and Clarence restores him to his previous life.\\"AFI's Top 10\\", American Film Institute As George now appreciates his life, despite its difficulties, Clarence wins his wings. As shown in the 1990 film Clarence, in December 1989, Clarence again comes to Earth to assist a human, Rachel Logan, who is in need of his care. Asked to help her by his fellow angel, Logan's deceased husband, he assists her to again appreciate life and her children, and saves her from suicide by bringing her to heaven for a brief visit with her husband. During his time on Earth he also shows that he has the power to take on the looks of a human, in this case Rachel's son Brent, whom he portrays so the boy doesn't get expelled from high school.

The winery, producing both white and red wine, is located in the south of France, in the commune of Aniane. Despite its modest designation and location, the vineyard has received widespread acknowledgement, described by The Times to taste like a \\"Latour\\" and by the French gastronomic guide GaultMillau as the \\"Lafite Rothschild of the Languedoc-Roussillon\\", it is frequently referred to as the Grand cru of the Languedoc. History On land sold by the Daumas family to a former glove manufacturer Aim√© Guibert, wines were first planted at this vineyard in 1974. Following the recommendation of Henri Enjalbert, a professor of geography at the University of Bordeaux, whose assessment of the terroir determined the microclimate to be uncharacteristically favourable for cultivation of wine in such a warm region, the first vintage was produced in 1978 with the assistance of the oenologist √âmile Peynaud. Mas de Daumas Gassac came to be seen as the first to prove that a French non-appellation wine (as simply labelled Vin de Pays de l'H√©rault) may be an extremely serious, long- living red wine able to fetch prices similar to a Bordeaux classed growth.winepros.com.au. Aim√© Guibert has since featured in the documentary film Mondovino, stating that \\"wine is dead\\". Moulin de Gassac The estate also fronts a neighbouring cooperative label producing a wide range of products such as various blended and varietal wines, as well as spirits, balsamic vinegar, and an oil that is the blend of extra virgin olive oil and grape seed oil. Production Over 50 hectares are cultivated in smaller plots dispersed throughout the estate, consisting predominantly of Cabernet Sauvignon, while other grape varieties include Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Pinot noir, Tannat, as well as Nebbiolo, Barbera and Dolcetto. The white varieties are mostly Chardonnay, Viognier and Petit Manseng, but also Marsanne, Roussane, Chenin blanc, Sercial, and Muscat. The red Grand vin Mas de Daumas Gassac has an annual production of 120,000 to 150,000 bottles. In addition the estate produces a dry white Mas de Daumas Gassac Blanc, 45,000 to 60,000 bottles annually, a Mas de Daumas Gassac Ros√© Frizant -a sparkling ros√©, 8,000 to 12,000 bottles annually, and a cuv√©e exception named √âmile Peynaud with a production of 2,000 bottles.

Planck temperature Contemporary models of physical cosmology postulate that the highest possible temperature is the Planck temperature, which has the value , or about . Above about , particle energies become so large that gravitational forces between them would become as strong as other fundamental forces according to current theories. There is no existing scientific theory for the behavior of matter at these energies; a quantum theory of gravity would be required. The models of the origin of the universe based on the Big Bang theory assume that the universe passed through this temperature about (one Planck time) after the Big Bang as a result of enormous entropy expansion. Hagedorn temperature Another theory of absolute hot is based on the Hagedorn temperature,Absolute Hot. NOVA. where the thermal energies of the particles exceed the mass‚Äìenergy of a hadron particle‚Äìantiparticle pair. Instead of temperature rising, at the Hagedorn temperature more and heavier particles are produced by pair production, thus preventing effective further heating, given that only hadrons are produced. However, further heating is possible (with pressure) if the matter undergoes a phase change into a quark‚Äìgluon plasma. Therefore, this temperature is more akin to a boiling point rather than an insurmountable barrier. For hadrons, the Hagedorn temperature is , which has been reached and exceeded in LHC and RHIC experiments. However, in string theory, a separate Hagedorn temperature can be defined, where strings similarly provide the extra degrees of freedom. However, it is so high () that no current or foreseeable experiment can reach it.  Electroweak epoch  In physical cosmology, the electroweak epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe when the temperature of the universe had fallen enough that the strong force separated from the electroweak interaction, but was high enough for electromagnetism and the weak interaction to remain merged into a single electroweak interaction above the critical temperature for electroweak symmetry breaking (159.5¬±1.5 GeV in the Standard Model of particle physics). As the universe expanded and cooled, particle interactions were energetic enough to create large numbers of exotic particles, including stable W and Z bosons and Higgs bosons. In the ensuing quark epoch the remaining W and Z bosons decayed, the weak interaction became a short-range force when the Universe was filled with quark‚Äìgluon plasma.

The three will be performing at Edinburgh Fringe from 1 to 10 August 2019 at Sofi's Southside. Bible metaphysics and authorship Maggy Whitehouse is an author and teacher of the Judaic mystical system of Kabbalah with particular reference to the mystical interpretation of the teachings of Jesus and the place and role of women in the Bible era. Her latest book is A Woman's Worth, The Divine Feminine in the Hebrew Bible. Whitehouse's 2007 book The Marriage of Jesus explored the social and economic times in which Jesus lived. Her theory is that Jesus would have married, like any other young man of his times, at the age of approximately 14. Working from historical knowledge of the times (and referring to Suzanne Dixon's book The Roman Mother) Whitehouse begins from the premise that the average lifespan of a woman in Jesus' time was 27 years. As Jesus is said to have begun his ministry at approximately 30 years old, she finds it likely that he was a widower by that time. In the 1990s Whitehouse wrote a fictional trilogy about a female cousin of Jesus, including The Book of Deborah. Whitehouse's novel The Miracle Man, an updated version of the story of Christ, was published in November 2010. Background and ministry From 1993 to 2009 Whitehouse studied the Toledano Tradition of Kabbalah with Z‚Äôev ben Shimon Halevi (Warren Kenton). She has acknowledged Kenton as the inspiration for her books on Kabbalah, which she calls 'primers' for Kenton's own work. Whitehouse studied New Testament Greek at Birmingham University for a year with Mark Goodacre and David Parker. She became an interfaith funeral minister in 2003. In 2007 she was ordained into the Apostolic Church of the Risen Christ, an Independent Catholic church, part of the Ascension Alliance. Broadcasting Whitehouse presented the Sunday morning breakfast show on BBC Radio Devon between August 2016 and October 2017. She worked as breakfast presenter for BBC Radio WM and Hereward Radio in the 1980s and as assistant producer on BBC Pebble Mill At One. In 1989, Whitehouse presented and co-produced the documentary Manchuria Express {Manchuria Expressurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_fyWaJcYI} about steam engines in China as part of Channel 4's 'Voyager' series.

Carlisle was a yodeler and was a pioneer in the use of the Hawaiian steel guitar in country music. He was a brother of country music star Bill Carlisle. Biography FootprintsInTheSnow Carlisle was born in Taylorsville, Kentucky and began performing locally with cousin Lillian Truax at age 16. Truax's marriage put an end to the group, and Carlisle began playing with Wilber Ball, a guitarist and tenor harmonizer. The two toured frequently around the U.S. playing vaudeville and circus venues in the 1920s. Carlisle and Ball first played at Louisville, Kentucky radio station WHAS-AM in 1930, which made them local stars, and later that year they recorded for Gennett Records and Champion Records. In 1931, they recorded with Jimmie Rodgers. Toward the end of 1931, Carlisle signed with ARC and was offered performance slots on several radio stations, including WBT-AM in Charlotte, North Carolina, WLS-AM in Chicago and WLW-AM in Cincinnati, Ohio. Cliff's brother Bill Carlisle became his guitarist after Ball left in 1934. During the 1930s Carlisle, who recorded a large amount of material despite a hiatus from 1934 to 1936, frequently released songs with sexual connotations including barnyard metaphors (which became something of a hallmark). Carlisle toured with his son, \\"Sonny Boy Tommy,\\" to occasional consternation from authorities in areas where this contravened local child labor laws. He continued to perform on WMPS-AM in Memphis, Tennessee for several years in the 1940s, but by the 1950s had retired from music. In the 1960s, The Rooftop Singers covered his tune \\"Tom Cat Blues\\"; in its wake, Carlisle and Ball did a few reunion shows together and recorded for Rem Records. On April 2, 1983, Carlisle died at the age of 79 in Lexington, Kentucky. Legacy Carlisle's 1933 song \\"Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad\\" is featured in the 2017 video game Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

This species of soap plant is endemic to California, where it grows in the Santa Lucia Range, in the Central Coast region. There are two varieties of this plant, and both are believed to be quite rare. It is a federally listed threatened species. Description Chlorogalum purpureum is a perennial plant growing from a bulb about 3 centimeters in diameter. The narrow, wavy leaves grow at the base of the stem. The leaves are bright green and have thick midribs. There are usually one to eight leaves, but plants with up to fourteen have been noted.USFWS. Chlorogalum purpureum Five Year Review. September 2008. The stem bears flowers at widely spaced nodes. Each flower has curled tepals each less than a centimeter long in shades of blue or purple; all other Chlorogalum species have white or pink flowers. The flowers have long stamens with yellow anthers around a protruding style. The two varieties of the species can be told apart by their sizes; var. purpureum (the variety usually called purple amole) grows up to 40 centimeters tall and var. reductum (Camatta Canyon amole) reaches only 20 centimeters. About 90% of the plants are of var. purpureum. Ecology and distribution This is a plant of the Mediterranean climate with hot, rainless summers and wet winters. Purple amole, var. purpureum, is endemic to the Santa Lucia Range of Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties. It is known from only two locations, the Army installation Fort Hunter Liggett and the National Guard post Camp Roberts. There are a total of four populations, probably totalling under 10,000 total individuals.The Nature Conservancy The habitat is grassland with patches of oak woodland. The Camatta Canyon amole, var. reductum, is known only from the La Panza Range in the center of San Luis Obispo County, about 61 kilometers away from the nearest population of purple amole. There is a single population with a variable number of individuals. The population sizes are difficult to estimate because the plants bloom infrequently and go dormant for several seasons at a time.Guretzky, J. A., et al. (2005). Life history traits of the threatened purple amole (Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum). US Army Corps of Engineers Report. Both varieties of this plant grow in soil lined with cryptogamic crusts. Purple amole is often associated with undisturbed or recovering soil crusts dominated by cyanobacteria. The soils beneath are clay topped with loam and a gravelly top layer. Much of the habitat is fragmented due to a history of crop cultivation in the area.Center for Plant Conservation: var. purpureum Plant associates in the area include rusty popcornflower (Plagiobothrys nothofulvus), miniature lupine (Lupinus bicolor), California goldfields (Lasthenia californica), and yellowflower tarweed (Holocarpha virgata), as well as another soap plant species, wavyleaf soap plant (Chlorogalum pomeridianum). Camatta Canyon amole grows in dry, pebbly, red clay soils; though some sources state this plant is part of the serpentine soils flora, it is actually more often found in a unique form of laterite, and never serpentine. Floral associates include crown brodiaea (Brodiaea coronaria), bluedicks (Dichelostemma capitatum), winecup clarkia (Clarkia purpurea), and sometimes chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum). There is a positive correlation between winter rainfall amounts and the number of purple amole that bear flowers the following spring. Conservation This plant has a limited distribution in the two counties. The two populations of purple amole are secure from destruction or development of their habitat. Other potentially damaging forces include gophers, which consume the plants, and feral pigs, which eat the bulbs and trample the habitat. Camatta Canyon amole occurs in an area used by off-road vehicle enthusiasts and herds of grazing cattle; these two forces tend to damage cryptogamic soil crusts and encourage the invasion of non-native plants. Invasive plants are a main threat to both varieties, as they outcompete them and change the local fire regime; the Camatta Canyon amole occurs in a single clumped, localized population that could be reduced significantly in a wildfire. Other suggested threats to the species include military activities and road maintenance.

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting member, former Liberal Party of Australia leader Dr John Hewson on 28 February 1995. The writ for the by-election was issued on 3 March 1995. Background John Hewson was elected as the member for Wentworth in 1987, in 1988 Opposition leader John Howard appointed him Shadow Finance Minister, in May 1989 Hewson became Shadow Treasurer after Andrew Peacock replaced Howard, after Peacock lost in the 1990 election, Hewson became the Leader of the Opposition defeating Peter Reith , the Coalition lost the 1993 federal election. Hewson had pledged to resign if the Coalition lost the 1993 election, but did not do so, and despite retaining the leadership over John Howard and Bruce Reid his leadership was undermined over the next year by Alexander Downer, Peter Costello and Bronwyn Bishop. Eventually, Hewson called a leadership ballot in May 1994 which was won by Downer with Costello as his deputy. For several months, Hewson was part of the Downer shadow ministry until he was sacked by Downer in August 1994. Downer's leadership lasted until January 1995, when he resigned and John Howard won the leadership. In February 1995, Hewson resigned from Parliament. Results Aftermath The Australian Labor Party did not run a candidate in the by- election, and the two-party preferred votes went to the Australian Greens candidate who polled 34.1 per cent. The former Liberal minister Bill Wentworth (great grandson of the seat's namesake, William Wentworth) stood as an independent, and gained a primary vote of 18.9 per cent. The Liberal Party retained the seat, however, with Andrew Thomson elected to parliament.

Life and career Abbas Sahhat was born into the family of a cleric in the city of Shamakhi. He received his primary education from his father. At age 15 he started writing amateur poems. Abbas Sahhat. Kultur.gov.tr Beginning in 1892 he studied medicine in Mashhad and Tehran. After returning to Shamakhi around 1900 he abandoned his professional field, as Russian institutions did not recognize medical diplomas from Iran. Sahhat started teaching Azeri and literature first in primary schools and then in a Realschule. This period is considered the beginning of his career as a poet and playwright. In 1903 he began writing articles for the Azeri-language newspaper Sharg-i Rus, published in Tiflis. His articles mostly discussed topics in contemporary literature. Abbas Sahhat. Sayt.ws As a poet, Sahhat adhered generally to romanticism. His poetry was influenced by Ali bey Huseynzade, editor of the ' magazine in 1905‚Äì1907. Sahhat also translated works of Pushkin, Lermontov, Nadson, Krylov, Hugo, Musset, Prudhomme, Amir Khusro as well as a number of German poets into Azeri. In 1912 he published his first collection of poems entitled ' (\\"Broken Saz\\"), his narrative poem ' and his translations of Western European literature under the name ' (\\"The Sun of the West\\"). In 1916 his romantic poem ' was published. In his literary style, influence of classical poets such as Nizami, Hafez and Saadi, and modern poets such as Tevfik Fikret, is seen. Among his dramatic pieces, ' (1912) and ' (1913) are noteworthy. There are accounts of a novel written by Sahhat and entitled Ali and Aisha. It was never published and its manuscript is believed to have perished during the Dashnak occupation of Shamakhi in April 1918, when Sahhat's house was ravaged and burned. The poet himself managed to escape the town with his family, fleeing first to Kurdamir and later to Ganja, where he died some months later of a stroke. Abbas Sahhat was in favour of liberal bourgeoisie and, due to his Iranian academic upbringing, disagreed with mass secularisation that was taking place among Azeris beginning in the early 20th century. Instead he promoted a more moderate idea of all-Muslim westernization. He dedicated some of his finest pieces of poetry to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, in which he presented himself as a realist poet. –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è 1929‚Äî1939. –ê–±–±–∞—Å –°–∏—Ö—Ö–∞—Ç References Category:Azerbaijani-language poets Category:Azerbaijani-language writers Category:19th-century Azerbaijani poets Category:20th-century Azerbaijani poets Category:19th-century Azerbaijani dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century Azerbaijani dramatists and playwrights Category:Azerbaijani dramatists and playwrights Category:1874 births Category:1918 deaths Category:People from Shamakhi Category:Azerbaijani emigrants to Iran Category:People of the Persian Constitutional Revolution Category:Azerbaijani male poets ","title":"Abbas Sahhat"},{"id":"14887936","text":"Mark G.

The company is best known for its hit series Let's Make a Deal, which aired in several company-produced iterations off and on between 1963 and 1986. The company disbanded sometime in 1987. History: Let's Make a Deal Prior to meeting while working in 1962 on the NBC game show Your First Impression, hosted by Bill Leyden, Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall had different career paths. Hatos was a writer and producer who had worked in both television and radio and had also been a producer for Bob Hope's early television specials. Hall's American media career began in 1955 when he became a contributor for the NBC Radio Monitor program. After five years of this he moved to Hollywood and became the host of the Merrill Heatter-produced Video Village. While hosting the series in 1962, he sold his first production (the aforementioned Your First Impression) to NBC and met Hatos, who was working on the show as a producer (Hall was executive producer). The next year, the duo debuted the long running Let's Make a Deal on NBC, and the show was an instant success, running in daytime on NBC and later on ABC for 13 seasons. Two weekly network primetime versions also aired, one on NBC in 1967 and one on ABC from 1969 to 1971. The show's popularity also spawned a syndicated version, which aired weekly from 1971 to 1977 and was one of the first network game shows to do so. Other shows In addition to LMAD, Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions also produced the 1970s hit Split Second for ABC. The series, which ran from 1972 to 1975, was the only other show the company produced that lasted more than one season. Other game shows produced by the team included Chain Letter, Three for the Money and It's Anybody's Guess for NBC and It Pays to Be Ignorant and Masquerade Party in syndication. The last of those series was the hosting debut for Richard Dawson. The 1980s After a hiatus of several years, Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions returned to production in the mid 1980s with a revival of Let's Make A Deal, which ran in daily syndication from 1984 to 1986. (Another daily syndicated version, which aired from 1980 to 1981, while hosted by Hall was not produced with Hatos.) After that series ended its run, Hatos and Hall revived Split Second in syndication in the fall of 1986 with Hall hosting. The company broke up following the show's cancellation. Afterwards Although Hatos retired from writing and producing television shows after Split Second ended in 1987, he continued to oversee the licensing agreements and was involved with the foreign versions of Let's Make a Deal until his death in 1999. Hall was retired for the most part following the 1987 cancellation of Split Second, though he frequently made cameos related to Let's Make a Deal such as one he made as part of Good Morning America's 2009 game show week. Hall replaced Bob Hilton as host of a daytime Let's Make a Deal series NBC attempted in 1990 (which was produced by Dick Clark Productions) and helmed it until its 1991 cancellation, and later made a cameo on a weekly primetime edition NBC aired in 2003. For the 2009 CBS daytime series, Hall served as a consultant and Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions is credited as a co-production company (much in the same way Mark Goodson's name was used on The Price Is Right long after his production company was dissolved). Hall has also hosted at least one game on the current version. Hall died in 2017.

It produces small daisylike flowers with rectangular yellow ray florets. The fruit is an achene about a centimeter long topped with a white pappus. It reproduces by seed but also by cloning itself at the root; tilling of soil and chopping up plants actually help this species disperse by sectioning and distributing root parts. Weed Risk This plant is considered a very troublesome weed in many areas. It easily invades fields, clogs harvesting machines, and successfully competes with other plants for water. There are several biological control measures used against this plant. The skeletonweed gall midge (Cystiphora schmidti - an insect), the skeletonweed gall mite (Aceria chondrillae - an arachnid), and skeletonweed rust (Puccinia chondrillina - a fungus) all show potential for controlling infestations. Uses In the Greek island of Crete the leaves and the tender shoots of a local variety called ampelosyrida (Œ±ŒºœÄŒµŒªŒøœÉœÖœÅŒØŒ¥Œ±) or glykosyrida (Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫ŒøœÉœÖœÅŒØŒ¥Œ±) are eaten raw or boiled in salads by the locals. The plant is also traditionally consumed by ethnic Albanians (Arb√´resh√´) in the Vulture area (southern Italy). Chondrilla juncea may have an anti-oxidant activity and some potential for medicinal use.

Starring Zhou Xun, Kitty Zhang and Gwei Lun-mei, the film tells a series of interwoven stories as it focuses on the lives of three women and their romantic relationships. Zhou plays a clumsy woman who secretly develops a pheromone drug patch, which serves as a plot device for the film; Kwai plays a punk rock band singer, who is also a boxer and novelist; and Zhang plays a wealthy attractive woman. Originally set to be an updated version of Tsui's Peking Opera Blues, All About Women was shot in Beijing, China, and was released in China and Hong Kong on 11 December 2008. The film was later released in Singapore on 8 January 2009.Coming Soon :: Golden Screen Cinemas Online Cast * Zhou Xun plays Ou Fanfan, a clumsy worker at a medical clinic who becomes petrified upon contact with any man. She is completely sightless without her thick glasses, and secretly develops a pheromone drug patch, which allows men to be attracted to her. Zhou was immediately cast after director Tsui Hark felt that she should be cast in a comedic role. She accepted the role, having been a fan of Tsui's films.All About Women explores what women want She also found Tsui to be a colourful and amusing person, as while during production she was able to sample many different lives every day. During filming, she once had a record of changing into 12 different costumes and 12 different make-ups in one single day: \\"Even if it took half an hour for each make-up, it would still mean 6 hours of being 'manipulated' by others, I felt like a puppet, very exhausting.\\" * Kitty Zhang plays Tang Lu, a corporate businesswoman, who tends to follow her head, not her heart. Zhang commented on the character, and how her friends relate to Tang Lu: \\"I've got female friends like that. They're actually very happy and think they're doing very well. Only other people think that they're sad and lonely, and society portrays them as such.\\" To prepare her for the role, director Tsui Hark hired an expert to give Zhang some training. Zhang admitted to having some pressure on the film's set as she feared destroying the expensive costumes and props. * Gwei Lun-mei plays Tie Ling, a 19-year-old boxer, internet novelist, and punk rock singer. She has an \\"imaginary\\" boyfriend, unaware that no one else can see him. To prepare for the role, Kwai learned how to ride a motorbike, and weave through traffic on it: \\"I was scared out of my wits. A lot of money had to be spent as I ended up scratching lots of vehicles along the way.\\" Kwai also commented on the costumes for the film: \\"It's the first time I realised a costume designer can be so miraculous. Putting on the clothes by William Chang, I felt as if I were transformed into another person...this is a far cry from my usual self.\\" * Godfrey Gao plays X, a famous rock superstar, who is Tie Ling's imaginary boyfriend.All About Women (2008) review * Alex Fong plays Professor Wu Mong- Gu, a charismatic environmentalist. Fong described his character as someone who \\"must not be dressed too elaborately,\\" and that \\"he dresses only in simple clothing.\\" * Stephen Fung plays Sima Xiaogang, Fanfan's love interest, who resembles her former dance instructor. He is an indie rocker, who winds up being a human experiment for Fanfan's pheromone drug patch. Fung joined the production of the film mainly due to his passion for music. * Eddie Peng plays Mo Qiyan, Tang Lu's cousin and secretary. He is a nerdy, bespectacled guy, who is attracted to Tie Ling. Screenwriter Kwak Jae-yong described the character as being similar to that of Cha Tae Hyeon, a character from his 2001 Korean film My Sassy Girl. * Shen Chang plays Tian Yuan, a timid colleague, who is hired to pose as Tang Lu in the hopes of initiating a deal with Professor Wu. * Zhang Xinyi * Izumi Liu * Yiyad Zhang The film features cameos from four filmmakers: the film's director, Tsui Hark, in a deleted scene, cameos as a taxi driver; co-screenwriter Kwak Jae-yong appears as a noodle restaurant patron; Hong Kong film director Jacob Cheung appears as himself, playing an unlucky patient; and actor‚Äìfilm producer Henry Fong appears as Ou Fanfan's boss. All About Women at HKMDB All About Women at chinesemov.com Production =Development= To commemorate on the 25th anniversary of his production company Film Workshop, director Tsui Hark wanted the film to be one of several remakes of films produced by the company.Tsui Hark to Direct Judge Dee in May 2009 ‚Äì Wu-Jing.org Tsui expressed his inspiration for All About Women being a calligraphy with the words She Ain't Mean written in Chinese (Â•≥‰∫∫‰∏çÂùè). He said that after seeing the drawing, he awoke one day, and images of countless women flashed across his mind. While promoting his 1991 film Once Upon a Time in China in Seoul, Korea, Tsui attended a seminar, where he met Korean filmmaker Kwak Jae-yong. Tsui began working on a script titled She's a Hooligan, developing various characters, who began to gradually form into something more concrete after several days. When Tsui discovered that Kwak was working on a script similar to his, he abandoned his own script, and collaborated with Kwak. Kwak wrote the script in Korean before it was translated into Chinese. Tsui then commented on and amended the Chinese version before it was translated back into Korean. The script was later re- edited by Kwak and retranslated into Chinese. =Filming= All About Women was shot in Beijing, China from 1 January to April 2008, and was hailed as updated version of Tsui's 1986 film Peking Opera Blues. In March, Tsui, for the first time as a filmmaker, invited the Chinese press visit to the set of All About Women in Changping, Beijing. Kitty Zhang commented on Tsui's style of filmmaking as the director would frequently make changes to the screenplay: \\"Often, when I arrived on the set in the morning, he'd hand me three pages of the script, saying that it's what we'd be filming today. I was taken aback. What he gave me earlier only had two paragraphs. Why such a big change?\\" Upon being questioned, Tsui admitted there would be changes to the screenplay, since he did not have everything he wanted in the film on the shooting script.

The full cost of maintaining the ARD-DDR-DEE in 2011 was approximately 16 million francs. The ARD 10 is one of two special operations units of Switzerland. The other, the \\"MP Spez Det.\\" or \\"Special Detachment of the Military Police\\", focuses primarily on domestic issues. History As part of the Army XXI reforms, a report on October 24, 2001 to the Federal Assembly of Switzerland called for the formation of a special forces‚Äìtrained unit that would be able to conduct counter-terrorist-type actions in the Swiss Army to protect Swiss nationals and soldiers living abroad. In 2003, the unit was created with Major Daniel Stoll as the unit's first commanding officer. 30 soldiers with special forces training formed the nucleus of the unit, with its internal structure based on the Special Air Service. In 2007, ARD 10 commandos joined in Exercise Cold Response 2007. The unit had been unveiled to the public during Army Day 2007 in Lugano from November 20 to November 25, 2007. By 2011, the unit has 91 soldiers in active duty. Forty operators currently serve in the ranks of ARD 10. It is suggested that the first batch of ARD 10 operators had been given training by foreign special forces instructors. They include instructors from the United States Navy SEALs, US Special Forces, and the Special Air Service. There has been calls on the Swiss government to deploy ARD 10 operators to combat Somali pirates with no consensus in Parliament, due to an evenly divided vote against it. The planned mission called for 30 ARD 10 operators to be deployed with a spokesperson for the Swiss Army saying that the ARD 10 is ready to be deployed if given the order. ARD 10 operators were supposed to be covertly deployed into Libya to rescue two hostages held by Gaddafi due to the arrest of his son in Switzerland under \\"Operation SAKR\\". Instead, the hostages were released after negotiations between Libya and Switzerland, with the details of the rescue operations leaked to the press. Criticisms Critics had blasted the creation of the ARD 10, saying that that unit might conduct anti-terrorist missions that may put civilians in harm's way contrary to their mission. The Zeit-Fragen, a weekly newspaper, also claimed that the ARD 10 would be a blow to Swiss neutrality, saying that crisis situations involving Swiss nationals are always solved through negotiations. There are concerns that the ARD 10, like all special forces, can be used covertly against politically active people instead of conducting their missions to their mandate. An article criticized the planned mission to Somalia, questioning whyARD 10 operators should shoot as pirates when they are on anti-piracy operations, since most pirates are ex-fishermen and criminals. Furthermore, an article from the Berner Zeitung insists that the ARD 10 deployment is not the solution, but calls for political solutions. The ARD10 was criticized for being \\"dangerous\\" when Swiss media leaked out plans to rescue Swiss nationals in Libya on June 28, 2010. In addition, it is reported that only 40 operators are currently active instead of the initially planned 90. According to Albert Stahel of Zurich University‚Äôs Institute for Strategic Studies, an umbrella of the Swiss military's various special forces units should be created, as Switzerland does not have enough resources to strategically transport ARD 10 operators to various places around the globe. Unit tasks The ARD 10 has certain tasks to fulfill as part of their mandate: # Procurement of key facilities # Protection of Swiss nationals, troop and facilities if endangered # Securing Swiss nationals from crisis areas # Direct Action # Special Reconnaissance Requirements Among the minimal qualification requirements for potential candidates in 18 weeks, these include: # 50 press-ups # 60 sit-ups # 10 chin- ups # 5 km cross-country run in under 24 minutes # 8 km walk in full combat gear (15 kg pack) in less than 58 minutes # 25 km walk in full combat gear (25 kg pack) in less than 3.5 hours # 300 m swim in under 10 minutes Other potential requirements include the following: # Good command of the English language # Good command of another language aside from English # Leadership skills Candidates who must wear eyeglasses must have a visual acuity of at least 0.80 in order to be accepted. The Swiss Army does not institute an age limit for soldiers who wish to join the ARD 10. Equipment Model of an ARD-10 commando with issued equipment during an exhibition. ARD 10 operators are equipped with the SIG SG 553 (replacing the SIG SG 552) assault carbine with various tactical and night vision scopes, depending on the operator. Their main sniper rifle is the Sako TRG-42 (in-service designation Scharfsch√ºtzengewehr 04 (SSGw 04)). The MP5SD3 submachine gun is the standard SMG used by the ARD 10. Their standard sidearms consist of Glock 17 and the Glock 26 alongside the P220. In addition, there are reports that the SIG Pro series are also issued. For training purposes, the G17T and G26T are used. Their equipment consists of knee protectors, kevlar helmets and anti-shrapnel vests. The ARD's main light infantry vehicle is the AGF. Training Chart on how ARD 10 candidates are selected and trained. Potential candidates must attend the full 18 months, of special forces training after completing their compulsory service with the Swiss Army, with 6 months dedicated to basic training and followed by 40 weeks of infiltration technique training. Candidates will be assessed prior to training their physical and mental state, as well as their health if they are fit to be qualified as ARD 10 soldiers. Candidates must also have clean records from their time after attending compulsory service. Upon completion of training, all ARD 10 soldiers are required to be on standby in case of deployment. Over 300 soldiers apply for a position in the ARD 10, but only 10 prospective soldiers are chosen for training as ARD 10 operators. Among the specialist courses taught to all prospective ARD 10 operators include the following: * Mountain Specialist * Amphibious Specialist * Parachute Specialist * Motorized Specialist Work conditions All ARD 10 soldiers are allowed a maximum of 20 days off from active service with the unit, as well as additional 5 days if required. Accommodations in terms of living quarters and food are taken care of by the unit itself without having the individual soldier pay. ARD 10 soldiers stay in the unit for 5 years. Efforts are underway to raise it up to 10 years of service. The soldiers are paid according to their marital status and economic standing. Extra pay ranges from 397 to 5,156 Swiss francs. Others are paid 4,111 Swiss francs if they have children with extra pay that includes 2,654 Swiss francs. ARD 10 soldiers are also paid if they are deployed abroad, depending on the nature of their mission. Soldiers are paid additionally 6.17 Swiss francs per hour for participating in night duties. All ARD 10 soldiers have insurance as provided by the Swiss military. In addition, ARD 10 soldiers are to reimbursed according to federal law with an accommodation maximum of 130 Swiss francs.

Background Emory Sekaquaptewa was born in Hotevilla in the Third Mesa, on the Hopi Reservation of northern Arizona, in 1928. His birth was never formally noted so he took 28 December as his birthday for official purposes.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/emory-sekaquaptewa- native-american-anthropologist-768358.html He was believed to be the first Arizona Native American to attend West Point, and he later attended law school at the University of Arizona, graduating in 1970. He held various leadership positions within the village of Kykotsmovi, as well as positions on the Hopi Tribal Council and serving as a judge on the appellate division of the Hopi Tribal Court.Pioneering 'Renaissance man' who wrote Hopi dictionary dies Sekaquaptewa was at one time married to Beverly Sekaquaptewa, and was the son of Helen and Emory Sekaquaptewa, Sr who met at the Phoenix Indian School about 1915. His mother's story was told in the book \\"Me and Mine: The Life Story Of Helen Sekaquaptewa\\" as told to Louise Udall, Published by University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1969. Scholarship Sekaquaptewa was the \\"Cultural Editor\\" on the Hopi Dictionary Project, which produced the first ever Hopi dictionary: \\"Hopi Dictionary/Hop√¨ikwa Lav√†ytutuveni: A Hopi‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary of the Third Mesa Dialect\\" in 1998. The 900-page dictionary contains entries on 30,000 words, as well as a sketch of Hopi grammar. This dictionary is credited with playing an important role in revitalizing the Hopi language and took him thirty years to complete, since the language had no standard or received variant and is highly complex.  Hopicrafts  About 1961 Sekaquaptewa and his brother Wayne Sekaquaptewa opened Hopi Enterprises in Phoenix, a business which employed Hopi silversmiths to make overlay jewelry for sale. Two of the silversmiths hired were Harry Sakyesva and Bernard Dawahoya. In 1962 Emory and Wayne relocated the business to the village of Kykotsmovi at Third Mesa on the Hopi Reservation and renamed it Hopicrafts. The business developed its own designs and style of overlay and successfully competed with the Hopi Silvercraft Guild on Second Mesa. It employed many talented silversmiths while in operation. Pieces made in the shop all bore a shop hallmark of a conjoined capitol \\"H\\" and lowercase \\"C\\". Sekaquaptewa made silver jewelry that was hallmarked SEKAQUAPTEWA, his brother Wayne only occasionally made jewelry and shared the hallmark. Hopicrafts closed in 1983. His nephew Phillip Sekaquaptewa, son of Wayne Sekaquaptewa, was a talented silversmith and skilled at not only Hopi silver overlay technique but an original contemporary master of stone and silver flush inlay.

This mustard is native to Eurasia but is well known in other parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions, as an introduced species and a noxious weed. This is an annual herb reaching a maximum of half a meter in height and covered abundantly in sticky foliage. The four tiny flower petals emerge from a loose tube of sepals and spread into a corolla about a centimeter wide. The flowers are lavender in color and a field heavily infested with purple mustard can take on a distinct lavender wash. The plant has a strong scent which is generally considered unpleasant. The fruits are long upturned cylindrical capsules about 4 centimeters long containing round, reddish-brown seeds. This is a tenacious weed which can be troublesome in agriculture. It reduces yields in grain fields and when it is consumed by dairy cattle it gives their milk a bad taste and odor. This plant reproduces by seed, so any control method preventing the plants from setting seed is effective.

The concept is analogous to classified ads in local newspapers. \\"Tradio\\" is a portmanteau of \\"trade\\" and \\"radio\\". The format is also often called Swap Shop, Buy Sell or Trade, Biz Baz, or Trading Post. Format Most tradio programs follow a similar format to each other. Callers are given a studio line in which they can call in and advertise, for free, a limited number of items for sale, or request an item to purchase from another listener. The caller then gives a phone number so that other listeners can contact the person for further information. Since the increased prevalence of e-mail and other electronic media, most stations permit the sending in of items to sell via e-mail or fax, though due to regular and/or identity theft concerns some stations will assign a code number to anonymize the transaction and keep identifying information off the air. Most stations also permit listeners to send lists of items through postal mail. Tradio programs are particularly associated with the full service format; tradio was commonly found on Independent Local Radio in the UK when it used a similar format (up to around 1990). There are usually some limits to what can be bought and sold through tradio programs. Most stations stipulate that only individuals, and no businesses, may use the tradio service, since the financial security of these small stations usually relies on the advertising dollars from these businesses. Federal regulations prohibit the sale of firearms through these services; real estate is also usually not allowed on tradio programs. Restrictions on the sale of automobiles varies from station to station. The name \\"tradio\\" does not apply to any one particular program and there are no national or syndicated tradio programs. It is technically not a franchised format, either. Popularity Typically tradio and similar programs are only heard on small, rural stations; KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is the largest market with a tradio program, airing weekly on Saturday afternoons. A similarly-styled program titled Wheelin' and Dealin' with Dave Ramos also airs during the weekends on WTAM in Cleveland, Ohio (but is not in a regular timeslot). In smaller markets, tradio programs can air daily. The smallest radio station in America that airs a Tradio program is KEDU in Ruidoso, New Mexico. The program is on a weekly set schedule Monday through Friday at 9:30am. Various Tradio programs have been the target of prank phone calling by The Howard Stern Shows Richard Christy and Sal Governale.

Aside from the band's reunion concert in 2005 it is Cream's only official full concert release on video. It was originally broadcast by the BBC on 5 January 1969. It was not released on video in the US until 1977. The opening acts for the concert were future progressive rock stars Yes who were just starting out and Taste, an Irish trio led by Rory Gallagher.  Versions  There are in fact several versions of this film. They are as follows - The original theatrical release * Created by Director Tony Palmer and distributed by manager Robert Stigwood, this was a documentary style film, incorporated live performances, narration by BBC announcer Patrick Allen, and interviews with the band members themselves showcasing their playing abilities (actually filmed in late 1967 or early 1968). Duration 84 minutes. * In 1977, a shorter version of the above film, presenting the footage in edited form, now lasting 51 minutes, was released on home video. The Television version * The first BBC Television broadcast - Containing the same songs as the 1977 version (and lasting the same length), but featuring narration from Radio One DJ Pete Drummond, and a different introduction and BBC end credits. (Note - The narrations by both Drummond and Allen are virtually identical.) This was also on the official DVD release. * A music only version, shown by the BBC in 1980 (The end credits show \\"MCMLXXX\\"), which was 30 minutes long, featuring just 5 complete songs, with no narration or interviews. In 2005, a special extended edition of the concert appeared featuring full versions of all songs separated from the narration and interviews. Lasting 80 minutes, it was released on the official DVD reissue. The new version featured digitally remastered sound and video including three bonus songs. A short clip of White Room from the second set (the film used the version from the first show), together with D.J. John Peel introducing the band onstage, was shown on the BBC1 programme \\"The Rock And Roll Years\\" in the late 1980s. In June 2014, it was given a Blu-ray / DVD release. Album Release In March 2020, the concert was released as part of the live album Goodbye Tour - Live 1968, being the first time the Royal Albert Hall concert was officially released via audio format.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/cream- goodbye-tour-live-1968-box-set-919780/  Criticism  The original film has often been criticized for both its mediocre sound and visual effects: > The audio is a turgid sonic sludge. The visuals are even worse, with > director Tony Palmer jerking the camera around as if this were an episode of > NYPD Blue, layering the picture with dated and distracting psychedelic light > effects, and providing far too many close-ups of Bruce's teeth (and almost > no wide shots of the entire band).Amazon.com: Cream - Farewell Concert: > Movies & TV: Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce (II), Tony Palmer, Sandy > Oliveri The band had performed two sets at the Albert Hall, but it is believed only the second set was filmed in its entirety. Several times during the performance, it is apparent that the on-screen shot is not in sync with the audio. In fact, in several songs, including during Ginger Baker's drum solo, he seems to change clothes at lightning speed due to careless post-editing, as well as Eric Clapton playing 2 different guitars. This is because footage from both sets, with the band wearing different clothes and Clapton using a Gibson Firebird for the first set, a Gibson 335 for the second, were edited together. The BBC used 4 static cameras and 2 hand held cams, all recording onto video tape, whilst Palmer himself filmed footage at the front of the stage, utilising a 16mm film camera. The difference in quality can be detected easily during the broadcast. However, the BBC \\"Pete Drummond\\" version was better quality overall, and is the only version that has these 16mm film clips removed ‚Äì the remastered release on the 2005 DVD presents both audio and video in excellent quality. Ginger Baker himself has lashed out in an interview against the Farewell Concert video, stating: \\"Cream was so much better than that.\\" Nonetheless, most Cream fans regard the actual performance with great enthusiasm, disregarding the poor quality of the video.

C. Fields as a henpecked husband who experiences a series of misadventures while taking a day off from work to attend a wrestling match. As with his other roles of this nature, Fields is put-upon throughout the film, but triumphs in the end. Plot Ambrose Wolfinger works as a \\"memory expert\\" for a manufacturing company's president. He keeps track of details about the clients President Malloy (Oscar Apfel) meets with, so that Malloy will never be embarrassed about not remembering things when meeting with them. But Ambrose doesn't keep files; all the documents are a huge mess of paper piled on his desk. Ambrose supports himself, his shrewish wife Leona (Kathleen Howard), his loving daughter Hope (from a previous marriage; played by Mary Brian), his freeloading brother-in-law Claude (Grady Sutton), and his abusive, sternly teetotal mother-in-law Cordelia (Vera Lewis). At the start of the film, two burglars, played by Tammany Young and Walter Brennan, break into Ambrose's cellar after midnight, get drunk on his homemade applejack, and start singing \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\". Ambrose is forced to handle the situation, and he winds up being arrested for distilling liquor without a license. While on the way to the night court Ambrose talks about the big wrestling match scheduled for that day, for which he has a front-row ticket. After Hope pays his bail, Ambrose returns home in time to have breakfast before reporting for work. He asks Malloy for the afternoon off, falsely claiming that Cordelia has died and her funeral is that day. He begins explaining that she was taken with a \\"chill\\" and that he poured her a drink. His story is interrupted by Malloy, who misconstrues it as a case of death from poisoned liquor, and Ambrose is too timid to contradict him. Malloy lets him go for the day. Ambrose's supervisor, Mr. Peabody (Lucien Littlefield), tells his department the tragic news so they can send condolences, and also notifies the newspaper. Ambrose has a series of misfortunes on his way to the wrestling match: He has encounters with ticket-writing policemen,This sequence was probably devised by co-director Clyde Bruckman, who had intended it for use in one of Fields' 1932 comedies for Mack Sennett, but after Fields left Sennett Bruckman gave the gag to Lloyd Hamilton in Too Many Highballs (1933). Bruckman and Fields then used it in Man on the Flying Trapeze, and then Bruckman used it again with Buster Keaton in Nothing But Pleasure (1940) and also an episode of The Abbott and Costello Show called Car Trouble (1954). he has a flat tire, and he is nearly hit by a train while chasing a runaway tire. Finally, while trying to get into the wrestling arena (Claude had stolen his ticket earlier), he gets knocked down by a wrestler who is thrown out of the building by his opponent. As spectators exit the arena, Claude sees Ambrose sprawled on the sidewalk and sees Ambrose's secretary, who had attended the wrestling match separately, bent over him expressing concern over his injury. Meanwhile, a huge number of flowers, sympathy cards, and funeral wreaths are delivered to the Wolfinger home. This puzzles Cordelia and Leona, and when they see Cordelia's obituary in the newspaper‚Äîunder the headline \\"Aged Woman Victim of Poisoned Alcohol\\"‚Äîthey are furious, and quickly fix the blame on Ambrose. Ambrose returns home to a harsh reception. He confesses to deceiving his boss, but when Claude announces that he saw Ambrose and the secretary \\"drunk in the gutter\\", Ambrose, who has been meek through the entire film, finally has had enough. He knocks Claude unconscious, and frightens his wife and mother-in-law into hiding. He and his daughter leave the house to go live elsewhere. Peabody has fired Ambrose, but Malloy demands that Peabody rehire him because no one else can figure out Wolfinger's filing system. Hope answers the telephone call from Peabody, and says (falsely) that Ambrose has a better offer from another company. After some bargaining, Ambrose is rehired with a huge raise in pay and four weeks' vacation. Meanwhile, Leona realizes that she still loves Ambrose, scolds Claude for his laziness, and stands up to her disagreeable mother. The film ends with Ambrose taking the family for a ride in his new car. Hope and Leona ride inside the car with him, while Claude and Cordelia ride in the open rumble seat during a heavy rain.

Waxing more enthusiastic than Greene, film critic Danny Peary declared in 1993 that this was nothing less than Fields' best performance. \\"In contrast to his other roles,\\" Peary wrote, \\"Fields isn't cantankerous, doesn't bully any imbecilic assistants, swindle anyone, or do a whole lot of bragging... But don't worry, as his nicest guy, Fields is still in peak form.\\" Noting that Ambrose Wolfinger is still \\"a rebel and nonconformist\\" despite his kindness, Peary adds, \\"It's a pleasure to watch Fields stumble through life and emerge, impossibly, unscathed.\\" Peary concludes by awarding Fields his \\"alternate\\" 1935 Academy Award for Best Actor: \\"For playing a marvelous character no other comic could conceive, and making us laugh nonstop for 65 minutes, Fields deserves the Oscar.\\"Peary, Danny, Alternate Oscars: One Critic's Defiant Choice for Best Picture, Actor, and Actress - From 1927 to the Present (New York: Delta, 1993), 34-35.

The Advocate has called Garland \\"The Elvis of homosexuals\\". The reasons frequently given for her standing as an icon among gay men are admiration of her ability as a performer, the way her personal struggles seemed to mirror those of gay men in America during the height of her fame, and her value as a camp figure.Dyer, p. 156 Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz is particularly known for contributing to this status. Garland as tragic figure The aspects of gay identification with Garland were being discussed in the mainstream as early as 1967. Time magazine, in reviewing Garland's 1967 Palace Theatre engagement, disparagingly noted that a \\"disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual\\". It goes on to say that \\"[t]he boys in the tight trousers\\" (a phrase Time repeatedly used to describe gay men, as when it described \\"ecstatic young men in tight trousers pranc[ing] down the aisles to toss bouquets of roses\\" to another gay icon, Marlene Dietrich) would \\"roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats\\" during Garland's performances. Time then attempted to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual, consulting psychiatrists who opined that \\"the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria\\" and that \\"Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her.\\" Writer William Goldman, in a piece for Esquire magazine about the same Palace engagement, again disparages the gay men in attendance, dismissing them as \\"fags\\" who \\"flit by\\" chattering inanely. He goes on, however, to advance the tragic figure theory as well. After first suggesting that \\"if [homosexuals] have an enemy, it is age. And Garland is youth, perennially, over the rainbow\\", he wrote: Openly gay comedian Bob Smith offers a comic take on the tragic figure theory, imagining an \\"Elvis king\\" and a \\"Judy queen\\", debating the idols: Garland as camp In discussing Judy Garland's camp appeal, gay film scholar Richard Dyer has defined camp as \\"a characteristically gay way of handling the values, images and products of the dominant culture through irony, exaggeration, trivialisation, theatricalisation and an ambivalent making fun of and out of the serious and respectable\\".Dyer, p. 176 Garland is camp, he asserts, because she is \\"imitable, her appearance and gestures copiable in drag acts\\". He calls her \\"ordinariness\\" in her early MGM films camp in their \\"failed seriousness\\" and her later style \\"wonderfully over-the-top\\". Friend of Dorothy Judy Garland from the trailer for the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz Other connections between Garland and LGBT people include the slang term \\"Friend of Dorothy\\", which likely derives from Garland's portrayal of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz and became a code phrase gay people used to identify each other. Dorothy's journey from Kansas to Oz \\"mirrored many gay men's desires to escape the black-and-white limitations of small town life ... for big, colorful cities filled with quirky, gender-bending characters who would welcome them.\\" In the film, Dorothy immediately accepts those who are different, including the Cowardly Lion (in a very camp performance by Bert Lahr). The Lion identifies himself through song as a \\"sissy\\" and exhibits stereotypically \\"gay\\" (or at least effeminate) mannerisms. The Lion is seen as a coded example of Garland meeting and accepting a gay man without question.Brantley, Ben; The New York Times: Jun 28, 1994. pg. C.15.Paglia, Camille.

In the 2001 documentary Memories of Oz, gay cult film director and social satirist John Waters spoke about seeing The Wizard of Oz as a child: Stonewall riots Some have suggested a connection between the date of Garland's funeral on June 27, 1969 and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern gay liberation movement, which started in the early hours of June 28. Some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved \\"were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their next meal would come from.\\"Loughery, p. 316 However, the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron Sylvia Rivera had come from the very emotional Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn.

Many used pseudonyms and \\"Judy Garland\\" was among the most popular.Kaiser, p. 198 Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Garland/Stonewall connection has persisted and has been fictionalized in Stonewall, Nigel Finch's feature film about the events leading up to the riots.

His only friend is a young girl who tries to help him. It stars Nigel Green, Mary Badham, Pat Cardi and Robert Pickering. It is based on a 1963 novel written by Rohan O'Grady, the nom de plume of Canadian authoress June Margaret O'Grady Skinner. It was filmed in Universal Studios on the largest sound stage taking advantage of the process screen Jordan, Joe Showmanship: The Cinema of William CastleBearManor Media with a location shot of a beach in Malibu, California. Plot Following the death of multi millionaire Russell Harrison (a cameo by William Castle) in a car crash, his $5 million estate falls to his only child, 12 year old Barnaby Harrison who will receive the money when reaching his age of majority. In the meantime Barnaby will live with his uncle Kevin who resides on a remote sparsely populated island eight miles from the mainland. During World War II Major Kevin Harrison was a James Bond type British Army Intelligence Commando who has published an account of his war exploits entitled Killing the Enemy; his book detailing his multiple accounts of extreme close combat killing of various Germans. Barnaby is escorted by Police Detective Sergeant Frank Travis on the cruise to the island. Aboard the boat is Chrissie who is Barnaby's age. The two children constantly argue and fight with Chrissie believing Barnaby is telling fantastic lies about his uncle's exploits though Frank does reveal himself as really being a policeman to her. Chrissie has come from a broken home and will be living with her Aunt Justine who lives on Uncle Kevin's island. Barnaby's bad behaviour continues on the island with Frank chastising him for playing with his detective revolver, Barnaby leading Christine astray by visiting a dangerous decrepit hotel and Barnaby keeping up a constant litany of tall tales to impress or frighten Chrissie. Barnaby however, worships his heroic Uncle Kevin and enjoys reading his book. One night Uncle Kevin, dressed in his wartime military beret and battledress (as he does on the cover of his book) visits a sleeping Barnaby to wake him up to go on an adventure with him. Leading Barnaby to high cliffs overlooking the crashing surf, Uncle Kevin hypnotises Barnaby to walk in specific directions with the aim of having Barnaby fall off the cliff to his death whilst Kevin is home in his bed. The next day Justine sees Barnaby perilously close to the edge of a high cliff and shouts at him, waking him out of his trance. A shaken Barnaby believes that he was walking in his sleep until alone with his uncle, Uncle Kevin jovially explains that he intends to kill Barnaby for his inheritance. Though his first attempt at eliminating him in a manner to appear accidental failed, he shall try, try again. Kevin also explains that his home is \\"Switzerland\\" an area of neutrality where he will not harm Barnaby, nor will he harm him when he is with Justine or Sgt Travis who still remains on the island as Uncle Kevin's guest. Based on Barnaby's previous lies and hysterical behaviour no one believes him until Chrissie discovers the truth and gleefully suggests they kill Uncle Kevin first. The trio begin a series of cat and mouse assassination attempts against each other. When Uncle Kevin discovers that Chrissie stole Sgt Travis's revolver and came up with an unsuccessful assassination attempt Kevin includes her in his game. Production The film was William Castle's third and final film for Universal Pictures with Castle purchasing the film rights for the novel soon after its 1963 publication. Universal's casting director John Badham cast his younger sister Mary who had gained acclaim in the role of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). He also chose Pat Cardi who had recently appeared in Universal's And Now Miguel; Badham and Castle picked Cardi over James Mason's son and Stanley Livingston then co-starring on My Three Sons, Nigel Green had recently co-starred in The Ipcress File (1965) released by Universal; Let's Kill Uncle was Greeen's first lead role. Nestor Paiva was suffering from stomach cancer during the production and died in the year the film was released. During the filming Castle had wanted Barnaby to inherit $20 million ($10 million in the novel). Universal insisted on $5 million; when Castle objected MCA Universal head Lew Wasserman came to see Castle himself telling Castle \\"For $20 million I'd kill the kid myself\\". Cardi recalled that Nigel Green acted as a real life friendly uncle to him on the set, giving him tips on performing. Cardi admitted that the tarantulas frightened him, so during rehearsals plastic spiders were used, even though the spider wrangler and William Castle told him the real spider had been de fanged and was harmless. When shooting the actual scenes, the real tarantula was present with Castle asking Cardi \\"wouldn't it be fun to drop it on Nigel's chest?\\" Green was unenthusiastic until Castle told him that Sean Connery had a real tarantula walk on his chest in Dr. No (1962). Green shouted \\"If it's good enough for Connery, it's good enough for me!\\" and did the scene without complaint; no one telling him that Connery had a tarantula walking over a glass pane rather than being on his naked skin. Pat Cardi stated that several endings were shot for the film and \\"Universal picked the worst one\\". Cardi recalled there \\"were a lot of politics going on with the film\\".

The Scriptural Way of the Cross or Scriptural Stations of the Cross is a modern version of the ancient Christian, especially Catholic, devotion called the Stations of the Cross. This version was inaugurated on Good Friday 1991 by Pope John Paul II. The Scriptural version was not intended to invalidate the traditional version. Rather it was meant to add nuance to an understanding of the Passion.Archbishop Piero Marini, The Way of the Cross, www.vatican.va History Out of the fourteen traditional Stations of the Cross, only eight have clear scriptural foundation. To provide a version of this devotion more closely aligned with the biblical accounts, Pope John Paul II introduced a new form of the devotion, called the Scriptural Way of the Cross, on Good Friday 1991. He celebrated that form many times, often but not exclusively at the Colosseum in Rome on Good Friday.Joseph M Champlin, The Stations of the Cross With Pope John Paul II Liguori Publications, 1994, Pope John Paul II, Meditation and Prayers for the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum, Good Friday, 2000 In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI approved this set of stations for meditation and public celebration.  The text of the Stations  Before each station (all genuflect while reciting): Minister: We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you. All: Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world. = First station: Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane = Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \\"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\\" He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress. Then he said to them, \\"My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.\\" He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, \\"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.\\" When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, \\"So you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\\" Matthew 26:36-41 = Second station: Jesus is betrayed by Judas and arrested = While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying, \\"the man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away securely.\\" He came and immediately went over to him and said, \\"Rabbi.\\" And he kissed him. At this they laid hands on him and arrested him. Mark 14: 43-46 = Third station: Jesus is condemned by the Sanhedrin = When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin. They said, \\"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\\" but he replied to them, \\"If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I question, you will not respond. But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\\" They all asked, \\"Are you then the Son of God?\\" He replied to them, \\"You say that I am.\\" Then they said, \\"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\\" Luke 22: 66-71 = Fourth station: Jesus is denied by Peter = Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the maids came over to him and said, \\"You too were with Jesus the Galilean.\\" But Peter denied in front of everyone, saying, \\"I do not know what you are talking about!\\" As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, \\"This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.\\" Again he denied it with an oath, \\"I do not know the man!\\" A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter, \\"Surely you too are one of them; even your speech gives you away.\\" At that he began to curse and to swear, \\"I do not know the man.\\" And immediately a cock crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: \\"Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.\\" He went out and began to weep bitterly. Matthew 26: 69-75 = Fifth station: Jesus is judged by Pontius Pilate = The chief priests with the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held a council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate. Pilate questioned him, \\"Are you the king of the Jews?\\" He said to him in reply, \\"You say so.\\" The chief priests accused him of many things. Again Pilate questioned him, \\"Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.\\" Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.... Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas and handed Jesus over to be crucified. Mark 15: 1-5, 15 = Sixth station: Jesus is scourged at the pillar and crowned with thorns = Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak, and they came to him and said,\\"Hail, King of the Jews!\\" And they struck him repeatedly. John 19: 1-3 = Seventh station: Jesus bears the cross = When the chief priests and the guards saw [Jesus] they cried out, \\"Crucify him, crucify him!\\" Pilate said to them, \\"Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\\" ... They cried out, \\"Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!\\" Pilate said to them, \\"Shall I crucify your king?\\" The chief priests answered, \\"We have no king but Caesar.\\" Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha. John 19: 6, 15-17 = Eighth station: Jesus is helped by Simon the Cyrenian to carry the cross = They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. Mark 15: 21 = Ninth station: Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem = A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, \\"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, ‚ÄòBlessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.' At that time, people will say to the mountains, ‚ÄòFall upon us!' and to the hills, ‚ÄòCover us!' for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\\" Luke 23: 27-31 = Tenth station: Jesus is crucified = When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. [Then Jesus said, \\"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\\"] Luke 23: 33-34 = Eleventh station: Jesus promises his Kingdom to the repentant thief = Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \\"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\\" The other, the \\"repentant thief\\", however, rebuking him, said in reply, \\"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\\" Then he said, \\"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\\" He replied to him, \\"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\\" Luke 23: 39-43 = Twelfth station: Jesus speaks to his mother and the Beloved Disciple = Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother Mary, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the Beloved Disciple, he said to his mother, \\"Woman, behold, your son.\\" Then he said to the disciple, \\"Behold, your mother.\\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. John 19: 25-27 = Thirteenth station: Jesus dies on the cross = (It is optional but appropriate to remain kneeling while in this station) It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \\"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last. Luke 23: 44-46 = Fourteenth station: Jesus is placed in the tomb = When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over. Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it [in] clean linen and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed. Matthew 27: 57-60 = Optional fifteenth station = Many churches have long added the resurrection as a fifteenth station, and in 2000 John Paul II gave his approval. This is in line with the centrality of the resurrection in the Church's liturgy, and with the teaching of Second Vatican Council that \\"devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonise with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.\\" Other innovations The Catholic Church in the Philippines uses a slightly different set called the New Way of the Cross. It starts with the Last Supper and ends with the Resurrection of Jesus. It was adopted as early as 1992. It is used only among dioceses within the Philippines and among Overseas Filipino parishes and communities. Whereas the scriptural form was meant only to add nuance to the understanding of the Passion of Christ, this set of the Stations is perceived to inherently impugn the traditional set as if it were defective, fallacious and invalid. This set is neither sanctioned nor recognized by the Vatican either for personal or public recitation.

The name of \\"Eighteen Mile\\" Creek refers not to the length of the creek, but to its distance from the Niagara River to the west. Originating just north of City of Lockport in the Town of Lockport, it travels approximately northward, winding through the Town of Newfane. A dam by the community of Burt forms a widening of the creek as far upstream as the community of Newfane. Eighteen Mile Creek enters Lake Ontario at Olcott harbor. Much of the course of the creek is followed by New York State Route 78.  Watershed and course  The Eighteen Mile Creek drainage basin is located along the southern shore of Lake Ontario in Niagara County, New York. The creek flows generally to the north and discharges into Lake Ontario, through Olcott Harbor, approximately east of the mouth of the Niagara River. The watershed has a drainage area of approximately and includes Eighteen Mile Creek and its two main tributaries, the East Branch and the Gulf, as well as minor tributaries. In addition, much of the flow in the main branch of Eighteen Mile Creek comes from water diverted from the New York State Barge Canal. The natural topography of the area can be characterized as two relatively flat plains at different elevations separated by the Niagara Escarpment. The southernmost portion of the watershed is at a higher elevation than the remainder of the watershed and is separated by the Niagara Escarpment along the northern portion of the City of Lockport. The watershed lies entirely within Niagara County and encompasses portions of the Towns of Cambria, Lockport (including a portion of the City of Lockport), Royalton, Hartland, Newfane, and Wilson. The majority of the watershed can be characterized as a rural area comprising agricultural lands, with scattered residences along roadways, and rural villages; including Olcott, Newfane, and Gasport. A portion of one urban area, the City of Lockport, falls within the watershed and is the most densely populated area within the watershed. Commercial and industrial uses are concentrated in the City of Lockport. The main branch of Eighteen Mile Creek originates southeast of the City of Lockport, in the vicinity of Keck and Chestnut Ridge Roads, on the south side of the Niagara Escarpment. It travels northwest through the city until it is diverted underground near Vine Street. It then flows north in an underground culvert and resurfaces briefly south of the canal. It travels a short distance under the Canal, to a point near Clinton Street north of the canal, where it again resurfaces. It continues generally north, descending approximately over the Niagara Escarpment. As the creek descends the escarpment, it travels through the abandoned Flintkote factory property on Mill Street, and adjacent to the Lockport Wastewater Treatment Plant. The creek then flows north through the Town of Newfane before draining into Lake Ontario at Olcott Harbor. Environmental protection On March 13, 2012, the section of the creek north of the canal in Lockport was added to the U.S. Superfund National Priorities List. A section of Eighteen Mile Creek was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission because of an existing fish consumption advisory, benthic population decline, a degradation of fish and wildlife populations, prevalence of bird and animal deformities or reproductive problems and restrictions on dredging. Over the years, numerous contaminants have been identified in creek sediments which have a detrimental effect to the AOC and Lake Ontario. These contaminants include but are not limited to: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, dioxins and furans, dieldrin, mirex, DDT, lead, and copper. Sediments contaminated with these substances have directly contributed to the impairments just mentioned. The AOC is relatively pristine to the naked eye. This section of Eighteen Mile Creek flows through a steep-sided, undeveloped wooded gorge, where habitat disturbances are minimal. The extensive beds of emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation in this area account for an estimated , comprising one of the largest coastal wetlands in the western portion of Lake Ontario. These wetlands and undisturbed woodlands bordering Eighteen Mile Creek provide valuable habitats for wildlife that are uncommon in Niagara County's coastal area. A variety of bird species inhabit the area, including great blue heron, green heron, mallard, wood duck, belted kingfisher, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, red-winged blackbird, and swamp sparrow. Eighteen Mile Creek is particularly significant because large concentrations of Coho and Chinook salmon and brown trout migrate from Lake Ontario into the creek each fall. In addition, steelhead migrate into Eighteen Mile Creek during the fall and between late February and April. Due to the importance of this area, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has determined that, \\"Disturbances of wetland vegetation, including submergent beds, through dredging, filling, or bulkheading [excluding Olcott Harbor], would result in a direct loss of valuable habitat area.\\" The mission of the Eighteen Mile Creek Remedial Action Plan (RAP) is to restore the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the ecosystem in the Eighteen Mile Creek Area of Concern in a manner that reflects the communities concern for the preservation and protection of the waterway. Specific goals of the RAP are the protection and enhancement of human health, fish and wildlife, aesthetics, recreation and the economy of the Eighteen Mile Creek Area of Concern. Bathing and aquatic life have been established as the best uses of Eighteen Mile Creek through a public process under the New York State Stream Classification System. The RAP is designed to restore these uses where they have been impaired and to move toward the reduction of all sources of pollutants.

Although quickly ceding top- flight trains to the larger K4s Pacifics, the E6 remained a popular locomotive on lesser services and some lasted to the end of steam on the PRR. One, #460, called the Lindbergh Engine, is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. It was moved indoors to begin preparations for restoration on March 17, 2010. On January 10, 2011, PRR #460 was moved to the museum's restoration shop for a two- to three-year project, estimated to cost $350,000. The engine is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. \\"New life for old iron,\\" January 11, 2011, Intelligencer Journal/New Era, Lancaster, PA  Design  The E6 was designed by the Pennsy's General Superintendent of Motive Power, Lines East, Alfred W. Gibbs, and his team. They produced an Atlantic of modern design, featuring a large and free-steaming boiler, outside Walschaert valve gear, piston valves on the cylinders, and a cast steel KW pattern trailing truck designed by the PRR's Chief Mechanical Engineer, William F. Kiesel, Jr. Modern features never present on the E6 design, and never retrofitted, included the mechanical stoker, power reverse and feedwater heater.  Prototypes and testing  Dimensioned drawing of an E6s. A single prototype E6 locomotive, #5075, was turned out by the PRR's Juniata Shops in 1910; after the railroad's normal fashion, it would embark on a lengthy process of testing and experimentation before a production order was placed. Given that by 1910 the larger 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\" type was the accepted express passenger locomotive, it was somewhat contrarian for the PRR to be considering a new Atlantic class for that service. The E6, however, proved Gibbs et al. correct. The boiler proved free-steaming enough to enlarge the cylinders not once but twice; the stroke remained , but the bore began at and was enlarged to and finally to after superheating. In road testing on the Fort Wayne Division the E6 averaged start to stop for 105 miles with a nine-car train, as well as with a thirteen-car train and with a fifteen-car train. At speeds over , the E6 equaled or bettered a K2 Pacific. This was with the original cylinder bore. Superheating was applied after these tests, and proved itself so well that all other locomotives in the class were built superheated as class E6s, including two further prototypes. On the PRR's static test plant in Altoona the final version of the E6s produced in its cylinders at 56 mph. Also tested, on prototype #1092 classified E6sa, were rotary valves designed by O. W. Young, actuated by regular Walschaerts gear. These proved successful but insufficiently so to be chosen for production locomotives over the reliable piston valve. The barrel-chested E-6 was the first locomotive to achieve over 1000 HP per driving axle.  Production and service  Following the successful testing of the prototype locomotives, the PRR ordered a production run of a further eighty locomotives which were delivered in 1914. All were fitted with superheaters. They were largely assigned to main line limiteds between Jersey City or Manhattan Transfer and either Washington, DC or Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, although they sometimes ran through to Altoona, Pennsylvania. Larger locomotives were generally used on the mountain grades past Altoona. All locomotives were fitted with boxy oil-fired headlights from new, and the production locomotives had long tailrods projecting from the front of the cylinders. The tailrods were soon removed, as they were on other PRR classes that had them, and the oil headlights were replaced by electric units and turbogenerators, the latter sited between the headlamp and the stack. As K4s Pacifics became available in greater numbers in the 1920s, the E6s locomotives were displaced from top-flight trains, but continued in service in lesser assignments, and particularly along the New Jersey seashore routes. Nine locomotives were transferred to the rosters of the Pennsylvania- Reading Seashore Lines, and including those, all 83 of class E6s were still in service in 1947. Some locomotives were leased by the PRR to subsidiary Long Island Rail Road. Lindbergh run PRR 460 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania Celebrated pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh returned to the United States on June 11, 1927, after his successful solo transatlantic flight from New York City to Paris; he was greeted by President Calvin Coolidge at Washington, DC and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. There was intense competition between several newsreel companies to be the first to get footage of the ceremony back to New York to show in the Broadway theaters. Several companies chartered aircraft, but the International News Reel Corporation instead chartered a special train from the Pennsylvania Railroad, repeating what it had done for President Coolidge's inauguration. A plane could get from Washington to New York faster than a train, but the train could carry a darkroom to develop the film en route, making the train competitive. PRR management seized the opportunity to make headlines and set everything up for a record run. Other trains would be moved out of the way of the Lindbergh newsreel special. E6s Atlantic #460 was selected, being recently overhauled but having had time to \\"run in\\" after the work; B60B baggage car #7874 was equipped as a darkroom and P70 coach #3301 would carry PRR and newsreel company officials. The crew were cleared to run as fast as they considered safe; the tender would not need refueling during the run and the water scoop would pick up water from track pans without stopping. Unfortunately, the scoop was damaged during the first pickup attempt due to the speed at which the train had been traveling. An unscheduled three-minute stop near Wilmington was needed to repair it and fill up from a standpipe. The train made it to the electric changeover at Manhattan Transfer with an average speed of , a record never beaten by steam on that journey, with a reported maximum speed of . The newsreels brought by train reached the cinema screens over an hour before the ones flown due to the delay to process the latter. The Pennsylvania Railroad used this victory extensively in publicity in the following years. It is no coincidence that of the 83 class E6s locomotives, it was the \\"Lindbergh Engine\\", #460, that was selected for historic preservation. #460 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Passenger Locomotive No. 460. It was retired from service in 1955.

Typically a crib is made from wood, but it could be made from any long cylindrical material. Pairs of logs are laid parallel, then others laid over them to make a square, and this continues upwards in a style of building similar to a log cabin's construction. Each crib can be either empty or filled with a material such as rocks, gravel, concrete blocks, etc. This material can serve to provide additional stability in the event of high winds if the crib is very tall. Advantages of crib construction include its simplicity and strength. Logs need only be cut and notched for stability, then lain crosswise until a certain height is reached. As each layer of wood is only used as a compressive layer, the wood need not be strong. Since there are few load-bearing fasteners in the lower levels, reasonable strength is possible. Disadvantages include very heavy construction, relying on much more material than a bridge of more advanced design.

Unlike traditional learning, where learning a subject in depth was necessary to draw enough pertinent knowledge to solve new problems or answer questions, information grazing assumes some subjects are so large, fast-changing, interdependent, or esoteric, that traditional methods of learning may be unable to solve new problems or answer questions as efficiently. Information grazing is also one of the most commonly used coping techniques for stress and experts have noticed a trend with people many under the age of 35. The change from a traditional in-depth learning and memorizing of facts to a mentality of quickly finding, using, and then forgetting knowledge, stems from the technological singularity concept that information is growing so fast (see information explosion or information overload) that an individual can no longer hope to be a \\"renaissance man\\" or effectively keep up with some fields of knowledge. Examples of fields of knowledge that are more susceptible to information grazing techniques are science and engineering, where the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù knowledge has become so dynamic, that documentation and dissemination has increasingly moved from fixed paper media to digital formats allowing easier updating and searchability. With the advent of the Internet and modern computer-cataloging of libraries, vast sums of knowledge are easily accessible in overwhelming quantities in real time. And, with expected future advances in search engine technology and library services, the trend of information overload is expected to worsen; information grazing techniques will become more prevalent to deal with the overload. Disadvantages of information grazing come from its advantages. Switching from a \\"fixed\\" source of information that is constant, verifiable, and worth memorizing to \\"fluid\\" sources that are always in flux can lead to quick solutions that are unverified or worse, incorrect. Studies have shown that many people don't read past the first sentences of a Web site's content, and many never go beyond the first ten links listed in a search. As information becomes more like an instantaneous consumable item, memorization is less fact-based but more procedural (i.e. how to find it). Similar concepts are found in Japanese education where after intense study of many unconnected facts, most of the information is forgotten or if remembered, not connected to other relevant facts. In the US, this is similar to cramming an exam. Information grazing may have the same effect but greater, since it is done over the period of years.

Early life Gosh was born in the village of Nuri, near Karima, but moved during his childhood to Port Sudan. He was good at mathematics, became involved in the Islamist movement, and went on to study engineering at the University of Khartoum. As a student, he provided Hassan al Turabi's NIF movement with information about the beliefs of various student activists.Sudan Tribune, Salah Gosh  Salah Abdallah \\"Gosh\\", http://www.sudantribune.com/+-Salah-Gosh,493+- After the 1989 coup, he joined the Islamist government and helped Al Qaeda establish their base of operations in Sudan during the early 1990s. War crimes Gosh has been accused of having a significant role in organizing the Khartoum government's militias in the Darfur Conflict. According to the journalist Mark Goldberg, Gosh was \\"listed in a confidential annex to a January 30th Security Council report that identifies the 17 Sudanese individuals whom a panel of U.N. experts concluded were most responsible for war crimes and impeding the peace process.\\"The American Prospect , Feb. 2006 The panel recommended to freeze foreign assets and ban international travel for these individuals.Sudan Watch, March 2006 Goldberg also described Gosh as \\"[the] personal government minder\\" for Osama bin Laden when the latter was in Sudan between 1990 and 1996. According to Sudan commentator Eric Reeves, the panel also accused Gosh of having failed \\"to take action as Director of NSIS to identify, neutralize, and disarm non-state armed militia groups in Darfur [the Janjaweed],\\" as well as for \\"command responsibility for acts or arbitrary detention, harassment, torture, denial of right to fair trial.\\" Gosh has also been a point of contact between the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Sudan on counter-terrorism issues.

Mohamed Ellatta took his place to become the head of NSIS (National Security and Intelligence Service). 2011 Wikileaks documents In November 2011 Wikileaks diplomatic cables showed that Gosh had viewed Bashir's indictment by the ICC as a liability and might have been willing to support a coup against him.

In 1978, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature established Azraq as a wetlands reserve. By 1992, however, the springs dried up, and the aquifers that had once gushed ceased to provide.

It is located in Monywa District, Sagaing Division. It is the principal town of Chaung-U township. In the Bagan dynasty, when King Popa Saw Rahan (also known as King Taungthugyi) governed the country, it was named \\"San Tauk Village\\". It was a large village where different natives of the Union of Myanmar, like Kayin, Shan and Lawah (Wah) natives, lived happily together.The History of Chaung Oo by historians Then, King Kyansit founded the city, gathering ten villages together, for example, Ywa Thit and Ywa Ma, naming it Chaung Oo (or Chaung-U). It is situated above sea level at north latitude 22¬∞ 45' and east longitude 95¬∞ 8' to 95¬∞ 25'.The monograph Agriculture in Chaung U' The Monywa‚ÄìMandalay highway road passes it, so the communication to it is good, quick and easy. The Monywa‚ÄìMandalay railway meets that of Chaung-U‚ÄìPakokku in the town's station, so it is possible to get there by train. Its official township boundary touches the boundaries of other townships: Myinmu is in the east, Myaung is in the south and south-east, Salingyi is in the west, and Monywa is in the north. The Chindwin River is in the west of the township and the town is six miles away from the river. In Chaung-U there are historical ancient pagodas. Besides, its township has other historical villages, streams, and hills. Yadana Shwe Gu Kyi Pagoda which was built by King Alaung Sithu in Chaung-U Shwe Gu Kyi Pagoda History It was a village in the early age of the Bagan Dynasties before King Ah NawyahtƒÅr. To be exact, it was a crowded village, so King Taung Thu Kyi transferred there from Poppa when he was a farmer before he became a king. When he became the King in Bagan, he founded the village as an ideal village surrounded by ten villages, and he called it Than Tauk in ME 187. The village was named Than Tauk (San Tauk) because holes flared up when some holes were dug to traditionally bury the abracadabra copper sheets in the ground and to make the village fence. Then, King Kyansit founded the city with ten villages including San Tauk and named it Chaung-U. He called it so because some waves of the Nwe Chway stream were ahead of him there, although he tried to jump across it. When he was a prince, he had always been there and he stayed for a while. After that, the prince Kya Swar and his mother stayed and prayed in Saman Daja (Thaman Daza) Pagoda in Chaung-U to become a king. When he became the King, he offered to gild the pagoda.The stone inscription present in Saman Daja pagoda There is still an inscription on flat stone for his gilding and offering to the pagoda and donating to the monastery. There are many historical ancient pagodas and monasteries in Chaung-U. It has over 200 pagodas and 60 monasteries. Among them, the most distinctive pagoda is Yadana Shwe Gukyi Pagoda built in the downtown in ME 288. Some people say that it was built by King Ah'laung Sithu and some people say that King Popa Saw Raham built it. Throughout all dynasties in Myanmar, Chaung-U has been a town but it was sometimes a village. When King Sin Phyu Shin governed in Innwa and the country, Ramma Siri Kyaw Htin, the Librarian of Pitakkat and headman of ten villages of Chaung-U, was a famous doctor of literature. Moreover, Min Latwah who served King Mindom was also a famous headman of ten villages of Chaung-U and mayor of A Myint. In the age of the British Colony, Venerable Abbot Ven. D Pa of Maha Dhmmayone Pali University was honored as the Agga Maha Pantita by the British Government of Myanmar. Later abbots were also granted that certificate of honour by the National Governments. In ME 1365 or 2004, the centenary ceremony of the university was celebrated.The monumental magazine published in the Centenary Ceremony of Maha Dhmma Yone Pali University Many famous poets, politicians and intellectuals have been born in Chaung-U. Now, it is a crowded town located on important highways. Directory The Monywa‚ÄìMandalay and Chaung-U-Pakokku trains provide access to Chaung-U. It is possible to reach from Mandalay or Monywa, and from Pakokku by car, bike, motor bike or by other vehicles. It is 84 miles away from Mandalay, and 14 miles away from Monywa. Moreover, there is a good highway from Chaung-U to Pakokku. Chindwin river is in the west. Chaung-U in map Coordinates 21¬∞57‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥N, 95¬∞16‚Ä≤32‚Ä≥E Sagaing Division, Central Myanmar  Economy  Since there is much farmland all over the township and the town is located at the junction of two highway roads, public business goes quite well and it is abundantly rich with vegetables, fruits and other foods. One can abundantly and cheaply get any sort of vegetables. The communication is so easy, thus the commerce or trade and transportation are good enough to say that a high percentage of population in the town have got enough good business and a comfortable living standard. Weather and climate It is in a central zone of Myanmar. Its weather is fair. Chaung-U features a tropical wet and dry climate. Geography In the east of the town, there are long rocky hills, namely, \\"Nwechway Hills\\". The town is situated in a plain. In the west, there have many green basin farms near the Chindwin river. Those farms in the east are irrigated by Nwe Chway Dam near Nwe Chway village.

Another distinction of the town is having the oldest festival of the whole township, Maha Pawah RƒÅna, on Thidingyut Full Moon Day every year. In 2012, the 70th Maha Pawah RƒÅna Festival of the whole township was celebrated. In the festival, all Buddhist monks in the whole township meet each other and make the Pawah RƒÅna in the only Buddhist Pawah RƒÅna Hall of the township, and Buddhist people offer some articles to them in every Thidingyut Full Moon Day. The festival has been successfully celebrated yearly since 1942. As the 70th festival of Maha Pawah RƒÅna was recently celebrated last Thidingyut Full Moon Day in 2012, Chaung-U is one of the towns and cities having the longest Maha Pawah RƒÅna festival tradition.

Telegraphing may undercut suspense by advance disclosure or extreme hinting of an element in a composition, narrative plot, or recitation. A familiar example is stand-up comic and comedy films \\"telegraphing\\" the punch line of a joke, i.e. making its outcome obvious before it happens. This meaning for the term was coined shortly after the invention of the telegraph. In music and the visual arts, such techniques are respected as means of preparing the audience by \\"building up\\" to the foreseeable result, as musical overtures usually do. In role- playing games such as live-action role-playing it may refer to non-verbal communication with other players through gestures to convey the intentions of the player outside the game. Telegraphing is often compared to foreshadowing as a way to reveal incoming plot and make the listener to form expectations. While foreshadowing not necessarily reveals that the introduced element will play a role later, telegraphing conveys information to spectators about how the plot will develop. Contrast it with red herring, where the plot element revealed in advance is intended to be misleading. In literature telegraphing is generally seen as lessening the final effect by approaching it too gradually, and thus as a failure of literary technique. Information used too often to telegraph information about characters can be overused and become clich√©s, such as a dumb police officer eating doughnuts, an absent-minded professor, or a beautiful librarian concealed by unattractive personal grooming.

The band played a mix of post-hardcore and psychedelic rock and was described by Trouser Press as \\"Austin's resident heirs to the Butthole Surfers' weird- rock crown\\". Ed Hall was a trio not containing any member of that name; Gary Chester handled guitar duties, with Larry Strub on bass. Drumming on the band's first two albums was handled by Kevin Whitley, who was replaced by Lyman Hardy until the group dissolved. History =Early years (1985‚Äì1988)= Ed Hall was founded in 1985 by John Buron, Gary Chester, Andy Colvin and Larry Strub. Larry Strub had moved to Austin in the early eighties to attend the University of Texas where he met drummer John Buron, who was interested in starting a band. At his advice, Strub began learning to play bass guitar. Gary Chester took botany classes with Strub and was offered to join the duo. The band was named as such after Buron created a character named Ed Hall in a game of Exquisite Corpse. \\"John thought Ed Hall was a great name because it was totally opposite of the Butthole Surfers, Scratch Acid, or the Dead Kennedys,\\" explains Chester. \\"It was just this totally banal, generic name.\\" The band began performing during Art Student's Association gatherings at UT before switching to playing at the local Dong Huong Vietnamese restaurant on North Loop, which also served as a live platform for other local punk groups such as the Pocket FishRmen, ST-37, and Thanatopsis. The location was known for their willingness to support esoteric and cult performers and the live compilation The Polyp Explodes, which featured Ed Hall was released locally. The compilation was brought to the attention of Tom Flynn at Boner Records, a Berkley-based label known for issuing esoteric underground groups. Upon hearing Ed Hall, Flynn contacted the band and offered them five hundred dollars to record their debut album. Andy Colvin, who had served as the group's lead vocalist up until that point, departed from the band for personal reasons. Recordings Ed Hall made with Colvin appeared on Charlie Manson Street, a 1989 compilation album comprising Colvin's work with multiple bands including Interdimensional Vortex League. =Boner records albums (1988‚Äì1991)= After releasing six songs on the Mind Drum Records compilation Charlie Manson Street, debut album Albert was released on the Boner label in 1988. Standout track \\"Candy House\\" was a taste of things to come on 1990s similarly bizarre and humorous Love Poke Here. The band was subsequently featured in Richard Linklater's 1991 indie film Slacker, and signed a contract with Butthole Surfer King Coffey's Trance Syndicate label and toured North America as the Butthole Surfers' support act. =Trance Syndicate albums (1991‚Äì1996)= With each song named after an individual that may or may not have ever existed, 1992's Trance Syndicate debut Gloryhole marked a change in the band's sound, whilst retaining much in the style of its two predecessors: open, loose backbeats overlaid with pop song structures, and Butthole Surfers- esque influence. Production changed following the move to Butch Vig's Smart Studios, and highlights included \\"Buster Enamel\\" and the Jakob-like instrumental \\"Bernie Sticky,\\" along with a cello-driven cover of Kiss's \\"Beth\\" (also released as a 7-inch single on Trance Syndicate) 1993's Motherscratcher opening track \\"White House Girls,\\" with its exaggerated backbeat and laughing chorus, employs prickly riffs and trebly, note-driven leads of guitarist Gary Chester, with bass player Larry Strub and new drummer Lyman Hardy, who replaced Kevin Whitley prior to the Gloryhole tour. Influences also include Flipper, and with whom they toured in 1994. Ed Hall's fifth album, 1995's La La Land was an extension of the ground covered on Motherscratcher . =Breakup and post-breakup activities (1996‚Äìpresent)= Their sixth album, Permission to Rock... Denied was completed but never officially released. In a March 2013 interview with online music zine Punk Globe, Strub commented on the record stating, \\"You could still tell it was us, but different.\\" Ed Hall split in 1996. Bassist Strub moved to Thailand and taught English for some years. Gary Chester spent time in Moist Fist and Gold (which was just Pong), and Lyman Hardy played in a number of bands, including the Goin' Along Feelin' Just Fines. All three now play in retro-futuristic cosmic dance-rock combo Pong. A reunion show in Austin, Texas in 2003 featured Chester, Strubb, Hardy, and Whitley, with Whitley and Hardy sharing drum duties. A reunion show (with Crust and Pain Teens) happened in November 2012. Another show in Austin took place on July 19, 2014. Ed Hall played a double-bill with Pong at Fred's Texas Cafe in Fort Worth, TX on August 2, 2014. =Andy Colvin & Ed Hall (2015)= In 2015 using the appellation \\"Andy Colvin & Ed Hall\\" vocalist Andy Colvin released hundreds of outtakes, b-sides, and alternate versions of material recorded during Ed Hall's early years. =Ed Hall: The Unauthorized Story= On September 28, 2017, the Local Sightings Film Festival in Seattle premiered the short documentary film titled Ed Hall: The Unauthorized Story (2016) which was directed by Benjamin Camp and produced by Andy Colvin.\\"Semi Iconic, The Ballad of Dick Rosetti\\", The Stranger, September 23, 2017 Band members Final line-up * Gary Chester ‚Äì electric guitar (1985‚Äì1996), vocals (1987‚Äì1996) * Lyman Hardy ‚Äì drums (1991‚Äì1996) * Larry Strub ‚Äì bass guitar (1985‚Äì1996), vocals (1987‚Äì1996) Former members * John Buron ‚Äì drums (1985) * Andy Colvin ‚Äì vocals (1985‚Äì1987) * Kevin Whitley ‚Äì drums (1985‚Äì1991) ;Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1985 till:01/01/1996 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocal value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Studio albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1986 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1987 LineData = at:01/01/1988 color:black layer:back at:01/01/1990 color:black layer:back at:12/31/1991 color:black layer:back at:10/18/1993 color:black layer:back at:05/23/1995 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Andy text:\\"Andy Colvin\\" bar:Gary text:\\"Gary Chester\\" bar:Larry text:\\"Larry Strub\\" bar:John text:\\"John Buron\\" bar:Lyman text:\\"Kevin Whitley\\" bar:Kevin text:\\"Lyman Hardy\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Gary from:01/01/1985 till:01/01/1996 color:Guitar bar:Gary from:01/01/1987 till:01/01/1996 color:Vocal width:3 bar:Larry from:01/01/1985 till:01/01/1996 color:Bass bar:Larry from:01/01/1987 till:01/01/1996 color:Vocal width:3 bar:Lyman from:06/01/1985 till:06/01/1992 color:Drums bar:Lyman from:01/01/1987 till:06/01/1992 color:Vocal width:3 bar:Kevin from:06/01/1992 till:01/01/1996 color:Drums bar:Andy from:01/01/1985 till:01/01/1987 color:Vocal bar:John from:01/01/1985 till:06/01/1985 color:Drums Discography Studio albums *Albert (1988, Boner) *Love Poke Here (1990, Boner) *Gloryhole (1991, Trance Syndicate) *Motherscratcher (1993, Trance Syndicate) *La La Land (1995, Trance Syndicate) *Permission to Rock...

He played guard at the University of Michigan from 1922 to 1924, and was chosen as a first-team All-American in 1924. Slaughter served as an assistant football coach at the University of Wisconsin, North Carolina State University, and the University of Virginia. He was also a member of the faculty at the University of Virginia, and held a variety of positions, including Chairman of the Department of Physical Education and Director of Intramural Sports, from 1931 until his retirement in 1973. Early years Slaughter was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1903 and was an exceptional athlete. He played center and was the captain of the 1920 football team at Louisville Male High School in Louisville, Kentucky.Male Bulldog Football History Michigan Slaughter enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1921 and played on Fielding H. Yost's football team as a guard from 1922 to 1924. Yost later credited Slaughter with \\"the greatest play in football I ever saw.\\" The play took place in the last 18 seconds of the 1923 Michigan‚ÄìWisconsin game. Wisconsin had the ball at its own 35-yard line and needed to gain 65 yards for a score. A Wisconsin player caught a pass and appeared to be heading to a game-winning touchdown. Yost described Slaughter's \\"diving shoe-string tackle\\" as follows: > Suddenly, with a great burst of speed, a Michigan man went for him, grabbed > him and downed him. I looked for the number of the Michigan man. Lo and > behold, it was 'Butch' Slaughter, a guard, who, under ordinary > circumstances, would have no more business in that part of the field than I > would. Down Harris and Slaughter went on our 20-yard line, and with them > went the chance of all chances for Wisconsin, for the whistle which ended > the game blew at that moment. Slaughter's play preserved an undefeated season for the 1923 team and helped them win the national football championship. At the end of the 1923 season, sports writer Lawrence Perry selected Slaughter as a first-team All-American at the guard position. In the 1924 season, Michigan overcame a late 6‚Äì0 deficit to win, 16‚Äì6, against Ohio State. Slaughter scored a touchdown in the game to help George Little win his only game as coach against Ohio State. At the end of the 1924 season, Slaughter was selected as a first-team All- American by Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly, Norman E. Brown, and Lawrence Perry. on the last All-American team selected by Walter Camp. In announcing his choice of Slaughter as an All-American, Walter Camp wrote: > Slaughter is a veteran guard who has always towered in any line of forwards. > A big man, extremely active, he provides the pivotal spot upon which a line- > plunging attack may rest. He carries his charge through so that he is never > shoved back upon his runner. He is never guilty of 'knifing' through. > Slaughter has unlimited endurance. Sports columnist Norman E. Brown wrote, \\"Slaughter is one of the greatest defensive guards the Big Ten has had in recent years. ... On offense Slaughter could be counted on not only to open up a hole but \\"carry through\\" with the play.\\" Life magazine wrote 25 years later that Slaughter had been \\"famous and feared for vicious tackling at Michigan.\\" Slaughter graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor of science degree in engineering. Wisconsin In July 1925, Slaughter was hired as assistant coach for the University of Wisconsin Badgers football team. Slaughter coached the Wisconsin linemen under head coach George Little, who had coached Slaughter at Michigan. His former Michigan teammate, Irwin Uteritz, was also hired by Little as an assistant coach to work with the Wisconsin backfield players. Slaughter remained the line coach at Wisconsin for the 1925 and 1926 college football seasons. In September 1926, reports were published indicating that Slaughter had signed to play professional football with Red Grange. However, Slaughter turned down the offer, noting that he would be barred from coaching in the Big Ten Conference if he signed as a professional football player. North Carolina State In April 1927, Slaughter was hired as an assistant football coach at North Carolina State College. He was an assistant coach at North Carolina State under Gus Tebell. During the 1927 season, Slaughter handled the linemen, while Tebell worked with the backfield players. In 1928, Slaughter was hired as the line coach at Michigan State University but failed to report for the job. When the Spartan squad assembled for practice on September 10, 1928, Slaughter was not on hand. Coach Harry Kipke gave him the benefit of the doubt, assuming the Spartans used the same early practice date as the Big Ten, September 15. When Slaughter failed to arrive on that date, Kipke sent him several telegrams but received no response. North Carolina State announced on September 20, 1928 that Slaughter had been retained for another year as its line coach. Slaughter continued serving as line coach for the North Carolina State Wolfpack through the 1930 football season. Virginia In March 1931, Slaughter was hired as an assistant football coach at the University of Virginia, where he was put in charge of the linemen under new head coach Fred Dawson. Slaughter was an assistant coach under Lawson from 1931 to 1933. In 1934, Gus Tebell took over as the head coach at Virginia, and Slaughter stayed on as the line coach under Tebell through the 1936 season. When Frank Murray replaced Tebell as head football coach in February 1937, Slaughter was kept on line coach. In July 1940, Slaughter left the football team to assume a faculty position as an instructor in Virginia's physical education department and was replaced by another University of Michigan All-American Ralph Heikkinen as the Cavaliers' line coach. Slaughter continued to serve on Virginia's faculty, becoming an assistant professor in 1944 and an associate professor in 1950. He also served as a member of the University Senate, Chairman of the Department of Physical Education, and Chairman of the Processions Committee and received the IMP Society Faculty Award in 1965. Slaughter also took over as the coach of Virginia's golf team in 1940. In his first year as the coach of the golf team, one of his athletes, Dixon Brooke, won the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships. Slaughter also served as the chairman of the ACC Golf Coaches Association. He coached the Cavaliers' golf team from 1940 through at least the 1965 season.Corks and Curls (1965 ed.), page 219.

From 1946 to 1948, he also returned to football coaching as an assistant football coach under Arthur Guepe, the fourth Virginia head coach for whom Slaughter served as line coach.(\\"The approaching registration of students for the fall term brought a group of Junior varsity candidates for Assistant Coach Butch Slaughter who started drawing up a game schedule and planning scrimmage work with the varsity.\\") Slaughter also served as the Director of the Department of Intramurals at the University of Virginia from 1957 to 1973. Slaughter retired from the University of Virginia in 1973. In November 1982, the Slaughter Recreation Center, a new intramural athletic center on the University of Virginia campus, was dedicated in honor of Slaughter. Death and family Slaughter's gravestone at the University of Virginia Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. Slaughter died in 1985 at age 82. After learning of Slaughter's death, Joe Palumbo, captain of Virginia's 1951 football team said: \\"I best remember Butch Slaughter as a prince among men.

She subsequently commissioned him and nine other officials to tour the 10 circuits that the empire was divided into. In 691, the assistant imperial censor Lai Zixun () falsely accused the official Liu Xinggan (), his brothers Liu Xingshi () and Liu Xingyu (), and nephew Liu Qiantong () of treason. Wu Zetian put Shi and her secret police official Lai Junchen in charge of the investigations. Shi was friendly with Liu Xinggan and tried to find ways to absolve him and his family members, but could not, and Liu Xinggan and his brothers and nephew were all executed. Afterwards, Lai Junchen reported to Wu Zetian that Shi was trying to absolve the Lius. Wu Zetian ordered Lai Junchen to investigate Shi as well. Shi, in fear, committed suicide.

Among other things, he is particularly noted for his role in developing certain innovative Chinese characters of Empress Wu; that is, as part of Wu Zetian's acquisition and consolidation of power by means of literature and religious practices, Zong Qinke worked on developing modified characters to replace the regular forms of characters with particular symbolic importance with newly invented characters intended to support this process, such as the characters for her personal name (Zhao) and the characters for \\"Heaven\\" (tian) and \\"Earth\\" (d√¨). It is not known when Zong Qinke was born, but it is known that he was from Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and that his mother was a cousin of Wu Zetian's.

Around the new year 690, she adopted and promulgated the new characters, which were used until at least 705. Later in 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, establishing Zhou as its \\"emperor\\" and interrupting Tang.

In addition to carrying news, all laws passed in Peru must be published by El Peruano. It is currently edited by Delfina Becerra Gonz√°lez. It is published by the Peruvian Company of Editorial Services SA - Editora Peru (Empresa Peruana de Servicios Editoriales SA - EDITORA PER√ö), a state enterprise under private law.

This law included the various collective state media under a unified management, the majority of which returned to private ownership following the departure of the military regime from power. History =Early decades (1825-1854)= El Peruano was first published in Lima on October 22, 1825 under the name El Peruano Independiente, an \\"official\\" newspaper established by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who ordered Tom√°s de Heres to create a publication supporting his presence in Peru. In May 1826, the Ministry of Government declared the publication official and ordered that notices and documents relating to the civil service be inserted in it. Its name was changed to simply El Peruano on May 13 of that year. The cleric Lucas Pellicer was the first editor after the officialization of the publication. The Gazette began publishing laws on November 15, 1826 because the newspaper El Registro Oficial, which was published for that purpose, was published irregularly. Over time El Registro Oficial lost its importance compared to El Peruano. El Peruano underwent a series of name changes. It was called La Prensa Peruana under the leadership of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Larriva (1828-1829), El Conciliador under the leadership of Felipe Pardo y Aliaga (1830-1834). It was also called El Redactor Peruano (1834-1836 and 1838), La Gaceta de Gobierno (1835), El Eco del Protectorado (1836-1839), and in Lima El Eco del Norte (1837-1838).

Wodzicki's other research activities included studies on Australasian gannets at Cape Kidnappers, rooks and the birdlife of the Waikanae estuary, as well as investigating problems with introduced rodents on Tokelau and Niue. Along with J. E. C. Flux he rediscovered an introduced population of the then supposedly extinct Parma wallaby on Kawau Island.

They were best known for their VHS releases of Zombie 2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I Spit on Your Grave. They were also well known for their detailed (and often lurid) box art, especially after their switch to the \\"big box\\" format. So popular was the label that Charles Band has begun reissuing titles (starting with 1989's Intruder) under the old Wizard Video banner. Wizard Video is also known for creating the two Atari 2600 video games The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween under the name Wizard Video Games. However, these games were aimed at the adult market; so, because of its violent content, these games were either banned from stores or hidden behind the counter and only taken out by request. This caused the games to become rare and sales were small, causing the company to stop making video games. The company also distributed films under the \\"Force Video\\" logo. On February 7, 2013, Charles Band claimed to have rediscovered copies of 36 Wizard Video title boxes, as well as Wizard's video game boxes, in one of his storage warehouses. 32 of the 36 films were re-released as limited editions on a four- titles-per-month basis starting on February 12, with the inner clamshell cases and tapes being new production. The entire supply of the remaining 4 films was discovered to be water damaged and would not be released; the two games will be re-released at a later date.The Wizard Video Collection In 2014, the Wizard Video brand was re-launched as Wizard Studioshttp://www.fangoria.com/new/charles-bands-wizard-studios-unveils-first- films/ Fangoria - Charles Band's Wizard Studios Unveils First Films \\"to spotlight rising independent filmmakers and their cutting-edge genre pictures\\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/73285/wizard-studios-announces- first-3-films-vampie-virginia-obscura-and-villanelle Dread Central - Wizard Studios announces first 3 films - Vampie, Virginia Obscura and Villanelle with the first wave of films - Virginia Obscura, Vampie, Villanelle - premiering on Band's Full Moon Features subscription-based streaming service.

The Western Han inhabitants of the county had migrated to the area from western regions. The county was renamed Liqian () during the Northern Wei dynasty and disestablished during the Sui dynasty, becoming part of Fanhe County. There is a myth that some of the modern-day residents of Zhelaizhai (now Liqian village, in Jiaojiazhuang township) are descendants of a group of Roman soldiers that were never accounted for after being captured in the Battle of Carrhae. However, eminent Chinese authorities, modern genetic studies, and archaeologists have debunked this theory.  History  The area that became Liqian County did not become part of Chinese territory until the Western Han dynasty conquered this area in 2nd century BC. Until the 1st century BC, it belonged to Fanhe county (), Zhangye prefecture (). In 37 ;BC, General Chen Tang () of the Western Han dynasty attacked Xiongnu and brought many captives back to China in 36 ;BC. These captives were given land to be settled. The place was called Liqian, which is where Zhelaizhai is now situated. Liqian was split from Fanhe and received the county status in the Western Han dynasty. The inhabitants around Liqian were later called Liqian Rong () or Lushui Hu () in historical records. Several states established by non-Han Chinese have controlled Liqian during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Lushui Hu even ruled one of these states, the Northern Liang, from 401 to 439 ;AD. The Northern Wei conquered the Northern Liang. In the coming years, Liqian was ruled by the Northern Wei, the Western Wei, the Northern Zhou, and then the Sui dynasty, which reunified China in 589 ;AD. Liqian county was merged into Fanhe county again in about 592.  Lost Romans myth  During the 20th century, theory speculated that some of the people of Liqian may be descended from Ancient Romans. In the 1940s, Homer H. Dubs, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford, suggested that the people of Liqian were descended from Roman legionaries taken prisoner at the Battle of Carrhae. These prisoners, Dubs proposed, were resettled by the victorious Parthians on their eastern border and may have fought as mercenaries at the Battle of Zhizhi, between the Chinese and the Xiongnu in 36 ;BC. Chinese chroniclers mention the use of a \\"fish-scale formation\\" of soldiers, which Dubs believed referred to the testudo formation ‚Äì a Roman phalanx surrounded by shields on all sides. Several investigations of Dubs' theory have been conducted. To date, no artifacts which might confirm a Roman presence, such as coins or weaponry, have been discovered in Zhelaizhai. Rob Gifford, commenting on the theory, described it as one of many \\"rural myths\\". People with normatively Caucasoid traits and/or who spoke Indo-European languages lived in areas that are now part of Gansu and Xinjiang centuries before the Romans, including the Yuezhi, Wusun, Basmyls, Tocharians, and some prehistoric Siberian populations. One or more of these peoples may have been responsible for the Caucasoid Tarim mummies of Xinjiang. Genetic testing in 2005 revealed that 56% of the DNA of some Zhelaizhai residents could be classified as Caucasoid but did not determine their origins. A subsequent DNA study found that \\"paternal genetic variation\\" did not support \\"a Roman mercenary origin\\" and that the modern population of Liqian was consistent genetically with being a \\"subgroup of the Chinese majority Han.\\"  See also  * Sino-Roman relations  Notes   References   Further reading   Category:Geography of Gansu Category:Jinchang ","title":"Liqian"},{"id":"14889935","text":"Street of Tada-U Tada-U or Tadau is a town in central Myanmar about 10 km from the provincial capital of Mandalay.

Agostinho Neto, the leader of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), declared the independence of the People's Republic of Angola on November 11, 1975, in accordance with the Alvor Accords. UNITA and the FNLA also declared Angolan independence as the Social Democratic Republic of Angola based in Huambo and the Democratic Republic of Angola based in Ambriz. FLEC, armed and backed by the French government, declared the independence of the Republic of Cabinda from Paris. The National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forged an alliance on November 23, proclaiming their own coalition government based in Huambo with Holden Roberto and Jonas Savimbi as co-presidents and Jos√© Ndel√© and Johnny Pinnock Eduardo as co-Prime Ministers. The South African government told Savimbi and Roberto in early November that the South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations in Angola despite the coalition's failure to capture Luanda and therefore secure international recognition at independence. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of the largest, friendly, military force in Angola, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of November 10, the day before independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria, South Africa and the meeting took place. In a remarkable reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep troops through November but promised to withdraw the SADF troops only after the OAU meeting on December 9. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on November 12. The Soviet leadership expressly forbid the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa. In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, with the exception of Cuba, withdrew. The last elements of the Portuguese military withdrew in 1975 and the South African military withdrew in February 1976. On the other hand, Cuba's troop force in Angola increased from 5,500 in December 1975 to 11,000 in February 1976. FNLA forces were crushed by Operation Carlota, a joint Cuban-Angolan attack on Huambo on January 30, 1976.Angola Reds on Outskirts of Pro-Western capital city, January 30, 1976. The Argus, page 10, via NewspaperArchive.com. By mid-November, the Huambo government had gained control over southern Angola and began pushing north. Clark Amendment President Gerald Ford approved covert aid to UNITA and the FNLA through Operation IA Feature on July 18, 1975, despite strong opposition from officials in the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Ford told William Colby, the Director of Central Intelligence, to \\"go ahead and do it\\" with an initial US$6 million in funding. He granted an additional $8 million in funding on July 27 and another $25 million in August. Senator Dick Clark Two days prior to the program's approval, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he believed maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to more violence and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying the success required expanding the program, but the program's size already exceeded what could be hidden from the public eye. Davis' deputy, former U.S. ambassador to Chile Edward Mulcahy, also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on May 13, 1975. Mulcahy believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the Communist MPLA, refuse to take sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA. He warned however that supporting UNITA would not sit well with Mobutu Sese Seko, the ruler of Zaire. Dick Clark, a Democratic Senator from Iowa, discovered the operation during a fact-finding mission in Africa, but Seymour Hersh, a reporter for The New York Times, revealed IA Feature to the public on December 13, 1975. Clark proposed an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act, barring aid to private groups engaged in military or paramilitary operations in Angola. The Senate passed the bill, voting 54-22 on December 19, 1975, and the House passed the bill, voting 323-99 on January 27, 1976. Ford signed the bill into law on February 9, 1976. Even after the Clark Amendment became law, then- Director of Central Intelligence, George H. W. Bush, refused to concede that all U.S. aid to Angola had ceased.p. 52 Pages 186-187. According to foreign affairs analyst Jane Hunter, Israel stepped in as a proxy arms supplier for the United States after the Clark Amendment took effect. The U.S. government vetoed Angolan entry into the United Nations on June 23, 1976.Kalley (1999). Page 4. Zambia forbid UNITA from launching attacks from its territory after Angola became a member of the UN on December 1, 1976. Vietnam The Vietnam War tempered foreign involvement in Angola's civil war as neither the Soviet Union nor the United States wanted to be drawn into an internal conflict of highly debatable importance in terms of winning the Cold War. CBS Newscaster Walter Cronkite spread this message in his broadcasts to \\"try to play our small part in preventing that mistake this time.\\" The Politburo engaged in heated debate over the extent to which the Soviet Union would support a continued offensive by the MPLA in February 1976. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Premier Alexei Kosygin led a faction favoring less support for the MPLA and greater emphasis on preserving d√©tente with the West. Leonid Brezhnev, the then head of the Soviet Union, won out against the dissident faction and the Soviet alliance with the MPLA continued even as Neto publicly reaffirmed its policy of non-alignment at the 15th anniversary of the First Revolt. Angolan government and Cuban troops had control over all southern cities by 1977, but roads in the south faced repeated UNITA attacks. Savimbi expressed his willingness for rapprochement with the MPLA and the formation of a unity, socialist government, but he insisted on Cuban withdrawal first. \\"The real enemy is Cuban colonialism,\\" Savimbi told reporters, warning, \\"The Cubans have taken over the country, but sooner or later they will suffer their own Vietnam in Angola.\\" Government and Cuban troops used flame throwers, bulldozers, and planes with napalm to destroy villages in a 1.6 mile wide area along the Angola-Namibia border. Only women and children passed through this area, \\"Castro Corridor,\\" because government troops had shot all males ten years of age or older to prevent them from joining the UNITA. The napalm killed cattle to feed government troops and to retaliate against UNITA sympathizers. Angolans fled from their homeland; 10,000 going south to Namibia and 16,000 east to Zambia, where they lived in refugee camps. Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington of the United Kingdom expressed similar concerns over British involvement in Rhodesia's Bush War during the Lancaster House negotiations in 1980. Shaba invasions Shaba Province, Zaire. 1,500 members of the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba, Zaire from eastern Angola on March 7, 1977. The FNLC wanted to overthrow Mobutu and the Angolan government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, did not try to stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji, and Mutshatsha. Zairian troops were defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance on April 2. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This troop force worked in conjunction with the Zairian army and the FNLA of Angola with air cover from Egyptian pilots flying French Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with a number of refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April. Mobutu accused the Angolan government, as well as the Cuban and Soviet governments, of complicity in the war. While Neto did support the FNLC, the Angolan government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's anti-Communists. The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15 million-worth of non- military aid. American timidity during the war prompted a shift in Zaire's foreign policy from the U.S. to France, which became Zaire's largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on July 22, 1977. John Stockwell, the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Angola, resigned after the invasion, explaining in an article for The Washington Post article Why I'm Leaving the CIA, published on April 10, 1977, that he had warned Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that continued American support for anti-government rebels in Angola could provoke a war with Zaire. He also said covert Soviet involvement in Angola came after, and in response to, U.S. involvement. The FNLC invaded Shaba again on May 11, 1978, capturing Kolwezi in two days. While the Carter Administration had accepted Cuba's insistence on its non-involvement in Shaba I, and therefore did not stand with Mobutu, the U.S. government now accused Castro of complicity. This time, when Mobutu appealed for foreign assistance, the U.S. government worked with the French and Belgian militaries to beat back the invasion, the first military cooperation between France and the United States since the Vietnam War.George. (2005). Page 136. The French Foreign Legion took back Kolwezi after a seven- day battle and airlifted 2,250 European citizens to Belgium, but not before the FNLC massacred 80 Europeans and 200 Africans. In one instance the FNLC killed 34 European civilians who had hidden in a room. The FNLC retreated to Zambia and back to Angola, vowing to return. The Zairian army then forcibly evicted civilians along Shaba's 65-mile long border with Angola and Mobutu ordered them to shoot on sight. U.S. mediated negotiations between the Angolan and Zairian governments led to a peace accord and an end to support for insurgencies in each other's respective countries. Zaire temporarily cutoff support to FLEC, the FNLA, and UNITA and Angola forbid further activity by the FNLC. Nitistas Neto's Interior Minister, Nito Alves, had successfully put down Daniel Chipenda's Eastern Revolt and the Active Revolt during Angola's War of Independence. Factionalism within the MPLA became a major challenge to Neto's power by late 1975 and he gave Alves the task of once again clamping down on dissension. Alves shut down the Cabral and Henda Committees while expanding his influence within the MPLA through his control of the nation's newspapers and state-run television. Alves visited the Soviet Union in October 1976. When he returned, Neto began taking steps to neutralize the threat he saw in the Nitistas, followers of Alves. Neto called a plenum meeting of the Central Committee of the MPLA. Neto formally designated the party Marxist- Leninist, abolished the Interior Ministry and DOM, the official branch of the MPLA used by the Nitistas, and established a Commission of Enquiry. Neto used the commission, officially created to examine and report factionalism, to target the Nitistas, and ordered the commission to issue a report of its findings in March 1977. Alves and Chief of Staff Jos√© Van-Dunem, his political ally, began planning a coup d'√©tat against dos Santos. Alves represented the MPLA at the 25th Soviet Communist Party Congress in February 1977 and may have then obtained support for the coup from the Soviet Union. Alves and Van-Dunem planned to arrest Neto on May 21 before he arrived at a meeting of the Central Committee and before the commission released its report. The MPLA changed the meeting's location shortly before its scheduled start, throwing the plotters' plans into disarray, but Alves attended the meeting and faced the commission anyway. The commission released its report, accusing him of factionalism. Alves fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola with the Soviet Union. After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to kick Alves and Van-Dunem out of power. Ten armored cars with the FAPLA's 8th Brigade broke into S√£o Paulo prison at 4 a.m. on May 27, killing the prison warden and freeing more than 150 supporters, including 11 who had been arrested only a few days before. The brigade took control of the radio station in Luanda at 7 a.m. and announced their coup, calling themselves the MPLA Action Committee. The brigade asked citizens to show their support for the coup by demonstrating in front of the presidential palace. The Nitistas captured Bula and Dangereaux, generals loyal to Neto, but Neto had moved his base of operations from the palace to the Ministry of Defence in fear of such an uprising. Cuban troops retook the palace at Neto's request and marched to the radio station. After an hour of fighting, the Cubans succeeded and proceeded to the barracks of the 8th brigade, recaptured by 1:30 p.m. While the Cuban force captured the palace and radio station, the Nitistas kidnapped seven leaders within the government and the military, shooting and killing six.George (2005). Pages 129-131. The government arrested tens of thousands of suspected Nitistas from May to November and tried them in secret courts overseen by Defense Minister Iko Carreira. Those who were found guilty, including Van-Dunem, Jacobo \\"Immortal Monster\\" Caetano, the head of the 8th Brigade, and political commissar Eduardo Evaristo, were then shot and buried in secret graves. The coup attempt had a lasting effect on Angola's foreign relations. Alves had opposed Neto's foreign policy of non-alignment, evolutionary socialism, and multiracialism, favoring stronger relations with the Soviet Union, which he wanted to grant military bases in Angola. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union supported Neto's ouster. Ra√∫l Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust in the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened. In December, the MPLA held is first party Congress and changed its name to the MPLA-PT. The Nitista coup took a toll on the MPLA's membership. In 1975, the MPLA boasted of 200,000 members. After the first party congress, that number decreased to 30,000. Rise of dos Santos On July 5, 1979, Neto issued a decree requiring all citizens to serve in the military for three years upon turning the age of eighteen. The government gave a report to the UN estimating $293 million in property damage from South African attacks between 1976 and 1979, asking for compensation on August 3, 1979. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, a Cabindan separatist rebel group, attacked a Cuban base near Tshiowa on August 11.Kalley (1999). Page 12. President Neto died from inoperable cancer in Moscow on September 10, 1979. L√∫cio Lara and Pascual Luvualo flew to Moscow and the MPLA declared 45 days of mourning. The government held his funeral at the Palace of the People on September 17. Many foreign dignitaries, including Organization of African Unity President William R. Tolbert, Jr. of Liberia, attended. The Central Committee of the MPLA unanimously voted in favor of Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos as President. He was sworn in on September 21. Under dos Santos' leadership, Angolan troops crossed the border into Namibia for the first time on October 31, going into Kavango. The next day, the governments of Angola, Zambia, and Zaire signed a non-aggression pact.

Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Presby began his announcing career at CFDC in Vancouver in 1925, and remained with the station at the point where its call letters changed to the current CKWX two years later. Afterwards he moved to the U.S., and between 1928 and 1935 he worked at KOMO in Seattle, Washington and KEX in Portland, Oregon. In 1935, Presby moved to San Francisco, California, where he became the staff announcer for NBC on the West Coast, and also did local announcing work for its Blue Network flagship station, KGO. He was the announcer for years on the program Bughouse Rhythm, which showcased leading jazz and swing musicians. After the network transferred its West Coast programming operations to their newer Radio City studios in Hollywood, Presby moved there in 1942 and remained in that base of operations for the rest of his career (which included another move to the network's Color City complex in Burbank, starting in the 1950s). As NBC did not own a radio station in Los Angeles, he also handled local announcing work for its affiliated station, KFI. After NBC launched its Los Angeles television station, KNBH (later KRCA-TV and now KNBC) in 1949, Presby became one of the station's first announcers. His most famous television credit was as announcer, and the voice of \\"Froggy the Gremlin,\\" on Smilin' Ed's Gang (he had also served in both capacities on the radio show) and its successor, Andy's Gang. Later in the 1950s, he hosted a local children's show as \\"Uncle Archie.\\" Presby remained chief West Coast announcer for NBC, and booth announcer for KNBC, until his retirement in 1972. After retiring, he settled in Vista, California, and then moved to Escondido, California in 1998. He died in Escondido on January 22, 2007 at age 99.

Following are series of events related to Saka Sirhind: * Eviction of Mata Gujri, Sahibzada Fateh Singh and Sahibzada Zorawar Singh from Anandpur Sahib siege. * Arrest of above three at Morinda and hearing at Sirhind. * innocent appearance at Sirhind Court. * Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan defended young Sahibzadas. * Declaration of Innocence of Sahibzadas, by Qazis and other officials. * Provocative arguments by Diwan Sucha Nand to support prosecution. * Found guilty of keeping ideology rebellious to Mughal Government and religions. * Punishment - Bricked alive * Aftermath What happened there Hill rajas and Mughal forces had laid seize to Anandgarh Fort, Anandpur Sahib for about 8 months, in 1704. The Mughals and Hilly Rajas wanted Guru Gobind Singh to leave the fort they swore on Quran and Bhagwat Gita/Gauo Mata to give a safe passage to Guru. The Guru decided to leave the fort on request of panj piaras. Guru Sahib, four Sahibzadas, Mata Gujri, Guru's Mahil (wives), five Panj Piaras and a few hundred Sikhs left Anandpur Sahib on the chilly night of 20 December 1704 towards Ropar. In the intervening night of 20‚Äì21 December, the enemy breached the vows and attacked Guru's entourage at a site on Sarsa rivulet some 25 km from Anandpur Sahib. Guru's family separated. This spot is now known as Parwar Vichhora. Mata Gujri with two younger grandsons, accompanied Guru family cook, Gangoo, a Kashmiri pandit, to his village, Saheri near Morinda. Guru's Mahil left with Bhai Mani Singh, towards Delhi. Guru Gobind Singh with two elder Sahibzadas, 5 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs proceeded towards Chamkaur and reached there, in the afternoon of 21 December. Both are in Ropar Distt.(Pb.). The famous Chamkaur battle, took place on 22 and 23 December 1704, where two elder Sahibzadas, 3 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs laid down their lives. Mata Gujri and the two younger Sahibzadas were arrested by Morinda Mughals sent by Wazir Khan at Saheri village. From there, they were handed over to Suba Sirhind. They were imprisoned, in the Thanda Burj (Cold Tower). A farcical Trial began, in the Kacheri, (Court) of Suba Sirhind. It lasted for three days. On 27 December 1704, a heinous and cold-blooded crime was committed in the Sarzameen of Sirhind. Guru Gobind Singh's two younger sons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh aged 7 and 9 years were bricked alive and later killed in the presence of the Assembly of Shaitans, presided over by Suba Sirhind, Wazir Khan. Two younger Sahibzadas and Mata Gujri were cremated by a rich Hindu merchant Diwan Todar Mal who covered the cremation grounds in gold coins as their final rites couldn't be done on mughal ground (land), this place is now known as Joyti Saroop Gurudwara.

Early life Gordon Gutteridge was born in Launceston, Tasmania. He was the son of a medical doctor, and one of five children. His brother Hal was an engineer and later became mayor of the City of Westminster in London. Gordon attended Melbourne Grammar School and later studied engineering at Melbourne University. War service Gutteridge was on holiday in the US at the declaration of World War I. He immediately went to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and enlisted in the Canadian army the day after war was declared. During World War 1, Gutteridge served at the battles of Ypres and the Somme. He was seriously wounded and taken prisoner. He made two unsuccessful escape attempts. Career At the end of the war he returned to Canada for demobilisation, then back to Melbourne to finish his engineering studies. He won a Rockefeller scholarship and completed his master's degree at Harvard University. Gutteridge was later appointed director of the Commonwealth Division of Public Health Engineering. In 1928 he resigned from that position and commenced private practice in Melbourne. He specialised in water and sewerage schemes, especially in rural Victoria and Tasmania, but also designed other facilities such as abattoirs and saleyards. In 1929, Gordon Gutteridge was elected a member of the Kew City Council, and was mayor of Kew in 1933‚Äì34. The practice of Gordon Gutteridge merged with that of Gerald Haskins and Geoffrey Davey to form GHD in 1939. After the outbreak of World War 2, Gutteridge and his firm became involved in the design and construction of military camps and training schools. He travelled widely to investigate the state of the art in these facilities in the UK, the US and Canada. Gutteridge had always suffered poor health and the effects of his World War 1 injuries never left him. He collapsed at his desk in February 1942 and did not recover.

Some writers who have asserted this trend can lead to exploitative and unjustified plot devices. Common tropes of lesbians in the media include butch or femme lesbians and lesbian parents. The word Butch lesbian comes from the idea of a lesbian expressing themselves as masculine by dressing masculine, behaving masculinely, or liking things that are deemed masculine, while the word femme lesbian comes from the idea of a lesbian expressing themselves as feminine by dressing feminine, behaving femininely, or liking things that are deemed feminine. In the media, lesbian marriage and parenting are depicted in shows such as the live action television show The Fosters and the animated series Steven Universe. Literature During the twentieth century, lesbians such as Gertrude Stein and Barbara Hammer were noted in the U.S. avant-garde art movements, along with figures such as Leontine Sagan in German pre-war cinema. Since the 1890s the underground classic The Songs of Bilitis has been influential on lesbian culture. This book provided a name for the first campaigning and cultural organization in the United States, the Daughters of Bilitis. Joseph Sheridan le Fanu's 1872 novella Carmilla is often cited as a root of the lesbian vampire trope about the predatory love of a vampire (the title character) for a young woman (the narrator) which was picked up in 20th- century exploitation films. The novella has since been adapted into a webseries, as well as a film based on the series. During the 1950s and 1960s, lesbian pulp fiction was published in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, often under \\"coded\\" titles such as Odd Girl Out, The Evil Friendship by Vin Packer and The Beebo Brinker Chronicles by Ann Bannon. British school stories also provided a haven for \\"coded\\" and sometimes outright lesbian fiction. During the 1970s the second wave of feminist-era lesbian novels became more politically oriented. Works often carried the explicit ideological messages of separatist feminism and the trend carried over to other lesbian arts. Rita Mae Brown's debut novel Rubyfruit Jungle was a milestone of this period; Patience and Sarah, by Isabel Miller, became a cult favorite. By the early 1990s, lesbian culture was being influenced by a younger generation who had not taken part in the \\"Feminist Sex Wars\\" and this strongly informed post-feminist queer theory along with the new queer culture. In 1972, the Berkeley, California lesbian journal Libera published a paper entitled \\"Heterosexuality in Women: its Causes and Cure\\". Written in deadpan, academic prose, closely paralleling previous psychiatry-journal articles on homosexuality among women, this paper inverted prevailing assumptions about what is normal and deviant or pathological. The paper was widely read by lesbian feminists. The journal is no longer published, and the article is nearly impossible to find: a Google search on the title typically yields Albert Ellis's book Homosexuality: its Causes and Cure, which was published before 1972, and before the American Psychiatric Association decided that homosexuality was no longer a mental disorder. Sappho was an ancient Greek poet who, over time, has become well known for her poetry fragments that frequently dealt with love between women. Mary Oliver, a naturalist poet, was a known lesbian, but did not discuss her sexual orientation in her poems. Andrea Gibson, who gained fame in 2006 for their performances in multiple poetry slams, is a queer activist poet, who is open about their sexual identity and writes often about their challenges and experiences as a queer person in their poems. Art Le Sommeil (Sleep) by Gustave Courbet (1866) In Art History, paintings showing two or more females together seldom displayed much in the way of potential sexual activity between them. When it came to nudity, most women subjects were depicted as dancers or bathers, usually stated as goddesses. One well known painting from the 19th century is Gustave Courbet's Sleep which openly depicts two women asleep after love-making (indicated by the broken pearl necklace); and Dominique Ingres' Turkish Bath in which, in the foreground, one woman can be seen with an arm around another and pinching her breast. Both these paintings ended up in the collection of erotica collector and diplomat Khalil Bey,The Art of the Nude by Deirdre Robson, published by Siena but are now exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of ArtSleep at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre,Turkish Bath at the Louvre respectively. Another work from the 19th century, Lysistrata haranguing the Athenian women (1896), by Aubrey Beardsley depicts a group of naked women, with one of them about to manually stimulate another. More famous is, Damned Women (Femmes damn√©es) (c. 1885), by Auguste Rodin, which is a sculpture of two women in movement on top of one another.

Mihanovich later formed a music duo with Celeste Carballo, who was also her partner. Although they never took an explicitly activist stance, they played a fundamental role in making lesbianism visible in South American popular culture. The music video for The Head and The Heart's Another Story portrays a lesbian couple. The music video for Bjork's \\"All is Full of Love\\" depicts two lesbian robots kissing. Other music videos: * dodie's \\"Sick of Losing Soulmates\\" * Halsey's \\"Ghost\\" * Hayley Kiyoko's \\"Cliffs Edge\\" * Hayley Kiyoko's \\"Girls Like Girls\\" Opera and theater Lesbian characters rarely appear in opera; Countess Geschwitz in Alban Berg's Lulu is one exception, but Charles Gounod's Sapho portrays the poet as straight. Patience and Sarah, based on the Isabel Miller novel, has been described as the first lesbian opera. In theater, there are quite a few plays and musicals that have lesbian characters or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical that has received a lot of recognition in the past few years is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay role models, and the awkwardness and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands out because it normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms. Cinema The first lesbian-themed feature film was M√§dchen in Uniform (1931), based on a novel by Christa Winsloe and directed by Leontine Sagan, tracing the story of a schoolgirl called Manuela von Meinhardis and her passionate love for a teacher, Fr√§ulein von Bernburg. It was written and mostly directed by women. The impact of the film in Germany's lesbian clubs was overshadowed, however, by the cult following for The Blue Angel (1930). Until the early 1990s, any notion of lesbian love in a film almost always required audiences to infer the relationships. The German silent film Pandora's Box (1929) is the first film to have a lesbian subplot, where a Countess (portrayed by Alice Roberts) is deeply infatuated with the protagonist Lulu (Louise Brooks). The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was very subtle in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers. Playwright Lillian Hellman's first play, The Children's Hour (1934) was produced on Broadway. Set in a private girls' boarding school, the headmistress and a teacher are the targets of a malicious whispering campaign of insinuation by a disgruntled schoolgirl. They soon face public accusations of having a lesbian relationship.Hellman, Lillian  Introduction: Feminism in Literature The play was nominated for a Pulitzer prize, banned in Boston, London, and ChicagoThe Children's Hour at About.com and had a record-breaking run of 691 consecutive performances in New York City.Playersring.org, Children's Hour A 1961 screen adaptation starred Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. The play's deep and pervasively dark themes and lesbian undertones have been widely noted.http://gayleft1970s.org/issues/gay.left_issue.05.pdf Mainstream films with openly lesbian content, sympathetic lesbian characters and lesbian leads began appearing during the 1990s. By 2000 some films portrayed characters exploring issues beyond their sexual orientation, reflecting a wider sense that lesbianism has to do with more than sexual desire. Speaking at the Bombay Academy of Moving Images, Nisha Ganatra revealed that Bend It Like Beckham was originally intended to have a more overt lesbian theme by Gurinder Chadha..Bend It Like Beckham - Lesbian Film ReviewAnanova - Bend it like Beckham was nearly a lesbian love story Notably, Gurinder Chadha previously directed the film What's Cooking, which featured Julianna Margulies and Kyra Sedgwick as a lesbian couple. Chadha is claimed to have softened the lesbian angle, to a case of \\"crossed wires\\" and jokes like \\"Lesbian? Her birthday's in March. I thought she was a Pisces,\\" to make the film more marketable - something which has not gone down well with all gay reviewers.Bend It Like Beckham However, Jess' male friend Tony was retained as a sympathetic gay character. Bend it like Beckham also won an award for \\"Outstanding Film\\" from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against DefamationGLAAD: Antonio Banderas, John Waters, \\"Bend it Like Beckham,\\" \\"Angels in America,\\" Honored at 15th Annual GLAAD Media Awards Presented by Absolut Vodka in Los Angeles In 1985, the film \\"Desert Hearts\\" was released, which was based on a novel by Jane Rule. This movie shows one of the first positive portrayals of lesbians in wide-screen films. Although, when the main character Vivian first comes to town she knows of being queer. In fact, she is there to stay because she is currently seeking a divorce with her husband. Upon arriving, she discovers Cay, who is known to the locals as a 'bad boy' type, save for the fact that she is a woman. From there Vivian and Cay establish a fairly unproblematic relationship together, though, in the end, Vivian must return home. Notable mainstream theatrical releases include Bound (1996), Chasing Amy (1997), Wild Things (1998), Kissing Jessica Stein (2001), Lost and Delirious (2001), Mulholland Drive, Monster (2003), D.E.B.S (2004), Rent (2005, based on the Jonathan Larson musical), My Summer of Love (2004), Loving Annabelle (2006) and Imagine Me & You (2005). There have also been many non-English language lesbian films, such as Fire (India, 1996), Show Me Love (Sweden, 1998), Aim√©e & Jaguar (Germany, 1999), Blue (Japan, 2001), The Mars Canon (Japan, 2002), Blue Gate Crossing (Taiwan, 2004), Butterfly (Hong Kong, 2004), Love My Life (Japan, 2006) and Les filles du botaniste (France/Canada, 2006). In 2013, Blue Is the Warmest Colour, a French drama film revolving around a romance between two women, was released. It won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and numerous critics deemed the film to be the best of 2013. The film was noted for its explicit sex scenes, with Variety critic Justin Chang writing in his review of the film that it is marked by the most explosively graphic lesbian sex scenes in recent memory\\". In 2014, Pride came to the big screen as a film that followed the true story of a British LGBT group as they tried to raise money to help the efforts of the British miner's strike in 1984: the group's campaign would become known as Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. The running joke within the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners group is that the character Steph(Faye Marsay) is the one that makes up the \\"L\\" of LGSM, meaning that she is the only lesbian represented in the group - that is until the group comes across a lesbian couple ( Stella (Karina Fernandez) and Zoe (Jessie Cave)) along their journey of supporting the miners and their families. Television and radio  Lesbian characters have made very rare appearances in scripted radio programs, almost always as killers or murder victims. The first lesbian on American radio was in an episode of the imported British crime anthology series The Black Museum entitled \\"The Brass Button\\". The character, Jeanette Morgan, was the episode's murder victim. She was described as \\"not interested in men\\" and \\"living that strange and unnatural kind of way\\". Jeanette was murdered by a soldier who, having heard gossip about her, makes sexual advances. When she rejects his advances towards her, he strangles her to death.Capsuto, p. 20 Early American television largely ignored lesbian women. Homosexuality was not discussed on television until the mid-1950s, and when it was discussed ‚Äî usually on local talk shows ‚Äî it was almost uniformly male homosexuality under discussion. It was not until 1962, when an episode of Confidential File covered the 1962 convention of the Daughters of Bilitis, that a national broadcast specifically covered lesbianism.Capsuto, p. 43 Lesbians were explicitly excluded from the proposal for the country's first documentary broadcast on homosexuality, 1961's The Rejected, and from the first network documentary on homosexuality, \\"The Homosexuals\\", a 1967 instalment of CBS Reports. On scripted television, the earliest lesbian characters were \\"coded\\", like the villainous Miss Brant on The Asphalt Jungle (1961), a repressed lesbian who shoots girls on lovers' lane for making themselves available to boys,Tropiano, p. 57 or neurotics like Hallie Lambert from a 1963 episode of The Eleventh Hour. After years during which the only portrayals of lesbians on television were negative, stereotypical, or both, NBC aired \\"Flowers of Evil\\" a 1974 episode of the series Police Woman. In it a trio of lesbians (described by Lesbian Tide magazine as \\"The Butch, The Bitch and The Femme\\"Capsuto, p. 110) were robbing and murdering the elderly residents of the nursing home they ran. Lesbian activists operating under the name Lesbian Feminist Liberation staged a zap at NBC's New York City headquarters. Ten women entered the building and occupied it overnight. Around 75 women demonstrated in front of the building. The following morning protesters unfurled a twenty foot long banner from the balcony of vice president Herminio Traviesas's office reading \\"LESBIANS PROTEST NBC\\". They and street-level picketers chanted slogans like \\"NBC works against lesbians\\" and \\"Lesbians are sitting in\\".Capsuto, pp. 112‚Äî13 The 1980s television series L.A. Law included a lesbian relationship which stirred much more controversy than lesbian TV characters would a decade later. The 1989 BBC mini series Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit was based on lesbian writer Jeanette Winterson's novel of the same title. Russian pop-duo t.A.T.u were popular in Europe during the early 2000s, gaining wide attention and TV airplay for their pop videos because they were marketed as lesbians even though they were not. Many science fiction series have featured lesbian characters. An episode of Babylon 5 featured an implied lesbian relationship between characters Talia Winters and Commander Susan Ivanova. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine featured a few episodes (\\"Rejoined\\") with elements of lesbianism that implied, but never stated, that in Star Trek's 24th century such relationships are accepted, even though the show never actually depicted one. Torchwood's first series involved brief lesbian encounters for both Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori), but in each instance alien intervention was responsible. AfterEllen reviewer Karman Klegroe criticises Torchwood's record on this score concluding that: \\"sexual tension between the male characters, particularly Captain Jack and Ianto, is standard fare, whereas the women have very few sexual interactions that aren't quickly explained away by alien circumstances\\".Bisexual Women Are Alien to \\"Torchwood\\" In the fourth series, recurring character Charlotte Willis (Marina Benedict) was eventually revealed to be a lesbian. Actress and comedian Ellen DeGeneres came out publicly as a lesbian in 1997 and her character on the sitcom Ellen did likewise soon after during its fourth season. This was the first American sitcom with a lesbian lead character. The coming-out episode won an Emmy Award, but the series was cancelled after one more season. She then continued to be the star of two more television programs. The Ellen Show debuted on CBS in September 2001, and was cancelled before the end of the first season. In September 2003, NBC premiered The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a daytime talk show that has so far been successful. In all of these accounts, DeGeneres has performed a lesbian persona as a consumed character that corresponds to her true identity. She is among the first mass mediated lesbians in history. Because she is a TV personality, her position as an accessible, likeable lesbian, is unique to most portrayal of gay and lesbian actors or characters in media. Ellen DeGeneres is known for playful personality separate from her lesbian identity, where some of her only \\"lesbian identifiers\\" are seen to be her clothing style and her mention of her relationship with Portia de Rossi. Ellen was recently granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, for her courage and her help pushing the country in a direction of justice by President Barack Obama. The HBO series Deadwood featured a lesbian madam running a local brothel. In 2000, the ABC Daytime drama series All My Children character Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) was revealed to be a lesbian. Though the storyline received significant praise from critics and viewers and spun two popular romances (Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone, Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery), it was also met with criticism for its almost perpetual trauma and Bianca's lack of a successful long-running romance with another woman. The character was later given a wife to combat this, in the pairing of Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery, which became the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime television, but this was also met with criticism; critics and fans reasoned that the storyline was underdeveloped and essentially failed in popularity. Showtime's The L Word is a drama focusing on the relationships of a group of women. The majority of the characters are bisexual and lesbian women, including: Dana Fairbanks, Alice Pieszecki, Bette Porter, Shane McCutcheon, Tina Kennard, Jodi Lerner, Helena Peabody, Phyllis Kroll, and Jenny Schecter. The success of The L Word led to a reality television spinoff, The Real L Word, which premiered in 2010. In 2005, an episode of The Simpsons (\\"There's Something About Marrying\\") depicted Marge's sister Patty coming out as a lesbian. Also that year on Law & Order the final appearance of assistant district attorney Serena Southerlyn included the revelation she was a lesbian, although some viewers claimed there had been hints of this in previous episodes. Jenji Kohan's, Netflix Original, Orange is the New Black is an American comedy-drama that was created in 2013. The fourth season was released on June 17, 2016, and the show has featured several lesbian and bisexual relationships so far, making them a key part of the plot line. The majority of the characters on the show identify as women, because the show is based in a women's federal prison, and a significant amount of those women identify with a sexuality other than heterosexuality, including: Piper Chapman, Alex Vause, Nicky Nichols, Big Boo, Suzanne \\"Crazy Eyes\\" Warren and Poussey Washington. Orange is the New Black helps to expand lesbianism in mainstream media and confronts many lesbian stereotypes throughout the show. This show paints a greater picture of lesbians in many different forms and personalities. In February 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth, sixth, and seventh season. The 2013 ABC Family TV series, The Fosters, depicts a lesbian couple raising multiple children, some biological, some adopted, and some fostered, in a San Diego suburb. The show explores many queer themes and issues as it follows Stef and Lena's relationship through getting legally married, adopting children, considering having children through alternative methods, and raising teenagers, one of which comes out as gay. In 2016, the supernatural series Wynonna Earp premiered, and quickly introduced Nicole Haught as a love interest for Waverly Earp. The show has been praised for its refusal to allow its lesbian & bisexual characters to fall into common tropes, and is generally regarded as a source of overwhelmingly positive representation for that community.

In most instances, the potential of a relationship between the women does not survive past the episode and the lesbian character rarely appears again. The first of these was an episode titled \\"He's a Crowd\\", from the 1991 legal drama L.A. Law. =\\"Bury Your Gays\\"= In March 2016, the CW series \\"The 100\\" caused controversy with its decision to kill off Lexa, a supporting character who had been involved in a fledgling relationship with Clarke Griffin, one of the series' protagonists. Lesbian & bisexual fans of The 100, as well as numerous other shows, united in expressing their anger and frustration with the show's creator, Jason Rothenberg, causing him to issue a formal apology for Lexa's death. Lexa's death caused immediate outrage from the show's large lesbian fanbase, which saw her death as contributing to a wider pattern commonly known as the \\"Bury Your Gays\\" trope. Fans united in calling for showrunners to acknowledge and consider the overwhelming history of dead lesbian and bisexual characters when mapping out their own characters' fates. Advertising The Millennium has brought forth new types of modern advertising. There has been a shift towards highly sexualized and sexually explicit advertising materials in print, fashion, art, music, television, and movies. It would seem that most advertisements featuring two or more women have a negative context to them. They almost possess a soft-core pornographic theme to them. Gill (2008) presents a shift in the representation of women by breaking advertising segments down into several different identities. Of them is the \\"hot lesbian\\".Gill, R. (2008). Empowerment/Sexism: Figuring Female Sexual Agency in Contemporary Advertising. Feminism & Psychology, 18 (1), 35-60. The \\"hot lesbian\\" identity portrays the fantasy of two or more lesbian women, whose physical appearance is considered \\"hot\\" according to conventional patriarchal beauty standards, engaging in \\"suggestive\\" lesbian behaviour, or explicit sexual activity. There are many notable examples of ads portraying hot lesbians in them (Canada Oil Sands,Gerson, J. (2016). ‚Äò‚ÄòHot lesbians‚Äô ad bashing Saudi oil backfires on Canadian oilsands advocates.‚Äô National Post Versace clothing, Skyy Blue Vodka, Pornstar clothing, Nikon camera, American Apparel clothing, Calvin Klein products, Miller Light beer, etc.). Sender (1999), Ingebretsen (1999), and Bhat et al. (1998) point out that there are advertisers who do use gay and lesbian models to promote directly to the gay and lesbian community, but wish to remain innocuous to heterosexuals.Sender, K. (1999). Selling Sexual Subjectives: Audiences Respond To Gay Window Advertising. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 16 (2), 172-196.Ingebretsen, E. (1999). Gone Shopping: The Commercialization of Same- Sex Desire. International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies 4 (2), 125-148.Bhat, S., Leigh T., & Wardlow, D. (1998). The Effect of Consumer Prejudices on Ad Processing: Heterosexual Consumers' Responses to Homosexual Imagery in Ads. The Journal of Advertising, 27 (4), 9-28. Gay and lesbian advertisers do not actively pursue national recognition (which is essentially to a much larger demographic of heterosexuals) mostly due to fear and criticism. However, some very notable corporations, such as \\"Sony, Toyota, Microsoft, Levi's, Banana Republic, American Express, Miller, and Absolut now commonly use gay media. Some firms (IKEA, Calvin Klein, Benetton) have gone further into using homosexual imagery in advertising to [appeal to] more general audiences\\" (Bhat et al., 1998, p. 10). The gay and lesbian advertisers should be creating ads that appeal to all sexual preferences, even though this may be easier said than done. The gay and lesbian advertisers must go beyond their select audience for ad campaigns targeting gays and lesbians to look at the inclusion, instead of exclusion, of heterosexuals. Sender (1999) suggests that on the heterosexual side, \\"images which are arousing for lesbians, but which may not have originally been intended for [lesbians], may actually offer greater pleasure than those which are implicitly coded to suggest a lesbian reading\\" (p. 191). If such is the case for \\"hot lesbian\\" advertisements, then there is nothing to say that actual lesbian advertisements might find heterosexuals left wanting something as well from them. Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take exception to the role of \\"hot lesbian\\" in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity.Diamond, L. (2005). 'I'm Straight, but I Kissed a Girl': The Trouble with American Media Representations of Female‚ÄìFemale Sexuality. Feminism & Psychology 15 (1), 104‚Äì110.Wirthlin, K. (2009). Fad Lesbianism: Exposing Media's Posing. Journal of Lesbian Studies, 13 (1), 107‚Äì114. As Diamond (2005) states, \\"media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality\\" (p. 105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of what it is to be lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, \\"In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of \\"fad\\" lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities\\" (p. 113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear \\"authentic\\". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the \\"hot lesbian\\", and ensure they do not fall into the \\"heteronormative appropriation\\" of advertising's effects. Jhally (1989) and Jackson (2009) on the other hand do not see the portrayal of women being objectified as a commodity or \\"hot lesbians\\" necessarily wrong.Jhally, S. (1989). Advertising, Gender and Sex: What's Wrong with a Little Objectification? Working Papers and Proceedings of the Center for Psychosocial Studies, 1-12.Jackson, S. (2009). 'Hot Lesbians': Young People's Talk About Representations of Lesbianism. Sexualities, 12 (2), 199‚Äì224. Not in the literal sense, but advertisements are reflective of what our views are. In turn, this may open up women who were unsure of their sexuality (even though most lesbians would state that they were lesbians from birth) and let them experiment without the boundaries. As an example, older advertisements from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s are made up of ideologies of what men wanted, and what they believed to be their ultimate dreams. Those ads supposedly portrayed what women dreamed about, when really this was only because they were being told what to dream about by men. Women were just heterosexual in everyone's eyes, as being lesbian was a major taboo during that time. Lesbians were always in the background, just not front-and-centre. Nowadays, you have postfeminist women who want to be free from labels, experiment sexually, and use fashionable lesbianism in advertising as it does not affect their heterosexual ways. It has become a \\"fad\\", or \\"cool\\" to be bi-curious, or tri- sexual. This, in turn, may open up other avenues for women who were once shunned upon. Sexuality and gender have been elevated to a privileged position in our cultural discourse, and thus powerful media campaigns only further this cause. It is natural that the \\"hot lesbian\\" would be at the forefront because sex always sells, and the \\"hot lesbian\\" theme in advertising is what is taking place now. As such, people can view the advertisements as just advertisements, or it can pique their curiosity. Comics For much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. An example was in the 1938-39 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates: one of the main villains, Sanjak, has been interpreted by some as a lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend, though this is not openly stated. Further, some writers and others (notably Chris Rock on Saturday Night Live) have commented that the Peanuts character Peppermint Patty is a lesbian (and inferred a relationship with her close friend Marcie, although such an inference was never supported by the comic strip's content). (Peppermint Patties has been used as a pejorative slang word for lesbians.) Until 1989 the Comics Code Authority, which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through newsstands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Overt lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the Authority's seal of approval. The first comic with an openly lesbian character was \\"Sandy Comes Out\\" by Trina Robbins, published in the anthology Wimmen's Comix #1 in 1972. Gay Comix (1980) included stories by and about lesbians and by 1985 the influential alternative title Love and Rockets had revealed a relationship between two major characters, Maggie and Hopey.Jaime Hernandez, \\"Locas\\", reprinted in Meanwhile, mainstream publishers were more reticent. A relationship between the female Marvel Comics characters Mystique and Destiny was only implied at first, then cryptically confirmed in 1990 through the use of the archaic word leman, meaning a lover or sweetheart.Uncanny X-Men #265 (Early August, 1990). Only in 2001 was Destiny referred to in plain language as Mystique's lover.X-Men Forever #5 (May, 2001). Previously, WildStorm's Image Comics had featured Sarah Rainmaker of Gen¬π¬≥ as a character with an interest in other women, and had openly depicted homosexual relationships between the members of the Authority, such as Jenny Sparks and Swift.Jenny Sparks: The Secret History of the Authority, mini-series published in 2000 In 2006 DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman even while openly lesbian characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in DC Comics. In 2006, the graphic memoir Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic by Alison Bechdel, was lauded by many media as among the best books of the year. Bechdel is the author of Dykes to Watch Out For, one of the best- known and longest-running LGBT comic strips. Manga and anime In Japanese manga and anime, lesbian content is called Girls Love (in Japan) or yuri. In the west, a distinction is occasionally made between yuri (more explicitly sex-based) and sh≈çjo-ai (more romance-based), a term created in the west by analogy with sh≈çnen-ai. Sh≈çjo-ai is not used in that sense in Japan, where (as a manga term) it mainly denotes lolicon. The third season of Sailor Moon introduced Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, a lesbian couple. However, the season was heavily censored when dubbed and shown on TV in North America. Many of the scenes which would suggest this particular relationship were cut away and the two characters were depicted as cousins (this led to further controversy as many fans noticed the editing). In many of the manga artist group Clamp's series such as Miyuki-chan in Wonderland or Cardcaptor Sakura, some characters are clearly lesbians. In Miyuki-chan in wonderland, for example, Miyuki is constantly trying to escape the attention of scantily clad female admirers; while Tomoyo in CCS is famous for her ostensibly innocent but rather suspect obsession with playing \\"dress-up\\" with the lead character, Sakura. Video games SaGa Frontier (a PlayStation title produced by Square) has a lesbian character named Asellus. Another character named Gina is a young girl who tailors Asellus' outfits, often discusses her deep attraction to Asellus and becomes her bride in one of the game's many endings. However, much related dialogue and some content has been edited out of the English-language version. The PlayStation title Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix (a prequel to Fear Effect) reveals that Hana Tsu Vachel, a main character in both games, had a sexual relationship with a female character named Rain Qin. Strawberry Panic! is a mild Japanese lesbian game for PlayStation 2 featuring romance amongst a group of female students living in a common all-girls' boarding house atop Astrea Hill. Tristia of the Deep-Blue Sea, Neosphere of the Deep-Blue Sky, Akai Ito and Ayakashi Ninden Kunoichiban, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly, Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl are widely known in Japan. Gone Home is an interactive story game made by Fullbright that follows the story of a girl, Sam, who falls in love with her female best friend.

He successfully passed it off as a work by Paul Gauguin, selling it at Sotheby's for ¬£20,700 in 1994. Three years later, in 1997, it was bought by the Art Institute of Chicago for an undisclosed sum, thought to be about $125,000.

For a decade the sculpture remained on display, and was part of a major joint exhibition on Gauguin with the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. However, following revelations about its existence at Greenhalgh's trial in 2007, The Faun was tracked down by The Art Newspaper to Chicago and exposed as a fake. In October 2007, the Art Institute removed the statue from display, and announced that it was seeking compensation from Sotheby's. What the ultimate fate of The Faun is to be has not yet been revealed.Vogel, Carol (December 13, 2007). \\"Work Believed a Gauguin Turns Out to Be a Forgery\\". New York Times. Accessed December 14, 2007. Background to the forgery In the early to mid 1990s, Shaun Greenhalgh was predominately involved with paintings. He sold a Samuel Peploe, but in particular he was successful with his Thomas Morans. He sold one to Bolton Museum in 1994 and at New York City auctions in 1995 he sold seven, and is reckoned to have produced as many as 40.\\"Amarna Princess statement\\" . Bolton Museum.

Yet at the same time, he must have been researching the possibility of at least one Gauguin work. As well as The Faun, he is known to have also forged a Gauguin vase, possibly at a later date.Lovell, Jeremy (November 17, 2007). \\"Octogenerian British art forger sentenced\\". New Zealand Herald. Accessed December 26, 2007. Gauguin is significantly less well regarded for his sculptures than for his paintings. It is likely that Greenhalgh was aware of that, and saw it as an opportunity. Forgers typically focus on the lower priced artworks of major artists, for though they offer fewer returns, they are subject to much less scrutiny.Thompson, Clive. \\"How to make a fake\\", New York Magazine, May 24, 2004. Accessed December 26, 2007. Moreover, Gauguin himself had left just enough of a record to indicate he may have been interested in producing such an item, a drawing of a faun sculpture in a sketchbook from 1887. This was backed up by suggestive historical events: at a Gauguin exhibition in 1906, a \\"faun ceramic\\" was displayed, and another listing for a work entitled \\"Faun\\" was found for a 1917 Nunes and Fiquet gallery exhibition. Scholars in the 1960s dutifully recorded these possibilities. Even in 2007, experts were still uncertain about how many ceramic sculptures Gauguin had actually produced. Estimates range from 55 to 80. Of these, between 30 and 60 are thought to be lost or destroyed.Storch, Charles; Artner, Alan (December 21, 2007). \\"Taken in by a complete fake\\". Los Angeles Times.

At 47 cm, it was modest, yet typically sized for a Gauguin. The gallery caption of The Faun read \\"unglazed stoneware with touches of gold gilding\\".Art Institute of Chicago.

Use of the gold gilding was deft; it was similar to investments Greenhalgh had made on previous forgeries. In 1991, for example, he is thought to have melted down genuine Roman silver coins when reconstructing the Risley Park Lanx.Chadwick, Edward (November 17, 2007). \\"Antiques rogues show: update 3\\". The Bolton News. Accessed November 30, 2007. Any anomalies in The Faun that were detected were explained away. Sold twice over In 1995, The Faun was sold at Sotheby's for ¬£20,700. The Greenhalghs, who worked together as a family, had constructed a provenance based around Olive Greenhalgh (Shaun's mother), using her maiden name \\"Roscoe\\". She claimed to be a descendant of Roderick O'Conor, a friend of Gauguin's purported to have bought the sculpture at the 1917 exhibition, and known to have bought at least one other. Legitimising their ownership through inheritance was a typical ploy of the Greenhalghs, as was forging documents to go with it.Kelly, James (November 16, 2007). \\"Fraudsters who resented the art market\\". BBC News. Accessed November 17, 2007. In this case, Olive produced a copy of the sale invoice. There were no concerns about authenticity. As well as being well received by Sotheby's itself, The Faun was authenticated by the Wildenstein Institute in Paris. Their catalogue raisonn√© had not yet been published when the sculpture was sold on 30 November, but the auction house had received a letter two weeks beforehand indicating The Faun's incorporation. The first buyers were experienced London art dealers Howie and Pillar. They lived with it for years and described it as \\"a wonderful object\\". When the curator for the Art Institute of Chicago, Douglas Druick, saw The Faun he was reportedly \\"intrigued\\" and \\"very keen to acquire it\\". Subsequently, the Art Institute carried out their own research into the authenticity of the item and purchased it in 1997, for what was thought to be about $125,000. However, to this day, the Art Institute has refused to reveal actual details of the price it paid. What is known is that the purchase was funded, at least in part, by the Major Acquisitions Centennial Endowment and is associated with the estate of Suzette Morton Davidson. At any rate, the Art Institute plans to seek compensation from Sotheby's.\\"Art Institute's statement regarding Paul Gauguin's The Faun\\". Art Institute of Chicago. Accessed December 24, 2007. The \\"good sculpture\\" Purchase of The Faun was proclaimed as a great success. Chief curator Douglas Druick declared it Gauguin's \\"first ceramic\\". In 2001, The Art Institute sculpture curator, Ian Wardropper, said it was one of the most important acquisitions in the last twenty years. The Faun was included in a publication of Chicago's \\"Notable Acquisitions\\". It was accepted by a specialist in Gauguin ceramics, Anne-Birgitte Fonsmark. The consensus of analysis was that the half-man half-goat fitted with Gauguin's known exploration of primitivism, and various attempts were made to provide a detailed interpretation of The Faun's sexuality in terms of Gauguin's relationships. Druick noted \\"the absence of the often flaunted sign of a faun‚Äôs virility, resulting in an aura of impotence\\". Even after it was exposed as a forgery, James Cuno, the director of the Art Institute, still described it as \\"good sculpture\\". The \\"Van Gogh and Gauguin\\" exhibition On September 21, 2001, The Faun became part of a major exhibition, \\"Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South\\". Organised as a joint venture between The Art Institute of Chicago and the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the event ran for four months in Chicago before shifting to Amsterdam. Funding was unprecedented, with support from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities, and a $1.5 million grant from the Ameritech Foundation.\\"Art Institute announces unprecedented support from Ameritech for Van Gogh-Gauguin exhibition\\". PR Newswire. March 11, 1999. Accessed September 3, 2012. The exhibition brought together works from \\"63 public and private collections around the world, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan and Russia\\".\\"Ameritech offers a unique canvas to bring works of van Gogh and Gauguin to Chicago's sidewalks\\".

Joseph Harriss wrote in the Smithsonian: Promoters described the exhibition as \\"extraordinary\\" and a \\"serious and very beautiful show.\\" Art critic Suzanne Hoefaerkamp felt viewers were \\"unified by their experience of great art.\\"Hoefaerkamp, Suzanne (January 16, 2002). \\"Studio of the South\\". The Christian Century 119(2). Of the 134 items on display, most were paintings, plus three Japanese prints by Hokusai, Hiroshige and Korin.\\"List of works in the exhibition\\". Art Institute of Chicago. September 22, 2007. Accessed December 24, 2007. The focus of the exhibition, and the critics, was very much on the interplay between the paintings. In fact, there were only seven sculptures, all by Gauguin. The others were Portrait Vase of Jeanne Schuffenecker, Cleopatra Pot, Leda and the Swan, Self-portrait Jug, Self-portrait Jar, and Female Nude with Flower (known as Lust). The slideshow for the exhibition was arranged chronologically, so that The Faun (slide 02) could be clearly seen as Gauguin's first ceramic. Equally self-evident is how well the forgery fitted in thematically. Exposure and reaction In 2007, Shaun Greenhalgh was convicted for money laundering, predominately over the Amarna Princess. However, during the trial, the variety and number of his other forgeries were widely noted. Scotland Yard admitted that many were likely to be still undetected.\\"The ¬£10m art collection that was forged by a family in their garden shed in Bolton\\". Times Online. November 17, 2007.

Picking up on references to the Gauguin faun, The Art Newspaper launched its own investigation and tracked The Faun down to the Art Institute in Chicago. The Art Institute was quick to emphasise, in a statement on its website, that the sculpture came with provenance from respected sources, and The Faun was \\"never a principal focus of the [Greenhalgh] investigation\\". Douglas Druick, the chief curator, described The Faun as \\"creative [and] well-researched\\". James Cuno, the director, said it was \\"a crafty concept\\". According to Ian Wardropper, then the sculpture curator, the provenance was \\"completely believable\\". Melaine Clore from Sotheby's described The Faun as a once-in-a-decade forgery. On the process of obtaining artworks, Cuno added: \\"We make thousands of decisions like this annually. Once in a lifetime something like this happens.\\"Blakely, Derrik (December 14, 2007). \\"Art Institute discovers Gauguin sculpture is fake (video)\\" . CBS2. December 14, 2007.

However, other commentators speculate that as much as half of the art market is made up of forgeries.Sharp, Rob (December 10, 2007). \\"The counterfeiters: Inside the world of art forgery\\". The Independent. Accessed September 3, 2012. In October 2007, The Faun was removed from Art Institute where it had been on permanent display as part of its post-Impressionist collection. It remained on the website as part of the \\"Studio of the South\\" exhibition slideshow until mid-December. Because Greenhalgh's trial finished before the sculpture was revealed as a forgery, it was not impounded by police, but the Art Institute was reportedly in discussion about compensation with Sotheby's and the private dealer.

He was born in the town of Molvizar, in Granada, Spain. Santa Mar√≠a of Iquique School massacre The bloodiest massacre in Chile‚Äôs history occurred on December 21, 1907. Workers in the nitrate mines, a leading industry owned largely by foreign (British and German) capital, struck on December 4 demanding humane working conditions and higher wages. By the 13th a general work stoppage in all the nitrate mines was announced. The miners were Bolivian, Argentine, Peruvian as well as Chileans. 18,000 workers, together with wives and children marched without food and water to the port of Iquique to seek support. On the 14th, the maritime workers joined them in the strike. President Pedro Montt appointed Colonel Roberto Silva Renard to handle the situation. Colonel Silva Renard, under confidential orders from the minister of the interior, Rafael Sotomayor ordered the miners to dissolve and return to work. When the miners refused, he ordered the Army to fire into the miner‚Äôs encampment at the schoolyard of the Domingo Santa Mar√≠a school. The official report was 140 deaths and 200 injured, but the real estimates range between 1,100 and 3,500 men, women and children killed. Colonel Silva Renard was promoted to Brigadier General as a reward for his defense of democracy, law and order. The assassin Among the dead at the Santa Mar√≠a massacre was Manuel Vaca, a Spanish immigrant worker. Antonio Ram√≥n was his half-brother, and the two were very close. At the time of the massacre, Ram√≥n was living in Argentina, but when news stopped arriving from his brother, he travelled to Iquique to find out what had happened. There is some evidence that he already had plans to revenge himself, as he bought a dagger and some strychnine. Revenge for the Santa Mar√≠a massacre was the reason Ram√≥n arrived in Chile from Argentina, using his own identity.Goicovic Donoso, Igor, Entre el dolor y la ira: La venganza de Antonio Ram√≥n Ram√≥n, Editorial Universidad de Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile, 2005, pp. 188 Ram√≥n finally decided to take action seven years later. He found General Silva Renard walking alone to his office, in Viel street in Santiago, on December 14, 1914, and stabbed him seven times on his back and head. The General started shouting ‚ÄúMurderer! Murderer!‚Äù and several passersby came to his help. Ram√≥n, in turn, stopped the attack and tried to run away, only to be captured by an off-duty prison guard named Perfecto Salazar Acevedo. When Ram√≥n saw himself surrounded and all escapes blocked, he drank the bottle of strychnine he was carrying, but vomited most of it and was unharmed. Once in custody, Ram√≥n vehemently denied other parties' involvement in the assassination, and the worker's held public campaigns to raise money for his defense. He was eventually sentenced to five years in prison. General Silva Renard survived the attack, but suffered permanent effects from the injuries: he lost all movement of half of his face, became blind, and was mostly an invalid until his death in 1920. Ram√≥n was released in 1919 and all track of him was lost after that time.

According to band's members the name means simply that none of them wear dreadlocks. Style Anti Dread play melodic punk rock music, similar in style to that originating from the 1970s. The band avoids incorporating any political views into their songs and cover few social or economical issues. The situation is caused by the fact, that most of the band's members are experienced musicians, who had played in several projects throughout their lives and see Anti Dread as the space they can play for pure entertainment. The band's musical inspirations can be observed through the bands they decided to cover on their albums. These include Cock Sparrer, The Dictators, Turbonegro, Ramones, Sex Pistols and Skrewdriver. History Anti Dread logo with a slogan similar to God save the Queen, with the words God replaced with \\"Jah\\" and queen with \\"punx.\\"The band formed in 2003 in Szczecin as a new project of Pawe≈Ç Czeka≈Ça, The Analogs bass guitar player. He decided to play the guitar. He was joined by B≈Ça≈ºej Halski (second guitar) and Pawe≈Ç Boguszewski (drums). After quite a long search for vocalist Anti Dread chose Piotr P√≥≈Çtorak, who at the time sang in The Hunkies. The last position to be filled was that of bass guitar player. This was taken by Kefir. In the end of 2003 the band's first record was released - 14 Seksistowskich Piosenek. As the title explains (14 Sexist Songs), the album contains fourteen songs, three of which are in fact covers. The record was released by Jimmy Jazz Records label. After a few concerts B≈Ça≈ºej decided to leave the band and move to Kielce and was replaced with Dydas, guitarist of another punk rock band from Szczecin - W≈Çochaty. Soon after another changes took place. Pawe≈Ç Boguszewski is replaced with Kanister and Kefir is replaced with Miros≈Çaw Lipniewski. Second album - Jeszcze Wiƒôcej Seksistowskich Piosenek (Even More Sexist Songs) was released in the beginning of 2005. Besides 15 new songs it contained a clip for Sobotnia Noc song and reggae remix of Radio Kingston by Piotr Banach of Indios Bravos. The album did not vary from the first one very much, but contained wider variety of styles. Musicians included rhythms of reggae, ska or Californian punk rock alongside classic 1977 punk style. After the second album had been released Dydas left the band and his position was taken over by Cl-Boy who also plays the guitar in Road Trip's Over band from Szczecin. In the end of 2006 Piotr P√≥≈Çtorak left Anti Dread. Andrzej from W≈õciek≈Çy Pies band became the new vocalist. In the autumn of 2006 the band recorded their third album Wszyscy Jeste≈õmy Lesbijkami (We Are All Lesbians). After recording had been finished Grzesiek took over drummer position from Kanister and Olaf replaces Cl-Boy. The third album was released in 2007. The title, according to the band's members expresses the mere fact that all of them love women, this being the only possible explanation. The front cover had been drawn by ≈Åukasz, vocalist of Bilety do Kontroli band. The record brought 13 new songs, including 3 covers. The general style of the album keeps up to band's stylistic.

A parian doll, like a china doll, has a body made from fabrics and a head created from untinted white porcelain. Unlike the china doll however, the parian doll's head is not dipped in glaze before firing and as such has a matte finish, similar to bisque dolls, giving it a markedly different appearance. The term parian refers to the appearance of the fine white parian marble of Paros, Greece. The UFDC (United Federation of Doll Clubs) accepted definition of these dolls is as follows: \\"Parian doll: doll made of fine white bisque (unglazed porcelain) without tinting. The features, hair and cheeks may be painted.\\"Krombholz,Mary Groham, German Parian Dolls, 2006, Reverie Publishing, pg. 7 Many collectors now are discarding the term parian in favor of untinted bisque versus tinted bisque. Parian dolls usually have molded blond hair. Brown and black haired parians are less common. Parians are often elaborately decorated with colored feathers, flowers, scarves, ribbons, combs, jewels, and luster ruffs (single, double, occasionally triple) about the bottom of the yoke. The hair was arranged in interesting and elaborate ways. The eyes were painted or glass. The glass-eyed dolls are sought after by collectors.Antiques Digest The lead company in manufacturing these untinted bisque parian dolls was Alt Beck & Gottschalck.Coleman, The Collector's Encyclopedia of Dolls Vol. 2, Crown Publishers, 1986, pgs. 20-31 Other manufacturers include Conta & Boehme, Dornheim Koch & Fischer, Kister, Hertel Schwab & Co., C.

It was first published in Courier in September 1899.Willa Cather's Collected Short Fiction, University of Nebraska Press; Rev Ed edition, 1 November 1970, page 393 Plot summary Mrs Johnston stops at Cheyenne, Wyoming train station to collect a ticket for her next train to San Francisco. She has come all the way from New York City to join her husband, a railroad official. However, the Station Agent claims he has already given her ticket to a Mrs Johnston, with confirmation by telegram from Mr Johnston, and that she might write her a note. The other woman's reply says that her name is actually Johnson (without a 't') and that Mr Johnston is coming to pick her up at Cheyenne so they can travel to San Francisco together. Infuriated, Sybil decides to take a train back to New York City; she thinks her husband has been cheating on her, and that this is the ultimate insult. However, she is met by her husband and he explains Sally is a friend whom she had met at a wedding sometime later. The couple make up and meet the other woman.

The book was assembled after a series of interviews Bragg had with current scientists about the world's greatest scientists such as Archimedes, Isaac Newton and Einstein. Bragg, who brands himself as a \\"non-scientist\\", conducted these interviews on BBC Radio 4 for other non-scientists. The book looks at the notion of being a \\"genius\\" and through discussions with 20th-century scientists explores the extent to which the great scientists of history were geniuses. The book's title is taken from Newton's 1675 quote: \\"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\\"  Inspiration  In the introduction to On Giants' Shoulders Bragg writes that the world of science was one of mystery and could not be entered nor understood by non-scientists such as himself. Thus he wrote this book, along with scientists, to open a door for other non- scientists to view the world of science as it has been for the past 2,500 years. By doing so, and by explaining the works of the greatest scientists in vernacular understandable by non-scientists, he aims to make the world of science less exclusive and mysterious.
