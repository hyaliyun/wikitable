She served with her sister Hope Gamwell during World War I and they then ran a farm in what is now Zambia. They both became pilots. They returned to the UK for World War Two and Marian commanded the FANYs after a row with the ATA. After the war they returned to Zambia before retiring to Jersey. Life Gamwell was born in West Norwood to Frederick Robison Gamwell and Marian Antonia Bankart in 1891. Her sister (Anne) Hope Gamwell was born in 1893. Her brother, Frederick Whittington Gamwell, was one of the pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1914. Her father had been a partner in a London business trading in Hong Kong, China and Japan until 1896. She and her sister's education was at Roedean School and after that they taught themselves mechanics by taking their mothers car to bits. In 1910 Marian tried to study architecture but she was rejected because she was a woman. She did work with animals before going to Saskatchewan where she worked in a mixed farm until she returned to the UK in 1912. After the start of WWI, Marian, Hope and their mother travelled to France at the suggestion of Dr Elsie Inglis where they helped clean up and prepare the abbey at Abbaye de Royaumont to be a hospital. The Scottish Women's Hospital that was established there operated throughout the war, but in May 1915 the two sisters volunteered to join the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. Their mother returned to her home in Wales where she established a home for wounded soldiers at Aber Artro Hall near Llanbedr. Before she left France her mother left funds that enabled an ambulance and a mobile bath Daimler to be purchased for the first FANY hospital which is where they and the vehicles were based at the hospital they call \\"Lamarck\\" in Calais. In April 1918 Marian had to return home due to suspected appendicitis but when recovered she went to work in a munitions factory for Rolls-Royce. They returned to the UK and gained pilots licences in 1930 Between the wars the two sisters ran a coffee farm in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) at a place called Abercorn and now called Mbala. The called their land \\"Chilongolwelo\\" and it was just under 1,000 acres at the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. They were there until the FANY called them back because of the onset of World War Two. Hope went immediately and Marian stayed back to close down the farm. Marian who was the natural leader arrived in 1940. Marian and Hope Gamwell sisters in 1964 at Abercorn (now called Mbala) Marian would command the FANYs after a row with the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The row was with Helen Gwynne-Vaughan who was Chief Controller of the ATS which had been formed in 1939. This was a role that the FANY commander, Mary Baxter Ellis, had turned down as she preferred to lead the FANYs. Ellis agreed to supply 1500 women to serve with the ATS as long as they could be independent of the ATS. This was agreed but Gwynne-Vaughan broke the agreement and forced the attached FANY staff to be absorbed. Gwynne-Vaughan held the role to 1941. Ellis swallowed her pride and become a deputy-director at the ATS throughout the war. Whilst Marian took over the leadership of the remaining FANYs and her sister, Hope, took a special interest in the FANYs who ran the Special Operations Executive. After the war the two sisters returned to Zambia where they reopened their farm. They grew crops that were not coffee. They were there until 1964 when they decided to retire together to live on Jersey. Marian and Hope Gamwell died on Jersey.

She is a research director and instructor at the Centre de recherches internationales (Fr) at Sciences Po. She studies political economy and trade policy with a particular focus on Sub- Saharan Africa, and she also studies the role of market forces in shaping the policies and structure of the state and how that affects the lives of individuals. Education and positions Hibou attended Sciences Po, obtaining her undergraduate degree in 1987. In 1995, Hibou graduated from The School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences with a doctorate in economics. Her doctoral dissertation was entitled √âconomie politique de la protection en Afrique (The political economy of protection in Africa), and used a Weberian framework to study trade policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. Her thesis supervisor was Jean Coussy. In 1998 Hibou joined the faculty at Sciences Po and Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Bordeaux. From 2006 to 2010 she taught a seminar at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, in 2010 she moved to the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, and then in 2013 to the Ecole de Gouvernance et d'Economie in Rabat, Morocco. Research Hibou studies the international political economy of the Middle East and North Africa, Sub- Saharan Africa, and Southern Europe, using the work of Michel Foucault and Max Weber to reflect on the nature of state economic reforms and political power. From the work for her doctoral thesis, Hibou developed the 1996 book L'Afrique est-elle protectionniste? Les chemins buissonniers de la lib√©ralisation ext√©rieure, which studied the political economy of development using cases of policy, fraud, and smuggling in former French colonies of Sub-Saharan Africa. Hibou was the editor of the 1999 book La Privatisation des √âtats (The privatization of states). The book studied the ongoing process of privatization around the world, studying the trend across many countries to give private companies control over functions that had previously been the prerogative of the state. In 2006 she published the book La force de l'ob√©issance. √âconomie politique de la r√©pression en Tunisie (The Force of Obedience: The Political Economy of Repression in Tunisia), which was based on field work that she conducted in Tunisia between 1997 and 2005. The book studied subjugation in Tunisia beyond the readily apparent authoritarian repression, focusing instead on how the economy systemically subjugated Tunisians during that period under the pretense of voluntary work. Hibou's 2011 book, Anatomie politique de la domination (Political anatomy of domination), analysed and compared types of authoritarian governments. The book was reviewed in Le Monde. Hibou's work has been cited, or she has been interviewed, in news outlets including Le Parisien, Lib√©ration, and The Diplomat. Hibou developed an idea of bureaucratie n√©olib√©rale (neoliberal bureacracy) which consists of the systematic use of standards, rules, procedures, and norms that are derived primarily from the market or the world of business and have an impact on daily life. This mechanism enables the liberal market to formally impose itself on fields which are not obviously connected to it, such as the field of education. Hibou has been a member of the editorial board of Politique africaine, Critique internationale, and the Karthala book series Les Afriques.

It had an equivalent organisation in Northern Ireland, N.I.W.A.A.G. They were founded as a reaction to the perceived lack of representation of women artists in exhibitions in Ireland and to the 1987 \\"Irish Women Artists from the Eighteenth Century to the Present Day\\" exhibition and publication from the National Gallery of Ireland. W.A.A.G. had one exhibition at the Project Arts Centre in 1987, which featured over 90 women artists such as Anne Madden. The show featured over 100 slides of artwork, which later developed into a catalogued slide bank maintained by W.A.A.G. Their second exhibition was held at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham (later the Irish Museum of Modern Art) in 1988 which featured a number of student artists from the National College of Art and Design. The group set out to be well integrated into international women artists' networks, with the chair of W.A.A.G., Mooney elected to the executive of the International Association of Women in the Arts. Her election coincided with Dublin's year as the European City of Culture in 1991. As part of the celebrations, 11 women artists from across Europe created artworks across the River Liffey on the theme \\"Women Artists and the Environment\\", as well as Dublin hosting a visit from the Guerrilla Girls.

The 220-km long section between Shyok and DBO was constructed between 2000 and 2019 by India's Border Roads Organisation (BRO).

Lt Gen Prakash Katoch, DSDBO Road completed ‚Äì but what of the scam and the northeast?, Indian Defence Review, 27 April 2019.  History  The Darbuk‚ÄìShyok‚ÄìDBO Road traverses the historic winter route, also called the ZamistƒÅnee route, used by the trading caravans between Leh and Yarkand. Whereas the summer route would cross the Ladakh Range through the difficult Sasser Pass to reach the Shyok River valley, the winter route used to go via the banks of the Shyok River when the water flow would be much reduced and the frozen river surface could be crossed on foot as needed.: \\"Those traders and passersby who opted to travel to Yarkand in winter would cross Digar La and follow the narrow and winding valleys of the Shyok river. This river, which was frozen during winter, was to be crossed and re-crossed several times.\\" Proceeding on the right (western) bank of the Shyok River up to Sultan Chhushku, the route crossed the river to the eastern bank, and followed the valley of Murgo nala to reach the village of Murgo. Here, the summer route also joined the winter route having crossed the Shyok River near Saser Brangsa. From here, the joint route followed Burtsa nala and Depsang nala to reach the Depsang Plains and went on to the Karakoram Pass via Daulat Beg Oldi.  Route  The BRO road begins near the village of Shyok, which is the on the west bank of the Shyok River after its V-shaped bend. Shyok already has roads leading west, to Leh via Darbuk, and south, leading to Pangong Tso. The BRO road crosses the Shyok river to its right bank and rounds the corner, continuing along its right bank due north (on the west side of the river bed). After passing the historic campsites of Chhumed, Mundro and Mandaltang, it crosses the river near Sultan Chhushku. A 430-metre- long bridge over the full width of the river bed has been constructed and named the 'Colonel Chewang Rinchen Setu'. After the Setu, the road goes through the valley of Murgo Nala to reach the village of Murgo, then the valley of Burtsa Nala to reach the camping site of Burtsa, and then Depsang nala to pass by Qizil Langar, close to the Line of Actual Control with China. After Qizil Langar, the road enters the Depsang Plains on a more or less straight route to the Dault Beg Oldi. = Sino-Indian border dispute = Chinese claim lines in Ladakh Current Chinese claims at Burtsa, compared to the line marked by the US Office of Geographer (in blue) Near Burtsa, where the Depsang nala from the north and the Raki nala from the east join to form the Burtsa nala, the Line of Actual Control has been disputed by China and India. China's 1956 claim line as well as the 1960 claim line leave the entire Raki nala (Tiannan river in Chinese nomenclature) in Indian territory. However, the People's Liberation Army's papers are said to document a so- called \\"line of actual control on 7 November 1959\\". Since 2013, they began to assert this line as the operative LAC. This would put the Chinese border within an earshot of the DS‚ÄìDBO Road. Yun Sun, China‚Äôs Strategic Assessment of the Ladakh Clash, War on the Rocks, 19 June 2020. In the Chinese view, the LAC claimed by India is that of 8 September 1962, prior to the hostilities of the 1962 Sino-Indian War. The area between the two lines is said to have been \\"unjustly occupied by India\\" in the intervening years. During the border standoff in 2020, the Chinese forces again stationed themselves near the junction of the Raki Nala and Depsang Nala (often called the \\"Y junction\\" or \\"bottleneck\\") and blocked the Indian troops from patrolling to the east of it. Indian media reported that this amounted to a loss of 900 square kilometres of territory for India.  Construction  The construction was initiated in 2000, with a revised deadline of 2014. However, in 2011, an inquiry by the Chief Technical Examiner found that three-quarters of the road had been laid on the river bed, which is unsuitable for military use. A new Border Roads Task Force from Jammu was then commissioned to realign the constructed road on higher ground and to complete it. The revamped project was scheduled for completion in 2017 but was eventually completed in April 2019. The old alignment was used in the intervening period during the winter months.

History  In 1947, an immediate concern in Europe was a major influenza outbreak in the continent, as well as the need to identify appropriate viruses for a vaccine against the circulating strains. The WHO Interim Committee of the United Nations agreed to begin a Global Influenza Programme (GIP) for the study and control of influenza. In 1948, the Interim Committee recommended the establishment of the first World Influenza Centre at the National Institute for Medical Research in London along with Regional Centres and Observers. A total of 38 regional centers (later named National Influenza Centers) were summoned to participate in the effort, which took extensive activity to develop plans and coordinate information and virus sharing. Five years after the establishment of GIP, the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) was established out of need for an influenza surveillance system to inform the methods for disease prevention and control.

The music he wrote was in a Late Romantic style. At the time of his early death, he was considered a promising composer in Sweden, appreciated by his colleagues. Biography Harald Frykl√∂f was born in Uppsala. Little is known about his early life. In 1901 he entered the Royal Conservatory of Music, the predecessor of the present-day Royal College of Music, Stockholm. In 1902 he started taking private lessons, in addition to attending the conservatory. In 1905, he spent a term in Berlin, where he studied instrumentation under Philipp Scharwenka. Frykl√∂f considered this experience to be of great value for his development as a composer. He also took private piano lessons in Sweden from 1904 until 1910, and in general continuously sought to improve his skills and knowledge throughout his short life. He began teaching harmony and piano in 1904 and would continue to be active as a teacher for all his life, dividing his teaching efforts between private schools and the Royal Conservatory. In 1908 he attained the position of assistant organist at Storkyrkan in Gamla stan in Stockholm, and in 1918 became the head organist of the church. In 1915, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. During the last years of his life he attained several prestigious commissions and positions. Frykl√∂f was widely regarded as a skillful professional by his Swedish colleagues. He had an international outlook, published several of his pieces abroad and cooperated with foreign composers, for example Peter Griesbacher. Frykl√∂f, \\"who had hardly ever known a day‚Äôs illness in his life\\", was infected with the Spanish flu in early March 1918, subsequently caught pneumonia and died on 11 March 1918, aged 36. At the time of his death, he was considered a composer of significant promise in Sweden and has been called one of the most important composers of his generation. In 2019, to commemorate the centenary of his death, a memorial concert with some of his compositions was performed in Saint James's Church, Stockholm. Works Frykl√∂f worked in the tradition of Late Romanticism, but with a \\"distinctively personal idiom\\". He had an interest in the history of music, which often influenced his compositions. He often sought to integrate elements from a wide variety of sources into his compositions. The compositions of Frykl√∂f have been described as characterised by \\"modally inspired idiom and a predilection for contrapuntal writing and polyphonic forms.\\" The earliest known compositions by Frykl√∂f are from 1900, i.e. before he had entered the conservatory. From 1905‚Äì1910, Frykl√∂f composed music for organ and choral works; especially the later have been praised. In the years between 1912 and 1915, Frykl√∂f wrote several motets, and he spent his last years composing sacral music. A Sonata alla leggenda for violin and piano by Frykl√∂f from the same time is often regarded as his best composition. He only composed a single work for symphony orchestra, Concert Overture op. 1, which was incidentally also his first composition.

The fire burned a total area of 123,875 acres. It was the fifth largest wildfire in Arizona‚Äôs history. The blaze caused the evacuation of homes, road and campground closures, endangered wildlife habitats, and the destruction of hiking trails and archaeological sites.  Origin  The fire erupted five miles in the Superstition Mountains east of Mesa, near the Woodbury Trailhead, north of Superior, Arizona, in the Tonto National Forest. The origin of the fire was human-based.  Description  The fire was reported around 1:28 PM on June 8. On June 18, the fire was only 6% contained, and 40,557 acres were burnt. By June 21, the fire had burnt 54, 998 acres, while the containment had dropped from 42% to 34%. As of Tuesday night, June 26, the fire had scorched 121,899 acres, and firefighters had contained 48% of the fire. Due to the size and complexity of the fire, both government agencies and private contractors were deployed to gain control of the fire. By mid-June, there were 450 firefighters to fight the flames. On Monday, July 15, by 7:00 PM, the fire was fully contained. = Use of UAS = On June 26, 2019, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was deployed by Justin Baxter, a drone fire operations specialist, and his three-man team. They flew a Matrice 600 (M600) for gathering data on the magnitude of damage and locating hot spots using an infrared sensor.  Consequences  The fire destroyed the habitat of the white-tailed and mule deer, javelinas, bighorn sheep, black bears, coyotes, bobcats and gray foxes.

It runs between Castroville, where it connects to the Union Pacific Coast Line, and Monterey, formerly running as far as Pacific Grove. It is roughly paralleled by California State Route 1 and is active to Sand City . History Originally built by the Monterey & Salinas Valley Railroad, the line was the first narrow gauge railroad to operate in California with 3-foot gauge tracks laid between Salinas and Monterey. The line saw financial issues very soon after opening and was purchased by a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific on September 29, 1879. A new branch north to Castroville was constructed by the new owners and the western portion converted to standard gauge with the Hotel Del Monte opening the following year. This allowed direct passenger leisure services to run from San Francisco. The line came under the auspices of Southern Pacific proper in 1888 and was extended west past Pacific Grove to a facility at Lake Mejella. By the 1950s, sand made the bulk of freight moved along the route. Passenger rail service ended with the cancellation of the Del Monte after April 30, 1971, when Amtrak took over passenger rail services in the United States. Tracks were realigned with the construction of State Route 1, but the rails west of Seaside were abandoned in 1979. The tracks in Pacific Grove and Monterey were removed in the 1980s and the former right-of-way is now the Monterey Bay Recreation Trail. The Salinas River bridge was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake ‚Äì reconstruction time as well as the closure of Fort Ord in 1993 left almost no activity on the line, and it was abandoned soon after that. The full line was purchased by the Transportation Authority for Monterey County (TAMC) in 2003 for $9.3 million ($ adjusted for inflation). Planned restoration Restoration of Del Monte-like service to Monterey had been identified as early as the Caltrans 1984-89 Rail passenger development plan. Amtrak declined to operate such service, but operations under Southern Pacific (by then running state-subsidized services) were studied with ridership forecast developed. The TAMC opted to initiate Caltrain service to Salinas station in 2021. TAMC has put forward plans to rebuild the line and commence a rail service between Monterey and Castroville. The project calls for diesel light rail trains to operate at twelve stations from Custom House Plaza in Monterey and the future Castroville Caltrain station. The route was included in the 2018 California State Rail Plan as eligible for further study in 2022 and integration into the state rail network by 2040.

Life Brugmann was born in Verviers on 18 October 1829, the son of the industrialist and financier Fr√©d√©ric Brugmann. He studied at the Ecole Centrale de Commerce et d'Industrie in Brussels, before working at the family bank.Samuel Tilman, \\"Brugmann (Georges)\\", Nouvelle Biographie Nationale, vol. 8 (Brussels, 2005), pp. 43-46. After his father's death in 1852 and his elder brother's in 1853, he and his younger brother Ernest headed the family firm. He also became a deacon in the Protestant Church of Brussels, and contributed to the building of several Protestant churches in Belgium. Brugmann invested heavily in railways and tramways. In 1857 he became chief financial officer of the newly founded Compagnie G√©n√©rale du Mat√©riel de Chemins de Fer, which supplied railway equipment to companies in Spain, Turkey and Italy, and in 1874 helped found the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Tramways. In the 1880s he was an early investor in projects for the colonisation of the Congo Free State, and he was one of the founders of the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (1886). In 1888 the family bank, Brugmann et Fils, was bought by Banque Baiser, which in 1910 itself became part of Deutsche Bank. Brugmann was an active philanthropist in the Association pour secourir les pauvres honteux (now Secours et Conseils), and served as consul general in Brussels for Sweden and Norway. He never married, and died in Brussels on 23 November 1900, leaving ten million francs for the founding of what is now Brugmann University Hospital.

Contents The Book of Monsters is a supplement that describes 124 monsters from worldwide myth and legendry. Publication history Little Soldier Games had been founded in 1975 by Ed Konstant and David Perez. After an abortive attempt at a role-playing game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and an Arthurian role-playing game called Knights of the Round Table, Konstant and Perez decided to supply third-party supplements for the new role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. They called upon Phil Edgren, who owned a bookstore around the corner from their shop, to write the text to a bestiary of mythical monsters. The result was The Book of Monsters, a digest- sized 44-page book published in 1976 that was the first fantasy bestiary, predating TSR's Monster Manual by a year. The illustrations and cover art were done by Bob Charrette. In 1978, Phoenix Games bought Little Soldier Games, and signed over the rights to the Little Soldier back-catalogue to Gamescience after Gamescience paid the printing costs for Phoenix's first two products. Gamescience quickly republished a 16-page edition of The Book of Monsters under their banner. They later included it in the 1990 compilation The Fantasy Gamer's Compendium. In his book Designers & Dragons, game historian Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"Little Soldier had also gotten into the roleplaying field with a series of generic fantasy-roleplaying supplements, the first of which was The Book of Monsters (1976) a description of 124 monsters by mythological scholar Phil Edgren. Edgren would end up being Little Soldier's most prolific author.\\" Shannon Appelcline noted that Dungeons & Dragons was the clear market leader among about a dozen RPGs available by early 1977, by which time \\"third parties had begun supplementing the game, with the most notable early supplements including Wee Warrior's The Character Archaic (1975) and Palace of the Vampire Queen (1976), Little Soldier's The Book of Monsters (1976) and The Book of Demons (1976), and Judges Guild's City State of the Invincible Overlord (1976+) and Dungeon Tac Reference Cards (1976). It would be 1977 or 1978 before \\"generic fantasy\\" supplements intended for D&D; really started to proliferate, but even then, most would fit into the categories defined by these early publishers: accessories (like The Character Archaic), adventures (like Palace), monsters manuals (like Little Soldier's Books), and setting books (like City State).\\" Appelcline also mentioned that Gamescience bought the back catalog of Little Soldier Games in 1978, \\"which included several board games and a half-dozen \\"generic\\" fantasy supplements of very early pedigree. (Little Soldier had published them starting in 1976.) Gamescience expanded its roleplaying line almost immediately with reprints of Little Soldier's Book of Demons (1978) and Book of Monsters (1978). Zocchi had originally planned to publish more, but the rest of the Little Soldier FRP books would have to wait until all six appeared as part of The Fantasy Gamer's Compendium (1983).\\" Reception In the February-March 1978 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #5), Lew Pulsipher did not recommend The Book of Monsters, stating \\"Book of Monsters really isn't worth it, particularly since much of the information is available in decent libraries in encyclopedias of mythology and folklore.\\" References Category:Fantasy role-playing game supplements ","title":"The Book of Monsters"},{"id":"64066457","text":"Winnie Ngwenya is a South African politician, African National Congress (ANC) member and a permanent delegate to the National Council of Provinces since 2019.

Background The identity has been referenced in media, and researched widely in academia and across international institutions in relation to both domestic and diasporic Eastern European identity. In a research study by four professors and doctors of University of Exeter, the academics proposed that the identity has historical roots associated with early Muslim conquests in the region and a subsequent early conception of \\"Fortress Europe\\": > Alongside Iberia, parts of Eastern Europe had the longest engagement with > the Islamic world on the continent. Through the presence of domestic Muslim > minorities and entanglement with the Ottoman Empire for over half a > millennium, the idea of Islam - whether in times of conflict or of > coexistence - played a formative role in the construction of a specifically > Eastern European identity. University of Graz academic Natalia Waechter's research has correlated a pattern of a lesser sense of the identity in individuals who, while European, are ethnic minorities in neighboring countries in the region; \\"Analysis has also shown that Eastern European identity is especially low for ethnic minority groups among which either Slovakia or Hungary is resident nation or titular nation (Slovaks in Hungary, Hungarians in Slovakia, and Hungarians in Ukraine).\\" In Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science, the competing national (e.g. Moldovian) versus regional Eastern European identiy in diasporic populations has also been explored within the United Kingdom. History In an Anthropological Journal of European Cultures-piece, University of Exeter's Dr Ljubica Spaskovska proposed that an \\"East-West divide\\" in Europe and a \\"distinct 'Eastern European' identity\\" can be traced and credited to several European project developments between the two World Wars. At the end of the Cold War and the revolutions of 1989, Eastern European identity entered a new phase of development. In this regard, sociologist G√∂ran Therborn believes \\"heavy-handed Soviet bilateral hegemony barred most of any positive Eastern European identity\\". In 2000, Iulia Motoc, who in 2013 became a European Court of Human Rights judge, published research suggesting that the development of the identity can be contrasted with German identity. In the context of European integration within the legal structure of the European Union, while both identities \\"demonstrate a deep attachment to Europe\\", Motoc proposed that national identity in Germany shows signs of subsiding, while contrastingly a growing assertion of Eastern European identity has been observed. Since the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, academic analysis has suggested that cooperation between MEPs from the EU8 countries can be viewed as the expression of \\"Central and Eastern European identity\\". In Costica Bradatan's 2013 Philosophy, Society and the Cunning of History in Eastern Europe, academic Julia Sushytska analyzed Lviv, a city in Eastern Europe which had its national affiliation switched seven times in the 20th- century, as an example of the complexities in Eastern European identity formation and associations. Academic research Research by academic Gary Marks and political scientist Liesbet Hooghe has correlated strong national identity in Eastern Europe with both a pan-European and broad Eastern European identity. In 2009, University of Helsinki's Matti Jutilla analyzed historian Hans Kohn's dichotomy on Eastern versus Western European identity. Published in the European Journal of International Relations, the research proposed conflict and bias in Kohn's representations of the two regional European identities; with common portrayals of Eastern European identity as backward or illiberal in comparison to its Western counterpart. In 2013's The Politics of Becoming European, University of Kent academic Maria M√§lksoo used the writings of Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin to analyze and compare \\"Western and Eastern European identity constructions\\".

Early life  Born in Milan, Italy, Marco developed a passion for music at a young age. He received his first guitar as a gift, at age 9, when he was enrolled into the Lainate Private School in Milan. While there, he studied both classical and contemporary music and was influenced by a variety of classical and modern artists. At age 17, he was introduced to the fire of flamenco jazz, as played by Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and Paco De Lucia, and to the passionate tango music of Astor Piazzola. By age 21, Marco was composing. Career Active not only as a guitarist, but also as a composer and teacher, in 1993 he founded with Alberto Vigan√≤ the complex \\"Altus Karma\\", with which he took part in the same year in the festival \\"On the border between Sardinia and Jazz\\", sharing the stage with artists of the caliber of Al Di Meola and Paco De Lucia. The CD of the same name \\"Altus Karma\\" was made in 1995 with the group itself. In 1996 he formed the Diatriba Quartet by participating in the Sant'Anna Arresi Jazz Festival which included the participation of musicians such as Noa, Pat Metheny and Michel Petrucciani.http://www.santannarresijazz.it/en/pas-editions/ In 1997 he took part in the recording of the Satie's Magazine album \\"Contrunti\\". From 1998 he began playing concerts as part of the project called 'Marco Porcu & MCM Ensemble', an experience that lasted for several years. In 2004 he performed in London and the United States, where he moved until 2005. In the same year he was recognized as the \\"Artist in Residence\\" by the Wichita Guitar Society on \\"... his exemplary and unique artistic and technical ability in field of musical and compositional performance \\". Back in Italy, he started a collaboration with Giovanni Prosdocimi, a violist, producer and arranger and also with Gianluigi Cavaliere, leader of Chantango, a band he joined in 2006, recording the album 'Bestiario d'Amore'. Around the same time, he collaborated with singer-author Marisa Sannia on a musical poetic project based on the lyrics of Garcia Lorca. The same year, he performed at the Sistina theater in Rome with the actor Orso Maria Guerrini and sharing the stage with Toquinho. In 2008, he was invited by the Music College of Wichita (Kansas, USA) as the holder of the acoustic guitar chair. In 2011, his solo album Sciamano (Shaman) was released in the United States. The same year, at the Bologna Festival of the Arts, he ranked first in the instrumentalist category, earning the special prize \\"Piergiorgio Farina\\". In 2012 he performed in a recital for solo guitar as part of the \\"Summer Cloister\\" review in Parma, where he was also awarded the prize entitled \\"for having distinguished himself as a talented artist in the international arena\\".

Contents The Book of Demons is a supplement of rules for demon conjuration, and contains descriptions of 85 demons. Publication history Little Soldier Games had been founded in 1975 by Ed Konstant and David Perez. After an abortive attempt at a role-playing game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and an Arthurian role-playing game called Knights of the Round Table, Konstant and Perez decided to supply third-party supplements for the new role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. They used Phil Edgren, who owned a bookstore around the corner from their shop, to write the text for their first book, The Book of Monsters; they then asked Edgren to write a second book, The Book of Demons. The illustrations and cover art were done by Bob Charrette. In 1978, Phoenix Games bought Little Soldier Games, and signed over the rights to the Little Soldier back-catalogue to Gamescience after Gamescience paid the printing costs for Phoenix's first two products. Gamescience later included The Book of Demons in the 1990 compilation The Fantasy Gamer's Compendium. Shannon Appelcline noted that Dungeons & Dragons was the clear market leader among about a dozen RPGs available by early 1977, by which time \\"third parties had begun supplementing the game, with the most notable early supplements including Wee Warrior's The Character Archaic (1975) and Palace of the Vampire Queen (1976), Little Soldier's The Book of Monsters (1976) and The Book of Demons (1976), and Judges Guild's City State of the Invincible Overlord (1976+) and Dungeon Tac Reference Cards (1976). It would be 1977 or 1978 before \\"generic fantasy\\" supplements intended for D&D; really started to proliferate, but even then, most would fit into the categories defined by these early publishers: accessories (like The Character Archaic), adventures (like Palace), monsters manuals (like Little Soldier's Books), and setting books (like City State).\\" Appelcline added that TSR was publishing rules expansion supplements in the early days of D&D; which \\"included new classes, new spells, new artifacts, and generally new rules ‚Äî and almost none of the third-party publishers were duplicating them. Little Soldier did present some black magic rules in The Book of Demons, but that was a rare and much more focused exception.\\" Appelcline also mentioned that Gamescience bought the back catalog of Little Soldier Games in 1978, \\"which included several board games and a half-dozen \\"generic\\" fantasy supplements of very early pedigree. (Little Soldier had published them starting in 1976.) Gamescience expanded its roleplaying line almost immediately with reprints of Little Soldier's Book of Demons (1978) and Book of Monsters (1978). Zocchi had originally planned to publish more, but the rest of the Little Soldier FRP books would have to wait until all six appeared as part of The Fantasy Gamer's Compendium (1983).\\" Reception Lew Pulsipher reviewed The Book of Demons for White Dwarf #5, and stated that \\"Book of Demons may be worthwhile if you like new character classes and permit Chaotic characters in your campaign. I should also point out that the Black Magician class probably won't work in crossover play because the referee won't have sufficient control over what occurs.\\" References Category:Fantasy role-playing game supplements ","title":"The Book of Demons"},{"id":"64066619","text":"Fonner Park is a thoroughbred horse racing facility located in Grand Island, Nebraska. Co-located with Eihusen Arena and the grounds of the Nebraska State Fair, it is named after its original land owner August L. Fonner, and first held races in 1954. Physical attributes Fonner Park is a dirt oval. The Fonner Keno Casino and Finish Line Restaurant offers keno and off-track betting.; In July 2019, the facility received authorization from the Nebraska Racing Commission to install historical Instant Racing machines, but in February 2020 their installation was delayed due to a pending lawsuit over their legality. History The site was purchased by the Hall County Livestock Improvement Association in April 1953. The park was named after August L. \\"Gus\\" Fonner, who donated the land. The Old Reliable Hereford Show and Sale was held as its first livestock exhibition in September, before beginning its inaugural season of racing on April 29, 1954. In the years that followed, Fonner was expanded to include additional grandstand seating, expanded barn space, an indoor quarter-mile training track, and other amenities. In March 1979, Fonner Park began offering Sunday races for the first time. In 1988, the track began simulcasts to Lincoln and Omaha. = Prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic = On March 16, 2020, live racing at Fonner Park was suspended due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 19, the facility announced that it planned to resume races behind closed doors as a \\"trial\\" from March 23 through April 1, with races moving from weekends to a Monday‚ÄìWednesday schedule, only essential personnel present at the track, and additional safety protocols. While grandstands would be closed to the public, spectators would still be able to watch from the track's parking lot, and use its geofenced betting app while on the grounds. The Fonner Keno Casino and restaurant would remain operational, subject to restrictions. As one of the few U.S. tracks to continue racing (and horse racing being one of the few sports to continue in any form amidst the pandemic's arrival in North America), the \\"boutique\\" Fonner Park began to receive national exposure, including more frequent simulcasts by TVG Network. The change in scheduling and shift to late-afternoon first posts helped alleviate conflicts with weekend simulcast racing from other tracks still in operation, and helped attract more viewers from the west coast. With the resumption of races, Fonner Park experienced a surge in off-track betting activity domestically and abroad; on its first day of races after the resumption, the track handled over $1.3 million‚Äîsurpassing the track's previous single-day record of $1.2 million. Fonner Park CEO Chris Kotulak noted that the track only received 3% of the revenue from OTB, meaning that higher numbers would be needed to cover purses and employee salaries. In its first two weeks, the average handle increased to $2.1 million per day. Fonner Park simulcasts were also being picked up in countries such as Australia, England, France, and South Africa, while the Grand Island Independent described the track as having temporarily become \\"the center of the horse racing world\\". On April 1, it was announced that Fonner Park would continue this racing format through April. Kotulak stated that it \\"exceeded our expectations because we did not expect as many other tracks to cancel racing\\". By its sixth week, the average daily handle had peaked at $3.5 million, but to taper off towards $3 million as other tracks resumed racing. From February through April, Fonner Park took a total of $71.3 million in wagers, a year- over-year increase of $63.8 million. It also accounted for 40% of wagers from TVG customers in April 2020 (as opposed to only 5% the year before). On April 22, the Nebraska Racing Commission approved the addition of 12 additional days of racing in May, extending Fonner Park's season through May 27.

Margaret Conway or Margaret Conway, is an American political scientist. She is a Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of Florida. Conway is a scholar of political behavior, and particularly on how gender and race affect political participation. Career Conway has published extensively on the topic of political behavior and its interactions with gender and race. In 1985, Conway published the book Political Participation in the United States. Conway structured the book around paradoxes in the study of participation in the United States, which allowed her to both challenge and elaborate the major theories of political participation. Political Participation in the United States was reprinted several times, and by its third edition in 2000 it had become a central book in the study of political participation. Conway's study of the general problem of political participation in America has included several works that examine the participation of different demographic groups in American politics. She was a co-author, with Pei-te Lien and Janelle Wong, of the 2004 book The Politics of Asian Americans. In The Politics of Asian Americans, Lien, Conway, and Wong use a national survey to study Asian Americans' progress and the social barriers that remain, and to measure the extent of their political participation and social integration. Conway has also published books and articles on political participation by women, including as a co-author of the 2004 book Women & Public Policy: A Revolution in Progress. She was also a coauthor, with David W. Ahern and Gertrude A. Steuernagel, of the 1997 book Women and Political Participation: Cultural Change in the Political Arena, which had multiple printings.

She served during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, as well as in a variety of domestic missions.  Construction and characteristics  Planetree was built at the Marine Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company yard in Duluth, Minnesota. Her keel was laid down on December 4, 1942. The ship was launched on March 20, 1943. Her original cost was $872,876. Her hull was constructed of welded steel plates framed with steel I-beams. As originally built, Planetree was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement was 935 tons. While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. She was designed to perform light ice-breaking. Her hull was reinforced with an \\"ice belt\\" of thicker steel around her waterline to protect it from punctures. Similarly, her bow was reinforced and shaped to ride over ice in order to crush it with the weight of the ship. USCGC Planetree as she appeared at the end of her career Planetree had a single stainless-steel five-blade propeller driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 700 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran a 1200 horsepower Westinghouse electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which had the ability to lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Planetree's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 42 enlisted personnel. Planetree was armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. Two racks of depth charges were also mounted on the aft deck. All of this armament was removed in 1966 leaving Planetree with only small arms for law enforcement actions. At the time of construction, Planetree was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. The designation was system was changed in 1965, and she was redsignated WLB, an oceangoing buoy tender. Her namesake is the plane tree, a genus of trees which includes sycamores.  Great Lakes service  Planetree was commissioned on November 4, 1943, and began her career in the Great Lakes. In early December 1943 she was icebreaking in Lake Superior to keep the port of Ashland, Wisconsin open for iron ore shipments. On December 10, 1943 the Canadian steamship Sarnian went aground off Point Isabella on the Keweenaw Peninsula during a storm. Covered in ice and pounded by high seas, her hull plates cracked, and she was abandoned three days later. Her crew of 22 was rescued by Planetree. Planetree spent the winter of 19431944 icebreaking in the Great Lakes. She was the first vessel of the season to reach Sault Ste. Marie by breaking ice in the Saint Mary's River in March 1944.  Pacific service  Planetree testing firefighting equipment at the Coast Guard Yard in June 1944 In June 1944 Planetree was assigned to a new homeport, Honolulu, Hawaii. During her transit from the Great Lakes she stopped at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. Tenders sailing for war zones were equipped with extra firefighting pumps, welding equipment, and diving gear. Once she reached Hawaii, one of her tasks was to deliver updated LORAN equipment to remote stations at Baker, Gardner, and Atafu Islands, which she accomplished in 1945. The end of World War II in 1945 created intense pressure from conscripted members of the armed forces and their families for rapid demobilization. The Coast Guard lost so many sailors that it was forced to decommission several ships for lack of crews to sail them. Planetree was decommissioned in March 1947 and held in reserve at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. On September 1, 1949 Planetree was recommissioned and assigned to Guam. She was responsible for maintaining aids to navigation across a swathe to the Pacific from Okinawa to Eniwetok to Saipan. She also supplied remote bases. For example, on September 23, 1954 she arrived at Angaur, an island in Palau, towing a barge with about 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel for the LORAN station there. In October 1954 she was reassigned to Honolulu. Her primary mission was to maintain aids to navigation, including LORAN stations, throughout the central Pacific. Due to the vast distances involved, these cruises were long. They took advantage of the ship's at-sea endurance. During February and March 1960, Planetree spent seven weeks repairing aids to navigation on Samoa, and Swains, Baker, Jarvis, Howland, and Enderbury Islands. In August 1960 she was sent on a four-week cruise to Midway and Johnston Islands, and Samoa to maintain aids to navigation. Planetree cruised the western Pacific on a five-month trip maintaining buoys in 1965. She also worked in the Hawaiian Islands. When a May 1960 tsunami displaced the harbor buoys at Hilo, Planetree was on the spot to reset them. Planetree was tasked with a number of search and rescue missions while stationed in Honolulu. For example, in August 1959 she towed the disabled schooner Diablo and her crew of ten 675 miles back to Honolulu. She rescued the 17-man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel Koryo Maru II which had gone aground on Minto Reef in the Caroline Islands in 1961. The sloop Rampage, participating in the 1967 Transpacific Yacht Race, lost her rudder and was towed to port by Planetree. Planetree had a brief tour in the Korean War zone, arriving on May 15, 1954. When she departed on July 27, 1954 she was the last Coast Guard cutter to leave theater of operations. She earned the Korean service medal for her efforts. In July 1958 crew from Planetree arrested pacifist and nuclear activist Earle L. Reynolds 65 miles inside a restricted area in the Pacific Proving Grounds. He was protesting the Hardtack I series of hydrogen bomb tests. Planetree escorted his sailboat to Kwajalein. In 1966 the Republic of Vietnam had only a single buoy tender. It was not adequate to maintain and improve navigational aids needed by the growing US shipping along the South Vietnamese coast. In particular, U.S. commanders wanted a series of petroleum off-loading buoys to support the movement of fuel ashore from tankers. They requested assistance placing these buoys and on April 24, 1966 Plantree became the first Coast Guard buoy tender to enter the Vietnam theater of operations. She set 16 off-loading buoys in 4 ports. Other requests for aids to navigation resulted in the Coast Guard deploying four buoy tenders, including Planetree, on short rotations during the Vietnam war. During her 1967 Vietnam deployment, Planetree set ship anchorage and mooring buoys off Da Nang and Chu Lai. Among the unique challenges faced in the war zone was that aids to navigation were used for target practice by all sides in the conflict. Batteries for lighted buoys were stolen by all sides for use in cars and other applications. Whenever any of the Coast Guard buoy tenders were deployed to the theater they sailed with Vietnamese lighthouse service personnel aboard. The training they received was deemed sufficient to turn over responsibility for maintaining their own aids to navigation in December 1972, but by then the regime was falling. The last Coast Guard buoy tender left Vietnamese waters in the spring of 1973 as part of the general withdrawal of U.S. forces.. Planetree earned the Vietnam service award.  Alaska service  Planetree was given a refit in 1974. She received an \\"austere\\" renovation, the less comprehensive of the two buoy tender service life extension programs the Coast Guard implemented at that time. This refit was expected to extend the ship's life by 8 to 10 years. Crew quarters were improved and modernized, and a new crew lounge was added. The climate control system was modernized, and the main engines and electrical switchboards were overhauled. New 100 kilowatt generators were installed. After the renovation, in August 1974, Planetree was reassigned to Juneau, Alaska. Her primary mission remained the maintenance of aids to navigation. One unusual aspect of this service is that she was responsible for supplying the last manned lighthouse in Alaska, Five Finger Island. Planetree sailed from Alaska to Hawaii several times during her career to join training exercises. On one trip, in January 1993, she encountered a storm which produced 100-mile per hour gusts and waves 55 feet high. Three small holes opened in the ship's hull causing a 30 to 50 gallon per hour leak. The application off quick-drying cement as temporary patches cut the leaks down to 3 to 5 gallons per hour, which the ship's pumps handled easily. Planetree hove to until the weather moderated, reducing her speed to just the minimum required to allow her rudder to be effective in steering the ship. Even at this low speed, the ship began to leak propeller shaft lubricant which threatened her ability to continue steering. USCGC Douglas Munro responded to Planetree bringing additional lubricant, and the ship made port as the weather moderated. In September 1984 Planetree was tending a buoy about 5 miles west of Gustavus, Alaska. She struck a submerged object which tore a hole in her hull 3 feet long and eight inches wide. Her main hold flooded to ten feet deep. She sought shelter at Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park where commercial divers installed a temporary patch. In 1985 Planetree was transferred to Ketchikan, replacing USCGC Laurel. In her new homeport she was responsible for 254 aids to navigation between Dixon Entrance and Juneau. On April 6, 1989 Planetree was directed to sail for Prince William Sound to assist in the Coast Guard response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Planetree and USCGC Yocona attempted to corral floating oil near Seward with floating boom. At 10:11 pm on January 25, 1990 Planetree ran aground at Deception Point in the southern part of Wrangell Narrows. There were no injuries and the ship was promptly refloated, but her hull was pierced and began to flood. USCGC Firebush, USCGC Elderberry, and USCGC Anacapa responded and brought emergency pumps and divers. The divers found a 1' x 2' hole, a 6\\" x 1\\" crack and a 5-foot dent on Planetree's port side. The pumps prevailed, removing 3.2 million gallons of water from the ship's hold. Planetree ultimately made it to drydock in Ketchikan under her own power.USCGC Planetree (second from left) rafted in reserve fleet, Suisun Bay, CaliforniaPlanetree was decommissioned in Ketchikan on March 19, 1999. During her career she earned several honors including the Coast Guard Unit Commendation, two Meritorious Unit Commendations, and eight Coast Guard E Ribbons. She was replaced in Ketchikan by USCGC Anthony Petit.  Retirement  After decommissioning, Planetree was placed in the ready reserve fleet and moored with other mothballed ships at Suisun Bay, California. Several efforts were made to donate the ship to a worthy non-profit organization. The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 sought to donate Planetree to the Jewish Life museum in Sherman Oaks, California. In 2005 Congress acted to give Plaintree to CAS Foundation, Inc. of Indiana. In 2009 the Senate took action to donate the vessel to The Anchor Program in Richmond, California. None of these donations happened. In 2018 the Maritime Administration contracted with All Star Metals of Brownsville, Texas to recycle Planetree and USCGC Iris. They were drydocked at Mare Island to clean their bottoms and repair their hulls sufficiently for them to reach Texas. The drydock contract was for $268,000. The two ships were towed to Brownsville where they arrived on January 28, 2019. It was reported that the cost of the recycling was $1,359,400.

It was named in honour of Mason Hale, the \\"preeminent student of the Parmeliaceae\\". The genus was circumscribed in 2010 by Pradeep Kumar Divakar and Ana Crespo. Emodomelanelia is in the \\"Melanohalea\\" clade (one of nine major groups in the Parmelioid clade of the Parmeliaceae) along with the genera Melanelixia and Melanohalea. The genus name combines emodo (referring to the Himalayas) and melanelia (referring to the brown colour of the upper thallus surface). Description Characteristics of the genus Emodomelanelia include an olive brown to brown thallus, narrow to moderately broad lobes, a non-pored epicortex, the presence of effigurate pseudocyphellae (i.e. with a lobed shape), and bifusiform conidia. The cortex stains green with HNO3+. Habitat and distribution Emodomelanelia masonii is endemic to the Himalayas, where it grows on rocks in alpine and subalpine habitats.

Considerations on the Unified Strength Theory due to Mao-Hong Yu (in German: Einige √úberlegungen zur Unified Strength Theory von Mao-Hong Yu), Forschung im Ingenieurwesen, 74(3), pp. 135-166.  Mathematical Formulation  Mathematically, the formulation of UST is expressed in principal stress state as {\\\\sigma _2} \\\\leqslant \\\\frac}} {\\\\sigma _2} \\\\geqslant \\\\frac}} where {\\\\sigma _1},{\\\\sigma _2},{\\\\sigma _3} are three principal stresses, {\\\\sigma _{t}}is the uniaxial tensile strength and \\\\alpha is tension- compression strength ratio (\\\\alpha = {\\\\sigma _t}/{\\\\sigma _c}). The unified yield criterion (UYC) is the simplification of UST when \\\\alpha = 1, i.e. {\\\\sigma _2} \\\\leqslant \\\\frac{1}{2}({\\\\sigma _1} + {\\\\sigma _3})}} {\\\\sigma _2} \\\\geqslant \\\\frac{1}{2}({\\\\sigma _1} + {\\\\sigma _3})}}  Limit surfaces of Unified Strength Theory  The limit surfaces of the unified strength theory in principal stress space are usually a semi-infinite dodecahedron cone with unequal sides. The shape and size of the limiting dodecahedron cone depends on the parameter b and \\\\alpha. The limit surfaces of UST and UYC are shown as follows. The limit surfaces of UST with \\\\alpha=0.6 The limit surfaces of UYC  Derivation of Unified Strength Theory  Due to the relation ({\\\\tau _{13}} = {\\\\tau _{12}} + {\\\\tau _{23}}), the principal stress state ({\\\\sigma _1},{\\\\sigma _2},{\\\\sigma _3}) may be converted to the twin-shear stress state ({\\\\tau _{13}},{\\\\tau _{12}};{\\\\sigma _{13}},{\\\\sigma _{12}}) or ({\\\\tau _{13}},{\\\\tau _{23}};{\\\\sigma _{13}},{\\\\sigma _{23}}). Twin- shear element models proposed by Mao-Hong Yu are used for representing the twin-shear stress state. Considering all the stress components of the twin- shear models and their different effects yields the unified strength theory as \\\\+ b{\\\\tau _{12}} + \\\\beta ({\\\\sigma _{13}} + b{\\\\sigma _{12}}) = C, {\\\\text{ when }} {\\\\tau _{12}} + \\\\beta {\\\\sigma _{12}} \\\\geqslant {\\\\tau _{23}} + \\\\beta {\\\\sigma _{23}}}} \\\\+ b{\\\\tau _{23}} + \\\\beta ({\\\\sigma _{13}} + b{\\\\sigma _{23}}) = C, {\\\\text{ when }}{\\\\tau _{12}} + \\\\beta {\\\\sigma _{12}} \\\\leqslant {\\\\tau _{23}} + \\\\beta {\\\\sigma _{23}}}} The relations among the stresses components and principal stresses read = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _1} - {\\\\sigma _3}} \\\\right), {\\\\sigma _{13}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _1} + {\\\\sigma _3}} \\\\right)}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _1} - {\\\\sigma _2}} \\\\right), {\\\\sigma _{12}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _1} + {\\\\sigma _2}} \\\\right)}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _2} - {\\\\sigma _3}} \\\\right), {\\\\sigma _{23}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( {{\\\\sigma _2} + {\\\\sigma _3}} \\\\right)}} The \\\\beta and C should be obtained by uniaxial failure state }}} By substituting Eqs.(4a), (4b) and (5a) into the Eq.(3a), and substituting Eqs.(4a), (4c) and (5b) into Eq.(3b), the \\\\beta and C are introduced as }}} + {\\\\sigma _{\\\\text{t}}}}} = \\\\frac, C = \\\\frac{{1 + b{\\\\sigma _{\\\\text{c}}}{\\\\sigma _{\\\\text{t}}}}} + {\\\\sigma _{\\\\text{t}}}}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma _t}}}  History of Unified Strength Theory  The development of the unified strength theory can be divided into three stages as follows. 1\\\\.

Prelude  In the 1121 Ibn Tumart, the founder and mahdi of the reformist Almohad movement, arrived in Marrakesh to preach his ideas. He even met with the Almoravid emir, Ali ibn Yusuf, during prayers at mosque and confronted him about his ways. The Almoravid political leadership became hostile to what they saw as his subversive presence and he eventually fled to the Atlas Mountains, establishing himself at Tinmal, south of Marrakesh. His influence and power grew until he eventually had the confidence to launch a military attack against the Almoravids with the help of the Berber tribes (particularly the Masmuda) allied to him. Perhaps sensing the growing threat and insecurity in the region, Ali ibn Yusuf fortified Marrakesh with its first set of ramparts in 1126.  The battle  The battle was the culmination of an attempted Almohad assault against Marrakesh, the Almoravid capital, the center of power in the region. The Almohads, led by Ibn Tumart, initially defeated the Almoravids near Aghmat and pushed them back to the city. When the Almohad forces arrived before the city, the population was taken by surprise and there was chaos as the defenders were routed and as the inhabitants fled within the walls. Some died in the crush of people trying to pass through the narrow city gates. The Almohads under general al-Bashir and his lieutenant Abu Zakariyya besieged the city for forty days until Almoravid reinforcements arrived and, along with a sortie from the defenders, crushed the Almohad forces. The battle took place just east of the city and is named after a garden, Buhayrat al- Raka'ik, which was located here near the gates of Bab Debbagh and Bab Aylan.  Aftermath  A large number of Almohad commanders were killed. General al- Bashir died in battle, while his lieutenant, Abu Zakariyya, was wounded in the eye by an arrow. The Almohad threat to the city was staved off for 17 years (until their conquest of the city in 1147). A few months after this, the Almohad leader, Ibn Tumart, died. His death was kept secret for a period of 3 years which was called a _ghayba_ or occultation. Eventually, his death was announced and Abd al-Mu'min emerged as the leader the movement and the founder of a new dynasty that lasted until its demise. Abd al-Mu'min eventually conquered Marrakesh in 1147.

In the annals, Im Seong-gu is referred to as a \\"man from Gilju\\", who married a man and a woman.

The regiment was formed on August 26, 1862, when two existing units were combined. Later that year, the regiment was then lightly engaged at the Battle of Iuka and saw heavy action at the Second Battle of Corinth. In 1863, the regiment was engaged at the Battle of Port Gibson, and was part of a major charge at the Battle of Champion Hill. After a defeat at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge, the regiment took part in the Siege of Vicksburg, where it saw heavy fighting. The Siege of Vicksburg ended on July 4th with a Confederate surrender; after being exchanged, the regiment combined with the 2nd Missouri Infantry to form the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated). The 6th Missouri Infantry ceased to exist as a separate unit. Organization The 6th Missouri Infantry was mustered on August 26, 1862, at Guntown, Mississippi, as the result of consolidation of several existing units. The bulk of the regiment came from Erwin's Battalion, although Hedgpeth's Battalion also contributed. Two artillery batteries who had not been issued cannons were reclassified to infantry; the men of these two batteries were merged into the 6th Missouri Infantry. The regiment's first colonel was Andrew Eugene Erwin, former commander of Erwin's Battalion. Isaac Newton Hedgpeth, former commander of Hedgpeth's Battalion, was appointed lieutenant colonel; Joseph P. Vaughn was the regiment's original major. On the date of muster, the regiment's original organization was: * Company \\"A\\": Cass County, Missouri and Jackson County, Missouri. Commanded by Francis M. McKinney. * Company \\"B\\": Jackson County, Missouri and Lafayette County, Missouri. Commanded by Samuel F. Taylor. * Company \\"C\\": Boone County, Missouri and Howard County, Missouri. Commanded by Stephen Cooper. * Company \\"D\\": Cape Girardeau County, Missouri and Stoddard County, Missouri. Commanded by Albert A. Woodard. * Company \\"E\\": Jackson County, Missouri and Johnson County, Missouri. Commanded by Jeptha Duncan. * Company \\"F\\": Cass County, Missouri and St. Clair County, Missouri. Commanded by John M. Wiedemeyer. * Company \\"G\\": Clay County, Missouri and Platte County, Missouri. Commanded by John B. Clark. * Company \\"H\\": Howard County, Missouri. Commanded by John M. Hickey. * Company \\"I\\": Cape Girardeau County, Missouri and Scott County, Missouri. Commanded by John D. Parsons. * Company \\"K\\": Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, Ripley County, Missouri, Wayne County, Missouri, and Arkansas. Commanded by Alvah G. Kelsey. Companies \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"E\\", \\"F\\", \\"G\\", and \\"H\\" contained men from Erwin's Battalion. Companies \\"I\\" and \\"K\\" were from Hedgpeth's Battalion, and Company \\"D\\" was composed of the men from the two artillery units. =Component units= Hedgpeth's Battalion had been formed in April 1862 when several elements of the Missouri State Guard, commanded by militia officer M. Jeff Thompson, were transferred to Fort Pillow and Fort Pickering near Memphis, Tennessee. The battalion served on Confederate States Navy ships during the Battle of Plum Point Bend on May 10, and later became part of the First Confederate Infantry Regiment on July 10. On August 25, the battalion was detached from the 1st Confederate Infantry, and became part of the 6th Missouri Infantry on August 26. Erwin's Battalion had been organized on May 16, 1862 by consolidating Clark's Missouri Battalion and Rosser's Missouri Battalion. The battalion performed garrison duty at Corinth, Mississippi until the Confederates evacuated the town at the end of the month. Afterwards, the battalion performed guard duty in northern Mississippi until the unit became part of the 6th Missouri Infantry on August 26. Harris' Missouri Battery had entered Confederate service on January 1, 1862. After participating in a skirmish near Sikeston, Missouri on February 28, the battery transferred to Fort Pillow. Since the battery did not have cannons, it served as infantry; seeing action at the Battle of Plum Point Bend on May 10. On July 2, the battery was merged into Hedgpeth's Battalion, although about 60 men were detached to man the cannons of the ironclad CSS Arkansas on July 15. On August 26, the battery became part of the 6th Missouri Infantry. McDonald's Missouri Battery had officially joined the Confederate States Army on March 13, 1862, although many of the men of the battery had seen prior service in the Missouri State Guard. On April 28, the battery's cannons were transferred to the Arkansas Appeal Battery, and McDonald's Battery was sent to Fort Pillow. After seeing action at the Battle of Plum Point Bend on May 10, the battery served as infantry and became part of the 6th Missouri on August 26. Service history1862= Confederate dead on the field of the Second Battle of Corinth On September 19, 1862, the regiment was exposed to artillery fire at the Battle of Iuka, but was otherwise unengaged. At the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4, the regiment was part of the brigade of Brigadier General Martin E. Green as part of Brigadier General Louis H√©bert's division of Major General Sterling Price's corps of Major General Earl Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. Also in Green's brigade were the 7th Mississippi Battalion, 43rd Mississippi Infantry, 4th Missouri Infantry, 3rd Missouri Cavalry, Guibor's Battery, and Landis's Battery. On the first day at Corinth (October 3), the 6th Missouri, as well as the rest of Green's brigade (less the artillery), began a charge against the Union line defended by Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies' division. The Confederates met with heavy Union fire, and a cabin in the path of the 6th Missouri threw the regiment's ranks into confusion. After about 15 minutes, Green's brigade was forced to withdraw. Another attempt at a Confederate charge was broken by a counterattack by the 2nd Iowa Infantry, the Iowans' attack hit the 6th Missouri the hardest. Green's brigade was forced to withdraw again. Reinforced by elements of Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade and supported by the brigade of Brigadier General Charles W. Phifer, Green's brigade, including the 6th Missouri, made another charge, eventually driving the Union forces from their line. Despite having a clear path to attack the Union interior line, the Confederate advance was halted by Price due to fatigue and disorganization in the Confederate ranks. On October 4, Green was promoted to division command due to H√©bert falling ill. Command of Green's brigade then fell to Colonel William H. Moore. Moore's brigade made a charge against the Union interior line. After driving in Union skirmishers, the Confederates came under heavy fire from a fortification known as Battery Powell. A sergeant of the 6th Missouri described the charge by stating that \\"great gaps were thrown in their ranks [...] every instant death smote.\\" Moore's brigade broke through the Union lines and began driving into the town of Corinth itself. Moore's brigade would be reinforced by elements of Phifer's and Brigadier General John C. Moore's brigades, but a Union counterattack drove the Confederates out of Corinth, ending the threat. The 6th Missouri suffered 223 casualties at Corinth, including Lieutenant Colonel Hedgpeth, who was severely wounded, and Major Vaughn, who was killed. After escaping a Union trap at the Battle of Davis Bridge on October 5, the 6th Missouri was assigned to the First Missouri Brigade on October 22. =1863= Battle of Champion Hill In early 1863, the 6th Missouri was transferred to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, where the regiment help construct fortifications. The regiment was present at the Battle of Grand Gulf on April 29. Along with many of the other men of the First Missouri Brigade, the 6th Missouri was shifted to Port Gibson, Mississippi on May 1 to counter a Union landing. At the Battle of Port Gibson, which took place on May 1, the 6th Missouri was used to support the right wing of the Confederate line. When Union troops threatened to cut off the Confederate route of retreat, the 6th Missouri counterattacked. The charge drove deep into the Union line, but was forced to retreat some distance when it encountered Union reinforcements. The 6th Missouri became isolated from the rest of the Confederate force, began to run out of ammunition, and was forced to make a fighting retreat to rejoin the main Confederate force as it retreated. At the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, Company \\"E\\" of the 6th Missouri was detached with four companies from other regiments of the First Missouri Brigade to serve as a skirmishing unit. Later in the battle, the First Missouri Brigade was used to fill a breach in the Confederate line; the 6th Missouri was posted on the left of the brigade's line. The First Missouri Brigade eventually began a counterattack to stabilize the Confederate line. The Confederates drove the Union line back over a mile, although at the cost of heavy casualties. One soldier participating in the charge wrote that \\"the blood ran in a stream, as water would have done.\\" The charge of the Missourians broke through the Union line, capturing a crossroads and Champion Hill itself, both of which were strategic points on the field. However, Union reinforcements commanded by Brigadier General Marcellus M. Crocker arrived, and the Missourians withdrew after more fighting. On May 17, the 6th Missouri was part of a Confederate force tasked with holding the crossing of the Big Black River. In the ensuing Battle of Big Black River Bridge, the Confederate line was broken, and a rout for the river crossing ensued. The 6th Missouri did not receive clear withdrawal orders, and did not withdraw from the line until the regiment was almost surrounded. After the retreat across the Big Black River, the 6th Missouri entered the defenses of Vicksburg, and took part in the Siege of Vicksburg. On May 19, the 6th Missouri Infantry, along with the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated) and the 5th Missouri Infantry, were used to plug weak points in the Vicksburg defensive perimeter. On May 22, the 6th Missouri strengthened the Confederate line near a point known as the Stockade Redan, helping to repulse Union attacks. alt=Marker for the 6th Missouri Infantry at Marker for the 6th Missouri Infantry at Vicksburg National Military Park On June 25, a mine was detonated under a point of the Confederate line named the Third Louisiana Redan. The 6th Missouri was used to plug the gap created by the explosion. Sharp fighting followed as Union infantry attempted to exploit the new gap. However, the Confederate line, which contained the 6th Missouri, the 5th Missouri, and the survivors of the 3rd Louisiana Infantry held after much hand-to-hand fighting. Both sides used makeshift hand grenades in the fighting. Colonel Erwin was killed early in the action. On July 1, another mine was detonated under the position of Companies \\"B\\" and \\"H\\" of the 6th Missouri. Many of the men of the 6th Missouri were killed in the explosion. While Union artillery shelled the gap created by the explosion, a large-scale infantry assault did not occur. The 6th Missouri lost 56 men on July 1. On July 4, the Confederate defenders of Vicksburg surrendered, and the 216 survivors of the 6th Missouri were paroled. The men reported to Demopolis, Alabama, and were eventually exchanged. On October 6, the 6th Missouri Infantry was combined with the 2nd Missouri Infantry to form the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated); the 6th Missouri ceased to exist as a separate unit. Legacy The men of the 6th Missouri formed Companies \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", and \\"H\\" of the 2nd and 6th Missouri (Consolidated); Companies \\"A\\", \\"E\\", \\"F\\", \\"G\\", \\"I\\", and \\"K\\" were composed of men from the 2nd Missouri. Colonel Peter C. Flournoy of the 2nd Missouri commanded the new regiment. The consolidated regiment saw extensive action in the Atlanta campaign in 1864, including fighting at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27. On October 5, the regiment fought at the Battle of Allatoona. The consolidated regiment suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Franklin on November 30; it missed the Battle of Nashville in mid-December. On April 9, 1865, the regiment surrendered at the Battle of Fort Blakely.

During this period, the Yu became a prominent clan in the prefecture of Xin An (Êñ∞ÂÆâÈÉ°), Luoyang. Because of the war in the north at that time, they moved to the south, to places like Hunan and Hubei. After the Han Dynasty, the surname became quite well-spread in the southern China, less so in northern China. Many of the Yu moved into counties like Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Jiangxi in southern China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. After the Tang Dynasty the surname became widespread and very well known in the southeast area of China. At this point they moved into other places like Fujian and Guangdong.

Early life and education Helen Grimshaw was born in Hanover Square, London, but grew up in Surrey. Grimshaw was the daughter of a civil engineer and educated at the Francis Holland School. She attended the University of London in 1924 where she studied civil engineering graduating in 1930 with a BSc (Special) Engineering. She was the first woman to apply to and join the Institution of Civil Engineers as a student on 13 January 1925 and became an associate member the following year. Grimshaw graduated from University College London in 1930 with a BSc (Special) Engineering and returned for another year to get practical training in the engineering workshops. She completed her PhD there in 1936, under Professor Ernest Coker. Career Grimshaw spent her career working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Farnborough. She joined them in 1937 in the instrumentation department working on de-icing equipment, oxygen equipment, pressure suits and the flight testing of instruments and other safety equipment. She worked on the team to achieve the world altitude record with Flight Lieutenant M.J. Adam in the Bristol Type 138. Grimshaw took over the flight test programme in 1941.

Grabowski Foundation has endowed Polish Migration and Polish Cultural History studies at University College London, and the Universities of Stirling, Cambridge and at Trinity College, Oxford. He donated his pharmaceutical and art collections to several museums in Poland. Life Mateusz Grabowski was one of three children born to Wojciech and Marianna Grabowski in Wizna near ≈Åom≈ºa in the Podlasie Governorate, Congress Poland. As a young man he was involved in the Polish Scouting movement. He graduated as a Master of Pharmacy at Stefan Batory University in Wilno. His first post was alongside his pharmacist uncle in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. In 1930 he moved to Warsaw where he married, had two sons and rose to the role of government inspector of pharmacies. With the probability of war increasing in the late 1930s he joined the army reserve and became a member of the Polish Army Medical Corps. He subsequently organised the pharmacy services of the army.Dymarczyk I.

During World War II, he escaped from Poland and sought refuge first in France and after its fall in 1940, in the United Kingdom. His family were left behind in Warsaw where his older son, Wojciech, ps \\"oko\\", participated in the Warsaw Uprising. Although they survived the war, his wife died in the aftermath. Grabowski was able to bring out his two young sons to join him in London. After the war in London he set up a small network of pharmacies in Earl's Court and Chelsea and started one of the first mail order chemists in England. He specialised in sending pharmaceutical products to war-ravaged Poland. In 1959 he opened the Grabowski Gallery next to his chemist shop in Sloane Avenue, Chelsea. The gallery specialised in promoting young and diaspora artists, among whom were Pauline Boty, David Hockney and Bridget Riley. It was a non-commercial venture. Rather it was an expression of his passion for art. The gallery held its final show in 1975 before closing. Grabowski's younger son, Andrzej, an artist, predeceased him in 1969. His other son, Wojciech, also a pharmacist, took over the family business after Grabowski died in London in 1976. Grabowski was buried at North Sheen Cemetery, London.

Leading the Second Regiment of the Middlesex militia, he and his force of 150 militiamen (reinforced in part with help from General Israel Putnam and 50 Pennsylvanian riflemen), used intelligence from a defector to attack a Loyalist regiment of the New Jersey Volunteers led by Major Richard Witham Stockton, a first cousin of Declaration signer Richard Stockton. With only losing a militiaman, Neilsen's forces successfully captured Major Stockton along with Captain Asher Dunham, Lieutenant Fraser, and 62 Loyalists.

A stonecutter by profession, Lekoviƒá was declared the first national hero of Yugoslavia. As a soldier of the Serbian Army, he participated in the First World War, during 1914 and 1915. He distinguished himself as a brave and capable fighter, but due to his wounds, he was captured in the fall of 1915 in the vicinity of Peƒá. He spent the rest of the war in Hungarian captivity near Budapest. After the end of the war, he returned to his hometown and learned the stone-cutting craft, and soon after he got married and moved to the village of Recice near Po≈æega. In search of work, he visited many places, mostly in western Serbia. In the years after the war he became a sympathizer of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and because of his expressed righteousness and solidarity, he often came into conflict with employers, but also with the government. After 1938, he renewed his contacts with the then illegal Communist Party and took part in some of its actions. Following the occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941, Lekoviƒá joined the U≈æice partisan detachment with his three sons and took part in insurgent actions. After the First Enemy Offensive and the withdrawal of partisan forces from Serbia, in March 1942 he joined the Second Proletarian Strike Brigade, in which he was appointed Deputy Commander of the First U≈æice Battalion. In the battles, he distinguished himself with heroic deeds. By the decision of the Supreme Headquarters at the end of March 1942, he was proclaimed the first national hero of Yugoslavia. He died in June 1942 in battles with Italians and Chetniks, on the mountain Zivnju, near Gacko. In the last battle, Lekoviƒá protected the retreat of his battalion, which was left without ammunition. He rolled big rocks at the advancing enemies when he was shot. A school in Po≈æega is named after him.  Biography  He was born on November 23, 1893, in the village of Svraƒçkovo, near U≈æiƒçka Po≈æega, where his birthplace is today. He came from a poor peasant family. His father Milinko, in addition to Peter, had three other sons and a daughter. He finished primary school in his native village. Since the family had a hard time supporting themselves, Petar started working from the earliest childhood, as a boy. At first, he was engaged in various physical jobs, mainly related to farming, and as a young man, he began to learn the stone-cutting craft. He was interrupted in his learning by the call-up for military service in 1914, as well as the beginning of the Great War. = World War 1 = The beginning of the World War 1, in July 1914, found him serving his military service in Kragujevac. After the outbreak of the war, he was assigned to the First Company of the Second Battalion of the Fifth Infantry Regiment of the Drina Division. With this unit, he took part in the battles on the Cer and Drina, during the summer and early autumn of 1914. Lekoviƒá distinguished himself in these battles with his courage, and he also captured several enemy soldiers. After the Battle of Kolubara and the victorious offensive of the Serbian army, he broke out with his unit on the Sava, near Obrenovac. Then a great epidemic of typhus began, so Petar fell ill with typhus. After recovering, he returned home briefly, but soon returned to his unit. In October 1915, when the great enemy invasion of the Kingdom of Serbia began, Petar took part in the first battles on the Sava. After withdrawing from the initial positions, together with several soldiers, near the village of Grabovac, near Obrenovac, he protected the withdrawal of his unit. He was then wounded in the leg. After stationing his unit in Kragujevac, he refused to go to the hospital and remained in the unit at his own request. He then took part in the battles near Kraljevo and Ra≈°ka, and then in Kosovo and near Peƒá. Since he had problems with the wound, which could not heal in any way, he was transferred to the rear. Due to the sudden German attack, his unit had to withdraw, so he was captured along with other exhausted soldiers from the background. Together with the other prisoners, he was taken first to Ra≈°ka, and then to Kragujevac. From there, they were taken by train to a prison camp in Hungary, not far from Budapest. The living conditions in this camp were extremely difficult, and the food was especially poor. Due to the bad conditions, the prisoners protested, and during the protest, Petar was at the head of a group and in the delegation for negotiations with the camp administration. In order to improve the food of the detainees, the camp administration then decided to send the prisoners to work on the surrounding properties. Peter was assigned to a certain Janos, whom he helped with field jobs. From the boss, when he worked, he received news about the October Revolution in Russia and the bad situation on the Austro-Hungarian fronts. Encouraged by this news, Peter decided to flee, but after a few days, he was captured and returned to the camp. After the signing of the armistice in November 1918, all prisoners of war left the camp near Budapest and came to Belgrade, from where they returned to their homes. Shortly after arriving in his native village, Petar was called to the unit to which he belonged before his capture. In Zagreb, he reported to the command of the Fifth Infantry Regiment, where he had to describe in detail how he was captured and how long he was in captivity. After the check, he was sent to Jelenje, near Rijeka, where his unit was located. Arriving at the unit, Petar did not find many of his war comrades from 1914 and 1915, because many were killed during the crossing of Albania and on the Salonika front. Due to exhaustion, Peter's health deteriorated sharply after returning to the unit, and he was soon discharged from the army.

It is affiliated with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and is a member of the UChicago health system, the only children's hospital in the system. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21 throughout Chicago and features an ACS verified level I pediatric trauma center. Its regional pediatric intensive- care unit and neonatal intensive care units serve the Chicago region.  History  Pediatrics at the University of Chicago dated back to 1927 when the university opened up the Home for Destitute and Crippled Children. In 1938 the University combined their pediatric and maternity hospitals into one facility. In 1967, the University of Chicago Medicine‚Äôs Wyler Children's Hospital opened in a wing of the adult hospital. The hospital had a capacity of 140 beds and 95,000 square feet. Wyler was located one block south of the new Comer Children's Hospital. The hospital began construction in 2001 and was funded in part from a $21 million donation by Gary and Frances Comer. The plan included 240,000 square feet and 7 floors. The new design included features requested by the patients and families from included larger windows and expanded parent sleeping areas and was designed by Atlanta based Stanley Beaman & Sears. In total, Comer was built at a cost of $68 million. In August 2010, protests erupted outside of the hospital over the death of Damian Turner, an 18-year- old who was killed by gunshot. At the time the only trauma center on campus was Comer Children's, treating trauma patients up to age 15. Hospital administrators committed to building a new adult trauma center and expanded the age limit for Comer's trauma center to age 18. In 2010 a lawsuit was filed against Comer Children's for treating more babies in their neonatal intensive care unit than they were licensed to. They were fined $5 million as a result of the lawsuit. In 2013 members of the Stephen family donated $10 million to the NICU for expansion. It was renamed to the Margaret M. and George A. Stephen Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to honor the donation. In 2019 the hospital announced a partnership with Advocate Children's Hospital and NorthShore University HealthSystem's pediatric division to help provide better pediatric care for children. The alliance is opening a joint 35,000-square- foot outpatient pediatric center in Wilmette. The alliance allows these smaller hospitals to compete with the nationally ranked Lurie Children's Hospital.

History and usage  Siemens BS11 BTS In 2008 Harald Welte and Dieter Spaar experimented with a base transceiver station from Siemens that was end-of-life and implemented the BSC side of the A-bis protocol, which eventually turned into OpenBSC. After attracting more interest, support for other BTS models was added. The first release of the OpenBSC project took place at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress held in December 2008. In the following years, the software has been used at various hacker cons such as the Chaos Communication Congress, Chaos Communication Camp and Electromagnetic Field to provide a cellular network. In 2010, a telephone- side implementation of the GSM stack was developed, named OsmocomBB. Together with OpenBSC, these projects became part of the new Osmocom umbrella project. The Sysmocom GmbH company was founded by Welte and Holger Freyther in 2011 to provide commercial support. Since 2018 Osmocom software and Sysmocom hardware has been used in Villa Talea de Castro in Mexico to provide a cellular network to around 3500 people. Osmocom software has been used in research projects.  Projects  OpenBSC = OpenBSC was a project to develop a free software implementation of GSM protocol stack and elements. It runs on Linux and requires an E1 interface (ISDN Primary Rate Interface, via mISDN). It is written in C and licensed using the GPL (‚â•v2) license. The first version implemented the GSM specification 21.12 and 08.5x, and worked for a specific Base Transceiver Station (Siemens BS11 MicroBTS). OpenBSC implemented several MSC components, including the A-bis protocol (the protocol between the BTS and the BSC), AUC, HLR, VLR (both using SQL tables), and a SMS Switching Center. OpenBSC can be accessed using telnet. OpenBSC supported the following BTS devices: * Siemens BS11 (microBTS) (E1 Primary Rate interface) * ip.access nano BTS (PoE-interface) OpenBSC is now considered legacy and the features have been split into different projects: OsmoBSC, OsmoMSC and OsmoHLR. = SDR = rtl-sdr was discovered by Steve Markgraf, who also created osmo-fl2k for radio transmissions. These projects deprecated the use of OsmoSDR. = OsmoTETRA = The OsmoTETRA project implements the TETRA protocol. Osmo-tetra implements the lower layer of the protocol. Some conducted research revealed that some government traffic is not properly secured. = OsmocomBB = OsmocomBB is a free firmware for the baseband processor of mobile phones which handles the encoding and radio communication of both voice and data. OsmocomBB is the only existing free implementation of baseband firmware, excluding failed projects like TSM30 from THC and MadOS. OsmocomBB implements the GSM protocol stack's three lowest OSI Layers of the client side GSM protocol and device drivers. The protocol layers forming the kernel exists on the baseband processor, typically consisting of an ARM processor and a digital signal processor.Motorola C139, a model compatible with OsmocomBB It has support for the Calypso chipset produced by Texas Instruments.Cooper, T. A. (2012). Integration of Open-Source GSM Networks (Doctoral dissertation, Virginia Tech). Karsten Nohl has extented OsmocomBB to be able to detect IMSI catchers.

Biography  Born in Tiberias in about 935, his father Saadia Gaon was a prominent figure, who was the Sura Gaon from 928‚Äì942. In a letter written in 928, his father mentions his older brother Sheerit, although he doesn't mention Dosa. This has led scholars to place Dosa's birth around 935, meaning that he was only a young boy when his father died in 942. In 953, Sheerit and Dosa compiled a list of their father's books. Ibn Daud states in Sefer ha-Qabbalah that Dosa wrote a biography about his father entitled \\"The Story of Rav Saadia and the Benefits He Did for Israel\\" which was written in an epistle to Hasdai ibn Shaprut. Some state that Samuel ben Hofni was the last Sura Gaon, although in his commentaries Judah al-Madari includes Dosa in a list of the Sura Gaons. Dosa is also mentioned in the glossary of The Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides, who states that Dosa was one of the scholars who combated the Greek conception of the eternity of the universe. Most scholars have identified Dosa as being identical with David ben Saadia, who wrote several Talmudic work in Arabic.Bezalel Ashkenazi, Shitah MekubezetBava Metzia 104b When Dosa was seventy-five, he became head of the Sura academy, following the death of Samuel ben Hofni in 1012. Only a few of Dosa's responsa's survived, and the ones that did, reflect the modern Halakic stance that defined his father. Notably, Dosa defends Hai Gaon against the criticism Samuel Ibn Naghrella brings forth regarding Hai Gaon's talmudic interpretations. A more unusual aspect of his life, Dosa had taken an auth in his teenage years to refrain from eating bread as an act of asceticism, which he apparently continued up until his death in 1018 in Baghdad.

He was the founder of the towns of San Sebasti√°n de La Gomera and Valverde. BiographyEarly life= Likely born in Seville at the end of the fourteenth century, he was the second son of Gonzalo P√©rez Martel, VI Lord of Almonaster, jury of the coalition of El Salvador, Major Collector of Seville and Procurator in the Court of Madrid in 1391. His Mother was Leonor Ruiz Peraza, daughter of Bartolom√© Ruiz Peraza, a Sevillian knight. His siblings were Alonso P√©rez Martel, first-born and VII Lord of Almonaster, and Leonor Martel, wife of Fern√°n Arias de Saavedra, the renown Lord of Castelar and warden of Ca√±ete la Real. By 1410 Peraza was engaged in the trade of olive oil from his olive groves in Valdeflores, where he was lord. He was also warden of the Castle of Matrera in 1420, Faithful Executor and a Knight veintiquatro of Seville.https://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/aea/id/1343 During the 1430s he would act in the Canary Islands on behalf of Guill√©n de las Casas and his father-in-law Juan, who owned the rights to them. http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/aea/id/1491 = Unification of the Lordship of the Canary Islands = Through his father, Gonzalo Martel, Hern√°n Peraza owned certain rights over the lordship of the islands, thanks to the grant by King Enrique III of Castile to Gonzalo in 1391 to conquer them. From his marriage to In√©s de las Casas, Peraza received the dominion of the island of Fuerteventura, granted as a dowry by his father-in-law Juan de las Casas, while he obtained the right to the rest of the islands in 1445 when he traded with Guill√©n de las Casas, a relative of his wife, his estate in Hu√©var in exchange for the rights that Guill√©n had over the lordship of the islands, both inherited from his father Alfonso - Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma and Gran Canaria - and acquired from the Count of Niebla Enrique de Guzm√°n in 1430 ‚Äî El Hierro and Lanzarote. This effectively unified control of most of the Canary Islands under Peraza. = Establishment on the islands = Peraza relocated to the islands in 1447 with his son Guill√©n and three ships, first taking possession of Fuerteventura, where they were well received. While Peraza organized the new government of Fuerteventura, he also organized several expeditions to the other islands in search of slaves and loot with which to pay for the conquest. A ship led by a relative and in which his son Guill√©n goes, makes an incursion in La Palma, where the natives defeat the conquerors and Guill√©n dies, while the other two ships, under the command of Biscayan captain Juan Mach√≠n, arrive to El Hierro and capture the daughter of the island king. The death of Guill√©n Peraza becomes a highly significant and impactful moment in the history of the Canary Islands politically and culturally. It sparks saddness and outrage among nobles in the Castillian mainland and drove his father Hern√°n to an increasingly brutal repression of the native people. It also inspired the first work of original Spanish literature to come from the Canary Islands, a dirge poem titled Endechas a la muerte de Guill√©n Peraza - Laments to the death of Guill√©n Peraza. His exact date of death was not recorded, however it can be dated between the second half of 1447 and the first quarter of 1448. His body was believed to be found during an excavation in 1980. Returning his army to Fuerteventura, Hern√°n Peraza embarked to take possession of his domain. They arrived in Gran Canaria, but they do not get to disembark due to a large number of hostile aborigines concentrated on the beaches of the bay of the Islets. = Reconquest of El Hierro = Although the island of El Hierro had been conquered by Jean de Bethencourt in 1404 or 1405, the instability of the dominion of the Canary Islands during the first half of the fifteenth century caused its relative abandonment by the conquistadors and the aboriginal Bimbaches to return to their native customs. Therefore, already in possession of the lordship, Peraza arrived on the island with his army in November 1448 with the intention of dominating it. With the intercession of the island princess captivated by Juan Mach√≠n, Peraza achieved the submission of the aboriginal king Osinisa. Once the island was dominated, Peraza founded the town of Valverde and left his relative Luis Gonz√°lez Martel de Tapia as governor, who married a daughter of the deposed Bimbache king. = Occupation of La Gomera and conflicts with the Portuguese = \\"Torre del Conde,\\" the tower constructed by Hern√°n Peraza The Elder in 1450. In January 1450 Peraza reached the edge of gomero de Orone, where he receives the submission of the native king. As a consequence of this peace, the sides of Hermigua or Mulagua and Agana, aligned to the Portuguese since 1423, rebelled against Peraza. For this reason, Peraza chooses to build a tower on the side of Ipalan where the best port on the island was located, building what is now known as La Torre del Conde - \\"The Tower of the Count.\\" Peraza faced several attacks by the Portuguese in 1450 and in 1452. = Entry into Tenerife = After dominating La Gomera, Peraza continued to make inroads into the islands without conquering. In an entry he made to Tenerife, he captured a Guanche boy who was fishing on the shore. Peraza took him as a servant, baptizing him with the name of Ant√≥n and who, years later, would return to the island and would be the one to instruct the Guanche people on the image of the Virgin of Candelaria.  Personal life  Peraza was married to In√©s de las Casas, daughter of Juan de las Casas, by 1424. The Count of Niebla had transferred ownership of the islands to him through her. Their son, Guill√©n Peraza, died in battle on La Palma. Therefore, the right of conquest of the Canary Islands passed to their daughter, In√©s Peraza. Hern√°n Peraza died in San Sebasti√°n de La Gomera in 1452.

It is located in Ann Arbor Township in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It was built by the Detroit Edison Company in 1919 for hydroelectricity before being decommissioned in 1959. The dam is currently owned by the nearby city of Ann Arbor. The surrounding area is used for recreational purposes, including Gallup Park, which is Ann Arbor's most popular recreational area. Description The Geddes Dam is located in southeastern Ann Arbor Township about from the eastern city limits of Ann Arbor. U.S. Route 23 crosses the river slightly west of the dam, which forms the eastern boundary of Ann Arbor's city limits at this point. The Geddes Dam is approximately from the Huron River mouth at Lake Erie. The nearest dams are the Argo Dam upstream and the Superior Dam downstream. When the dam was completed, the resulting flooding created a reservoir of . The reservoir has no official name but is sometimes referred to as the Geddes Pond or Geddes Impoundment. It sits at an elevation of above sea level and has an average depth of . The dam has a discharge capacity of 9,700 cubic feet per second (275 m3/s). The dam consists of two automated bays, each with two concrete spillways for a total dam length of and an entire crest length of . The dam is tall. The dam is one of four dams owned by the city of Ann Arbor. The other dams are the Argo Dam, Barton Dam, and Superior Dam. Only the Argo Dam and Barton Dam are actually within the city of Ann Arbor. Geddes Dam is within Ann Arbor Township, and Superior Dam is in neighboring Superior Township to the east. History Washtenaw County historic marker along the Geddes Dam reservoir The first hydroelectric facility was built along this stretch of the Huron River in 1884. Property along the Huron River was purchased by the Detroit Edison Company in 1905 for the purpose of building a hydroelectric dam. The dam was eventually built in 1919 as a series of hydroelectric dams built along the Huron River. The Geddes Dam was decommissioned in 1959 and no longer utilized for hydroelectric purposes. The dam was sold to the city of Ann Arbor in 1963. In 1968, the \\"heaviest storm in a generation\\" caused the Geddes Dam to fail, and increased water levels also severely damaged several downstream dams and caused considerable property damage. The dam was rebuilt in 1971‚Äì1972, in which new automated gates were installed to control the water level of the reservoir. The Detroit Edison Company once operated four hydroelectric dams that served Ann Arbor: Argo Dam, Barton Dam, Geddes Dam, and Superior Dam. At one time, they were all decommissioned in the late-1950s, but Barton Dam and Superior Dam were recommissioned in the 1980s and currently provide hydroelectricity for Ann Arbor's power grid. Geddes Dam and Argo Dam were left decommissioned, because higher cost estimates and lower energy production kept them from being recommended for recommissioning. In 2010, a plan was proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to recommission the Argo and Geddes Dam in order to provide additional electric power to the nearby Ann Arbor VA Medical Center. A study found it would cost up to $14.7 million to construct new hydroelectric stations at both decommissioned dams. The transmission lines themselves would cost another $1.3 million, with at least $220,000 per year for maintenance. Funding was denied by the Ann Arbor City Council to go ahead with the project, but the proposal of completely removing the Geddes Dam was also not in financial consideration. In 2013, the city approved a financial plan to improve the surrounded areas of both Argo Dam and Geddes Dam at a cost of $295,530 to a local contractor. The dams received these significant improvements in 2014. Activities Reservoir side of the Geddes Dam The Geddes Dam serves a recreational purposes for shore fishing in both the reservoir and the area immediately downstream along the Huron River. Common fish caught within this area include catfish (bullhead and channel), bluegill, small and largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike, and walleye. At one time, tiger muskellunge were stocked by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources at the Geddes Dam reservoir, but the population did not materialize and was not replinished. The Border-to-Border Trail, which runs for from Dexter Township to Ypsilanti Township, passes along the Geddes Dam and also provides public amenities. The area along the western edge of the reservoir is organized as Gallup Park, which is Ann Arbor's most popular recreation area. Gallup Park is located on both sides of the reservoir about upstream. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources maintains a small public boat launch at Gallup Park, which allows for access to the reservoir and Geddes Dam. Larger boats are restricted, as the reservoir is a no-wake zone, and canoes and kayaks that want to continue the path of the Huron River must portage over the dam. =Health concerns= The Huron River is occasionally issued a \\"Do Not Eat\\" fish advisory by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services when the waters accumulate high levels of cyanobacteria and perfluorooctanesulfonatecan (PFOS). When this bacteria is present, prolonged contact with the water is not advised, although occasional contact with PFOS is not considered a health concern. When the advisory is in place, fishermen are advised to catch and release only, and warning signs are posted at river access points. The advisory is often issued for long stretches of the Huron River that include the Geddes Dam portion of the river.

It measures . The large work was painted for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, and is now held by the Imperial War Museums. Nash served on the Western Front in the First World War, and became a war artist. He was engaged by the War Artists' Advisory Committee after the outbreak of the Second World War to paint for the Royal Air Force and the Air Ministry, but his works were not well received by either and his full-time engagement was ended in December 1940. Nonetheless, the Committee earmarked funds to buy further works from Nash, the first of which was Totes Meer, completed in March 1941, and the second was Battle of Britain. Two further works were completed under this arrangement, Defence of Albion (1942) and Battle of Germany (1944). In his own description of the painting, Nash says it is \\"an attempt to give the sense of an aerial battle in operation over a wide area and thus summarises England's great aerial victory over Germany\\". It is not based on a single incident, but rather is an abstracted attempt to symbolically depict the entire conflict between Britain and Nazi Germany, with free-flying British fighters battling ordered ranks of German aircraft. Nash included several landscape elements present throughout the Battle of Britain: white cumulus clouds above; below, a river meandering through yellowed fields and past a town to the coast; and in the distance, a view across the English Channel to occupied France. White vapour trails across the sky show the paths of dogfighting aircraft, amid dark smoke from several that have been damaged or crashed down in flames, while ranks of new Luftwaffe aircraft are approaching. Nash worked on the painting at his studio in Oxford. He based the sky on a 19th-century lithograph of a storm over Paris and the Seine, which his wife Margaret gave to his pupil, Richard Seddon. Seddon suggested Nash should include more dark trails of smoke in addition to the white vapour trails, adding one as an example which remains in Nash's finished work. Nash delivered the painting was delivered to the War Artists' Advisory Committee in October 1941, and it was exhibited at the National Gallery, London in January 1942. It is now held by the Imperial War Museums.

The claimants were 114 individuals, six of whom were considered lead plaintiffs and given close consideration by the judge, Mr Justice Burton. Several of the claimants were minors who had become infected with Hepatitis C in the course of their treatment for leukaemia. The defendants were the National Blood Authority (NBA) and in respect of Wales, the Velindre NHS Trust, Cardiff. Blood as a product This case demonstrated that blood for transfusion and organs for transplantation could be considered natural substances under Section 45 (1) of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and as such, blood infected with hepatitis C would count as a defective product. Burton J accepted that the hepatitis C‚Äìinfected blood bags were non‚Äìstandard products that would be at variance with the producer‚Ä≤s intended use. It was not accepted, however, that all blood products were likely to be considered similarly defective. The Defendants did not agree that blood was a non‚Äìstandard product and claimed that all blood, even though it was processed to a certain degree, carried an inherent risk‚Äîby virtue of being derived from a ‚Ä≥natural raw material‚Ä≥. Burton J was satisfied that the problem of infected blood was not known to the consumer, nor did the consumer expect the bag of blood they were being given to be defective. After taking into account all circumstances as per the Product Liability Directive 85/374/EEC, the blood which had been infected with hepatitis C on and after 1 March 1988 failed to provide the expected level of safety and as such, was deemed to be a defective product within the meaning of Article 6. Circumstances under Article 6 The court looked to the EU Product Liability Directive rather than the Consumer Protection Act 1987. The wording of Article 6 of the Directive states that when all circumstances are taken into account, and the product does not provide the safety that someone is entitled to expect, that product is rendered defective. The Defendant‚Ä≤s argued that the wording under Article 6 as to how ‚Ä≥all circumstances‚Ä≥ should be taken into account in establishing the level of safety, meant that the court had to consider what steps could reasonably have been expected of the producer, the National Blood Authority, in trying to avoid viral transmission. However, Burton J held that avoidability was not one of the circumstances that needed to be taken into account under Article 6. The circumstances under Article 6 which should be taken into account include: Under Article 6(2), if a newer version of a product was to come into circulation, it would not render the older version defective simply because there was a better version available. Significance The late Lord Morris of Manchester, then president of the UK Haemophilia Society, said that the case represented a ‚Ä≥landmark judgement‚Ä≥ that would be of considerable interest to several thousand others who had been infected with hepatitis C as a result of NHS‚Äìsupplied blood products. The ruling, which found in favour of the claimants, was significant in that it was the first of its kind where there was a finding of liability in medical circumstances under consumer law, without the need for a finding of fault, in particular, without needing to prove fault on the part of the National Blood Authority who had supplied the defective product. It was also the first group action under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. Government response In a House of Lords debate on 23 March 2001, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, in his r√¥le as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health at the Department of Health, said that careful consideration would have to be given to the implications of the judgment which he described as the first of its kind in relation to the NHS under the Consumer Protection Act. In the same debate, Lord Clement-Jones made the claim that officials of the Parliamentary Under‚ÄìSecretary of State at the Department of Health had been discretely warning journalists as to the possible implications of the judgment and that it had been reported in The Independent that the NHS could see claims in the region of hundreds of millions if similarly injured consumers were to follow the precedent of this case.

He is known for his single, \\"Do It Again,\\" which is often mistaken to be Soichi Terada's work, due to an incorrect credit on YouTube. Yokota has been described as \\"one of Japan's unsung heroes of house.\\"  Biography  Early life and career = Yokota comes from the ≈åta ward, growing up in Tokyo and its adjacent suburbs of Kanagawa and Chiba, and attended Chidori Elementary School in south Tokyo during the early 80's, where he played baseball. Yokota liked other activities, such as football and swimming, but also liked playing his father's electric organ. Yokota started listening to Yellow Magic Orchestra in elementary school, and quit baseball to take piano lessons across the street from his house. He studied for two years before using his otoshidama to buy a Casio MT-40 in Akihabara. After a couple of years, he bought a Korg Poly-800 and a cassette recorder. When computers started popping up when he was in middle school, he started recording tracks around 1982. In 1983, after YMO broke up, Yokota discovered hip hop through a midnight radio program, which led him to stop using synthesizers and make his own beats. He became a supporting member of Puzzle Jam Rockers and was involved in the production of early hip-hop albums such as Krush Posse and East End while doing track making and turntablism. = Introduction to house music = In 1987, Yokota met fellow producer Soichi Terada when participating in a Vestax DJ Contest, where Yokota won a prize. Terada introduced him to house music and synthesizers, even letting him in his house to watch him perform and have Yokota use his gear during his free time. He began making house music, but said that it was difficult to find others like him since the dominant style of electronic music in Tokyo was Hi-NRG and eurobeat. He formed the label Far East Recording with Terada in 1990. He and Terada would put out their first album called Far East Recording in 1992. = Absence from music = Yokota has stated that he lost his motivation to create music due to the influx of new technology. He stated, ‚ÄúIn the past, sampling time was limited so you had to be really creative when you had an idea. But with hard disk recording the possibilities were endless, and around 2000 I lost my motivation to make music.‚Äù He focused more on his custom car parts company, Night-Pager, that he launched in 1992. Also during this time, he raised his three children. In 1999, Yokota and Terada played at Club Citta for a memorial event for Roger Troutman, playing \\"Computer Love.\\" The event would be their last live before going on hiatus. In 2011, another company he created that sold camera parts went bankrupt, but managed to restart his company as a producer of custom-made car parts. = Resurgence = In early 2013, a YouTube channel called UtopiaSpb uploaded a rip of \\"Do It Again,\\" but incorrectly credited the song to Terada. While their other rips range from 1 thousand views to 9.8 thousand views, \\"Do It Again\\" garnered more than 2 million views as of June 2020. Multiple users, including Terada himself, pointed out the inaccuracy, but the channel has been inactive since the upload of the song. In May 2016, he appeared in Boiler Room playing a live set. In November of that same year, he released his second album, Do It Again And Again, which includes unreleased songs produced in the late 80's and early 90's. In September 2019, he released his third album, I Know You Like It, and in October, released Ultimate Yokota 1991-2019. In March 2020, he participated in the music festival Snow Machine alongside Terada, Chida, Kuniyuki Takahashi, FEMM, Mayurashka, Gonno and Kikiorix.  Albums  Do It Again and Again = Do It Again and Again was released on November 30, 2016. The album had a release party at Circus Tokyo on February 25. The album is Yokota's first full-length solo album, with Stefan Betke mastering the album. Yokota described it as \\"a compilation of my whole life producing\\" so that he could \\"relive 27 years of significant memories.\\" = I Know You Like It = I Know You Like It was released on September 25, 2019, three years after Do It Again and Again. The album includes covers of Yokota's previous songs \\"Night Drive\\" and \\"Shake Yours\\" and a cover of the song \\"Simoon\\" by Yellow Magic Orchestra. The album received generally positive reviews. The Tape Deck rated it a yellow, saying that his \\"melange of thin high-frequency synths and rhythm fills, comes through clearly on I Know You Like It, a cheekily-titled release that will hopefully see him find a greater American audience.\\" Yellow means that it had high points in aesthetics and originality, but low points in intellect. This also means that it \\"stands out in both emotional evocation and in uniqueness.\\" At Finding Figaro, the author explains, \\"It‚Äôs an incredibly consistent album cover-to-cover and, to my ears, already feels like a timeless classic, definitely one of the releases of 2019.\\" = Ultimate Yokota 1991-2019 = Ultimate Yokota 1991-2019 was released in October 2019. All songs included in the album were previously unavailable in vinyl form. Yokota said about the compilation: \\"This project ‚ÄòUltimate Yokota‚Äô is a careful selection of tracks from the early 90‚Äôs which haven‚Äôt been released on vinyl ever. It is my 30 years chronicle.\\" The album includes six songs from Do It Again and Again and six songs from I Know You Like It. Chal Ravens of Resident Advisor said, \\"His ear for melody and a snappy sample provides endless variety, but the basic recipe tends to combine the bossy, velvet-lined grooves of classic New York house with a certain Japanese accent‚Äîplayful earworms and plasticky organs straight from an arcade game, or notes of laidback electro- boogie that make you want to start your engine and cruise through the neon-lit bustle of south Tokyo.\\"  Artistry  Influences = Yokota has said that Haruomi Hosono of the Yellow Magic Orchestra is one of his major influences, stating the he listened to YMO and Ryuichi Sakamoto when he was 10 years old. From 1985 to 1995, he listened to hip hop artists from Sugar Hill Records, Def Jam Recordings and Tommy Boy Records, and \\"was hugely impressed by the stuff Lil Louis was doing.\\" = Musical style = Yokota's music focuses on electronic and house music, including downtempo, deep house, and tech house. His style is similar to collaborator Soichi Terada, as well as Galaxy 2 Galaxy, Ata Kak, Los Microwaves, and Larry Heard. Yokota prefers a simpler style of music where \\"it‚Äôs basically made up of beats and bass from the rhythm machine and vocals on top.\\"  Discography  Singles and EPs = *1991: \\"Twin Base Vol. 1\\" (with Soichi Terada) *1991: \\"Tokyo XXX\\" (with Terada) [BPM] *1991: \\"Got To Be Real\\" (with Terada) [Far East] *1991: \\"Let's Groove' (with Terada) [Far East] *2014: \\"The Far East Transcripts\\" (with Terada) [Hhatri] *2015: 'The Far East Transcripts II\\" (with Terada) [Hhatri] *2016: \\"The Far East Transcripts III\\" (with Terada) [Hhatri] *2018: \\"Tokyo Horoki Part 1' (with Pleasure Cruiser & Smoke Thief) [High Hoops] *2020: \\"Detectors\\" [Far East] *????: \\"Believe The House / Purpul Haze\\" [Far East] = Studio albums = *1992: Far East Recording (with Terada) [Far East] *2016: Do It Again And Again [Far East] *2019: I Know You Like It [Far East] = Compilations = *2019: Sound Of Vast - 5 Years Anniversary Series 02 (with The Mole) [Sound Of Vast] *2019: Ultimate Yokota 1991-2019 [Sound Of Vast] = Appearances = *2015: Soichi Terada - Sounds from the Far East [Rush Hour]  References  External links  Official Facebook and personal Facebook Shinichiro Yokota on SoundCloud Category:Living people Category:Japanese electronic musicians Category:20th-century Japanese musicians Category:1969 births Category:Musicians from Tokyo Category:Japanese house musicians Category:21st-century Japanese musicians ","title":"Shinichiro Yokota"},{"id":"64068899","text":"Ostermundigen railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Ostermundigen, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

Biography  He began his artistic studies in his hometown, with the portrait and history painter, Moreno Carbonero. Later, he moved to Seville, where he studied law. In 1882, he went to Paris, having decided to devote himself entirely to painting, and studied with L√©on Bonnat at the √âcole des Beaux Arts. After his stay in Paris, he travelled to Rome, where he remained until 1891, when he settled permanently in Seville. In 1902, he was named an Academician at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Santa Isabel de Hungr√≠a. The following year, he succeeded his father, Andr√©s Parlad√© y S√°nchez de Quir√≥s, as Count of Aguiar. In 1909, he was appointed Senator for the Province of Seville. With a recommendation from the Academia, he was placed in charge of the excavations being carried out at the archaeological site in the ancient Roman city of Italica, near Santiponce, in 1919. This would be his primary occupation until his death. His paintings may be divided into two very distinct stages. In his first stage, which lasted through the end of the 19th-century, he followed in the steps of his teacher, Carbonero, and focused on painting historical scenes. In his second stage, begun around the turn of the century, he switched to a modified costumbrista style, originally focused on bullfighting and notable for his attention to detail. Later, he turned to peasant scenes and animals; primarily dogs and horses. Many of his animal scenes involve hunting; a sport that he himself was fond of. He participated in numerous exhibitions outside of Spain; including London (1888), Berlin (1890), Par√≠s (1899) and San Francisco (1915). His works may be seen at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla, among several others.

It was written in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. The report connects Catholic ideals to abolitionist ideals in order to defend the human rights of African Americans.  Resolution  Manhattanville College hosted a multitude of students and faculty interested in the civil rights aspects of the Catholic Church. The resolution is a series of eight written by students in 1933. The students at Manhattanville College were inspired by a man named George Hunton, the editor for the Interacial Review, a journal that focused on the Catholic opinion of interracialism. During the 1930s, the effects of the Great Depression increased rapidly, especially for poor communities such as African American ones. The Manhattanville students wrote the 8 resolutions because of the racial violence, discrimination, and other injustices African Americans face. The Great Depression was polarizing whites and African Americans because white people did not want colored people taking their jobs. ‚ÄúRacial violence again became much more common‚Äù with lynchings especially. The Manhattanville students were motivated by Hunton's speech that they worked to pass the 8 resolutions to advocate for interracialism. The president of the college at the time, Grace Dammann-RSCJ, supported the interracialism of Manhattanville College. Dammann was an advocate for racial justice along with her students. The Manhattanville students were inspired by activists such as George Hunton to express the Catholic principles related to interracialism. Many incidents involving legal charges against African Americans were being decided in court. Unjust violence and discrimination drove people similar to the Manhattanville students to promote a greater life for African Americans.  Message of Resolution  The Manhattan Resolutions were adopted by college students to combat racial injustice. There are a total of 8 resolutions that are declared in the resolution. The first resolution declared that ‚Äúthe negro as a human being and as a citizen is entitled to the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and to the essential opportunities of life and full the full measure of social justice.‚Äù The first resolution alludes to the constitution by using the phrase ‚Äúright of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.‚Äù The second resolution is ‚Äúto be courteous and kind to every colored person, remembering the heavy yoke of injustice and discrimination he is bearing. To remember that no race or group in America had endured that many handicaps that are his to-day.‚Äù The second resolution focuses on having others sympathize and be kind. The third resolution states, ‚Äúto say a kind word for him on every proper occasion.‚Äù This resolution is followed by the fourth resolution which is, ‚Äúnot to speak slightingly or use nicknames which tend to humiliate, off end or discourage him.‚Äù These two resolutions were written to help others remember to be compassionate and to go out of their way to be gracious. Resolutions 5 and 6 are the resolutions that directly correlate with the catholic church. Number five states, ‚Äúto remember that the catholic church and the catholic program of social justice has been the ‚Äúgreatest hope of the colored race.‚Äù Followed by number 6 which states, ‚Äúto recognize that the negro shares my membership in the mystical body of Christ and the privileges that flow there from and conduct myself in accordance therewith.‚Äù These two resolutions show the responsibility that the Catholic Church took on to help stop racial injustice. The seventh resolution states, ‚Äúto give liberally on the Sundays of the year when the collections are devoted to the heroic missionaries laboring among the Negro group.‚Äù The seventh resolution refers to the collection of money at church which will be used to help fight against racial injustice. The last resolution states, ‚Äúto become increasingly interested in the welfare of the negro; to engage actively in some form of catholic action looking to the betterment of his condition, spiritually and materially.‚Äù This means that the Catholic Church wants others to also get involved and perform the actions of the resolution to stop racial injustice for African Americans.  A Committee of Catholic College Graduates and Undergraduates  The Manhattanville Resolutions were put together by ‚ÄúA Committee of Catholic College Graduates and Undergraduates‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Interracial Committee of the Brooklyn Catholic Action Council‚Äù, and the Forward was written by Francis S. Mosely. * ‚ÄúThe following committee is an independent group and not affiliated with any single college or university‚Äù ** Thomas J. Masterson (chairman) ** Alfred A. Cooper ** Joseph G. Cox ** Wm. Fitzgerald ** Mary Gallagher ** Raymond J. Goetz ** Rita L. Honerkamp ** Marjorie McLinden ** Francis J. Lovelock ** Edgar A. Martin ** Eileen O‚ÄôMahoney ** Agnes Toner **James J. Walsh  Impact  The Manhattanville Resolution became the ‚Äúbasis for a Catholic interracial program at Catholic colleges.‚Äù The resolution began a series of events leading to educational interracialism. The interracialism program for Catholic colleges around the country met many times after the resolution had been published to discuss further actions to take to desegregate schools. The Catholic colleges discussed these proposals at the many Catholic Interracial Conferences in starting in 1935. The Manhattanville Resolution initiated the public discussion between Catholic colleges about interracialism. This impacted the civil rights movement as a whole because particular religious support for education amongst other things bolstered the argument that African Americans are deprived of basic human rights.

The adobe house he built in what is now the city of Napa, California still stands, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Juarez was born a Spanish subject at the Presidio of Monterey, California on February 24, 1809. Mexico, including California, became independent from Spain in 1821. Military service Juarez enlisted in the Mexican Army on April 1, 1827 at age 18, and on August 14 of that year, he was dispatched to assist with control of the Indians in the Sonoma and Napa areas, the very northern frontier of Mexican control of California. On February 19, 1829, Indians attacked Mission San Rafael Arc√°ngel in what is now Marin County, California, forcing the priest to go into hiding in the marshes along San Francisco Bay. Juarez led a squad of soldiers who pursued the Indians to a rancher√≠a near present-day Sebastopol, California. There, he suffered a minor arrow wound. His multi-layered buckskin coat absorbed much of the impact of the arrowhead and protected him from a more serious injury. He was discharged from the Mexican Army at the Presidio of San Francisco on February 19, 1836. Marriage and children Juarez married Maria de Jesus Higuerra (born San Francisco, December 4, 1815) on February 14, 1835. They had 11 children, seven of whom lived to adulthood. Ranching He spent the winter of 1837-1838 establishing herds of horses and cattle in the Napa Valley while living for safety with his family close to Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, California. In his years of military service and public life in Sonoma, he established a close relationship with General Mariano Vallejo, the most powerful man of that community. In December, 1837, he assisted Vallejo by helping to quell a mutiny of 24 Indian soldiers serving in the Mexican Army. He chased the deserters and helped convince them to end their rebellion. Juarez moved his family to the Napa Valley in 1840, building a small adobe home. On October 6, 1840, Mariano Vallejo gave him a Mexican land grant, Rancho Tulucay, consisting of east of the Napa River. In 1844, he was elected alcalde of the district of Sonoma. The Cayetano Juarez Adobe in 2020 In 1845, he built a larger adobe home that still stands and is the oldest building in the city of Napa. That building, fully restored and functioning as a restaurant in 2020, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Juarez and his wife were well known for hosting rodeos and fiestas. Also in 1845, Governor P√≠o Pico awarded Juarez a second land grant, called Rancho Yokaya, consisting of in what is now Mendocino County, California. The present day city of Ukiah, California is located there. Bear Flag Revolt and U.S. statehood During the brief Bear Flag Revolt against Mexican rule over California, which began in Sonoma on June 14, 1846, he acted as an intermediary between local Mexican government officials and the mostly American rebels. Mariano Vallejo had been taken hostage by the rebels and was eventually held at Sutter's Fort in Sacramento. Juarez tried to obtain his release and took steps to ensure Vallejo's safety. When two American prisoners of the Mexican forces were threatened with execution, Juarez traveled to Rancho Cotate and intervened to prevent the killings. By July, the United States government was in control, and Mexican rule in California came to a swift end. In August, 1848, U.S. Colonel John C. Fr√©mont and 150 members of his California Battalion, rode through Rancho Tulucay, foraging as they traveled. Some of Fr√©mont's men stole horses, saddles and cattle belonging to Juarez. He appealed directly to Fr√©mont, and his saddles were returned. Later years In 1859, Juarez donated of land to the City of Napa to establish the Tulocay Cemetery. On August 2, 1882, Juarez sold of his Rancho Tulucay land to the state of California for $11,506.00 for the purpose of constructing an insane asylum. Napa State Hospital is now located on that site. Juarez died on December 16, 1883 and is buried alongside his wife at Tulocay Cemetery. Legacy A document published by the National Trust for Historic Preservation called Juarez \\"one of California's most influential Rancho Era pioneers\\", going on to conclude, \\"During the 1830s Cayetano waged many successful campaigns out of the Presidio of San Francisco and after his honorable discharge in 1836, Cayetano Juarez successfully transitioned from a loyal Mexican citizen and a soldier in the Mexican Army under General Vallejo and Lieutenant Martinez to a valuable mediator between the Americans, Spaniards and Indians.\\" Juarez's descendants raised cattle in the Napa Valley for generations until well into the 21st century.

A minor character in the 2012 series, Shimotsuki's role has gained importance in the sequels, in which she becomes an inspector working in Unit One, an organization fighting crimes in a future where people live according to the will of the Sybl System. She has returned in following media, most notably as a protagonist in the first film of the Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System trilogy. By Psycho-Pass 3, Shimotsuki has become the leader of Unit One, looking after the new cast. She is voiced by Ayane Sakura in Japanese, and Cherami Leigh in English. Shimotsuki was created by writers Tow Ubukata and Gen Urobuchi in Psycho-Pass 2, as a supporting character contrasting with Nobuchika Ginoza. Shimotsuki was intended to be less likable, based on her actions in the storyline. The staff then developed her as a more appealing character for the next series. Initial critical responses to Shimotsuki were mostly negative, because of her actions against heroine Akane Tsunemori and her rude behaviour. In following works in the franchise, reaction to her has been mostly favorable. Appearances The character first appears in season 1, episode 6, attending Oso Academy as a high school student and schoolmate of Rikako Oryo. Two of her friends become Rikako's victims during the story arc. At the end of season 1, Mika Shimotsuki becomes a MWPSB inspector, in the same team as Akane Tsunemori. In Psycho-Pass, Shimotsuki learns that one of her allies is scheming against Tsunemori. When Shimotsuki is discovered, she is forced to cooperate with the schemer, and with the Sybil System. Now knowing that the Sybil is a collective consciousness, Shimotsuki finds herself turning into a Sybil puppet. Shimotsuki returns in the 2015 series, where she and the chief of the group trick Tsunemori into going to another country to deal with Tsunemori's former underling, the mercenary Shinya Kogami, and use the duo's teamwork to overcome them. In the climax, Shimotsuki and Unit One save Kogami and Tsunemori from armed soldiers. Studio: Production I.G. Shimotsuki returns in the 2019 film Sinners of the System. Akane Tsunemori's team is directed to return a woman to a special experimental prison, where the woman had worked as a therapist. Tsunemori dispatches fellow inspector Mika Shimotsuki, along with two Enforcers, Nobuchika Ginoza and Yayoi Kunizuka, to investigate the prison, while Tsunemori and the rest of the team investigate the case in Tokyo. Through a new combination of drugs, therapy, and work, the prison has produced a different kind of society, where latent criminal prisoners act in harmony with one another. Shimotsuki sees the woman as a criminal deserving of death, but she and Ginoza then realize that the woman has used herself as bait to try to protect a small child. The duo discovers that the warden is exploiting the prisoners to harvest nuclear waste buried beneath the prison, causing the prisoners to die of radiation. Shimotsuki records the warden's confession of her actions and reveals it to the prisoners. Shimotsuki then kills the warden, but the prisoners riot. Shimotsuki and Ginoza hunt down the rest of the complicit staff, and begin working to protect the prisoners. They later discover that the Sybil System knew of the warden's actions, as the prison is located above the System's former nuclear waste dumping ground. Studio: Production I.G. Shimotsuki returns as the chief of Unit 1 in Psycho-Pass 3, where she directs Arata Shinto and Kei Ignatov, along with multiple forces. The group clashes with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs team, who are dealing with two groups known as the Foxes and Biforst. In the 2020 film Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector, Shimotsuki's group is trapped inside a building by a terrorist who wants to kill the Tokyo governor, Karina Komiya. Unwilling to hand over Komiya, Shimotsuki and her team fight to defeat the terrorists. Studio: Production I.G. Creation and development As a new character, working as an Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki was given newcomer traits. During development, director Naoyoshi Shiotani was not able to explain the ways in which these traits differed from Akane Tsunemori's, because the series was still premiering. The staff described Shimotsuki's role as \\"extremely difficult\\". The staff were said to love Shimotsuki for the same reason that fans disliked her. Staff reported that, while Nobuchika Ginoza was used as an unlikable inspector in the first series, often the staff and the audience could not bring themselves to hate him. Given that reaction, they made Shimotsuki a less likable character. The staff decided to create the impression that Shimotsuki undergoes a major change in the second series, and then have her start from that point in the 2015 movie. Tow Ubukata claimed he ended up liking Shimotsuki to the point of joking he would marry her. Gen Urobuchi agreed that Shimotsuki's characterization changed for the movie so that she became a likable character. Ubukata described her as a bureaucrat. Because Shimotsuki's character arc with regard to the Sybil System was so different from Tsunemori's, with Shimotsuki devoted to the Sybil and Tsunemori rejecting them, Ubukata called the two an unlikely duo. During the making of Psycho-Pass 2, Ubukata and Shiotani decided on a color code for the new character lineup centering on Akane Tsunemori and the Sibyl System. \\"White\\" was Shimotsuki, and \\"black\\" was Tougane, with Kamui as \\"clear\\". Ayane Sakura took a liking to the role of Mika Shimotsuki in Sinners of the System For the first Sinners of the System film, Shiotani chose Nobuchika Ginoza and Mika Shimotsuki as the main characters because of their similarities to the protagonists of the first television series, Shinya Kogami and Akane Tsunemori respectively. But he noted that the new duo employed a different dynamic from Kogami and Akane, pointing out Ginoza's notable character arc across the previous projects related to Psycho-Pass, due mainly to his relationship with Masaoka and Kogami. =Voice actress= Voice actress Ayane Sakura believed Shimotsuki became more suited to the role of heroine as a result of her experience in the second television series, where she was the youngest main character. Once the first film premiered, Shiotani said of the trilogy that it would \\"broaden [the audience's] perspective. They're those kinds of movies\\". Regarding Shimotsuki's characterization, Sakura considered that Shimotsuki was still the same high school student from the original 2012 series, which explained her ongoing bad attitude. Sakura also noted Shimotsuki's informal treatment of Tsunemori. But on reading the script for Sinners of the System, Sakura found Shimotsuki's behavior gentler, and felt that this reflected her greater maturity. Fellow voice actor Kenji Nojima (Ginoza) responded similarly to Sakura's role, noting that Shimotsuki's traits were more upbeat than in Psycho-Pass 2. After recording the film, Sakura described the trilogy and Shimotsuki's character arc as amazing. Sakura was surprised by the way her character was handled, and how Ginoza started looking after her based on his own arc. Of her role in Psycho-Pass 3, Sakura noted that Shimotsuki would do anything for the sake of justice, even if she faces criticism as a result. Cherami Leigh voices Mika Shimotsuki in English. Reception Since Mika Shimotsuki's debut in Psycho-Pass 2, critical response to the character has been mixed. In the sequel, Anime News Network found her to be different from her original Psycho-Pass traits, citing her mistreatment of Enforcers such as Nobuchika Ginoza, and also speculated that the character might have a crush on Yayoi Kunizuka, as Shimotsuki tends to favor her instead. Kotaku enjoyed how different Shimotsuki's characterization was from Tsunemori's, as the two characters act in opposite ways when learning of the nature of the Sybil System, and observed that Shimotsuki \\"is still able to force herself to follow a device completely made up of criminal minds‚Äîable to convince herself that it is a perfectly wonderful idea that makes total sense despite the obvious contradictions\\". Anime News Network panned Shimotsuki as an unlikable supporting character, saying that she remains the same regardless of undergoing major change of mind in the narrative. Otaku USA described Shimotsuki's actions in the 2015 movie as \\"blind arrogance\\". The Fandom Post regarded Shimotsuki as a \\"too divisive character to say the least\\", commenting on the way she is used by Togane to attack Tsunemori. It said that Shimotsuki was \\"a really unlikeable co-protagonist due to the fact whilst she has her own views, she always gets into trouble and never seems to accept that it is her fault\\", and drew negative parallels with Akane Tsunemori's arc from the original series, saying that while Tsunemori often has detractors, she still manages to become more appealing due to her screentime. UK Anime Network said that, while Shimotsuki did not come across as likable, she is made more sympathetic by the difficulties she faces as a result of Togane and Sybil's manipulations. Anime News Network wrote that, despite her minor role in the 2015 movie, Shimotsuki's traits remained unlikable because of her hatred and informal manners whenever interacting with Tsunemori, which meant that viewers who had not watched the second series still understood the film. The response to Shimotsuki's actions in following appearances has been more positive. Anime News Network praised Shimotsuki's role in Sinners of the System for the way she gains depth and becomes heroic while dealing with the antagonists. All Time Anime had a similar reaction, saying Shimotsuki comes across as a more likable character. TheCinemaholic found Shimotsuki a more entertaining character in Psycho-Pass 3, citing the tsundere traits she displays when dealing with her underlings. Anime News Network noted that there was a balance of power between the two types of crime-fighting organizations due to Shimotsuki being the leader of Unit One. Using the analogy that \\"Mika's Public Safety Bureau team is the FBI while Frederica's Ministry of Foreign Affairs team is the CIA\\", it said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs team's handling of the situation makes Shimotsuki's anger reasonable. Biggest in Japan found Shimotsuki's actions in First Inspector comical, based on her reactions to events in the final moments of the film.

His place in American literary history was secured when he served for almost a decade as Henry Adams‚Äôs literary assistant and family archivist.  Early life  Theodore Frelinghuysen Dwight was born in Auburn, New York, the son of Almon Dwight (1814‚Äì1902) and Cyria Charge White (1817‚Äì1897). His father professed the Millerite Doctrine, the belief that the second coming of Christ would occur around 1843 or 1844 and, acting on that belief, lived in Jerusalem for four years before Theodore's birth, between 1837 and 1841, where he ran an industrial school.Benjamin W. Dwight, The History of the Descendants of John Dwight of Dedham, Mass., Vol. 2 (New York: John F. Trow & Son, 1874): 1025. From 1865 until 1869, Theodore Dwight attended Rochester Collegiate Institute and paid his way through school by working in a wholesale saddlery and hardware store.  Career  The major portion of Dwight‚Äôs career was as a librarian and archivist. Later in life, he served as an American diplomat. He occasionally worked as a bookkeeper, editor, and proofreader. =Early literary work= Around 1869, Dwight moved from Rochester to San Francisco, where he lived at 256 Bush Street and worked as a bookkeeper for the Pacific Union Express Company. Shortly after arriving in San Francisco, Dwight became a member of the local literary scene including Bret Harte, Ina Coolbrith, and Charles Warren Stoddard.Roger Austen, Genteel Pagan: The Double Life of Charles Warren Stoddard (Amherst, University of Massachusetts Press, 1991): 47. Dwight began writing for Harte's magazine Overland Monthly, primarily about books and autograph collecting.Overland Monthly 3 (October 1869): 342 Overland Monthly 5 (August 1870): 139. His writing occasionally drew notice in East Coast publications.‚ÄùNew Publications,‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äô(Boston) Daily Advertiser,‚Äô‚Äô 30 August 1871. His place in the local arts and letters scene was recognized when in January 1872 he was elected a trustee of the San Francisco Mercantile Library Association.‚ÄùThe Coming Mercantile Library Election,‚Äù (San Francisco) Daily Evening Bulletin, 8 January 1872. In the early fall of 1873, Dwight moved to New York City to take a position in the publishing house of G.P. Putnam‚Äôs Sons.‚ÄùLiterary Gossip,‚Äù (San Francisco) Daily Evening Bulletin, 11 October 1873. = State Department librarian = In 1875, Dwight left Putnam‚Äôs and moved to Washington, D.C., where he served briefly as a literary assistant to the American historian George Bancroft. While working for Bancroft, Dwight became known to the State Department Library senior staff, who eventually offered him the position of Chief of the Bureau of Rolls and Library.\\"Our New Librarian. Sketch of the Trustees' Appointee, Theodore Frelinghuysen Dwight,\\" Boston Globe, March 3, 1892, p. 10. The Bureau was the repository of manuscripts related to the foreign relations of the United States, beginning with the Continental Congress in 1774.Bulletin of the Bureau of Rolls and Library of the U.S. Department of State, (No. 1‚Äì3). September, 1893 (Washington: Department of State, 1893) Dwight held the position from 1875 until 1888. While there, Dwight assembled what was at the time called ‚Äúthe best international law library outside of the British Museum.‚Äù‚ÄùOur New Librarian. Sketch of the Trustee‚Äôs Appointee, Theodore Frelinghuysen Dwight,‚Äù The Boston Globe, 3 March 1892, p. 10. In 1881, Secretary of State James G. Blaine instructed Dwight to assist the U.S. Government in acquiring a collection of Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs papers. The papers were on the market in London, England, and Dwight, who was then traveling in Europe, went to London to examine the papers and assess their relevance to American history. He reported to the Senate that the papers ‚Äúare the veritable records of our history, and are as worthy of a place among the national archives as those of Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton.\\"Senate Miscellaneous Documents (No. 21), 47th Congress, 1st session, pp. 1-3, 96-99, cited in: Whitfield J.

Letters of Henry Adams, vol. III, p. 126. His duties for the Adams family included organizing and indexing the presidential and family papers as well as serving as a proofreader for Henry Adams and his brother Charles Francis Adams Jr. = Boston Public Library = In March 1892, Dwight was chosen to head the Boston Public Library, at a critical point in the Library‚Äôs history. A new building on Boston‚Äôs Copley Square was under construction and Dwight's selection was eagerly anticipated by Boston society.‚ÄùOur New Librarian. Sketch of the Trustee‚Äôs Appointee, Theodore Frelinghuysen Dwight,‚Äù The Boston Globe, 3 March 1892, p. 10. He began his job on April 13, 1892, but his tenure was from the outset characterized by personal and professional turmoil. Henry Adams was aware of the crisis that faced both Dwight and the Library, writing to a family friend: \\"Rumors reach me about Dwight, and grow more emphatic, but I am in deadly terror of him, and want to escape being drawn into the inevitable collapse of his ambitions. I never had so much difficulty in keeping out of a quarrel as in this case.Henry Adams to Lucy Baxter, letter dated December 10, 1893, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. IV, p. 144. [Lucy Baxter (1836‚Äì1922) was a close friend of Henry‚Äôs mother, Abigail Brown Brooks.] He left Boston within a year and spent the summer of 1893 in Rome, Italy, where he represented Isabella Stewart Gardner on acquiring a number of items from the famous 1892 Borghese Collection sale handled by the Italian dealer Vincenzo Menozzi. On December 19, 1893, Dwight gave four-months‚Äô notice that he would leave the Library on April 30, 1894, but Library trustees immediately granted him a leave of absence for the remainder of his term, stating publicly that his departure was due to ‚Äúpoor health and inability to stand the cares and responsibilities of the office.‚ÄùWalter Muir Whitehill, Boston Public Library: A Centennial History (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956): 130. Rumors in Boston suggested that his resignation was not voluntary. The Boston Globe opined: Dwight may also have been moonlighting elsewhere in a way that interfered with his duties at the Library. In 1895, within months of his departure from the Boston Public Library, Dwight published two hefty volumes of Civil War History for the Military Historical Society of Massachusetts, of which he was a member: Campaigns in Virginia 1861-1862, The Virginia Campaign of 1862 Under General Pope and Critical Sketches of Some of the Federal and Confederate Commanders.Both volumes: Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1895. His reputation as a librarian ruined in Boston, Dwight wrote to his friend Isabella Stewart Gardner on August 27, 1894, that he had no prospects in Boston, but might move to Chicago and seek work there. ‚ÄúMy efforts to be patient & cheerful usually end in failure,‚Äù he wrote to Gardner, a reference to the emotional problems that Adams and others had noted off and on for years.Theodore Dwight, Letter to Isabella Stewart Gardner from Boston, August 27, 1894, Gardner Museum Archives, Accession No. ARC.001384. = U.S. Consul at Vevey = In 1904, Dwight's friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked Secretary of State John Hay to appoint Dwight as U.S. Consul at Geneva. Dwight, by now living in England, accepted the position but tried unsuccessfully to impose conditions on the terms of the appointment. The State Department withdrew the nomination. Some months later, Lodge again asked Hay to appoint Dwight as Consul, this time at the much smaller American Consulate at Vevey, Switzerland. Hay agreed, and by 1905, Dwight had taken over the post in Vevey.Henry Adams to Elizabeth Cameron, letter dated April 10, 1904, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. V, p. 570‚Äì572; and Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. V, p. 572, note 1.  Personal life Club memberships= Dwight was a member of several prominent men's clubs and historical organizations, including the Cosmos Club,Cosmos Club: Act of Incorporation and By-Laws, with a list of officers and members (Washington: Cosmos Club): 6. the American Antiquarian Society,Boston Daily Advertiser, April 30, 18885, p. 2 the Massachusetts Historical Society,Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. 15 (1876‚Äì1877): 386-387. the Military Historical Society of Massachusetts, the Tavern Club, and the St. Botolph Club. In 1884, he was made an honorary member of the Harvard College chapter of Phi Beta Kappa Alpha.Catalogue of the Harvard Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa Alpha of Massachusetts (Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1912): 189. = Friendship with Henry Adams = Sometime around October 1881, Dwight, then librarian of the State Department, became acquainted with American historian Henry Adams, who was researching his landmark publication, The History of the United States of America (1801 to 1817).Henry Adams, Letter to Francis Parkman, October 4, 1881, ‚Äò‚ÄôLetters of Henry Adams,‚Äô‚Äô Vol. II, p. 440-441. Adams worked with thousands of pages of original documents housed in the State Department archives and came to rely on Dwight, who was meticulous, hard working, and knew the State Department collection inside and out. Sometime around 1885, Dwight began moonlighting as a personal and literary assistant to Henry Adams.Austen, Genteel Pagan, p. 112. Though the exact nature of his duties are unclear, they almost certainly included proofreading and editorial work on Adams‚Äôs History of the United States. During the summer of 1885, Dwight lived in Adams‚Äôs house at 1607 H Street, facing Lafayette Square. Dwight managed the house and its staff while Adams and his wife were on vacation in Virginia. Adams viewed Dwight as a friend rather than caretaker; for example, Adams encouraged him to make use of his wine cellar during the couple‚Äôs absence.Henry Adams to Theodore Dwight, letter dated June 28, 1885, Letters of Henry Adams, vol. II, pp. 618-619. After Adams's wife died in December 1885, Dwight moved in with Adams to help him run the household and, as Dwight described in a letter to a friend, to ‚Äúsupport his bereavement.‚ÄùTheodore Dwight to George Kennan, letter dated March 1, 1886. Cited in Letters of Henry Adams, vol. II, p. 641, note 3. He continued his work at the State Department while living in Adams‚Äôs home for the next three years. In March 1888, Adams and Dwight traveled together to Cuba by way of Florida, where they visited friends of Adams before sailing to Cuba for a visit of two weeks. In a letter to a friend, Adams called Dwight his ‚Äúcompanion.‚Äù In Havana, the two men attended a bull fight, a carnavale mascarade, and the opera, but ultimately found the city to be too noisy and, in Adam‚Äôs opinion, a ‚Äúgay ruin.‚ÄùHenry Adams to Charles Milnes Gaskell, letter from Los Ba√±os de S. Diego [Cuba], March 8, 1889, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. III, p. 105-107; and excerpt from Henry Adams‚Äôs diary, March 20, 1888, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. III, p. 107-108. Shortly after their return from Cuba, Dwight resigned from his position at the State Department Library and within a few months began working for the Adams family as their archivist in the ‚ÄúStone Library‚Äù located on the Adams homestead in Quincy, Massachusetts. The Stone Library is now part of the Adams National Historical Park and houses the personal and family papers of John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Charles Francis Adams, Henry Adams, and Brooks Adams. During Dwight‚Äôs years working in Quincy, Adams became increasingly concerned about Dwight‚Äôs mental health. In 1890, for example, he wrote to Dwight: ‚ÄúI am very anxious to hear that you are feeling right. I cannot believe that the trouble is beyond easy and quick treatment. These clouds vanish as quickly as they come, and some day you will wake up right. Most men and women have had the experience.‚ÄùHenry Adams to Theodore Dwight, Letter dated February 28, 1890, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. III, p. 225. By mid-1891, anticipating both the conclusion of Dwight‚Äôs duties in Quincy and the possibility that Dwight might be named Librarian of the Boston Public Library, Adams encouraged Dwight to consider leaving the employ of his family and accept the Library job if it were offered to him. The letters of Adams to his friends during these years contain many references to Dwight‚Äôs mental health and Adams‚Äôs worries about him, so that was almost certainly another reason Adams encouraged Dwight to leave: Early in 1892, Adams and his brother Charles Francis Adams, Jr. decided that the work Dwight was doing for them on the Adams family political papers would not continue past the summer.Henry Adams to Charles Francis Adams, Jr., letter dated January 20, 1892, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. III, p. 606. Adams would remain friendly with Dwight and his wife Sally until their deaths. He visited the Dwights in Switzerland in 1902. = Homosexuality = After moving to Boston to serve the Adams family, Dwight took up residence in a gentleman‚Äôs rooming house at 10 Charles Street where his lover, the writer and dramatist Thomas Russell Sullivan, also lived. The two men were not reticent about their relationship. They entertained together, were members of the same clubs, and went out in society as a male couple. They socialized together, for example, over private dinners with Isabella Stewart Gardner and her husband John L. Gardner at Boston‚Äôs Somerset Club.T.R. Sullivan, Passages from the Journal of Thomas Russell Sullivan, 1891-1903 (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1917): 110.T.R. Sullivan, Passages, p. 140. Dwight corresponded quite openly with Isabella Stewart Gardner about his impulses and affairs, writing in one letter to her: In 1892, while Dwight was traveling to meet Gardner in Europe, Sullivan wrote to her about the sadness he felt during Dwight‚Äôs absence: Dwight and Sullivan were also frequently guests at W. Sturgis Bigelow's male-only nudist colony on remote Tuckernuck Island, though membership was not strictly limited to homosexuals.Christopher Benfey, The Great Wave: Gilded Age Misfits, Japanese Eccentrics, and the Opening of Old Japan (New York: Random House, 2003): 66. In 1892, Dwight bought 121 male nude photographs by Guglielmo Pl√ºschow and Wilhelm von Gloeden in Munich and bought more in London later that summer. In a letter to his friend Charles Warren Stoddard, Dwight bragged that he had gotten the photographs through U.S. Customs without being detected, thus preventing ‚Äúconfiscation and imprisonment.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen you see my spoils you will comprehend my dangers,‚Äù he wrote to Stoddard.Quoted in Austen, Genteel Pagan, p. 127. In January 1896, while on his honeymoon, he visited von Pl√ºschow‚Äôs studio in Rome. He was such a good customer that von Pl√ºschow permitted Dwight to use the studio to take his own photographs of the models Dwight most appreciated: In another letter to her, Dwight described the breakup of an unidentified love affair, writing ‚Äú...the period has come to that little romance in which I was so foolish as to indulge. You were right in your prediction. I seem to come out of it somewhat battered perhaps, & somewhat benumbed but quite patient & resigned.‚ÄùTheodore Dwight to Isabella Stewart Gardner, undated letter, Gardner Museum Archives, Acquisition No. ARC.001375. The Boston historian Douglass Shand-Tucci concluded that Dwight‚Äôs homosexuality was one of the reasons for his hasty departure from the Boston Public Library.Douglass Shand-Tucci, Boston Bohemia: 1881‚Äì1900. Ralph Adams Cram: Life and Architecture (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1995):211. = Marriage to Sally Loring = In November 1895, at the age of 49, Dwight married Sally Pickman Loring (1859‚Äì1913), the daughter of Congressman George Bailey Loring of Salem. The marriage followed a very brief courtship and was a surprise to Dwight‚Äôs circle of friends, given his open homosexuality and the fact that Dwight had no known previous platonic or romantic involvement with women. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge‚Äôs wife Anna Cabot Mills Davis advised Sally not to marry Dwight after the engagement was announced, such was Dwight‚Äôs reputation as a homosexual.Henry Adams to Elizabeth Cameron, letter dated October 19, 1895, Letters of Henry Adams, Vol. IV, p. 339. Dwight's lover Sullivan likened it to a death, writing in his journal: ‚ÄúTo-night I dined quietly at Miss Sally Loring‚Äôs with Dwight. They are to be married very soon, and pass a year in Europe. So, in this whirl of life, Love and Death go hand in hand.‚ÄùSullivan, Passages, p. 149. During the early years of their marriage, the couple lived in what was then known as ‚Äúthe Bradbury Estate‚Äù at Kendal Green in Weston.‚ÄùFine Property in Kendall Green Changes Owners. Theodore F. Dwight is Purchaser of the Beautiful Bradbury Estate,‚Äù Boston Globe, April 17, 1898, p. 10. Their son Lawrence Dwight (1896‚Äì1918) was born a year later in Boston, on November 6, 1896. Lawrence spent most of his youth in Vevey, Switzerland, where his father was U.S. Consul. He graduated August 30, 1917, from the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. He was to have graduated from the Academy a year later in the spring of 1918, but his class finished a year early due to World War I. Lawrence died six months later of pneumonia in Brest, France, without having seen battle. He held the rank of Second Lieutenant at the time of his death and is buried in the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in France.  Death  Dwight died on February 3, 1917 at the age of 70. At the time, he was living at 48 Beacon Street on Boston‚Äôs Beacon Hill. His health had been failing for several years, though he stayed in touch with friends by phone and letter, especially Isabella Stewart Gardner.Theodore Dwight to Isabella Stewart Gardner, letter from Boston dated April 24, 1916. Gardner Museum Archives, Acquisition No. ARC.001395. Dwight's obituary in The Boston Globe made no mention of his wife or son, even though Sally had been a prominent member of Boston society for many years before her marriage to him.\\"Theodore F. Dwight Dead,\\" Boston Globe, February 4, 1917, p. 16. He is buried alongside his wife in the Harmony Grove Cemetery in Salem, Massachusetts.

Opened in 1977 and described by the Columbus Business First as \\"iconic\\" and a \\"tourist destination\\", the store has also been called \\"a national treasure\\" by The New York Times. The Book Loft has been described by visitors as a \\"literary labyrinth\\" due to its maze-like 32 rooms of books connected by narrow passageways and staircases. Description Store interior The Book Loft of German Village is one of the largest independent bookstores in the United States, with at least 500,000 books in stock and close to a million volumes available during Christmas holiday season. A garden path lined with park benches leads to a patio with bargain books and the main entrance. The store experience includes walking narrow hallways with stairways to multiple levels and the occasional dead end. A map describing the contents of each of the 32 rooms is available for visitors. The Book Loft covers 7,500 square feet of space, and along with books the store sells jigsaw puzzles, posters, and other merchandise. Eighteen music systems each play different music to create a genre-specific soundtrack in each area. The children's areas are the most popular rooms, according to owner Carl Jacobsma. Columbus area author Hanif Abdurraqib has described the sense of getting lost in the store as a formative experience, saying \\"It was important to read my way out of that maze... By the time I exited The Book Loft, I was able to imagine a different and better world than the one that I'd entered.\\" One of the niches the bookstore fills is providing closeouts (\\"remainers\\") that are sold at a heavily reduced price. The store provides a discount on every book sold in the store, with discounts ranging from 5% to 90%. The Book Loft offers multiple events a month such as author readings and signings, as well as sponsoring off-site events like comic book conventions. Building The store is located in red brick buildings dating to before the Civil War. 631 South Third Street once housed Maurer's Saloon and a nickelodeon movie theater called the Lily Cinema. Living quarters were located on the second floor of what was known as the Substantial Building, which would go on to serve as a church, a decorating company, an art studio and school, and an indoor golf course. In 1968 Marnie Southard opened a flower shop in one room of the building; later buying the entire building, she opened a larger art and antiques store and divided the rest of the building into six small shops. She also bought the adjacent building at 632 City Park, which had opened as Wolf Tavern in the nineteenth century and through the years had served as a series of small groceries. Southard created a block-long retail mall, building a new store connecting the two buildings, which was the original space of the Book Loft and now serves as its main entrance. History Former teachers Carl Jacobsma and Roger Tompkins owned a gift shop in the mid-1970s, and in 1977 Marnie Southard asked them to join her in a retail venture. Jacobsma and Tompkins opened a bookstore in one of the stores of Southard's mall; at opening, the store was small, with two floors with a loft on top, providing inspiration for the store's name. When neighboring shops went out of business, Tompkins and Jacobsma would buy the space, tear down the walls, and expand. In a slow and steady process over the next fifteen years, they would repeat this process at least seven times, until the entire building was theirs. In 1987 the shop's book buyer, Russell Iler, became co- owner of the store; owner Roger Tompkins died in 2012. The Book Loft struggled with tight finances due to the rise of Internet retailers in the late 2000s; since the mid-2010s, the business has recovered financially.

Biography  Origins and the disputed archbishopric = A member of the prestigious Visconti family, Giovanni III was directly related to other important bishops of Milan such as Giovanni and Ottone Visconti, his namesake and predecessors. Son of the general Vercellino Secondo Visconti of the Visconti di Somma and Giovanna Visconti, Giovanni was archpriest of the Metropolitan Chapter in 1402 and was first appointed archbishop of Milan in the years 1409-1417 by Pope Gregory XII during the Western Schism. The Council of Constance (1414-18) revoked this appointment. From that moment, other than his office as the commendatory abbot of Morimondo Abbey, he disappeared from the active religious scene until 1450. = Archbishop of Milan (1450-1453) = In early 1450, after the brief interlude of the Ambrosian Republic, Francesco Sforza, son-in-law of the late Duke Filippo Maria Visconti, conquered Milan. While attending the Jubilee of August 3, 1450, the previous Archbishop of Milan, , had died. Sforza secured Visconti's appointment from Pope Nicholas V to the Archbishop of Milan. During his brief tenure, Visconti reorganized Milan Cathedral's Chapter, including a fourth canon in the figure of the Provost. Visconti especially promoted the work of the San Barnaba in Brolo Hospital, founded in 1145, which was the direct predecessor of the Ospedale Maggiore (Maggiore Hospital) in Milan. Because of a common agreement with Duke Sforza and a Papal bull of Niccol√≤ V, Visconti assigned an annual sum of 810 gold ducats to be shared among the staff working there. Giovanni III Visconti died in Milan on March 9, 1453, and was buried in the cathedral.

Following the Kamakura period, the temple was in ruins, but during the Tensho era (1573-1593) a new priest that was a supporter of Chosokabe Motochika during the Sengoku period, revived the temple as a Rinzai Zen temple. During the fourth year of the Keicho era (1599) Chosokabe Motochika died of illness, and the temple became the bodaiji of the Chosokabe family. The present day temple name was taken from the posthumous priest name of Chosokabe Motochiki to become Sekkei-ji. Following the expulsion of Buddhism during the Meiji era, the temple was abandoned in 1870, the following year Hada Shrine was built in order to house the statue shintai of Chosokabe Motochika.

History  According to the temple records, the temple was founded by Kukai during the K≈çnin era (810-824). Following his travels to China, upon returning to Japan with the knowledge that Kukai's teacher Huiguo had bestowed upon him, Kukai grasped his vajra, prayed that he had arrived in a land he was destined to, and threw it eastwards. Kukai sensed that the vajra he had thrown was inside a pine tree of the mountain Sh≈çry≈´-ji is located on, and reported to Emperor Saga. During the 6th year of the Kounin era (815), remembering his master's teachings, Kukai founded the construction of Shoryu-ji, which shared the same name as his masters temple in Chang-an, Qinglong Temple (ÈùíÈæçÂØ∫). The Honzon Acala was chosen due to an experience Kukai had during a storm while returning to Japan, in which Acala was said to have appeared and cut the waves with a sword, saving them, which Kukai had carved as the Honzon.

About 1,100 issues were published. Some were issued by the Reichspropagandaleitung and others by local party organizations in each Gau. Along with Nazi leaders, the posters also quoted famous Germans from history, including Ludwig van Beethoven, Carl von Clausewitz, Otto von Bismarck, and Friedrich Schiller.

Historian Jeffrey Herf estimates that 32.5 million copies were printed in total from September 1939 to when the periodical was discontinued. The purpose of the publication was to educate Germans about Nazi ideals and values, especially those who did not take advantage of the party's indoctrination sessions. Initially, they were often printed in Fraktur type, but this changed in later editions. Anti-Nazi diarist Friedrich Kellner noted that it was printed on high-quality paper despite shortages which necessitated rationing.

His time as Gaon would be defined by an idealistic and innovative tenure, which heralded a new era of prominence for the Gaonate of Pumbedita.  Biography  Born in about 820, his father Abaye ben Natronai, was the paternal grandson of the Exilarch Mar-Zutra III. Despite that, his family were seen as poor. He was the youngest-ever Gaon, being appointed at just 21 years old, During his time as Gaon, his Halakic authority and influence stretched beyond just Babylon, reaching communities in Spain and North Africa. At one point, a community in Spain sent a letter to Rav Paltoi, requesting that he \\"write the Talmud and its explanations for them\\" on the bases that no one in their community would be knowledgeable enough to do so. Rav Paltoi vigorously protested against this, stating that \\"They are not acting correctly, and it is forbidden to do this. They thereby cause a decline in the study of the Torah, causing it to be forgotten.\\" This exemplifies the idealistic attitude that defined him and the future of the Pumbedita Academy. His responsa, can be found in most collections of Geonic responsa, as well as being quoted in the works of the posekim. Although this represents a minority of those he wrote. Although young, Rav Paltoi could be incredibly strict at times, excommunicating communities for disobedience of Halakha.

Early life Christian Espiritu was born on January 04, 1934 to Eugenio Espiritu, a school principal, and Felicula Espiritu in Para√±aque, Metro Manila. He studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. He became a draftsman for Leandro Locsin before deciding to shift careers into fashion design.

Ankyloblepharon must be differentiated from blepharophimosis, in which palpebral aperture is reduced and there is telecanthus, but the eyelid margins are normal. Another condition similar to Ankyloblepharon is Symblepharon where palpebral conjunctiva is attached to bulbar conjunctiva. Recognition of ankyloblepharon necessitates systemic examination to detect associated abnormalities such as genitourinary, cardiac, and syndactyly. PresentationComplication= Main Complication of congenital ankyloblepharon is amblyopia. Timely separation of the eyelids is very important to avoid the development of occlusion amblyopia. Etiology Ankyloblepharon may be congenital or acquired. The most common type is congenital. Clinically Ankyloblepharon may be complete, partial or interrupted. Complete ankyloblepharon is when the eyelids are fused throughout the lid margins. In the partial form, they are joined at one or more points. The interrupted form is also known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA). =Congenital ankyloblepharon= During fetal development, eyelid margins remain fused until the fifth gestational month, and may not be completely separated until the seventh month of gestation. Congenital ankyloblepharon occurs when the lid margins fail to separate at birth. The exact etiology of this condition is unknown. The currently accepted theory is that this condition is due to temporary epithelial arrest and rapid mesenchymal proliferation, allowing union of eyelids at abnormal positions. Systemic associations Congenital ankyloblepharon is seen in association with: * Hay-Wells syndrome: Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal dysplasia-Clefting (AEC) syndrome also known as Hay-Wells syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ankyloblepharon, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft palate and/or cleft lip. * Curly Hair-Ankyloblepharon-Nail Disease (CHAND) syndrome: it is a clinical variant of AEC syndrome. It is also known as Baughman syndrome. * Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome): AFA may be seen in association with Trisomy 18. * Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS): Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, first described by Trelat in 1869. The clinical features of the syndrome are highly variable and show different combinations of anomalies like cleft palate, cleft lip, lower lip pits or sinuses, popliteal webbing, syndactyly, genitourinary anomalies, nail anomalies, syngnathia, ankyloblepharon, talipes, and digital reduction defects. =Acquired ankyloblepharon= Acquired ankyloblepharon may occur due to trauma or inflammatory conditions. It may be associated with symblepharon also. The following conditions cause ankyloblepharon: * Chemical burns, thermal burns or trauma to the eyes * Cicatrising diseases such as Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid * Inflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis * Trachoma * Cicatricial conjunctivitis * Mucous membrane pemphigoid: Ocular form of mucous membrane pemphigoid may cause ankyloblepharon (4th stage of foster grading system). Treatment Lids should be separated by excision of adhesions between the lid margins and kept apart during the healing process. When adhesions extend to the angles, epithelial grafts should be given to prevent recurrences. History Ankyloblepharon was first described by von Anmmon in 1841. Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA), the interrupted form of Ankyloblepharon, was first described by Von Hasner in 1881. Etymology The word Ankyloblepharon was derived from Greek origin words ankylos (·ºÄŒ≥Œ∫œçŒªŒøœÇ) meaning bent, crooked, or closed and blepharon (Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÜŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ) meaning eyelid.

He was considered one of the greatest international scholars of Josephology. Biography Stramare studied in Rome and Jerusalem nas became religious of the Congregation of the Oblates of St. Joseph, being ordained a priest in 1952. A learned scholar, already in the 1970s he was called to occupy the chair of Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Lateran University and, subsequently, at the Pontifical Urban University and at the Pontifical theological faculty \\"Marianum\\". He received some important assignments from the Holy See, both in the Pontifical Commission for the Nova Vulgata (since 1973) of which he was responsible for the editions of the text until his death as the Consultor of the Holy Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Tarcisio Stramare was an Ordinary Member of the Pontifical Academy of Theology and directed the Giuseppino Movement, which, founded in 1963, became an important organ of the Congregation of the Oblates of San Giuseppe, for the study and diffusion of the cult of Saint Joseph. He carried out an intense activity as an essayist and a publicist, linked above all, but not only, to his profound knowledge of Scripture and the studies of Josephology. Among the latter we remember: Saint Joseph in Sacred Scripture, theology and worship (1983), Saint Joseph in the mystery of God (1992), Jesus called him Father. Historical- doctrinal review of Saint Joseph (1997) and Saint Joseph, the saint closest to Jesus (2008). Of a more properly biblical nature are: Matthew the divorcee? Study on Matthew 5, 32 and 19, 9 (1986), The Theology of Divine Revelation (2000), The Marriage of the Mother of God (2001) and Via Crucis. In the footsteps of the Redeemer (2004). The testimony and reflections of Tarcisio Stramare have had, especially since the late nineties of the twentieth century, considerable media relevance, both through radio and television networks, national and international. Tarcisio Stramare's familiarity with the television medium began at a young age, when, as a consultant, he collaborated with Father Mariano in the television column Who is Jesus? (1959) Stramare himself appeared repeatedly in broad audience programs, some of which were broadcast by RAI.https://web.archive.org/web/20080608204140/http://www.international.rai.it/cristianita/archivio_puntate/2004/20040104.shtml. His participation is also intense, in Italy and abroad in symposia and conferences. He died on 20 March 2020, in Imperia, at the age of 91, victim of COVID-19. Italia  Il Covid-19 non-risparmia i missionari Tarcisio Stramare and Saint Joseph Tarcisio Stramare has always had a deep interest in St. Joseph, making known the centrality of the figure and the role played in the divine mystery of Salvation. If we take into consideration the inseparable link existing between Incarnation and Redemption, St. Joseph is highlighted thanks to the role played by Jesus' putative Father, as a true minister of Salvation. These approaches are at the basis of the theological line followed by John Paul II in the apostolic exhortation Redemptoris Custos (1989). For Tarcisio Stramare the figure of St. Joseph, in the mystery of Salvation, therefore has, among the Saints, an importance second only to that of the Virgin Mary.This and other information contained in the paragraph are taken from: Tarciso Stramare, Bibliotheca Sanctorum , Vol. VI, Roma, coll. 1251‚Äì1287, contained on the site: una voceverona . The loving care and education that the Saint imparted to Christ are in fact just as relevant as procreation itself and reaffirm its undisputed exercise of fatherhood. Respect for the most fragile beings, children, and the sacredness of every life that is brought into the world are in some way enhanced by the figure of St. Joseph and constitute a message of disconcerting topicality. On the basis of these considerations, the figure of the saint, the closest to Christ after that of the Virgin Mary during the short existence of Jesus, imposes himself on the consideration of the faithful as patron saint of the Universal Church and unsurpassed model of husband, father and educator for every Christian family.

It became a nightclub described by The Wall Street Journal as \\"the default West Village boite for 'Page Six'-caliber starlets, enterprising NYU students, and fashion types.\\" In April 2009, it was raided and shut down by the Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement, following numerous noise complaints from residents living near The Beatrice Inn. The New York Times also reported that the club owed $23,000 in fines. Following its closure, a \\"Free the Beatrice Party\\" was organised by Sevigny at the nearby Cooper Square Hotel. Sevigny also announced plans to open a new club and restaurant in SoHo. In August 2015, Morgan Peterson of Harper's Bazaar listed The Beatrice Inn as one of \\"New York's Most Historic Nightclubs\\". In 2010, the building was purchased and refurbished into a Spanish tapas restaurant by restaurateur Cobi Levy. In July 2012, the restaurant was bought over by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter with his partners Emil Varda and Brett Rasinski. Carter sold The Beatrice Inn to executive chef Angie Mar in August 2016 and it was reopened in September 2016. The restaurant has had four executive chefs since 2012. Brian Nasworthy left for Picholine in early 2013 and was replaced by Aaron Zebrook. Angie Mar took over as executive chef in October 2013. Reception In May 2013, Pete Wells of The New York Times awarded The Beatrice Inn zero stars out of four and described the menu as \\"awful\\" and \\"unremarkable\\". In October 2016, after Mar bought over the restaurant, Wells revisited The Beatrice Inn and gave it a two-star review (meaning \\"very good\\"), praising her for making \\"the Beatrice Inn one of the most celebratory restaurants in the city.\\" In July 2017, Ryan Sutton, writing for Eater, found that the restaurant had been \\"transformed from a bastion of social exclusivity into a financial one\\" and was critical of the exorbitant prices; he gave The Beatrice Inn one star out of four. On the other hand, Shauna Lyon of The New Yorker, who also reviewed the restaurant in the same month, described it as a \\"buzzie foodie location\\" whose \\"menu is full of delicious, over-the-top bargains\\". The Beatrice Inn was included in the Michelin Guide New York 2020, which wrote that its \\"flavors are big and bold but the richness of the meat is balanced by a judicious use of herbs and fruits.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1920s establishments in New York (state) Category:Restaurants in Manhattan Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:West Village ","title":"The Beatrice Inn"},{"id":"64070816","text":"Upendra Nath Verma is an Indian politician.

It was envisaged as an improved and enlarged version of the Dornier Do X Flugschiff (flying ship) that first flew in 1929. The Do X was not entirely successful, being under-powered despite using six pairs of engines mounted above the wing, and only three were built. Dornier proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the Do X by replacing the pylon-mounted engines with four pairs of diesel engines each of about 1,000 horse power, each pair fitted into a nacelle fared into the leading edge of the wing and driving one of the aircraft's four propellers. A model of the aircraft was exhibited at the 1936 International Aviation Exhibition in Stockholm (ILIS) and details were published in the 1937 edition of Jane's All the World's Aircraft.

History The school went through several phases, moving several times, over its history. Central High was first established in 1860 when students of high-school age were added to Union Elementary. In 1864, the building was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt on the same site as a K-12, Washington School. A new building was erected in 1877, with the name changed to Central, on the corner of 4th Avenue South and 11th Street in Minneapolis. Designed in Victorian Gothic style by Franklin Long and Charles Haglin, the building was described by Minneapolis architecture critic Larry Millett as \\"one of the most impressive buildings of its time in Minneapolis.\\" It was expanded in 1886. In 1913, the school moved again to 4th Avenue South and 34th Street in Minneapolis, where it stayed until its closing in 1982. The new building was designed in the Collegiate Gothic architectural style. Minneapolis Public Schools closed Central, West and Marshall-University high schools in 1982. Central was demolished except for its gym.

It was one of the first sites to be listed on the ACT Interim Heritage Places Register in 1993. The workshop is also of national importance as it is one of only a few known surviving stand- alone blacksmith shops in Australia; although, many farm-based smithies have survived. The building remains in stable condition, but there is no firm plan concerning its long-term management and it remains fenced-off and innaccessible to the public.P. Saunders, A European Cultural Resource Survey of Ginninderra Village and ‚ÄòDeasland‚Äô Woolshed, Harcourt Hill Development Area, Gungahlin, ACT: Final Report, Canberra, 1993, pp. 20-23; cf. L.

McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 289-305. It has survived fire, vandalism and neglect for over 160 years. It is located on the Barton Highway, next to Deasland homestead, which is slated for demolition due to the ‚ÄòMr Fluffy‚Äô loose-fill asbestos disaster.The Canberra Times, 25 June 2015, p. 1; J. McDonald, ‚ÄòVale Deasland‚Äô, Canberra History News, vol. 456 (September) 2015, pp. 12-13. Locals gathered outside the Ginninderra Post Office, c. 1882, including the Ginninderra blacksmith, George Curran, and his nephew and apprentice, Harry Curran (third and fourth from the left) The workshop has an earthen floor and is constructed of timber posts, slabs and corrugated iron. It contains the remnants of a forge with a small cast-iron door and a petrol engine next to restored leather bellows. The five blacksmiths of Ginninderra The last full-time professional blacksmith of the ACT was Henry (‚ÄòHarry‚Äô) Curran. In 1949, after 67 years as the Ginninderra blacksmith, he retired. At that time, he was 82 and the oldest professional blacksmith in Australia.The Canberra Times, 12 December 1949, p. 2. At least four smiths had run the Ginninderra blacksmith‚Äôs shop before him from 1859 until 1891. All five Ginninderra blacksmiths were related to each other.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra 2018, pp. 289, 303. 1\\\\. 1859-1865: James Hatch (married Mary Ann Daley); no known apprentices 2\\\\. 1865-1876: Flourence McAuliffe (married Mary Ann Flanagan); five apprentices: John Wilson, Bobby Hamilton, John and Charles Fowler, George Curran 3\\\\. 1876-1889: George Curran (married Mary Ann Hatch); two apprentices: Harry Curran and Michael Hickey 4\\\\. 1889-1891: Alexander Warwick (married Esther Wall); junior partner: Augustus Helmund 5\\\\. 1891-1949: Henry (‚ÄòHarry‚Äô) Curran (married Agnes Gribble); junior partner: George Gribble First blacksmith of Ginninderra, James Hatch and his wife, Mary Ann Daley, c. 1865 James Hatch built the original blacksmith‚Äôs shop, possibly as early as 1859, but more likely in 1860 as he seems to have been away at the Kiandra goldfield in 1859.

Warman, The Hatch Family in Australia, Canberra, 1981, pp. 79-80.Upon his return to Ginninderra, he spent his time between farming and blacksmithing. Hatch‚Äôs elder brother, William, also moved to the district, taking up a selection called Rosewood in 1862.S. Shumack (ed. J. E. and S. Shumack), An Autobiography, or, Tales and Legends of Canberra Pioneers, Canberra, 1967, pp. 39-50. But James Hatch soon left Ginninderra for Urana in southern NSW by 1867.Obituary in Goulburn Evening Penny Post, 28 January 1896, p. 4; M. Warman, The Hatch Family in Australia, Canberra, 1981, pp. 4-10, 79-80. Flourence McAuliffe took over from Hatch in c. 1865.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 292-6. In 1867, fire destroyed his residence nearby. Fortunately, the blacksmith‚Äôs shop was saved with the help of Aboriginal man, Bobby Hamilton, and other Ginninderra neighbours. McAuliffe was one of the key advocates for a district school and supported the free selectors in Ginninderra. He led the formation of the Ginninderra Protection Union.Queanbeyan Age, 4 September, 1873, p. 2. McAuliffe‚Äôs workshop failed. In 1877 he was declared bankrupt.Freeman‚Äôs Journal, 28 July 1877, p. 11. The third Ginninderra smith was George Curran. Curran married Mary Ann Hatch, the niece of the original smith. George‚Äôs younger brother, John Curran, became the blacksmith at Murrumbateman, which meant that the brothers dominated the blacksmithing trade between Murrumbateman and Ginninderra in the 1876-89 period.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 296-8. The Queanbeyan Age said ‚ÄòYou can hear the notes, loud and clear, with all their variations, from the anvil of Mr George Curran‚Äôs blacksmith‚Äôs forge‚Äô.Queanbeyan Age, 1 August 1884, p. 2. Curran hired two formal apprentices. One was his nephew, Harry Curran, whose father was Henry Joseph Curran, a prominent journalist with the Catholic papers in Goulburn, Boorowa and Sydney.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòHenry Curran, Bushrangers, and a Boorowa Dream‚Äô, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, vol. 38, 2017, pp, 20-33. In 1882 when fourteen-year-old Harry was orphaned, his uncles, Patrick Curran and Thomas Lodge, adopted his siblings, but Harry was sent to Ginninderra as an apprentice under George.B. Maher, In Praise of Pioneers, Canberra, 1981, pp. 28-34; J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 82-9. When the Currans left Ginninderra to set up shop in Bungendore in 1889, another short-term smith arrived at Ginninderra. This was Alexander Warwick. Through his wife, he was related to the Hatch and Curran families. Helping him in the blacksmithing business was Augustus Helmund, the son of a German sign writer from Queanbeyan.E. Lea-Scarlett, Queanbeyan: District and People, Queanbeyan, 1968, pp. 123-4; L. Gillespie, Ginninderra: Forerunner to Canberra, Campbell, 1992, pp. 132, 136, 161, 225; J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 298-9. Warwick had come from Braidwood, where his father had combined blacksmithing and work as a teamster before buying the Canberra blacksmith‚Äôs shop, (near St John‚Äôs, Reid) which doubled up as the local post office.Queanbeyan Age, 6 May 1932, p. 2. It seemed like a good business move for the son to take over at Ginninderra and, between them, the Warwicks hoped to dominate the district‚Äôs business north of the Molonglo River. But Warwick‚Äôs span as the Ginninderra smith ended in March 1891. Like McAuliffe, he was also declared bankrupt.Goulburn Evening Penny Post, 10 March 1891, p. 4; Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser, 3 March 1891, p. 6. No handover had been arranged, which meant that the smithy was vacant. Harry Curran seized the opportunity, left his uncle George at Bungendore, and took over the workshop at Ginninderra a few months later in his own right. Curran married local, Agnes Gribble. He ran the workshop in partnership with her brother, the talented sportsman, George Gribble.J. McDonald, Three Henry Currans, Canberra, 2018, pp. 299-302. For Gribble, see J. McDonald, ‚ÄòThe Gribble Who Came to Queanbeyan‚Äô, Quinbean, vol. 9.1 (April) 2016, pp. 10-15. But Curran‚Äôs return as blacksmith in 1891 was not without incident. Ginninderra was in decline and a rival smithy opened up in nearby Hall village in the 1890s.L. R. Smith, Memories of Hall, Roebuck, Canberra, 1975, p. 2; L. Gillespie, Ginninderra: Forerunner to Canberra, Campbell, 1992, p. 213. In 1893, Curran found himself indirectly involved in a criminal case brought against his brother-in-law, who was charged with stealing seed corn from John Southwell, and hiding it in the blacksmith‚Äôs shop.Queanbeyan Age, 19 July 1893, p. 2. Gribble was acquitted. Matters improved and, by the late 1890s, the Currans had built a weatherboard home about 100m east of the workshop.Heritage Council of the ACT, ‚ÄòGinninderra Blacksmith‚Äôs Workshop‚Äô, 1993, p. 2; P. Saunders, A European Cultural Resource Survey of Ginninderra Village and ‚ÄòDeasland‚Äô Woolshed, Harcourt Hill Development Area, Gungahlin, ACT: Final Report, Canberra, 1993, pp. 24-25. The last years of its operation In 1905, the smithy and other buildings in Ginninderra village were threatened by a major bushfire, which swept across from Wallaroo. The newspapers, at the time, reported that it had been a close thing.Evening News, 3 January 1905, p. 4; Goulburn Herald, 4 January 1905, p. 2; Australian Town & Country Journal, 4 January 1905, p. 17. The blacksmith‚Äôs shop remainded the focus for what was left of Ginninderra village in the twentieth century.C. Newman, Gold Creek: Reflections of Canberra‚Äôs Rural Heritage, Ngunawal, 2004, pp. 58-59, 65. The Ginninderra smithy was even used as a polling booth in the 1907 election.The Canberra Times, 12 December, 1949, p. 2. In 1923, artist, Eirene Mort, when compiling a collection of works on the Canberra district, visited the workshop and made a pencil sketch of Curran at work at his anvil. Her drawing is now part of the collection of the National Library of Australia and is on loan to the Canberra Museum and Gallery‚Äôs permanent display, which also features Curran‚Äôs smaller anvil and swage block.NLA reference number: nla.pic-an3773808. In February 1954, when Elizabeth II visited Canberra, Curran was one of seven elderly ‚Äòpioneers‚Äô invited to meet the royal party. Lionel Wigmore recorded that, when he was introduced to the Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who remarked, ‚Äòyou must have worked very hard‚Äô, Harry Curran‚Äôs dry reply was, ‚ÄòToo right I did!‚Äô.L. Wigmore, The Long View: a History of Canberra, Australia‚Äôs National Capital, Melbourne, 1963, p. 172. Cf. The Canberra Times, 15 February 1954, p 4 (with photograph). Just two years later, Curran, the last professional blacksmith of the ACT, died. His blacksmith journal is part of the collection of the Hall School Museum and Heritage Centre.https://museum.hall.act.au.The blacksmith's shop is fenced off on the Barton Highway. Access is managed through the ACT Government.

The church has been on the National Register of Historic Places since May 22, 2005, and is of Norman Romanesque style. John Grey, the architect, made a very comprehensive plan of the church, and hired various craftsmen from around the country to apply the detail he wanted. The church is made from Bedford limestone mined and cut in Indiana, and Robert Garrison designed gargoyles and exterior sculptures around the building. Robert E. Wade painted the ornate roof inside the chapel, and Joseph Reynolds Jr. designed the stained glass windows. Despite being built in the middle of the Great Depression, it is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of Norman Romanesque architecture in the state of Colorado.

Developing from the overconcentration of business interests in China, it may be done for reasons of cost, safety, or long-term stability. It has also been described as a 'macro-level phenomenon'. The increasing cost of doing business in China has also increased operating costs, especially for manufacturers. The advantages of the cheap labour and market demand that China initially provided has increasingly been overshadowed by the advantages that ASEAN countries can provide. Multinational corporations have been looking at countries with adequately stable governments such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Philippines. Countries like Japan and United States are part of the phenomenon, with the strategy conceptualizing in businesses in these countries as early as 2008. However the China Plus One strategy has it own share of difficulties, including navigating new laws, new markets and streamlining the business over multiple locations. Some say that moving out of China now is not even practical. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous Indian companies have adopted strategy to find alternative supply chains. India's largest air conditioner manufacturer has started production of motors in India to reduce its reliance on China; Indian auto component manufacturers are also building the base to shift out of China, changing reliance to local vendors for some components; the same is the case for pharma companies.

The catch in 2001 totaled 200,000 tons of wild-caught seafood and 63,700 tons produced using aquaculture. The major fishing grounds are in the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan to the east and the Yellow Sea to the west. The main fishery ports are Sinpo, Kimchaek, and the nearby deep-sea fishery bases of Yanghwa and Hongwfin. The principal catch from the Sea of Japan is pollock. Fishing targets in seven-year plans were met until 1993, after which there was a shortage. Present catches are unknown, as is the size of the fishing fleet. Fishing is conducted under military supervision to prevent defections. Military service also affects both men and women. Conscripted men can acquire fishing skills while women are left to work in fish processing plants in their place. North Korea sells fishing quotas in its own EEZ through agents China. This has forced North Korean fishers to poach in Chinese and Russian waters, where they are ill-equipped to sail. The situation has resulted in numerous shipwrecks, particularly in the Japanese archipelago where \\"ghost ships\\" with their dead crew has washed ashore. Geography Pollock is a favorite fish of Koreans and the principal catch of North Korea. North Korea's coastline of about 2,495 kilometers, mixture of warm and cold ocean currents, and many rivers, lakes, and streams make its potential for fishery development better than for most other countries. The major fishing grounds are in the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan to the east and the Yellow Sea to the west. The principal catch from the Sea of Japan is pollock. Sardine and squid catches are also significant. From the west coast, yellow corvina and hairtail are the most common varieties of fish. Deep-sea catches include herring, mackerel, pike, and yellowtail. Shellfish and mollusks are caught too. , there are more than thirty state-run fishery station and about three-fourths of them are located on the east coast. The main fishery ports are Sinpo, Kimchaek, and the nearby deep-sea fishery bases of Yanghwa and Hongwfin. Most large-scale storage and canning facilities also are located on the east coast as well. Besides the fishery stations, smaller fishery cooperatives are located along both coasts in traditional fishing centers. Aquaculture and freshwater fishing take place on regular cooperative farms. History A major expansion of technical schools was undertaken since the 1950s, with specialized courses including fishing. Not until the early 1960s, however, did the domestic fishing industry begin to expand rapidly, receiving increased investment in vessels, equipment, and port facilities. Deep-sea fishing began in earnest in the 1970s. Total marine products increased from 465,000 tons in 1960 to 1.14 million tons in 1970, registering an annual growth rate of 9.4 percent compared with the planned rate of 14.5 percent. The Six-Year Plan target of 1 .6 million tons was met in 1976. In 1977 the government reorganized the fishery administration and pledged to continue improving port facilities and building bigger and better trawlers and processing ships. Improvements were slated for the fishery centers and deep- sea stations, and fishery cooperatives were reportedly given more autonomy to use their profits as they thought best. The government also urged the expansion of processing and storage facilities at the local level. In 1980 the largest stern-trawlers were of the 3,750-ton class, but most processing mother ships were imported. The completion of one 24,000-ton mother ship in celebration of the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea was an indication of the government's commitment to improving the fishing industry in the Second Seven-Year Plan. The projected budget for 1980 called for a 70 percent increase in direct government investment in fisheries. The target for 1984 ‚Äì 3.5 million tons of marine and freshwater fishery products, of which 2.7 million tons represented the fish catch ‚Äì was met. Through the 1970s and 1980s, in a bit to boot production by ideological means, Three Revolutions teams were sent to fishing villages for on-the-spot guidance and problem solving in close consultation with local personnel. The output target for the Third Seven-Year Plan was 11 million tons by 1993, including a catch of 3 million tons of fish. In order to expand marine products, the Third Seven-Year Plan called for modernizing the fishery industry. Specifically, the plan urged increasing the numbers of 14,000-ton class processing ships, 3,750-ton class stern-trawlers, and 1,000-ton and 480-ton class fishing vessels, as well as generally increasing the size of vessels. The government also called for widespread introduction of modern fishing implements and rationalizing the fishery labor system. Improvements also are slated for expanding and modernizing the cold-storage and processing facilities in order to facilitate speedy processing of catches. With an estimated total output of 1.5 million tons in 1990, down from 1.6 million tons in 1989, it was estimated that the 1993 target for marine products would not be met. The slow progress in state investment, combined with the shortages of oil, are the main factors in the disappointing record of marine output in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, veritable shortages of fish occurred. The catch in 2001 totaled 200,000 tons of wild-caught freshwater and saltwater fish, shellfish, and mollusks and about 63,700 tons produced using aquaculture. The exact numbers of present catches are unknown. Unlike most countries, North Korea does not report its annual catch to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), of which it is a member. Fleet The exact numbers of the fishing fleet, thought to be in poor condition, are not known. In 1998, North Korea had eight large fishing vessels (3,750 displacement tonnage, 2,759 gross tons, 83 m length, 2,250 horsepower) and 1,545 small vessels (485 displacement tonnage, 267 gross tons, 39 m length, 400 horsepower). Numbers of smaller vessels were not reported. Export and international relations Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of North Korea Fish is an important export commodity to North Korea. Fish and seafood are particularly exported to China. The United Nations Security Council sanctions from 2017 banned North Korean exports of seafood. Prior to the ban, North Korean exports of seafood were estimated at US$300 million annually. According to a 1988 agreement with the United Nations Development Programme, North Korea was to receive assistance in construction of a fish farm. The first joint venture North Korea established with China, in 1989, was a marine fishery products firm located in Chongjin that had an initial capitalization of US$1 million. Thousands of North Korean vessels fish in the waters of Russia and Japan annually. Typically small boats unsuited for the high seas, they are sometimes shipwrecked, on Russian shores, but particularly on the Japanese archipelago. The boats, usually carrying a dead crew, have been dubbed \\"ghost ships\\". Several reasons have been suggested for their accumulation on the Japanese shores including weather patters, poor condition of the fleet, and originating from Russian and Chinese waters where they have been ill-equipped to sail. Poaching in Russian waters was limited to the southern end of the Russian EEZ until the late 2010s when poachers moved further north. North Korea conducts fishing in its own EEZ, the extent of which is unknown because North Korea has not passed a law on it, mainly for the industrial sector. Some fishing for the artisanal sector takes place, too. Subsistence fishing has declined considerably over the years. A 2000 agreement between non-governmental fishing organizations of North and South Korea allowed South Koreans to fish inside the North Korean EEZ in the Sea of Japan until 2005. About 400 South Korean fishing vessels conducted fishing in the area. North Korea sells fishing quotas to its EEZ to foreigners through agents China. North Korean fishermen who are deprived of quotas to the EEZ then resort to poaching in the waters of China and Russia. Social issues Fish is important to the diet of North Koreans. Pollock is considered a favorite fish of most Koreans. Food stores in self-sufficient urban neighborhoods typically sell fish. The only exception to controlled markets is the peasant market, where surplus fish is sold at free-market prices based on supply and demand. In the public distribution system of North Korea, ocean fishermen and others doing heavy work are allotted more grain than government and party officials engaged in less strenuous physical activities. Fishing boats may be owned by cooperative organizations ‚Äì instead of directly by the state ‚Äì according to the constitution of North Korea. Young people might have simple fishing equipment to fish recreationally. The Coastal Security Bureau is responsible for policing and protecting the nation's fishing areas. At the county level, the county Cooperative Farm Management Committees include fishery agents if there are fisheries in the county. The military of North Korea is related to fishing in many ways. Not only is it heavily involved in fishing, but conscription affects how people relate to the economic sector in complex ways. Fishing is conducted under military supervision to prevent defections. Fishermen hand over their catch to the production unit they are assigned to, which in turn gives the fish to the military. The military uses it to feed troops, who are in line with the Songun (\\"military-first\\") policy privileged for food. Men in North Korea have to spend several years conscripted in the military. For them, it improves the chances of getting a good job after discharge. A sailor trained as a radio operator, for example, later might be assigned as the radio operator on a civilian fishing boat. They may also have experience due to the fact that soldiers have to supplement their rations, fishing being one way to do so. For women, the long absence of men from the workforce causes hardship. Women have for instance had to work in their place in fish-processing plants in temperatures well below freezing. A struggle over the control of fisheries between the military and Jang Song- thaek was the final straw leading to the latter's downfall and purge in 2013.

On August 29, 1970, Mu√±oz and fellow Chicano activist Ramses Noriega organized a peaceful march in East Los Angeles, California in which over 30,000 Mexican Americans were in attendance to protest the war in Vietnam. The event became a site of police brutality after sheriffs attacked and tear gassed the crowd, leading to the deaths of three people, including Mu√±oz's friend and Chicano journalist Ruben Salazar.  Early life and activism  Mu√±oz was a University of California, Los Angeles student who gained attention because of his position as class president, his strong position on Chicano politics, and his nonviolent protest ethics. Mu√±oz developed his Chicano identity and politics through inspiration from the Chicano Blowouts and in conversation with other Chicanos such as Moctesuma Esparza. Mu√±oz describes how he became attracted to the idea of Chicano nationalism through influences from Reies Lopez Tijerina, but \\"never became obsessed about the idea of the original homeland of the Aztecs somehow being the Chicano homeland as well,\\" or the concept of Aztl√°n. Instead, Mu√±oz became more focused on what he referred to as creating more \\"concrete and practical social change\\" through activism: \\"I never fully became an idealogue.\\" Mu√±oz was appointed as the United Mexican American Students (UMAS) student-faculty representative and chaired the committee on Chicano and Black student recruitment at UCLA. He advocated for the need \\"to recruit Chicano and Black students who might not meet the requirements of the UC system, and specifically at UCLA, but who showed promise and potential,\\" including many students who had participated in the walkouts. Mu√±oz notes how the school wanted to recruit more \\"minority students\\" yet wanted to maintain the requirements of high GPA and SAT test scores, yet expressed that it was these stringent requirements which were actively excluding Chicano and Black students at schools such as East L.A. High School. His recommendation was adopted as the High Potential Program. The increasing visibility of Chicano student activism led to racist backlash, which eventually led to Mu√±oz resigning from student government. However, when the president later resigned, this opened a spot for Mu√±oz to run for the position, which he did with Ramses Noriega as his campaign manager. Mu√±oz notes how this was a part of his identity formation: \\"I ran as a Chicano. I was no longer Ross Mu√±oz. I was Rosalio Mu√±oz.\\" He ran on a progressive platform, advocating for campus support for the United Farm Workers, disarming campus police, rent control in the apartments surrounding campus, and against the U.S. war in Vietnam. Mu√±oz won with over 60 percent of the vote and became the first Chicano student president at UCLA (1968-69).  Chicano Moratorium  On August 29, 1970, Mu√±oz recalled that the march of 30,000, which included \\"a Black delegation from the Che Lumumba branch of the Communist Party; a representative from the Young Lords; a Puerto Rican youth group similar to the Brown Berets; and Anglo-American members of the local Peace Action Council,\\" was being closely watched by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who described it as \\"boisterous\\" and \\"cheerful.\\" Mu√±oz received a hug from Ruben Salazar, who congratulated him for the success of the march: \\"You did it. You really did it.\\" Organizers and other participants shared in a feeling of accomplishment over the event. Mu√±oz and Rams√©s Noriega had planned the event as a part of a series of protests throughout the Southwestern United States that would eventually culminate in the East Los Angeles march in August. The march was described by scholar Lorena Oropeza as \\"one of the largest assemblages of Mexican Americans ever.\\" Mu√±oz opened the post-march rally stating \\"A year ago, when we started organizing against the war, there were very few of us,\\" but now \\"a powerful call for social change\\" had been created. Mu√±oz proclaimed that \\"we have to begin organizing on the issue of police brutality, we have to bring an end to this oppression.\\" In a bit of tragic irony, as noted by Oropeza, \\"shortly afterward, the bulk of demonstrators were running from the park in order to flee an assault by sheriff's deputies.\\"  Sabotage by police informer  Mu√±oz was sabotaged and ousted as leader of the Chicano Moratorium by Eustacio (Frank) Martinez, who was 21 years old at the time. At a press conference at the Los Angeles Press Club in 1972, Martinez admitted that he had worked as a police informer among Chicano activists in Texas and California. Martinez stated that he had become an informant and agent provocateur for the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Enforcement Division (ATF) of the U.S. Treasury Department after being arrested for possession of an illegal weapon in July 1969. Martinez was approached by an ATF agent referred to as \\"Tito Garcia\\" who stated that he \\"would not be charged for the Federal Firearms violation if he would work as informant and agent provocateur for that agency.\\" He carried out assignments of infiltrating the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) and the Brown Berets in Houston and Kingsville. Under the instruction of ATF agents Fernando Ramos and Jim Riggs, Martinez committed illegal acts \\"which allowed the police to make arrests and raid headquarters of the Chicano Moratorium Committee.\\" Martinez spread rumors about Mu√±oz, who was chairman of the Chicano Moratorium Committee, that he was \\"too soft\\" and \\"not militant enough.\\" This led to the ousting of Mu√±oz, who was replaced by Martinez himself in November 1970. Martinez continued as chairman until March 1971. In August 1971, on the anniversary of the Chicano Moratorium, Martinez was charged with inciting a riot and interfering with a police officer, orders he had received from the ATF. However, Martinez stated that Riggs appeared and attempted to force him to plead guilty, \\"with the intention of sending him back to Texas.\\" Martinez went public at this time, stating the he did so \\"for the simple reason that I was beginning to be aware that our people were being railroaded, and for another thing, I was being sold out. I had good intentions for working with the government. I believed in it. When I began to see how corrupt the government was in destroying my people, I couldn't see it anymore.\\" Martinez remarked, \\"[I]t does not pay to be an informer, because when they no longer need you, they'll frame you.\\"  1971 letter to the Los Angeles Times  Mu√±oz authored a letter to the editor of the Los Angeles Times in 1971, \\"in response to your [the Times'] plea for some social facts to understand the strained situation between Chicanos and the police.\\" In the letter, Mu√±oz details how \\"the current conflict between Chicanos and the police is a political confrontation that historically has its roots in the mid-1800s.\\" He described the mass deportation of Mexican Repatriation (1929-36) by border patrol and law enforcement as a critical event which \\"strained and intensified the anger of people of Mexican descent toward the law and law enforcement.\\" Mu√±oz also recorded how the Zoot Suit Riots (1943) were framed by the press as being initiated by the zoot suiters, who applied a \\"historically permanent label that implied 'the Mexicans did it,' thereby simultaneously protecting the servicemen from public ridicule.\\" Mu√±oz then cites a police department's \\"biological basis\\" report, which stated that \\"people of Mexican descent were biologically prone to criminal behavior.\\" Mu√±oz described that Chicano protest action against discriminatory educational institutions, the Catholic Church, and the U.S. government's involvement in Vietnam has always been \\"met with police-initiated political violence.\\" As a result, Mu√±oz described that Chicanos as well as the Black community are living in a \\"totalitarian-like atmosphere within a broader Los Angeles community,\\" especially in the absence of political representation. Mu√±oz warned against the rise of the police in the United States as a \\"more powerful political force in our increasingly less-free democratic society,\\" citing the Skolnic Report to the U.S. National Commission of the Causes and Prevention of Violence, which determined that \\"the ranks of law enforcement have become an ultraconservative social force which shrilly protest positive change.\\" As a result, Mu√±oz concluded that \\"rather than calling off our protest, and returning to a life of fear under police totalitarian aggression we have to continue to protest for purposes of survival.\\"  Additional resources  * Online Archive of California, Rosalio Mu√±oz papers, 1938-2012 * KCET, 31 August 2011, The Mu√±oz Family: Civil Rights Activists  References  External links  * Image of Rosalio Mu√±oz and Richard Martinez speaking at a press conference, 1971.

The river originates in the north of the d√©partement of Aisne, near Molain and flows northwest to its confluence with the Scheldt. It is long. History In 57 BC, the Selle was the site of the Battle of the Sabis between Julius Caesar and the Nervians, Atrebates and Viromandui.Pierre Turquin (\\"La Bataille de la Selle (du Sabis) en l' An 57 avant J.-C.\\" in Les √âtudes Classiques 23/2 (1955), 113-156) has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the battle was fought near modern Saulzoir. In the Middle Ages, the river was a boundary between the lands of Hainaut and Cambrai. In World War I, during the Hundred Days Offensive of 1918, the German Army had taken up positions along the Selle near Le Cateau. General Rawlinson's Fourth Army spent two weeks preparing to assault these positions. The attack was launched on the night of 17 October when the river was crossed in foggy conditions and continued until the Germans were finally forced to retire on 20 October.

It was probably the first company in the world to focus entirely on the cryptographic market. In December 1914, two Swedes; Olof Gyld√©n, a navy officer with an interest in cryptography; and Arvid Gerhard Damm, a Swedish engineer and inventor, met in Berlin to discuss Damm's ideas for a new type of crypto machine. Impressed, Gyld√©n managed to interest a group of Swedish businessmen to invest in a project to exploit Damm's ideas commercially. A patent consortium, Cryptograph, was founded in June 1915. A year later, a shareholding company with the same name was established with Gyld√©n as chairman and CEO. Damm was given the position of engineer and was also a shareholder. Expectations were great and sales estimated at more than 50 desktop machines and 500 handheld devices per year. However, actual sales were far below these numbers, and although Damm made inventions and designed new machines, the financial situation deteriorated. With the infusion of new money, primarily from Emanuel Nobel in 1922, the company was kept alive and machines continued to be produced, but success proved elusive. In 1922, Boris Hagelin was employed as controller, and in 1925 he was in charge of the company. He was the son of K W Hagelin, a close associate of Emanuel Nobel. In 1928, in competition with the Z√§hlwerk Enigma he managed to secure an order from the Swedish General Staff for a newly developed machine, the B-21. It was based on the ideas of Damm's B-13, but equipped with a battery and an Enigma style lamp field. In 1930, the Cryptograph company was terminated with all patent rights transferred to Boris Hagelin's company Ingeni√∂rsfirman Teknik which in turn was renamed Cryptoteknik in 1939. It stayed in business until 1958 when all activities were transferred to Boris Hagelin's Swiss company Crypto AG, founded in 1952.

Chu is a leader in the field of human-robot interactions. Her graduate work focused on building algorithms that enable robots to interact with and learn from their environments. Chu led the development of the healthcare support robot known as Moxi, who eases the burden on healthcare workers by completing tedious but critical tasks. Chu was also the youngest woman listed in Robohub's 2016 list of ‚Äú25 Women in Robotics You Need To Know‚Äù and a 2019 MIT Technology Review Innovator Under 35.  Early life and education  Chu was born in San Jose, California. Growing up, she lived with her parents, who were both software engineers, and her grandparents. Seeing the burden placed on her parents as her grandparents aged, Chu became motivated to pursue a career that would allow her to address the need to help increase the autonomy of the elderly as they age and relieve the burden on family and healthcare workers. Chu pursued her bachelors in electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. During her time at UC Berkeley, Chu worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dennis K. Lieu where she worked on integrated flywheels in triple hybrid drive trains. She graduated with her Bachelors of Science in 2009, and pursued work in Silicon Valley at IBM Almaden Research which is an innovation lab that pioneers breakthroughs in disruptive technology. Chu specifically worked in Natural Language Processing and intelligent information integration. In 2011, Chu left her position at IBM Almaden to pursue her Master's at the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Chu focused in Robotics under the mentorship of Katherine Kuchenbecker in the Haptics Research Group as a part of the GRASP Lab. Chu focused on haptics, essentially enabling robots with the ability to touch and interact with things in the environment and understand the abstract terms that humans would use to describe the feeling of that interaction. For example, a human may say a carpet is fuzzy, but Chu's algorithms would enable a robot to sense the rug, perform a computation, and also associate that ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù with the adjective or descriptor of fuzzy. Chu and her colleagues were able to train PR2 robots equipped with haptic sensors to touch objects and relate the information from the sensor with the human-provided adjective for the haptic quality of the object. The robot was able to learn these associations and then later generalize its learning to objects it had not yet touched and provide an adjective descriptor similar to one a human might use to describe the objects feel. These achievements were reported in Chu's first author paper in 2013 which was awarded Best Paper in Cognitive Robotics at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics. Chu's Master's work is critical to innovating robots that are able to effectively interact with humans. Since interacting with humans requires natural language learning and the ability to associate words with concepts and experiences in the environment, it is critical that we create robots that can understand language and meaning of words based on sensory experiences. After completing her Master's in 2013, Chu conducted a summer internship at Honda Research Institute and then pursued her graduate training at Georgia Tech. Chu conducted her PhD in Robotics and worked under the mentorship of Andrea L. Thomaz in the Socially Intelligent Machines Lab and under the mentorship of Sonia Chernova in the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning Lab. Her graduate work focused on building algorithms that enable robots to reason about action effects and interact with their environments in an adaptable way. Chu was inspired by a talk in developmental psychology discussing how children learn to interact with their environments. She figured that she could approach robot learning in this way as well, giving robots the basic building blocks of cognition so that they could play with objects in the environment and learn the appropriate ways to interact with them. Chu based her design on applying human-guided robot self-exploration to learn affordances. Affordances are all of the possible ways that an actor may interact with an object in the environment. Chu built algorithms that enabled robots with both self guided and supervised learning of the affordances of objects in the environment. She showed that the combination of both self and supervised learning allows for the best robot performance. Chu's work on human-robot interactions will one day enable robots to interact with humans and provide support, with a particular focus on the elderly, such that they can continue to live dignified and rewarding lives for as long as possible. Chu filed a patent with her mentor Thomaz in 2017 for her novel technology and she completed her PhD in 2017 as well.  Career and research  In 2015, Chu spent one summer working as an Intern at Google[x] under the mentorship of Leila Takayama. Chu then began working alongside her mentor Andrea Thomaz, to create a company with a goal of building socially intelligent robots that can assist people with chores both at work and home. In 2017, Chu and Thomaz co- founded Diligent Robotics. The goal of the company is to lessen the burden of tedious, time-consuming, and menial tasks such that people are able to spend more time making a positive impact in the lives of others and doing things they enjoy. After graduating from her PhD in 2018, Chu became the full-time Chief Technology Officer at Diligent Robotics. She now leads a diverse team of roboticists who build robots that feature autonomous mobile manipulation, social intelligence, and human-guided learning abilities, inspired by Chu's graduate discoveries. = Diligent Robotics = To achieve this goal, Diligent Robots released the clinical assistant robot named Poli. Poli is a robot with one arm, and is able to pre-fetch kits of often used supplies. Poli frees up time for nursing staff to have more time with patients. Poli was piloted at Seton Medical Center at the University of Texas in Austin. After designing Poli, Diligent Robotics brought to the fore their next healthcare support robot named Moxi. Moxi is a refurbished and updated version of Poli. Moxi possesses more human-like features including a face that can visually communicate social cues and a head and torso. These improvements were made to provide comfort and enhance the social interactions it has with humans. Chu and Thomaz have designed Moxi to change the misconceptions that robots have to be an view of robots have to work in isolation, to one where they become a part of a friendly and social team environment at work.

The hryvnia has been the national currency of Ukraine since 1996.  Etymology  Kyiv hryvnia in 11-12 century, reproduction by the National Bank of Ukraine The word ‚Äúhryvnia‚Äù in Kyiv Rus' firstly meant a decoration worn at the nape of the neck during Kyiv Rus' times and often served as a measure of weight at that time. The first mention of \\"hryvnia\\" in the meaning of currency is found in \\"The Tale of Bygone Years\\" between 8 and 9 centuries. The chronicle tells: Prince Oleg the Prophet, coming from the North, began to rule in Kyiv and \\"established to give the Vikings from Novgorod three hundred hryvnias a year, for peace. That is, already in the 8-9 centuries when conducting trade operations or paying tribute, the hryvnia was used as a measure of weight and counting. In the 11 century, the word \\"hryvnia\\" got a different meaning ‚Äî weight. During 11 century silver hryvnia weighing between 160 and 205 grams, depending on the type appeared in Kyiv Rus'. There were several types of hryvnias. The most common one in circulation was called the Kyiv hryvnia. It had a hexagonal shape and weighed 150 grams of silver. This money existed before the Tatar invasion. In addition, there were the Novgorod hryvnias, initially known only in the north-western lands. The Novgorod hryvnias had the appearance of long silver sticks and weighed 240 grams. The Chernihiv hryvnia was transitional from Kyiv's to Novgorod's hryvnia. It had a very close shape to Kyiv's and in weight as Novgorod's hryvnia.  Coin production  Chernihiv hryvnia, 11 century The first Ukrainian money made of gold and silver were produced during the rule of Kyiv Prince Volodymyr the Great. These coins had an image of a trident which was the symbol of Kyivan princes. The name of the coins were zlatnyks (gold coins) and sriblianyks (silver coins). The two sides of the golden coin depicted Prince Volodymyr and Jesus Christ. The silver coins were minted by Kyivan princes as well as in other principalities (e.g. Chernihiv, Novgorod). In 12-14 centuries Kyiv Rus' appeared in a decline and didn't mint coins. The population and feudals began using silver ingots called hryvnias to replace the deficient gold or silver coins minted by Kyiv Rus' princes previously. In the middle of the 14 century the new coins started being minted by Lviv and Kyiv rulers. Thus, hryvnia (silver ingot) slowly went out of circulation and remained as a unit of counting.  1917-1921  100 hryvnia's banknote of the Ukrainian People's republic (1918) During the Ukrainian Revolution in 1917‚Äì1921, the establishment of the national currency was of a primary importance for Ukrainian state. On 22 December 1917, the Central Council established Ukraine's state bank. Mykhailo Kryvetskyi was appointed to the director of the bank. He signed the first banknote (100 karbovanets banknote) issued by Ukrainian People's Republic on 5 January 1918. One karbovanets equaled to 0.767 grams of gold. In the design of the 100 karbovanets banknote there has been used the trident ‚Äî a major symbol depicted on golden and silver coins minted by Volodymyr the Great. On 1 March 1918, the Central Council introduced a new currency, the hryvnia, which consisted of 100 shahs and equaled 1/2 of a previously issued by the government Ukrainian karbovanets. In April 1918, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky again introduced the karbovanets as the main currency of Ukraine. It consisted of 200 shahs. Banknotes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 1,000 karbovanets were issued.  Since 1991  ‚Ç¥500 banknote In 1991 the National Bank of Ukraine started emission of coupons karbovanets. In September 1996, a currency reform was performed by National Bank of Ukraine and its head Viktor Yushchenko. As a result, a new currency called hryvnia was introduced. The National Bank of Ukraine issued 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 banknotes and minted 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 kopiikas. As for early 2020 the National Bank of Ukraine issued 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 banknotes with the plan to stop issuing 10-hryvnia banknote denomination in June and replacing it with a coin.

Description Leptospermum rupicola is a low-growing shrub that typically grows to a height or less. It has thin, firm bark, the younger stems with flattened hairs at first and a conspicuous flange. The leaves are narrow lance-shaped, about long and wide with a sharp point on the tip and tapering at the base but without a petiole. The flowers are white, wide and are borne singly on short side shoots from adjacent leaf axils. There are a few reddish- brown bracts at the base of the young flower buds but they are soon shed. The floral cup is glabrous, about long and the sepals about long. The petals are about long and the stamens long. Flowering mainly occurs from March to May and from September to October. The fruit is a capsule in diameter, the sepals having fallen off, and that remains on the plant when mature. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum rupicola was first formally described in 1989 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea, based on plant material collected by Ernest Constable at Nellie's Glen near Blackheath in 1957.

The film is produced by actor Nithin Sathya and is about two corrupt policemen played by Vaibhav and Venkat Prabhu. Nithin Sathya had previously worked with Vaibhav and Venkat Prabhu in Chennai 600028 II. The title Lock Up was chosen because the film is about a police lock-up and is based on several true incidents.

Venkat Prabhu portrays the antagonist for the first time in his career.  Soundtrack  Release  Lock Up was released on 14 August 2020 on the over-the-top (OTT) media service ZEE5. It was initially scheduled for a theatrical release in November 2019 after post-production work had been completed. However, the delay of the film and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic meant that the theatrical release was dropped in favour of an OTT release.  Reception  The Times of India gave the film a rating of three out of five stars and noted that \\"A positive factor is the lack of unnecessary deviation from the main plot and the way unsolved sub-plots are connected in the latter half\\". Hindustan Times wrote that \\"Lock Up is a praiseworthy attempt in the investigative thriller space. It‚Äôs also one of the better Tamil films among the recent direct OTT releases.

She worked for AFP in France in 1979 and as a foreign correspondent from 1980 to 1988. Kauffmann joined Le Monde as Moscow correspondent in 1988 and later Eastern and Central Europe correspondent from 1989 to 1993. She worked in the United States from 1993 to 2001 and Latin America in 2002 and 2003. Kauffman was appointed deputy chief editor of Le Monde in 2003 and covering Southeast Asia as reporter-in-large from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, she was appointed the newspaper's first woman editor-in chief, serving in the role until 2011. BiographyEducation= Kauffmann was born on 30 October 1955 in Marseille, France, to a military doctor. She earned degrees from the Centre de Formation des Journalistes (English: Training Centre for Journalists) in Paris, the Instituts d'√©tudes politiques, the Sciences Po Aix, the University of Provence and a degree in Spanish from Bilbao's University of Deusto. =Career= In 1979, Kauffmann began her career in journalism as the French desk for the French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP). One year later, she was made a foreign correspondent for the agency, spending 1980 to 1984 in London and 1984 from 1985 in Warsaw, Noum√©a in 1985, and then in Moscow between 1986 and 1988, during the period of Glasnost and Perestroika. Kauffmann joined Le Monde as its Moscow correspondent in 1988. The following year, she was made Eastern and Central Europe correspondent, covering the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the political changes of Eastern Europe's new democracies converting to a market economy. Kauffmann was moved by Le Monde to the United States in 1993, serving as Washington correspondent, until she was made New York Bureau Chief in 1996, serving in the position until 2001. According to The New York Times, Kauffman's \\"coverage of the United States was considered particularly objective and admirable, given the ambivalent relationship France has often had with the United States\\", observing the Presidency of Bill Clinton and the emergence of the Internet. In 1998 and 1999, she participated in the French-American Foundation's Young Leaders programme. She returned to Paris in 2001 but was sent back to New York later in the year to cover the Aftermath of the September 11 attacks as reporter-as-large. Kauffman's article collection of the attacks entitled Chronicle of America at War earned her the Prix AFRI-Thucydide international journalism award. From 2002 to 2003, she travelled to Latin America to cover the Argentine financial crisis, the election of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva as President of Brazil and Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency in Venezuela. In 2003, Kauffmann returned to Le Monde's Paris headquarters and became part of the editorial team when she was appointed deputy chief editor, becoming responsible for the newspaper's major reporters, and leading its in-depth reporting section. She continued in the role until 2004, when she was made managing editor of the newspaper until 2006. Kauffman was then made correspondent and reporter-at-large for Le Monde based in Singapore, covering Southeast Asia, Burma, the Philippines, China and India with a weekly column. √âric Fottorino asked her in late 2009 to consider an improved articulation of information for the newspaper and its website. Kauffmann was appointed editor- in-chief of Le Monde by Fottorino on 18 January 2010, succeeding Alain Frachon whose two-year term in the position had ended in 2009 and becoming the first woman to hold the post. During her tenure as executive director, she indicated her desire to improve the print newspaper and website, transforming Le Monde into ‚Äúthe paper that never sleeps.‚Äù Kauffmann also oversaw the collaboration of WikiLeaks with El Pais, The Guardian and The New York Times. In 2011, she was one of 13 candidates to apply for the position of director of Le Monde. Although the newspaper staff supported Kauffmann's candidacy, the owners Pierre Berg√©, Xavier Niel and Matthieu Pigasse and a selection committee rejected her and appointed √ârik Izraelewicz as director of Le Monde. She left the post of editor-in-chief soon after, but remained at Le Monde as an editor. Kauffmann contributes to the opinion pages of The New York Times International Edition, is a member of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism's advisory board, works for the AFP's non-profit media development arm AFP Foundation as a board member, is part of the European Press Prize's panel of judges, is a member of the European Group of the Trilateral Commission, the Google Advisory Council, and regularly appears on the France Culture radio programme L'Esprit public.

Its three goals are: protecting CAF personnel and capability, assessing CAF capabilities to respond to a pandemic, and assisting other government departments in the event of a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada Operation LASER was first activated on March 2, 2020; with escalation to Phase 3 of the operation on March 13, 2020. Under Operation LASER, military medical personnel and resources were deployed to certain long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario to assist with operating those facilities. These deployments were authorized by the Department of National Defence at the request of those provinces' premiers, Fran√ßois Legault and Doug Ford. Operation LASER during the COVID-19 pandemicBackground: Long-term care facilities = \\"Thank You Heros\\" sign at a long-term care home in Ontario Long-term care homes were impacted heavily by the pandemic; on April 13, CPHO Theresa Tam reported that at least half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada had been linked to long-term care homes (with the exact number varying by province), and that \\"these deaths will continue to increase, even as the epidemic growth rate slows down. Tam cited factors such as outside visitors, communal living spaces, and staff being transferred among multiple facilities, as particular vulnerabilities. The pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing staffing issues at some facilities, including underpaid staff, and being understaffed in general. On April 28, Tam stated that as many of 79 percent of Canada's COVID-19 fatalities occurred in long-term care homes. Health Canada issued recommendations for long-term care homes, encouraging them to restrict outside visitors and volunteers, restrict employees from being transferred between multiple facilities, provide personal protective equipment, enforce physical distancing during meals, screen staff and essential visitors, On April 15, Trudeau announced that the federal government planned to provide additional pay to long-term care workers. =CAF involvement= On April 17, the Department of National Defence (DND) agreed that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) could deploy in Quebec at Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF). They agreed to send 100 military personnel in response to a request by Premier Francois Legault. On April 20, the CAF deployed in Quebec. Lieutenant-Commander Heather Galbraith said that the only uniforms her soldiers would be wearing was medical scrubs. On April 22, Doug Ford placed a request that the CAF come to the aid of Ontario's LTCF, just like Francois Legault had done previously in Quebec. On May 7, the CAF reported that it had deployed \\"almost all of its medical capacity\\" in Quebec LTCF. \\"The Canadian military has stripped bases across the country of their uniformed medical personnel to support long-term care homes in Quebec that have been overrun by COVID-19.\\" At the time, in Ontario, 250 soldiers worked in five LTCFs. By middle of May, Quebec would see 1,350 soldiers in 25 LTCFs. On 13 May, the functions of the so-called Joint Task Force LASER (JTF-LR) were assumed by the Canadian Joint Operations Command, headquartered in Ottawa. Previously, they had been delegated to the 1st Canadian Division Headquarters in Kingston. On May 15, the CAF declared that four soldiers in Quebec and one in Ontario had tested positive for COVID-19 disease. Nearly 1,700 members of the CAF were at that time deployed. One deployment was to a LTCF in Montreal \\"where residents had been nearly abandoned by the staff.\\" The CAF stated that: On May 15, it came to light that soldiers from the 12e R√©giment blind√© du Canada were posted to the LTCFs around Montreal. This meant that 2nd Canadian Division, whose CO is Brigadier-General Gervais Carpentier, and which is based in CFB Montreal, had been deployed there. On May 21, the DND announced that it had seen a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 infections in the previous week, from five to 28. A total of 1,400 had been serving in Operation LASER at 25 LTCF including in Montreal, where the disease was spreading widely the previous week. The photographs disseminated show soldiers with bare hands and in tshirt-style medical scrubs while DND emphasized: LCol James Stocker, who commands the Queen's York Rangers under the 4th Canadian Division of Brigadier-General CJJ Mialkowski, said: \\"I think they are quite well prepared for the task.\\" This military contingent was increased to 1,675 soldiers by May 21. The DND spokesperson would not release, when asked, the detailed statistical data that would allow the public to infer about the problems. In addition to \\"the guidelines laid down by the military's medical branch\\", the DND takes instructions from the PHAC and provincial authorities on the PPE that are distributed to the soldiers. \\"At the Vigi Mont Royal LTCF in Montreal, soldiers started out wearing N-95 masks but shifted to using full shields, visors and hoods when reports surfaced that the virus was being spread through the ventilation system.\\" It came to light on this day that Operation LASER deployment is not classified by DND as a \\"special duty\\" operation. On 25 May, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence Anita Vandenbeld disclosed to the third sitting of the resumed 43rd Canadian Parliament that 36 soldiers from Operation LASER had been infected with COVID-19 disease. Vandenbeld corrected for the record Cheryl Gallant who had been under the mistaken impression that only 28 soldiers (12 positives in Ontario and 16 in Quebec) had been infected. The next day, it was disclosed that the Ontario OpLASER LTCFs suffered in human resources from a form of disrepair, decay and dilapidation. The DND chose this day to release a letter by BGen Mialkowski dated 14 May in which he reported the unvarnished truth as he and his soldiers found it. The five Ontario OpLASER LCTFs can be found below. On 27 June, the military said that 40 per cent of COVID-positive troops deployed to long-term care homes were asymptomatic. The troops, 55 of whom tested positive, were not tested by the military but rather by the care homes. General Jonathan Vance and the deputy Surgeon-General Marc Bilodeau said that the troops may have infected themselves in hotels where they were billeted. Out of the 55 troops who contracted the disease, only four remain ill; the balance have recovered and none were hospitalized. The military acknowledged it had no uniform testing program for troops and the CPHO was unavailable for comment.

Biology and medicine The discovery of modern anesthesia in the 19th century was an early breakthrough in the elimination of pain during surgery, but acceptance was not universal. Some medical practitioners at the time believed that anesthesia was an artificial and harmful intervention in the body's natural response to injury. Opposition to anesthesia has since dissipated, however the prospect of eradicating pain raises similar concerns about interfering with life's natural functions. People who are naturally incapable of feeling pain or unpleasant sensations due to rare conditions like pain asymbolia or congenital insensitivity to pain have been studied to discover the biological and genetic reasons for their pain-free lives. A Scottish woman with a previously unreported genetic mutation in a FAAH pseudogene (dubbed FAAH-OUT) with resultant elevated anandamide levels was reported in 2019 to be immune to anxiety, unable to experience fear, and insensitive to pain. The frequent burns and cuts she had due to her full hypoalgesia healed quicker than average. In 1990, Medical Hypotheses published an article by L. S. Mancini on the \\"genetic engineering of a world without pain\\": The development of gene editing techniques like CRISPR has raised the prospect that \\"scientists can identify the causes of certain unusual people's physical superpowers and use gene editing to grant them to others.\\" Geneticist George Church has commented on the potential future of replacing pain with a painless sensory system: Ethics and philosophy Ethicists and philosophers in the schools of hedonism and utilitarianism, especially negative utilitarianism, have debated the merits of eradicating suffering. Transhumanist philosopher David Pearce, in The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), argues that the abolition of suffering is both technically feasible and an issue of moral urgency: Nick Bostrom, director of the Future of Humanity Institute, advises a more cautious approach due to pain's function in protecting individuals from harm. However, Bostrom supports the core idea of using biotechnology to get rid of \\"a huge amount of unnecessary and undeserved suffering.\\" Animal welfare In 2009, Adam Shriver suggested replacing animals in factory farming with genetically engineered animals with a reduced or absent capacity to suffer and feel pain. Shriver and McConnachie argued that people who wish to improve animal welfare should support gene editing in addition to plant-based diets and cultured meat. Katrien Devolder and Matthias Eggel proposed gene editing research animals to remove pain and suffering. This would be an intermediate step towards eventually stopping all experimentation on animals and adopting alternatives. Concerning wild-animal suffering, CRISPR-based gene drives have been suggested as a cost-effective way of spreading benign alleles in sexually reproducing species. To limit gene drives spreading indefinitely (for test programmes, for example), the Sculpting Evolution group at the MIT Media Lab developed a self-exhausting form of CRISPR-based gene drive called a \\"daisy- chain drive.\\" For potential adverse effects of a gene drive, \\"[s]everal genetic mechanisms for limiting or eliminating gene drives have been proposed and/or developed, including synthetic resistance, reversal drives, and immunizing reversal drives.\\" See also * Antinaturalism * Appeal to nature * Biohappiness * Effective altruism * Suffering-focused ethics * Transhumanism ReferencesFurther reading  * Category:Animal welfare Category:Bioethics Category:Biotechnology Category:Consequentialism Category:Genetic engineering Category:Genome editing Category:Hedonism Category:Pain Category:Suffering Category:Transhumanism Category:Utilitarianism ","title":"Eradication of suffering"},{"id":"64072552","text":"Gregory Michael \\"Greg\\" Sowders (born March 17, 1960) is an American drummer and music publisher. He is a founding member of alternative country and Paisley Underground band the Long Ryders, and Senior Vice President and Head of A&R; at Warner Chappell Music in the United States. Early life Sowders grew up in Los Angeles and studied history at UCLA. As a child, his parents took him to his first concert with Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and the Everly Brothers. \\"When I heard that beat, I knew I wanted to play the drums,\\" Sowders said in 2017. While he was still in elementary school, his older brother went to college and left Sowders his Rolling Stones, Beatles, Beach Boys, and Chuck Berry collections. \\"And I started listening to this stuff. As I got older - in the late 1960s, early 1970s - I started listening to all that British rock and roll music.\\" In the late 1970s, he became interested in punk rock, and would cite the Ramones, Patti Smith, the Stooges, the Dictators, the Blasters, and X as his favorite artists at the time. Musical career In 1979, Sowders co- founded the Box Boys, one of the first Los Angeles-based ska bands that helped launch the ska and mod revival in Los Angeles in 1979 and 1980. They released two singles in 1980 before they disbanded. Sowders joined the nascent Long Ryders in 1982, recording three albums and an EP with the band before their breakup in 1987. The band reached the charts in the UK and gained a sizable cult following in the US while being popular on college radio. The band's take on American musical traditions was especially a success with critics in the UK, with Melody Maker calling their full-length debut, 1984's Native Sons, \\"a modern American classic\\". Extensive touring in the US and Europe helped make them one of the most successful independent bands at the time. After two independent label releases, the Long Ryders signed a major label deal with Island Records, who released the albums State of Our Union (1985) and Two- Fisted Tales (1987). State of Our Union became the band's best selling album and included their UK chart single and signature song \\"Looking for Lewis and Clark\\". The Long Ryders would later be regarded as a major influence on the alt-country movement that emerged in the 1990s. After the dissolution of the Long Ryders, Sowders and fellow Long Ryder Sid Griffin formed the Coal Porters in Los Angeles in 1989. The band continued in the same musical vein as the Long Ryders and later relocated to England without Sowders, who had retired from performing. Sowders did, however, occasionally do live performances and studio sessions with the Coal Porters, guesting on their albums Rebels Without Applause (1991), Land of Hope and Crosby (1994) and Los London (1995). Sowders also guested on former Black Crowe Marc Ford's 2002 album It's About Time. The Long Ryders have since 2004 occasionally reunited for brief reunions and, in 2019, released their first album in over 30 years, Psychedelic Country Soul. It reached No. 2 on the Official Americana Albums Chart in the UK and topped Amazon UK's Alternative Country and Americana Best Sellers chart. Music publishing Sowders worked in the Film and Television department at the performing rights organization BMI for two years before he joined Warner Chappell Music in 1991 as Manager of Film and Television. In 1994, he became Director of A&R.; He managed the rock, alternative and urban music divisions, working with artists like the Black Crowes, Lucinda Williams, Wilco, Nickelback, Staind, Rufus Wainwright, and Smash Mouth. He was promoted to the position of Senior Vice-President of A&R; in 2004 and, in 2008, also Head of A&R; in the United States. His responsibilities includes overseeing all of Warner Chappell's A&R; departments in Los Angeles and New York, excluding the Urban department. In connection with Sowders' promotion to Head of A&R;, former CEO for Warner Chappell Music Scott Francis stated, \\"He is a true music publisher, and has been instrumental in identifying and developing our roster of songwriters.\\" Francis added, \\"He is a highly personable A&R; executive who understands both the creative process and business side. Greg is driven by a passion for music and a devotion to Warner Chappell's songwriters.\\" By 2018, Sowders' career signings included Katy Perry, Green Day, the Deftones, Slash, David Byrne, and Rob Zombie, and the same year he extended his employment at Warner Chappell. Personal life Sowders married singer Lucinda Williams in 1986, but the couple divorced within a year and a half. He has since remarried. Sowders said in 2019: \\"If I had nothing at all to do with music, man, I‚Äôd do something with motorcycles. I‚Äôve ridden motorcycles my whole life. I‚Äôd probably work in a motorcycle shop or something. I never had to have a Plan B, and I certainly didn‚Äôt prepare for one.\\" DiscographyThe Box Boys= *\\"Uptown Yankee Ska\\" (1980, Zone-H) *\\"Skaletons from the Closet\\" (1980, M.A.O.) =The Long Ryders= *10-5-60 (1983, PVC) *Native Sons (1984, Frontier) *State of Our Union (1985, Island) *Two-Fisted Tales (1987, Island) *BBC Radio One Live in Concert (1994, Windsong) *Three Minute Warnings: the Long Ryders Live in New York City (2003, Prima) *State of Our Reunion (2004, Prima) *Psychedelic Country Soul (2019, Cherry Red / Omnivore) References Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from California Category:American drummers Category:American alternative country musicians Category:Americana musicians Category:American music publishers (people) ","title":"Greg Sowders"},{"id":"64072558","text":"Robert Campbell (19 December 1814 - 29 December 1868) was a Scottish advocate and hymn writer.

She wrote to support women's suffrage, anti-vivisection and anti-vaccination. Life Grove was born in 1863. Her parents were Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane-Fox and Alice Margaret (1828‚Äì1910, born Stanley). Her elder brother was the electrical engineer St George Lane Fox- Pitt. Unlike her siblings, who were primarily educated at home, she went to the Oxford High School. After a huge inheritance of Rushmore, a 29,000 acre estate in Dorset, from her father's cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, her father and her eldest brother took the name Fox Pitt-Rivers on 25 May 1880. She, like the other eight children in the family, took the name Fox- Pitt. Her use of the name was short-lived as in 1883 she married Walter John Grove. Assisted by her father's inheritance their honeymoon was extravagant, including a three month holiday in the USA where she met leading families such as the Vanderbilts and the Hewitts. She spent her time at social events on her return, living in Grosvenor Gardens but also returning to her childhood home at Rushmore. In 1879 she began one of her legacies which was a daily diary which she kept until her death. She was a supporter of women's suffrage and as an educated aristocrat she was invited to speak at meetings after she joined the movement in 1892. She wrote supportive pieces that were published in Cornhill Magazine and the Fortnightly Review. In 1895 she met and adopted Thomas Hardy as a mentor. In 1897 her father-in-law, Sir Thomas Grove, 1st Baronet, died and she became Lady Grove of Ferne House. In 1900 she was in Paris where she spoke at the International Congress of Women. She and her husband had inherited several properties including Ferne House in 1897 but they sold it in 1902 using the money to maintain their lifestyle. from the frontispiece of her book The Social Fetich in 1907 The first book she had published in 1902 was titled 71 Days Camping in Morocco. Her book dealt with her opposition to Cunninghame Graham's book four years before on a similar subject. The following year she was employed at 10 guineas a month to write for the New Review. She was in favour of women's suffrage but she objected to both vivisection and vaccination. On the latter she was taken to court in 1905 for failing to get her son vaccinated. In 1907 her book The Social Fetich sold well. She was characterised as a \\"mystagogue\\" by G.K.Chesterton who although he was generally in favour of her views, he derided her arguments because he said she did not explain her views but he accused her of making her readers \\"painfully conscious of not understanding\\".All Things Considered, 1908, G.K.Chesterton > Her favourite method is to terrify people from doing things that are quite > harmless by telling them that if they do they are the kind of people who > would do other things, equally harmless. If you ask after somebody's mother > (or whatever it is), you are the kind of person who would have a pillow- > case, or would not have a pillow-case. In 1908 she published The Human Woman which dealt with women's citizenship and it included her speech in Paris in 1900. In 1910 she published On Fads. Grove died at her home in Wiltshire in 1926 from tuberculosis which had been diagnosed twenty years before. At the end of her life her writings were dominated by the lack of money. An inheritance arrived in 1924 but it was almost all consumed with their outstanding debts with the butcher and other suppliers. Thomas Hardy wrote a poem \\"concerning Agnes\\" after her death. Her husband survived her. Her son Gerald Grove later became the third baronet. Private life She married Walter John Grove and had five children.

Life  thumbleft Abraham Buschke, a teacher of Hans Hausteins, was a senior doctor at Rudolf Virchow Hospital in Berlin. He died in 1943 in the concentration camp in Theresienstadt. Hans Haustein studied Medicine in Freiburg im Breisgau and Berlin from 1913 to 1918. In 1920, he completed a Doctorate in Berlin. Afterwards, he received his medical licence and became a medical assistant. His teachers in the fields of Dermatology and Venereology were Abraham Buschke, at Rudolf Virchow Hospital, as well as Georg Arndt, at the dermatology clinic of the Charit√© ‚Äì Berlin University of Medicine. In 1924, soon after Haustein was made a consultant in skin diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, he opened a surgery on Kurf√ºrstendamm. This afforded him an affluent clientele of high social status. He gained a reputation as a fashionable doctor, who also treated prostitutes and supplied them with pessaries for birth control. As a consultant, he was both a colleague and a rival of Gottfried Benn, who practised on Belle-Alliance-Street, today Mehringdamm. He lived in a large house on 4 Bregenzer Street in Berlin- Wilmersdorf, which was a centre for high society. In these rooms, he hosted lavish parties at which writers, composers, painters and patrons gathered. At the time of the Weimar Republic , a large proportion of Wilmersdorf's population was Jewish. Numerous Jewish artists and writers lived in this district. Haustein, who was known for his intellectual and erotic permissiveness, was regarded as a lounge lizard . He was in a relationship with a model called Sonja, who he is said to have been sexually dependent on. Among his closest friends were the writer Lion Feuchtwanger , the composer Fred Raymond and the painter Christian Schad , who painted a portrait of him in the style of magical realism in 1928. Haustein's lover Sonja can also be seen as a shadow on the wall in this painting. Haustein was also an academic and was considered one of the leading experts in combating venereal diseases. From 1916 on, he published over 70 works, including, his seminal works such as Venereal Diseases inclusive of Prostitution and The Early History of Syphilis. From 1921 until 1923 he worked for the magazine Social Hygiene, Welfare and the Hospital System. From 1932 he led the historical section of the Department of Genetics at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Buch, Berlin. When the National Socialists rose to power in 1933, Haustein suddenly lost his upper-class status and faced discrimination and persecution. His medical license was revoked and he had to endure house searches and interrogations. On 7 July 1933 he was arrested along with other Jewish and politically unpopular doctors and was severely maltreated in a provisional concentration camp. After these experiences, Haustein had no illusions over his fate as a Jew. When the Gestapo attempted to arrest him on 12 November 1933, he killed himself with cyanide.  Background  As early as April 22, 1933, the Nazi regime revoked the medical license of Jewish and politically left wing doctors, applying the new regulations of medical admission, thereby taking away their means of existence. While communist and socialist doctors had absolutely no right to object, their Jewish colleagues, who had already had a practice during World War I or had fought on the front line, could keep practicing for the time being. However, the Nazi regime restricted the opportunity increasingly in the subsequent years and eventually prohibited all of the Jewish doctors from exercising their profession from September 30, 1938 onwards by means of the fourth act of the law of the citizens of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany. Only a few of them were given permission ‚Äì as so-called treaters of sick people ‚Äì to take exclusively care of Jewish patients. The Nazi regime thought this gradual procedure was necessary because in Berlin in 1933 2000 out of 3600 health service doctors were Jewish according to the National Social categorisation and medical care had to be ensured. Most doctors were presumably accepting of the procedure towards their Jewish colleagues and also profited from this. All of a sudden, the opportunity to take over a practice presented itself to young doctors in particular. This behaviour on the part of many doctors made it much more difficult to confront the past after the Second World War. It wasn't until recently that the role of the medical profession and Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in the era of National Socialism began to be examined. An example of this is the medical historian Rebecca Schwoch's 2009 investigation into the history of the Associations of SHI Physicians in Berlin titled ‚ÄòJewish Doctors in Berlin and their Fate in National Socialism‚Äô. The long-lasting research work was financed by the donations of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, German Medical Association and the German Medical Journal. In the subsequent period, the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Bavaria began an academic study of the fate of Jewish doctors in Nazi Germany und die √Ñrztekammer Niedersachsen ver√∂ffentlichte eine Brosch√ºre zum Gedenken an j√ºdische Kollegen. and the Medical Association of Lower Saxony published a booklet in commemoration of their Jewish colleagues. In 2018, the Scientific Services of the German Bundestag released a short documentary about the exclusion, disenfranchisement and persecution of Jewish doctors under National Socialism for the members of the German Bundestag.

Entrance to the well, currently open to the public as a museum, is from no. 18 piazza Danti, through a covered walkway which leads to the underground sections of Palazzo Sorbello.  History  The Etruscan well is near \\"Colle del Sole\\", 477 m above sea level, the highest point in the city of Perugia, where the ancient acropolis of the Etruscan town used to be. Its construction can be presumably dated to the second half of the 3rd century B.C.; its purpose was probably to ensure an adequate water supply for the population.The Etruscan well is not the only example of this kind of structure in town: in order to meet the water requirements, a number of wells and fountains, both public and private, were built throughout the urban area. The reason for this, for a long time, was that the town had no water pipelines: work on the first aqueduct for the town of Perugia started in the 13th century. Found in: Simonetta Stopponi, Il Pozzo Sorbello. Una grande riserva idrica della Perugia etrusca, in Gianfranco Binazzi (ed.), Il Pozzo Etrusco alle origini dell‚Äôinsediamento urbano di Perugia. Atti del convegno: Perugia, Palazzo Sorbello, 9 marzo 2017, Bologna, Pendragon, 2018, p. 33.. Over the centuries the structure has been rebuilt several times, beginning in the 15th century, which suggests an uninterrupted use of its water reserve by the local community. Such continuity is actually confirmed by the well curb, in the middle of what is now Piazza Piccinino (formerly Piazza dei Gigli), which indicates the monument at road level. The curb of the Etruscan well, located in Piazza Piccinino, in front of the portal of Palazzo Sorbello. The well curb, originally used by the population to draw water from the underground tank (presumably dating to the 14‚Äì15th cent.), opens between the entrance to Palazzo Sorbello and to the Chiesa della Compagnia della Morte; in the past it has been repeatedly damaged, until recent times. It has been renovated by the Municipality on several occasions, then ‚Äì following very serious damage which caused part of the railing to collapse to the bottom of the well, to be then recovered in the mid-1960s ‚Äì a better position for it was found on the lawn in front of the Tempio di Sant‚ÄôAngelo, where it remained until 1973, the year in which it was relocatedSimonetta Stopponi, Il Pozzo Sorbello. Una grande riserva idrica della Perugia etrusca, p. 24.. The history of the Etruscan well in Perugia is inextricably linked with that of Palazzo Sorbello and of its owners, who succeeded each other over time also in the ownership of the well (entrance to which is actually from the underground rooms below the building itself). Palazzo Sorbello, whose construction was originally ordered by Niccol√≤ Montemelini in the 16th century, was partly built on walls of Etruscan origin. It replaced one tower and three houses from the medieval period, whose remains are still in the basement. In 1629 the Palazzo was bought by Diomede degli Oddi, then it became property of the counts Eugeni of Perugia. In 1780, Marquis Uguccione III Bourbon di Sorbello bought the mansion from count Antonio EugeniRuggero Ranieri, Memoria ed eredit√† di una famiglia di antica nobilt√† attraverso l'et√† moderna in Casa Museo di Palazzo Sorbello a Perugia, edited by Stefano Papetti and Ruggero Ranieri, Perugia, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello Foundation, 2010, p. 18.Claudia Pazzini, I marchesi Bourbon di Sorbello collezionisti d'arte nell'Umbria tra il XVII e il XIX secolo, in Casa Museo di Palazzo Sorbello a Perugia, pages 91‚Äì63., and decided to turn it into his main residence, thus associating the ownership of the Etruscan Well with his family. Even though he unconditionally owned the asset, Uguccione III stipulated that all the residents in the square should have free access to water from the Etruscan Well, which meant that they no longer needed to avail themselves of the public fountains located in the old town. In 1960, following instructions by Uguccione V Ranieri Bourbon di Sorbello, a first survey was carried out, which led ‚Äì for the first time ‚Äì to attributing the construction of the well to Etruscan hydraulic engineering. On the basis of a second survey, which was completed by immersion, Professor Filippo Magi, at the time lecturer in Archaeology and Art History, Etruscology and Italic Antiquities at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Perugia, was able to finally conclude that the Etruscan Well in Perugia was indeed one of the greatest products of Etruscan hydraulic engineering to have been discovered until then.  Description  Detail of the travertine \\"truss\\" roof of the Etruscan well of Perugia. The well consists of a cylindrical barrel structure, about 37 m deep, which has been dug into ground mainly consisting of clay and rounded pebbles (which is known in Italian as \\"tassello mandorlato\\"). The first 4 m below road level are occupied by a quadrangular room which then extends to a depth of 16 m, resulting in a large tank with a diameter of approximately 5.60 m. The upper section of this structure has a cladding made of large travertine slabs, above which there is a series of stone beams, stuck one into the other without using mortar or lime, forming two \\"trusses\\", each of which weighs approximately 8 metric tons, whose purpose is to support the ceiling above, which is also made of large travertine slabsFranco Ivan Nucciarelli ‚Äì Francesca Romana Cappelletti (a cura di), Il Pozzo etrusco, Perugia, Fondazione Ranieri di Sorbello, 2016, pages 15‚Äì16.. Starting from 16 metres below road level, the barrel structure of the well begins to narrow down, reaching a diameter of 3 m. Initially, to extract water, a system of buckets connected to a rope was used, which is confirmed by the presence of clear-cut grooves on the surface of the travertine block on the ceiling. A system with a central pulley began to be used only later, when an actual iron grid served to seal off the well curb, with the engraved date of 1768, plus the addition of two coats of arms, also made of iron, one of the marquis Bourbon di Sorbello, the other one of the family which previously owned the property, the counts Eugeni. From a typology perspective, the well can be compared ‚Äì although it is not exactly alike ‚Äì to a category of works widespread everywhere, with the same purpose, even if they do not always have the same structure. The homogeneous construction materials and techniques used for the well and for the Etruscan walls around Perugia has led to conclude that, originally, it was intended as a public utilitySimonetta Stopponi, Nuove osservazioni sul pozzSorbello e sul suo inserimento nel tessuto urbano di Perugia antica, in Margherita Bergamini (ed.), Gli Etruschi maestri di idraulica.

During the speleology surveys completed over the years, it has been ascertained that the overall size, including each of its sections, is 424 m3 and that it could contain (at full capacity) up to 424,000 litres of water.

Spectroelectrochemistry provides a whole vision of the phenomena that take place in the electrode process. The first spectroelectrochemical experiment was carried out by Kuwana in 1964. The main objective of spectroelectrochemical experiments is to obtain simultaneous, time-resolved and in-situ electrochemical and spectroscopic information on reactions taking place on the electrode surface. The base of the technique consist in studying the interaction of a beam of electromagnetic radiation with the compounds involved in these reactions. The changes of the optical and electrical signal allow us to understand the evolution of the electrode process. The techniques on which the spectroelectrochemistry is based are: *Electrochemistry, which studies the interaction between electrical energy and chemical changes. This technique allows us to analyse reactions that involve electron transfer processes (redox reactions). *Spectroscopy, which studies the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter (absorption, dispersion or emission). Spectroelectrochemistry provides molecular, thermodynamic and kinetic information of reagents, products and/or intermediates involved in the electron transfer process. = Classification of spectroelectrochemical techniques = There are different spectroelectrochemical techniques based on the combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. Regarding electrochemistry, the most common techniques used are: *Chronoamperometry, which measures current intensity as a function of time by applying a constant difference of potential to the working electrode. *Chronopotentiometry, which measures the difference of potential as a function of time by applying a constant current. *Voltammetry, which measures the change of current as a function of the linear change of the working electrode potential. *Pulse techniques, which measure the change of current as a function of difference of potential, applying pulse potential functions to the working electrode. The general classification of the spectroelectrochemical techniques is based on the spectroscopic technique chosen.  Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry  Ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-Vis) spectroelectrochemistry is a technique that studies the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the UV-Vis regions of the spectrum, providing molecular information related to the electronic levels of molecules. It provides qualitative as well as quantitative information. UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry helps to characterize compounds and materials, determines concentrations and different parameters such as absorptivity coefficients, diffusion coefficients, formal potentials or electron transfer rates.  Photoluminescence spectroelectrochemistry  Photoluminescence (PL) is a phenomenon related to the ability of some compounds that, after absorbing specific electromagnetic radiation, relax to a lower energy state through emission of photons. This spectroelectrochemical technique is limited to those compounds with fluorescent or luminescent properties. The experiments are strongly interfered by ambient light. This technique provides structural information and quantitative information with great detection limits.  Infrared spectroelectrochemistry  Infrared spectroscopy is based on the fact that molecules absorb electromagnetic radiation at characteristic frequencies related to their vibrational structure. Infrared (IR) spectroelectrochemistry is a technique that allows the characterization of molecules based on the resistance, stiffness and number of bonds present. It also detects the presence of compounds, determines the concentration of species during a reaction, the structure of compounds, the properties of the chemical bonds, etc.  Raman spectroelectrochemistry  Raman spectroelectrochemistry is based on the inelastic scattering or Raman scattering of monochromatic light when strikes on a specific molecule, providing information about vibrational energy of that molecule. Raman spectrum provides highly specific information about the structure and composition of the molecules such as a true fingerprint of them.  X-ray spectroelectrochemistry  X-ray spectroelectrochemistry is a technique that studies the interaction of high- energy radiation with matter during an electrode process. X-rays can originate absorption, emission or scattering phenomena, allowing to perform both quantitative and qualitative analysis depending on the phenomenon taking place. All these processes involve electronic transitions in the inner layers of the atoms involved. Particularly, it is interesting to study the processes of radiation, absorption and emission that take place during an electron transfer reaction. In these processes, the promotion or relaxation of an electron can occur between an outer shell and an inner shell of the atom.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroelectrochemistry  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique used to obtain physical, chemical, electronic and structural information about molecules due to the chemical shift of the resonance frequencies of nuclear spins in the sample. Its combination with electrochemical techniques can provide detailed and quantitative information about the functional groups, topology, dynamics and the three-dimensional structure of molecules in solution during a charge transfer process. The area under an NMR peak is related to the ratio of the number of turns involved and the peak integrals to determine the composition quantitatively.  Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroelectrochemistry  Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a technique that allows the detection of free radicals formed in chemical or biological systems. In addition, it studies the symmetry and electronic distribution of paramagnetic ions. This is a highly specific technique because the magnetic parameters are characteristic of each ion or free radical. The physical principles of this technique are analogous to those of NMR, but in the case of EPR, electronic spins are excited instead of nuclear, that is interesting in certain electrode reactions.

The figure shows a system of three electrodes: the central disc, corresponding to the working electrode; the semicircle with the largest arc, corresponding to the auxiliary or counter electrode; and the semicircle with the smallest arc, the reference electrode. = Advantages and applications = The versatility of spectroelectrochemistry is increasing due to the possibility of using several electrochemical techniques in different spectral regions depending on the purpose of the study and the information of interest. The main advantages of spectroelectrochemical techniques are: *The simultaneous information is obtained by different techniques in a single experiment, increasing the selectivity and the sensitivity. *Both qualitative and quantitative information can be obtained. *The possibility of working with a small amount of sample, saving it for future analysis. Due to the high versatility of the technique, the field of applications is considerably wide. *Study of reaction mechanisms, where the oxidation and reduction of the species involved in the reaction can be observed, as well as the generation of reaction intermediates. *Characterization of organic and inorganic materials, that allow to understand the structure and properties of the material when is perturbed by a signal (electric, light, etc.). *Development of spectroelectrochemical sensors, which are based on optical and electrical responses, capable of providing two independent signals about the same sample and offering a self-validated determination. *Study of catalysts, obtaining relationships between the electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and their photochemical and photophysical behaviour. *Study different processes and molecules in biotechnology, biochemistry or medicine. *Determine specific properties and characteristics of new materials in fields such as energy or nanotechnology. = References = Category:Physical chemistry Category:Spectroscopy Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Spectroelectrochemistry"},{"id":"64073082","text":"The Alice and Gwendoline Cave is a limestone cave in County Clare, Ireland.

Under the orders of Andr√©s A. C√°ceres, Cavero fought in the defense of Lima and in the resistance campaign in Sierra, during the War of the Pacific. He was Minister of Finance (1893), Minister of Justice (1894 and 1910), Minister of Government (1894-1895), Vice President of Peru (1904-1908) and President of the Council of Ministers (1910). He was also Senator for Ayacucho on multiple occasions and Deputy for Huanta. As a magistrate, he reached the position of Prosecutor of the Supreme Court. Jos√© Salvador Cavero Early life Cavero studied at the Colegio Nacional San Ram√≥n de Ayacucho and then went on to the University of San Marcos, from where he successfully graduated as a bachelor, graduate and doctor of Jurisprudence (1876). Cavero began his teaching career as an assistant professor of Special Rights in 1876. That same year, he was elected as a deputy from Huanta, an office he held till 1878. In charge of the Ayacucho prefecture during the War of the Pacific, Cavero formed and equipped a 500-strong battalion, which he led to Lima in December 1879, to support the defense of the Peruvian capital. While serving as a lieutenant colonel, he participated in the battle of San Juan and the battle of Miraflores as an assistant to Colonel C√°ceres. During this conflict Cavero received three injuries that caused the amputation of his left arm. In 1881, Cavero joined the Resistance Army of Sierra and fought in the Battle of Pucar√° of 5 February 1882. Throughout the Sierra or La Bre√±a war, he served as secretary of the C√°ceres chieftain. Political career Cavero was a senator for Ayacucho in the Congress meeting in Arequipa, which functioned from April 28 to July 20, 1883, under the auspices of the interim government of Rear Admiral Lizardo Montero. Having made peace with Chile and participated in National Reconstruction, he was active in politics and was elected senator in 1886, 1888, 1889 and 1894. In 1889 Cavero was appointed judge of the First circuit of Lima, a function that he suspended when he was appointed Prefect of Arequipa in 1890. He resigned from this position the following year, after being elected deputy from Huanta. In 1892 he became Prosecutor of the Superior Court of Lima and in 1893 he assumed the post of Minister of Finance of the government of Remigio Morales Berm√∫dez, a position he held until the following year. During the controversial second government of C√°ceres, Cavero served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Government (1894-1895). In 1903 Cavero entered the Supreme Court of Justice and was in charge of preparing reform of the Penal codes and Criminal Procedures. Cavero was elected first vice president of the Republic of the first government of Jos√© Pardo y Barreda (1904-1908); in fact, he was the only one in that position, since there was no second vice president. He stood out for promoting reform of public education. During the first government of Augusto B. Legu√≠a, Cavero was Minister of Justice and President of the Council of Ministers, from November 3 to December 27, 1910. Cavero retired from the magistracy in 1912. At the beginning of \\"Oncenio\\", he was elected senator for Ayacucho, a position he held from 1919 to 1924 . As a representative of the legislature he went to Washington D.C. to participate in the negotiations with Chile on the occasion of the final settlement of the Tacna and Arica question . Then he retired to private life. He died in Lima, on February 19, 1940. The newspaper El Comercio highlighted in 1950 his skills as a great jurist, self-sacrificing patriot and honest politician.

In 1992, she provided support for the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and in 1996, was appointed principal advisor to the ILO in connection with the 1989 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention. As a member of Inuit Ataqatigiit from the early 1980s, she strove for Greenlandic independence from Denmark and served as Greenland's Minister of Culture and Education (2003‚Äì2005). Early life Born in Qasigiannguit in western Greenland on 8 June 1950, Henriette Ellen Kathrine Vilhelmine Jeremiassen was the daughter of Jens Emil Axel Jeremiassen (1919-93), a skipper, and Birthe Marie Margrethe M√∏ller (born 1924), a factory worker. The eldest daughter in a family of eight children, she was brought up to recognize the equality of the sexes and to appreciate the importance of education. As a teenager, she spent a year in Denmark before completing her high-school education in Nuuk, matriculating in 1970. In 1975, she qualified as a teacher from N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen. During her studies, she became interested in the new women's movement, making it known in the sidelines of the Arctic Peoples Conference in 1973 that she regretted the poor representation of women. Career From 1975, she taught at the folk high school in Sisimiut where she developed an interest in left-wing politics and became the driving force behind the new women's movement in Greenland, including the red stocking movement KILUT. After an unsuccessful marriage in 1969 with Scott Lundby Rasmussen from Roskilde which was dissolved in 1971, she established a partnership with the Greenlandic linguist (born 1943) with whom she had two children: Inuk Poul (1976) and Nunni Navaranaaq (1979). Together with Olsen, she spent a year in Utqiagvik, Alaska, where she taught Greenlandic language, literature and culture. While doing this, the couple were also active in the 1977 Inuit Circumpolar Conference with participants from Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland, Rasmussen acting as interpreter. From 1979 to 1982, Rasmussen worked in the cultural section of Greenland's radio KNR. After training as a journalist, she then headed the school radio and video department until 1991. During this period, she was increasingly active in politics as a member of Inuit Atagatigiit, succeeding in being elected as the first female member of Nuuk's municipal council in 1983. Showing a strong stand for Greenlandic independence, she was able to have three additional IA candidates elected in the municipal elections in 1989. From 1984 to 1995, she was also a member of Greenland's parliament where she dealt with culture, environment and foreign affairs. In the coalition with Siumut from 1991 to 1995, she was Minister for Social Affairs and the Labour Market. Rasmussen became actively involved in promoting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which was adopted in Greenland in 1992. She was invited to represent Denmark at the UN World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 which was the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. Her proposal for a permanent UN forum for indigenous peoples was accepted in 1996. As a result, she was appointed Chief Technical Advisor on Indigenous People at the ILO, Geneva, where she served until 2000. She also contributed to the UNESCO World Culture Report (1998) and became a member of the Earth Charter Commission where she was involved in drafting a global environmental charter and promoting it in Greenland and through the Inuit Circumpolar Conference. In 2002, Rasmussen returned to Greenlandic politics, becoming Minister of Culture and Education from 2003 to 2005. She then returned to journalism, becoming a familiar voice on KNR until poor health forced her to retire. She had also served as French consul in Nuuk. After a lengthy illness, Henriette Rasmussen died in Nuuk on 3 March 2017. She is survived by her husband, two children and two grandchildren.

It is one of three properties along Christianshavn Canal that were built by anchor smith Hans Caspersen and are now all known as the Hans Caspersen House, the others being Overgaden Neden Vandet 39 and Overgaden Neden Vandet 33. The building was completed in 1769 and listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1945. History The site was in 1689 owned by ropemaker Verner Wesenduncks (Wesendonch). His house was located in Dronningensgade on the other side of the block. The lot was in 1718 acquired by timber merchant Niels Flesborg (c. 1695-1720s) and used as a lumberyard. The lumberyard was in 1720 ceded to timber merchant and captain Hans Brechvoldt who had just married Flesborg 's daughter Martha. Brechvoldt and a brother-in-law died in 1744, probably from drowning, leaving Martha Nielsdatter Flesborg Brechtwoldt as the owner of the lumberyard. In 1749, she sold the proiperty to brewer Peder Nielsen Trye Friis. He sold the two lots on auction in 1755. Part of the lumberyard (matr. 177B) was acquired by merchant and shipowner John Brown. The rest (matr. 177A, No. 50) was sold to dyer Andreas Hegelund. Hegelund's house is in a fire insurance policy from January 1756 described as a two-storey, timber framed building on a brick cellar. A staircase in oak timber connected it to a side wing with kitchen and workshop. A combined wagonhouse and stable with room for three horses was situated at the bottom of the property towards Dronningensgade.

Origins  BCODP was founded by the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) in 1981, the United Nation's International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP). Vic Finkelstein, a leading member of UPIAS, was especially keen to build 'a mass movement' of disabled people in Britain. * \\"On 13 June 1981 in London a meeting was organised between UPIAS and eight other national organisations controlled by disabled people, plus a further five organisations being willing to be involved. Its initial name was the National Council of Organisations of Disabled People, soon becoming [BCODP]\\" (page 15). It was one of a new type organisation at the time, being radically different to the established big disability charities in two ways: these charities claimed to speak for disabled people, and they were often impairment-specific (such as for blind people, for people with health condition X, for deaf people, etc). BCODP followed the new Social Model of Disability which said that what people with impairments had in common was that they were disabled by society, not by their impaired bodies. There had been some previous pan-impairment groups of disabled people in the 1960s, but these tended to focus on one aspect, such as the Disablement Income Group and the National Campaign for the Young Chronic Sick.  Research committee  BCODP linked with the Centre for Disability Studies at the University of Leeds to provide the organisation with high-quality research capacity, and in particular to support the case for new anti-discrimination legislation (ADL) for civil rights for disabled people. BCODP was prominent in the campaigns and protests which led to the (flawed) Disability Discrimination Act 1995.  Independent Living committee  An early focus of the work of BCODP was around Independent Living with the first meeting of this committee in 1982. It started to source funding from the UK government's Department of Health for staff and events costs, and established the National Centre for Independent Living (NCIL) which became an independent spin-out organisation from 2003 to 2006.  Name changes  In later years BCODP went through two changes in its name and structure, first in 1997 becoming the British Council of Disabled People (still known as BCODP), and in 2006 becoming the United Kingdom's Disabled People's Council (UKDPC). The organisation closed down in 2017.

There has been a church on the site since Saxon times, and the current church is a Grade I listed building.  History  A church on this site has existed since at least 1086 and was recorded in the Doomsday Book. It is most likely to have been a Saxon wooden church on the same site as the present church. The first stone church on the site was built circa 1220 by the Normans, and this was replaced by a 14th-century Gothic church using the same plan as the Norman church. This Gothic church was built between approximately 1340 and 1380 in the transitional style between the Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic styles. Parts of this building can be seen in the present, most notably in the lower parts of the transepts and nave and the lower portion of the tower. This building was extensively rebuilt and extended from circa 1437, which included adding a clerestory to the nave, three chapels added and the central tower raised to its present height of 84 feet (26 metres). In the middle of the 16th century, the south porch was built with a small room above it and the chancel was extended eastwards to its present length. By 1847, major restoration was required and was lead by the Rev. Stafford Brown. The nave roof was renewed, a new large west window created, the east wall of the chancel buttressed and the gallery removed. In 1968, it was found the stability of the entire building was at risk because an old culvert had broken, and water had saturated the clay into which the foundations of the church were built. Cracks in the stonework was appearing and the tower was leaning. 150 concrete piles were driven into the ground to a depth of up to 40 feet, and connected with new cross beams to stabilise the building.  Bells  The central tower, with its unusual rectangular shape, contains the third heaviest peal of eight bells hung for change ringing in the world, after Sherborne Abbey, Dorset and St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide, Australia. They are popular with visiting bell-ringers. Prior to 1921, the tower contained a ring of six bells cast by six different founders between 1671 and 1738. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, Leicestershire, were chosen to overhaul the bells in 1921 and it was proposed to augment them to eight by casting two new trebles, recasting two of the original six and retuning the other four. It was found when they had been removed to the foundry that none of the original bells could be satisfactorily retuned, so the foundry, with permission from the church authorities, recast all six bells and augmented them to eight, producing the octave the tower contains today. The tenor now weighs 35 long hundredweight and strikes the note C#. There is also an unused bell that hangs in an old wooden frame above the peal of eight, and dates from around 1600.

The story was published in installments by Rowling online, before its official publication in November 2020. The Ickabog is Rowling's first children's book since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published in 2007. Background and release J. K. Rowling wrote The Ickabog The Ickabog is aimed for children between the ages of seven and nine. It is the first children's book written by J. K. Rowling that is not set in the Harry Potter universe, and at its announcement, Rowling confirmed that The Ickabog would not be a Harry Potter spin-off. Rowling has described the book as a \\"political fairytale... for slightly younger children\\". Rowling first drafted The Ickabog between 2003 and 2007, as a gift for her children. She intended to publish The Ickabog after the Harry Potter series, but stopped after focusing on adult fiction instead. She left her script of The Ickabog in her attic until 2020. Rowling says that she went to her 50th birthday party wearing a dress containing the \\"lost manuscript\\" of The Ickabog. Rowling has made some adjustments to her original script after feedback from her children. Rowling announced that she would release the book online in 34 free online daily instalments between 26 May and 10 July 2020. Rowling said that \\"I‚Äôve decided to publish The Ickabog for free online, so children on lockdown, or even those back at school during these strange, unsettling times, can read it or have it read to them.\\" The first two chapters were released on 26 May 2020. Later, chapters three to five were published on 27 May 2020. The final chapter, 64, was published on 10 July 2020. In the first 24 hours, The Ickabog website had more than 5 million views from 50 countries. The Ickabog is expected to be released as a published book, e-book and audiobook in November 2020. Rowling has said that she will donate her royalties from the book to charity. Rowling also organised an illustration competition with ideas for images needed for each chapter of the book. The best illustrations will be featured in the published book. The book will be published by Hachette UK. Setting The Ickabog is set in the mythical land of Cornucopia, which is ruled by King Fred the Fearless. The Ickabog is a legendary monster that is said to inhabit the marshes of the North, used to explain the disappearance of sheep and people that wander into the marshes, and used to scare children. The south of Cornucopia is a prosperous area, with cities each specialising in different foods, in contrast to the less-wealthy north, known as the Marshlands. Plot On the eve of a visit from the king of the neighbouring country of Pluritania, Dora Dovetail dies of overwork, due to frantically trying to finish King Fred's latest costume, despite being ill. Fred, although embarrassed and feeling guilty, declines to visit the seamstress's family. The Dovetails, especially Daisy Dovetail, Dora's daughter, become bitter and disillusioned with him. This leads to a fight between Daisy and her close friend Bert Beamish, Major Beamish's son, when the former insults Fred. Upon hearing of the fight, Fred resolves to be less self- centred. When a shepherd from the Marshlands begs the king to rid the country of the Ickabog, Fred leaps at the chance to prove himself, riding to the North immediately. However, due to Fred's impetuousness, an accident occurs in the marshes that results in Major Beamish accidentally getting shot by Flapoon, one of Fred's advisors/friends. Seeing the opportunity to take control of the kingdom and become richer, Spittleworth, Flapoon's ally, pretends that Beamish was killed by the Ickabog, scaring Fred and the rest of the army into belief. On their return, three soldiers, including Goodfellow, a friend of Beamish, and Herringbone, the Chief Advisor, raise objections to the story. Herringbone is murdered and the three soldiers are imprisoned and given a false trial, ruining their names. A heavy tax is imposed on the country, to pay for an \\"Ickabog Defence Brigade\\". King Fred is scared into staying within the capital, to prevent him from seeing the poverty the tax has caused. Spittleworth, the new Chief Advisor, has the Dovetails kidnapped, with Dan being sent to prison, and forced to carve Ickabog feet for faking attacks on dissenters. Daisy is sent away to be murdered, although she ends up in Ma Grunter's orphanage. Several years pass, with the tax doubling, ostensibly to pay for more soldiers. Bert and his mother, Bertha Beamish, the king's head pastry chef, later guess Spittleworth's plot after Bert discovers a miniature Ickabog foot, the relic of a toy made for him by the now insane Dan Dovetail, identical to that of the supposed Ickabog. When she attempts to reveal the plot to the king, she is kidnapped and placed in the dungeons. Bert meanwhile escapes the city with the help of an incorrupt guard as Major Roach leads soldiers to arrest him. Arriving in the city of Jeroboam, Bert meets Roderick Roach, who tells him that Spittleworth killed Major Roach and imprisoned his family upon the latter's failure to capture Bert. However, before the two can go anywhere, they are captured by Basher John, and taken to the orphanage, where Bert meets Daisy. Meanwhile, Bertha Beamish has had the dungeons transformed into a kitchen, where, with the help of the prisoners, she continues in her old job, while slowly pulling Dan Dovetail back from his insanity. The four children, Roderick, Bert, Daisy, and Martha (a Marshlander whom Daisy had befriended at the orphanage) find out that Ma Grunter's orphanage is due for an inspection. If the inspector found Bert, a highly prized fugitive, they knew he would be recognized. They decide to escape before that happens. Bert and Roderick steal the keys, and the four hike through the cold to the Marshlands, led by Martha. They plan to meet the soldiers of the Ickabog Defence Brigade there, tell them their stories, and sway them to their side. When they reach the Marshlands, they realise that the Brigade has gone south for the winter. Succumbing to the cold, they fall unconscious. While they are unconscious, the real Ickabog carries them away. The four teenagers end up inside the Ickabog's cave. The Ickabog cooks them food from an abandoned food wagon. After Daisy talks to it, the Ickabog reveals that from it a new batch of Ickabogs will be \\"bornded\\". As the feelings experienced by the dying parent Ickabog influence those of its newborn brood, the Ickabog plans to eat the four during the bornding, to ensure that its children, which would normally only eat mushrooms, will become man eaters, to take revenge on and wipe out the humans, the cause of the near- extinction of the Ickabog race. In Chouxville, King Fred orders an Ickabog to be stuffed, and a ball to be given to celebrate the war. In the dungeons, the prisoners are arming themselves with kitchen knives and Dan Dovetail's chisels. Spittleworth, distracted with the problem of the ball and faking a stuffed Ickabog, fails to notice. Meanwhile, Daisy persuades the Ickabog not to eat them, but to reveal itself to the people and live amongst them, so that the people learn not to fear it. The group marches on Jeroboam, with the Ickabog handing out flowers to soldiers and citizens of the city. After overcoming their initial fear, they rally around the Ickabog, fuelled by resentment at having been lied to. After arming themselves (to protect the monster), they march on Chouxville. However, Basher John, having prospered under Lord Spittleworth's regime and realising the danger to it, steals a horse and rides ahead to warn him. Due to being held up, he arrives only as the Ickabog is approaching Chouxville. He breaks into the king‚Äôs apartments to deliver the news to Spittleworth, but is arrested, as Spittleworth refuses to believe him. Two spies deliver the same news minutes later. As Spittleworth prepares to investigate with Flapoon, he is confronted by the prisoners, who have escaped. They escape out the apartment, locking the exit, leaving King Fred to face the angry mob. As the Ickabog approaches Chouxville, Spittleworth goes to confront it with the Brigade. Despite Spittleworth‚Äôs orders to the contrary, when Flapoon sees the Ickabog's belly split, he fires his gun, believing that there are people inside controlling it. Bert jumps into the path of the bullet, determined to save the Ickabog at all costs. It hits his father's medal, saving him. The first Ickaboggle to be Bornded kills Flapoon, due to being Bornded in fear of his gun. However, the second Ickaboggle is Bornded kind, as Daisy is comforting the Ickabog as it dies. Spittleworth and the rest of the Brigade ride away. When Spittleworth reaches his mansion to escape with his gold, he is captured by Bert and Roderick ‚Äì disguised as Scrumble and Withers, Spittleworth‚Äôs butler and groom ‚Äì who had ridden ahead, freed Lady Eslanda, and bound Scrumble who is wrapped up on the floor. Spittleworth, King Fred, Ma Grunter, Basher John, Cankerby, Scrumble and others who benefited from Spittleworth‚Äôs regime are tried and imprisoned in the palace dungeons. Goodfellow becomes Prime Minister and marries Lady Eslanda, Roderick Roach marries Martha, and Bertha Beamish marries Dan Dovetail. The money from Spittleworth‚Äôs hoard is returned, allowing Cornucopia to be prosperous once more. A new city, Ickaby, is founded in the north, producing mushrooms, fish, and wool as its specialities. The first-born Ickabog, though initially savage, is tamed by Fred, and finally released, so that when its Bornding comes, the Ickaboggles are kind. Fred dies shortly after. Cornucopia lives happily ever after.

Formed in Ukraine in mid-1940, the division fought in the Battle of Kiev and was destroyed in encirclement in late September.  Formation  An unrelated 159th Rifle Division, the first Red Army unit to share the designation, was formed in the Ural Military District in September 1939, but was disbanded in January 1940 to form an officer cadet school. The designation of the 159th was reused for a division formed in July 1940 in the Kiev Special Military District, under the command of Colonel Ivan Mashchenko, appointed on the 29th. It included the 491st, 558th, and 631st Rifle Regiments, and the 597th Light and 723rd Howitzer Artillery Regiments, in addition to smaller support units. The 159th was assigned to the 5th Army of the district from 5 July to early August, then transferred to the 6th Army of the district between 3 and 17 August. It returned to the 6th Army in early 1941, assigned to the 6th Rifle Corps of the army. Mashchenko, who had departed for advanced training in July 1940, did not return to the division until 21 May.  World War II  The division was at roughly 66% of wartime strength with 9,548 personnel when Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June. They were armed with 8,278 Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles, 3,259 semi- automatic rifles, 305 submachine guns, 391 light machine guns, 173 medium machine guns, 54 45 mm anti-tank guns, 35 76 mm guns, 25 122 mm howitzers, nine 152 mm howitzers, and 147 mortars. Equipment included 395 vehicles and 40 artillery tractors. The division was able to hold its positions briefly, utilizing the defenses of the 6th (Rava-Ruska) Fortified Region. Despite its casualties, the 159th only retreated on the first day of the war. On 23 June, the army commander ordered the division to counterattack the German troops in the gap between the 41st and 97th Rifle Divisions of the corps. In the fighting near Magerov on the same day, Mashchenko was killed by a grenade. Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Semyonov, deputy commander of another division, was appointed commander of the 159th on 28 June. By this time the division and its corps had been transferred to the 26th Army. Semyonov took command of the 159th as it retreated from the vicinity of Tarnopol. The division was then tasked with moving to Volochysk to defend positions there with a tank unit and slow down the German advance. In five days of fighting there, the 159th suffered heavy losses but was able to accomplish its goal. The division was subsequently sent to the city of Belaya Tserkov for rebuilding, and was assigned the 91st Border Detachment, a rifle regiment, and a corps artillery regiment. With these forces, it took up defensive positions west of Belaya Tserkov, and defended them for six days. The division was flanked by the German advance and encircled from the city. For two days the 159th fought to break out and managed to accomplish this, reaching the main forces of the 26th Army in the Staritsy (now around the villages of Velyka Starytsya and Mala Starytsya) area. The 159th was tasked with defending positions west of Rzhyshchiv to prevent a German crossing of the Dnieper. After five days the division handed over its sector to the 45th Tank Division (fighting as infantry) and went to Kaniv to be rebuilt. The division later defended Kaniv for fifteen days against the German advance and covered the crossing of the Dnieper by the 5th Cavalry Corps. The division then crossed the river and defended positions on the opposite bank. In mid-September Semyonov went to the army staff, and was succeeded on 16 September by Colonel Nikolay Fedotov, deputy commander of another division. In the Battle of Kiev in late September the 159th was destroyed in encirclement with most of the 26th Army, with its commander being reported missing. According to one of the army's last reports, on 22 September, the 159th was fighting in encirclement at Kandybovka northwest of Orzhytsia, and repeated breakout attempts had failed. On paper, the division, though it had long ceased to exist, was officially disbanded on 27 December 1941.

The family emigrated to Australia in 1884, after failing in their fruit-farming and gold-mining endeavours. Dechaineux attended the Sydney Technical College from 1885 to 1888, where he came under the tutelage of house painter Lucien Henry. Dechaineux subsequently took lessons from Julian Ashton at the Art Society of New South Wales, while focusing on architecture and design, and eventually took over Henry as a design lecturer at the Sydney Technical College.

They are based on the earlier Siemens Viaggio Comfort railcars in use in Europe, but adapted for the North American market. The cars entered service with Brightline in 2018. Railcars are currently on order for the US states of California, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin for use on their state-supported corridors operated by Amtrak and Canada's Via Rail for use on its Qu√©bec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor.  History  The Venture trainsets came in response to a 2014 order from All Aboard Florida for its new Brightline corridor service, purchasing five trainsets of four passenger coaches along with ten Siemens Charger SCB-40 diesel-electric locomotives which will be placed on each end of a trainset. The design studio, the LAB at Rockwell Group, was contracted to adapt the design for the North American market. The trainsets were based on the Siemens Viaggio Comfort trainsets used in Europe. They were built at the Siemens factory in Florin, California starting in July 2015 and the first trainset was completed in December 2016. Public operations began on January 13, 2018.A test train in California in July 2020In November 2017, the state of California (representing a coalition of states including California, Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri) announced that it would be ordering 137 Venture railcars through its contractor Sumitomo Corporation. The states had initially contracted Sumitomo, which in turn subcontracted with Nippon Sharyo, to build the Next Generation Bi-Level Passenger Rail Car, but a prototype car failed a buff strength test in August 2015. After the test failure, the state consortium canceled its deal with Nippon Sharyo, and turned to Siemens as the new subcontractor. The order includes 49 cars for California, formed into seven semi-permanently-coupled trainsets and 88 cars for the Midwest states, formed into 34 married pairs and 20 single coaches. Similarly to Railjet, these cars will be hauled by an existing fleet of locomotives, this time the Siemens Charger SC-44 diesel- electric locomotive. The first three cars were completed in February 2020 and went into testing. The first trainset is supposed to go into revenue service in July 2020. On December 12, 2018, Canada's national passenger rail service operator, Via Rail, announced that it was purchasing 32 Venture trainsets to replace the entire fleet used on its Qu√©bec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor. Each new trainset will consist of a five passenger coaches (one equipped with driver's compartment) paired with a Siemens Charger SCB-40 diesel-electric locomotive. The first trainset is to be delivered for testing in 2021, with the first sets in service in 2022 and all trains in service by 2024. In August 2019, the state of Wisconsin ordered six coaches and three cab cars, for use on the Hiawatha Service, paid for with a grant from the Federal Railroad Administration. The additional coaches will be added to the pool of equipment used by the Midwest states. The cab/coach cars will be used exclusively on the Hiawatha Service.  Trainsets  Most Siemens Venture railcars are configured into semi-permanently coupled trainsets with open gangway-style connections between cars but with standard couplers on the outer ends of the trainset for connecting the trainset to locomotives or other railway equipment. The Amtrak Midwest equipment is an exception, and is divided into smaller semi- permanently coupled married pairs that can be assembled into a trainset using conventional AAR couplers. = Brightline trainsets = Siemens Venture trainset operated by Brightline at alt= A Brightline trainset consists of four semi-permanently-coupled coaches: three coaches with \\"Smart\\" economy seating and one with \\"Select\\" premium seating. Each trainset is paired with a Siemens Charger SCB-40 diesel-electric locomotive on each end. Once the route to Orlando is in operation, the trainsets will be expanded to seven coaches, and five more complete trainsets will be purchased. The \\"Select\\" coaches offers 2x1 and four-to-a-table seating with 50 -wide seats per car and complimentary snacks and beverages, while the slightly less expensive \\"Smart\\" fare coaches seat 66 with narrower -wide seats, with snacks and beverages available for purchase. Each trainset is able to hold 248 passengers. = Amtrak San Joaquins trainsets = Low-platform boarding door on Siemens Venture coach built for San Joaquins service The California Department of Transportation has ordered seven trainsets for the San Joaquins service with seven cars each: four coaches with economy seating, two coaches with economy seating and vending machines, and one cab car (control car) with economy seating. The order includes 49 cars for California, formed into seven semi-permanently- coupled trainsets. Since Siemens Venture trainsets were originally designed to be used with high platforms, two cars per trainset will have built-in wheelchair lifts in order to maintain accessibility with the low platforms used in California. The cab car and two other cars per trainset will have one vestibule per car, while the remaining cars will have two vestibules each. = Amtrak Midwest trainsets = The US states of Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin have ordered 97 cars to be used on their passenger rail corridors: Blue Water, Hiawatha Service, Illini/Saluki, Illinois Zephyr/Carl Sandburg, Lincoln Service, Missouri River Runner, Pere Marquette, and Wolverine, collectively called \\"Amtrak Midwest.\\" Uniquely among Siemens Venture trainsets, the Midwest trains will be made up of married pairs (two coaches semi-permanently coupled with open gangway-style connections) and 26 individual coaches with traditional gangway connections. The married pairs will consist of 17 caf√© cars mated to 17 economy seating coaches and 17 combination \\"business class\\"/economy coaches mated to 17 economy seating coaches. The business class and cafe cars will have two vestibules each, while the coaches will have one. Three cab cars with economy seating have also been ordered and will be used exclusively on Wisconsin's Hiawatha Service. The unique design will allow trainsets to be sized to meet the travel demands of the individual corridors and allow business class seating and caf√© car services to be added or removed. = Via Rail trainsets = Via Rail trainsets will consists of five individual coaches: two coaches with \\"business class\\" premium seating, two coaches with economy seating, and one cab car (control car) with economy seating.

It was conducted in the region of the Greater Chicago, Illinois, United States, from 15 May through 30 June 1978. Data collected were from single cell thunderstorms as well as mesoscale convective systems, such as bow echoes. Using Doppler weather radars and damage clues on the ground, the team studied mesocyclones, downbursts and gust fronts. NIMROD was the first time that microbursts, very localized strong downdrafts under thunderstorms, were detected which help improve airport and public safety by the development of systems like the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar and the Low-level windshear alert system.  Description  The project was set up by Ted Fujita and Ramesh Srivastava from University of Chicago with research assistants Roger Wakimoto and Gregory S. Forbes, as well as researcher Jim Wilson from NCAR. The NIMROD network included 3 Doppler weather radars disposed in a triangular baseline at approximately 60 km from one to the other and 27 mobile automatic weather station from NCAR forming a mesonet in and around the area. Two of the radars were operating in C-band (CP-3 and CP-4), the other was the CHILL Doppler S band radar with multi-elevation PPI and operating continuously. About 200 rawinsondes were released at 30 to 60-min intervals from the coordination position as needed on experiment days. O‚ÄôHare International Airport was chosen because one of the major objectives was also to determine the low-level winds in and around major airports. It was in corn fields area and late spring timeframe was chosen as damage to the corn could be used as indicators of high velocity wind at the surface. Nominal height of wind sensors was 4 m although some of the stations were located in the suburbs while others were in open fields. The mesonet data was obtained at 1-min resolution. Network operations were directed from the NCAR CP-3 radar site while US National Weather Service local bureau notified the team of significant downburst and/or tornadic events, and even assisted in damage surveys.  Aim and Results  Bow echoes are associated with different types of severe winds. Studies on downdrafts from thunderstorms have been few and the extension of their effects were not well known. Dr Fujita suspected that localized downdraft, later called microbursts, were responsible for damage on the ground and a weather hazard involved in some airplane crashes like the one on 24 June 1975 Eastern Airlines Flight 66 during landing at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, killing 113 and injuring 11. Fujita had hypothesized during the inquiry that the cause was such phenomena from his previous study of the effects of the damage caused by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945, and some unexplained damages during the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes. However, there was strong resistance from the meteorological community. He convinced the National Science Foundation and NCAR to fund projects to study thunderstorms downdrafts. NIMROD was the first large scale experiment to study this phenomena and it was the first time that Fujita had used Doppler radar data, having no previous experience in the interpretation of their data, but was rapidly confortable with them. Shortly after the start of the field program, the first recorded microburst on Doppler radar was viewed on the CP-3 radar at Yorkville, Illinois, on 29 May 1978. On the first scan of a thunderstorm, the Doppler velocity display showed a doublet of inbound-outbound velocities which was followed by observation of a gust front. Data obtained during the whole project permitted to describe the 3 dimensions motion of the air in thunderstorms and their structure as single cells, multi-cells, bow echoes or other types.  Legacy  This first experiment have been followed by numerous ones since 1978. One can name (JAWS Joint Airport and Weather Studies) in 1982 and MIST (Microburst and Severe Thunderstorm Experiment) in 1986 led by Fujita and the VORTEX projects. All of them leading to better understanding of summer severe weather for airport and public safety.  References  Bibliography  * . * .

Its customers are typically global manufacturers of vehicles, machines and equipment. Componenta is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki. Componenta‚Äôs production units locate in Finland. There are two foundries (in Pori and in Karkkila), four machining services units (in Jyv√§skyl√§, in H√§rm√§, in Kurikka and in Sastamala), and material services units (plate cutting, hydraulic tube manufacturing, forge) in Jyv√§skyl√§ and in Lepp√§vesi. In 2019, the company employed about 600 people.  History  Componenta‚Äôs history goes back to 1820 when the H√∂gfors ironworks was founded in Karkkila. Iron production was stopped in H√∂gfors in 1916 but the foundry has remained in Karkkila and is currently operating, at Componenta Castings Oy. Karkkila foundry is the oldest operating foundry in Finland. The second milestone in the 19th century was the founding of the Pori foundry in 1858. = Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi (1918‚Äì1974) = Matti Lehtonen started his foundry business in Helsinki in 1918 by buying one of the biggest foundries in Helsinki, Helsingin Valimo. The most significant customer for Lehtonen‚Äôs Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi during the first decade was Maanviljelyskonetehdas Oy to which Lehtonen supplied cast-iron components for agricultural machinery. Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi survived the downturn of the global economy during the 1930s by having good long-term customers, like Lokomo Oy from Tampere. During the period of growth and prosperity after the 1930s depression, Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi was supplying e.g. parts for harvesters, rubber production machinery, and also manufactured its by then largest casts, six 8 ton vats for pulp production. By 1937, the company had over 100 employees. Its products received a silver medal for excellent quality at the Paris International Exposition. When Matti Lehtonen died at the age of 70 in 1939, his son Bernhard Matias Lehtonen took over the company. During the war years, the foundry manufactured e.g. hand grenades and landmines. After the war, Finland had to pay war reparations to Russia, and for that purpose the foundry focused on making tempered cast iron wheels (‚ÄúGriffin wheels‚Äù). After the Finnish Winter War and Continuation War, the number of employees at the foundry was over 200. In the 1950s and 1960s Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi grew further and was successful both as a contract manufacturer and as a manufacturer of their own products. = Suomivalimo Oy (1975‚Äì1999) = In 1973, Yrj√∂ M. Lehtonen started as the CEO of Rauta- ja Metallivalimo Suomi. The company moved to Iisalmi in 1975 and changed its name to Suomivalimo Oy. The Helsinki foundry was closed down in 1977. Between 1984 and 1988, the company acquired e.g. the H√∂gfors foundry in Karkkila, Rosenlew foundry in Pori and Santasalo-Vaihteet. Santasalo-Vaihteet, lead by Heikki Lehtonen, continued as an independent company and was listed on the Stock Exchange in 1988. In 1990, the company acquired Fr√§mmestad, a machine shop located in Sweden. The recession years of the early 1990s were not easy for the Lehtonens' family business. During that decade, Suomivalimo Oy operated under the names of JOT-Yhti√∂t, JOT Components, Santasalo-Vaihteet and Santasalo-JOT. After the Santasalo-Vaihteet was sold to Metso in 1999, the company began to concentrate on foundry business. = Componenta (1999‚Äì) = In 1999, the Santasalo-JOT Group changed its name to Componenta. Componenta was listed on Nasdaq Helsinki in 2000 as a company focusing on foundry operations. Foreign operations for Componenta were further expanded in the mid-2000s when Componenta acquired the majority shareholdings in De Globe, a foundry company in the Netherlands, and in D√∂ktas D√∂k√ºmc√ºl√ºk Ticaret ve Sanayi, a Turkish cast iron and aluminium component manufacturer that employed 2,500 people. With these acquisitions Componenta became the second largest independent manufacturer of cast iron components in Europe. In 2006 it had 5,250 employees of whom 22 per cent were working in Finland. In Autumn 2016, Componenta announced that its Dutch operations will file for bankruptcy and that its Finnish and Swedish operations will file for restructuring. Componenta sold its Turkish operations in 2017. The Componenta Group had foundries in Pori and Karkkila in Finland, and the Fr√§mmestad machine shop in Sweden and there were about 660 employees. In August 2019, Componenta acquired Komas Oy and became the leading metal component manufacturer in Finland. The history of Komas Oy goes back to 1926 when Valtion Kiv√§√§ritehdas was founded in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland. In 2018, Komas had 175 employees in Jyv√§skyl√§ and Laukaa.

The comic is a modern retelling of the relationship between the Greek goddess and god Persephone and Hades. It began publishing weekly on WEBTOON in March 2018. Lore Olympus is currently the most popular comic on the WEBTOON platform; as of January 2020 it had 299 million views, and as of August 2020 WEBTOON reported that it had 4.1 million subscribers. The comic has been nominated for an Eisner Award and a Ringo Award, and a television series based on the comic is under development.  Plot and themes  Lore Olympus is an adaptation of the classic Greek myth, ‚ÄòThe Abduction of Persephone' in a mostly modern setting. The webcomic includes modern technology such as smartphones, sports cars, and tabloids. However, scenes in the realm of the mortals take place in the time of the original myths. The comic deals with strong themes of rape, harassment, abuse, and trauma. The story begins with Hades attending a party of Zeus's after his partner Minthe breaks up with him. Persephone has been allowed to leave the mortal realm and visit Olympus by her mother, Demeter. Hades takes notice of Persephone and comments to his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon that Persephone's beauty rivals that of Aphrodite. Out of jealousy, Aphrodite calls on her son, Eros, to get Persephone extremely intoxicated and dump her in the back seat of Hades' car in an attempt to have her embarrass herself in front of Hades. After their initial encounter from this incident, Hades and Persephone both express an interest in each other and become a couple. Plots in season one of the webcomic include Persephone seeking Hades' help to bring back friends who died when mortals uprooted sacred plants, a scheme by Minthe, Thanatos and Thetis to ruin Persephone's reputation, the rape of Persephone by Apollo, and Persephone's conflicted thoughts over a college scholarship that requires her to refrain from sex.  Major characters  The following characters are central to plot lines in the comic and make regular appearances: *Persephone is the goddess of spring, depicted as a young pink woman. She is a naive, warmhearted newcomer to Olympian life, and is searching for her independence. Persephone is 19 years old. She has prehensile hair which responds to her emotions in varying levels, sometimes by growing or sprouting flowers. She strives to become self- sufficient and to maintain a positive, hard-working attitude. While a kind, caring and somewhat naive individual, Persephone also harbours a dark secret; she massacred a village for murdering her fellow nymphs.

He is Artemis' twin brother. *Artemis is the goddess of the hunt and a member of The Goddesses of Eternal Maidenhood. She is Persephone's best friend and roommate and is Apollo's twin sister.

Nineteen years prior to the comic, Demeter shaped Persephone out of clay and became her mother. Demeter is a member of the Six Traitors Dynasty. *Ares is the god of war and is one of the sons of Zeus and Hera as well as brother to Hebe.

According to columnist Nahlia Bonfiglo, \\"Hades is depicted in dark colors‚Äîblues, purples, and blacks‚Äîthat match his setting. The underworld is likewise illustrated in dark hues, making Persephone and all of her bold, bright colors pop even more.\\"  Publication  The webcomic updates weekly on Webtoon, and readers with the \\"Webtoon Fast Pass\\" can access pages earlier. By August 2020, 120 episodes had been published, and Smythe said that she had an ending in mind for the series. Smythe creates Lore Olympus using Photoshop and a Wacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablet.  Influences  On her website for Lore Olympus, Smythe lists some of the sources that she uses for the comic: *Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths by Bernard Evslin; *Classical Mythology: The Greeks: The Modern Scholar by Professor Peter Meineck; *Classical Mythology by Professor Elizabeth Vandiver; *The Metamorphoses by Ovid; *The Greek Myths by Robert Graves; *The Works and Days by Hesiod; *The Illiad by Homer; *The Odyssey by Homer; *The Homeric Hymns by Homer, specifically the Hymn to Demeter.  Reception  In 2019, WEBTOON announced that Lore Olympus had been viewed over 299 million times, making it the most viewed webcomic on the platform. As of May 2020, Lore Olympus is the most popular webtoon on the platform, with over 3.9 million subscribers. In an article for The Daily Dot, columnist Nahila Bonfiglio recommended the webcomic, saying: \\"There are many reasons to read Lore Olympus, but the simplest is to see Smythe‚Äôs brilliant take on the myth. Her story is flawlessly enthralling, heartwarming, and painful. The characters confront timeless issues through a modern lens, breaking down the romanticization of rape and abduction with grace and intrigue. Smythe updates the series every Sunday, and new readers will find themselves awaiting that notification with bated breath.\\" Bonfiglio also praised the art, saying: \\"[Smythe's] captivating way of telling her tale often involves carefully considered colors, panels completely without words and even‚Äîsometimes‚Äîmusic.\\" The Beat declared Lore Olympus to be one of the 100 best comics of the 2010s, describing Smythe's art as \\"breathtaking\\" and making good use of the webtoon format, and saying that the modern setting made the story \\"feel as fresh and urgent as eavesdropping on your (very wealthy, very messy) neighbors.\\" Critical Darlings reviewer Kaitlin Konecke said that \\"the drawings allow us to see how Persephone feels. It‚Äôs a visceral way to tell a story, with graphics allowing us to see inside the mind of Persephone and convey the complicated array of emotions that follow a trauma such as sexual assault and rape.\\" Konecke also praised the depiction of assault from a female writer, saying that Smythe and others \\"are not just telling us, but showing us. And in doing so, they make women and survivors feel seen.\\" A reviewer for Love in Panels! praised the decision to give Persephone more agency than in the original story, saying that \\"it's that agency, her claiming of her own body and sexuality, that pulls me like a magnet to these tales.\\" = Awards = - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2020  Best Webcomic  Ringo Awards   Winner to be announced on October 24, 2020  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2019  Best Webcomic  Eisner Awards   Lost to The Contradictions by Sophie Yanow  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2019  Best Colorist  Ringo Awards   Lost to Tamra Bonvillain   Television series  In October 2019, Deadline reported that the Jim Henson Company had entered into a partnership with WEBTOON to create an animated series based on Lore Olympus.

Together with his twin brother Jeffrey Frank George (Jeff George) and other parties involved, he ran several Pill Mills in Florida, which contributed to the opioid epidemic in the USA. George was sentenced to 17.5 years imprisonment in 2012 for these and other crimes. The media called him Pill Mill Kingpin, because he was the owner of the largest network of such pain clinics in Florida between February 2008 and March 2010.  Origin, family, adolescence  The twin brothers Chris and Jeff grew up as children of John George and his wife Denice Haggerty in Wellington, Florida, an area where the inhabitants are considered to be wealthy. The father had become rich in the construction sector. Their parents divorced in 1988. According to their father, Chris and Jeff were not particularly good students, but they acquired entrepreneurial attitudes in the parental home.John Temple: American Pain, Chapter 1, Episode Pain Killer Profits of the television series American Greed on CNBC (30 June 2016). Chris was first arrested at the age of 13. Further conflicts with the police followed due to illegal possession of alcohol, brawls, contraventions, obstruction of justice and theft. In 2003 he was arrested for ordering and accepting a package of anabolic steroids for his own use and for friends. Chris George was sentenced to eight months in prison, six of which he served, mostly as an employee in his father's business (open prison). After being released from prison, he continued working in his father's construction company. Previously, Chris had studied business administration and construction management without earning a degree, spending two years at Palm Beach Community College and two years at Florida International University.  First sales activities  Before entering the pill mill business, Chris George and his twin brother Jeff ran the South Beach Rejuvenation Clinic, a company that sold anabolic steroids illegally.

A few weeks after the business started, a large number of Kentucky and Tennessee customers visited the South Florida Pain Clinic. The revenues increased significantly, also because of so-called sponsors. They paid a handful of people - often opioid addicts - to come to the South Florida Pain Clinic, receive prescriptions for high-dose painkillers and purchase hundreds of them at the clinic. A relevant part of these pills was given by the patients or buyers to the sponsors, who then sold them on the black market. Advertising on large billboards, in free newspapers and on the Internet contributed to the business success. Chris George also hired experts to optimize search engine rankings for the South Florida Pain Clinic website. At the same time, he took care of building up a stable network of suppliers, mostly smaller pain drug wholesalers. Complaints from owners of surrounding businesses led to the publication of a newspaper report about the South Florida Pain Clinic. Subsequently, the police observed the area.John Temple: American Pain, chapter 3, The clinic responded to these circumstances and the rapidly growing number of clients by moving to a new location, the Cypress Creek Executive Court, an office complex near Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, in summer 2008.John Temple: American Pain, chapter 4, At this location the number of personnel was increased.

The firm traded in metals/minerals, chemicals, fabricated metals and machinery & equipment. The firm was a founder member of the London Metal Exchange in 1877. Evolution The bank had strong patrician antecedents being primarily controlled by the family of Baron Glenconner, i.e. the Tennant family. The firm had its origins in chemical manufacturing when in 1811, Charles Tennant and Co of St Rollox, Glasgow established an associated company, C.

Anokhi works directly with Rajasthani craftspeople, and retails through its 25 stores in India and a few stockists in Europe and the United States. History Anokhi was started by John and Faith Singh in 1970, with the aim of creating contemporary products using traditional Indian techniques. Anokhi's focus was on reviving the hand-block printing techniques of Rajasthani craftspeople in an era of mass-produced clothing. Operations Anokhi works directly with artisans who live in villages around Jaipur. The designs are made in-house and are then delivered, along with fabrics, dyes, and woodblocks, to the artisans who finish the prints in their homes.: \\"Block printing of Anokhi fabric is decentralised in villages around Jaipur...fabrics, dyes and wood blocks are transported to artisans who print in their homes.\\" As block-printing has been traditionally practised by males, Anokhi involves rural women by commissioning their work in areas such as embroidery, appliqu√©, beadwork and patchwork; to encourage women in villages to seek employment, Anokhi runs a daycare centre at the manufacturing plant and provides educational support for their children.

Bernstein is an American public figure and community leader, known for his work with Jewish NGOs. He worked for the Anti Defamation League (ADL) from 2013 and became the inaugural CEO of Community Security Service in May 2020. He has been heavily involved in interfaith relations and law enforcement discussions in New York City and the surrounding cities and states. Early life & education Bernstein was born in New London, Connecticut on October 6, 1974. He attended East Lyme High School and was educated at Western Connecticut State University, where he played lacrosse and studied social work. Bernstein graduated in 1998 with a BA. He received an alumni award from Western Connecticut State University in 2007 for his professional successes, as he was the recipient of the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award from the School of Professional Studies. Bernstein received his ALM in Management- Nonprofits from the Extension School Management Program at Harvard University in 2011. While at Harvard he sat on the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations Student Advisory Board. Career Bernstein began his career at United Way, before working in senior positions at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and The David Project Center for Jewish Leadership. He started as the Executive Director and sat on the Israel based senior management team for American Friends of Migdal Ohr in 2011, one of the largest NGOs in Israel. In 2013, Bernstein was hired by Abe Foxman to be the New York Regional Director for the Anti-Defamation League, based in New York City. In June 2018, the New York regional office was merged with neighboring New Jersey, putting the regions under Bernstein's leadership. In December 2019, he was appointed to be the Vice President of the Northeast Division that included the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Boston offices. Shortly after joining ADL, Bernstein spoke about the dangers of hate groups in the US, following the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting. While serving as Regional Director for the ADL in New York, the region witnessed an unprecedented rise in antisemitism and violent hate crimes. Bernstein spoke regularly about the issues nationally in media. These incidents have included Anti-Semitic slurs by public figures, vandalism, and other attacks across the region. In 2018, an attack on Mapbox's naming of Manhattan lead many sites such as SnapChat and the Financial Times to display Anti-Semitic maps on their website. Bernstein spoke extensively with the media about the dangers such attacks can have on the Jewish community. Throughout December 2019, there were numerous recorded attacks in the borough of Brooklyn, a shooting in New Jersey and an attack on a Rabbi's home. Bernstein was at the scene in Jersey City and Monsey shortly after the incidents. All of the incidents were said to be antisemitic attacks. Bernstein was interviewed frequently on the incidents, often acting as a spokesperson for the wider Jewish community in the states of New York and New Jersey and worked closely with law enforcement. The attack on the Rabbi's home in New York City became known nationally as the Monsey Hanukkah stabbing. Following the incidents, he criticised NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio for suggesting this was a ‚Äúright-wing movement,‚Äù which Bernstein suggested was the wrong thing to do as it \\"normalised antisemitic attacks\\". Shortly after the Jersey City shootings, Bernstein and ADL created a partnership with NAACP to reduce hate crimes in the state of New Jersey. The aims were to educate public officials and improve civil rights in the state. The move came after a number of public officials made unacceptable statements about hate crime incidents in the state. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States led to Bernstein being regularly in the media, due to the rise in hate crimes. Prior to the pandemic in the country, Bernstein spoke about how he and the Anti-Defamation League had uncovered early discussions about extremists planning to weaponise the virus. He called the findings \\"deeply disturbing, but not entirely surprising.\\" Bernstein also frequently commented on antisemitic incidents in the United States, following the outbreak of Covid-19. In May 2020, it was announced that Bernstein would be joining the nonprofit, Community Security Service as its inaugural CEO. The role will help expand the number of volunteers that will be trained to protect Jewish institutions and events across America.

It is the only August Bloom movie from 1910 that has been preserved. The film produced by Nordisk Films was the company's first feature film and became a major sales success, 103 copies being sold world-wide. However the film could not be released in the United States of America because of censorship. The film was a remake of an eponymous film by competing producer Fotorama (dk), which is considered lost.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: Plot Anna is a young girl from a poor but honorable home in Denmark. When her father finds in a newspaper an ad for a well-paid job as a company lady in a mansion in London, she goes to the interview in a Copenhagen hotel and is happy to get the job. Her childhood friend and now fianc√© Georg is somewhat worried but Anna dismisses his distrust and travels to England. On arrival, to Anna's horror, she is taken into a luxury brothel. Anna manages to chase away her first customer, but cannot escape. The brothel maid takes pity on poor Anna and smuggles out a letter to her parents, who seek help from the \\"Association for the White Slave Trade Fight\\". Georg travels to London and hires a detective. Together they track down the brothel where Anna is kept and arrange her evasion. Anna crawls out a window and they escape in horse- carriage, but after a wind-blowing car chase, they are overpowered by the slaveholders who get Anna back. She is then transported to the port to be sold to another country. When Georg and the detective, who have alerted Scotland Yard, arrive at the house, the maid tells them where she has been brought. Georg and the police manage to board the ship just before it leaves and after a brief but exciting fight Anna is finally freed and can return home. Cast right Ellen Diedrich (as Ellen Rindom) (dk) as Anna Svend Bille as the customer at the brothel Lauritz Olsen (dk) as Georg Einar Zangenberg (dk) Victor Fabian (dk) as The Detective Ella la Cour (dk) as the madam of the brothel Otto Lagoni (dk)as Anna's father Julie Henriksen (dk) as Anna's mother Production and reception In 1910, filmmaker Ole Olsen, who had established in 1910 Nordisk Films Kompagni, the oldest Danish film production, hired actor August Blom as its new Head of Production. Between 1910 and 1925, he directed more than 100 films and started a new genre, the erotic melodrama. The White Slave Handle was his third film and it was a remake a film with the same title released in the Spring of 1910 by Nordisk Film's main competitor: Fotorama. That film was the first multi-reel film in Denmark and one of the first in the world, and its duration of 40 minutes as well as the fact that it showed life inside a brothel, made it a resounding success. Film History, Vol. 13, No. 1, Nordic Cinema (2001), pp. 6-22. Indiana University Press It was stressed at the time that the longer visual form did not inhibit comprehension, but aided it instead. A reviewer marveled that it was \\"The first artistic film. As a guide, the printed programme is unnecessary, the rapidly shifting but carefully linked episodes speak for themselves\\".Arhus Stiftstidende, 12 April 1910. To bank on this success, Olsen asked Blom to watch carefully the Fotorama film and to make a scene-by-scene re-creation of it. This was done, except for a few roles that got a name change. Nordisk did not hide its plagiarism, boasting that the film was executed exactly in the same way as the Fotorama film, but performed by better artists.Isak Thorsen, Nordisk Films Kompagni 1906-1924, The Rise and Fall of the Polar Bear, Indiana University Press, p. 77. This was not illegal because the Danish law on copyright did not cover films at the time.A similar situation existed in the United States, see e.g. the case of the 1904 film Meet Me at the Fountain. When Nordisk, in line with it usual practice, decided to distribute the film outside of Denmark, notably in Germany, he faced initially the reluctance of German distributors to present a film with of such a long duration, the standard for films being at the time one reel of about 15 minutes. Ole Olsen threatened a Hamburg cinema owner to stop supplying any Nordisk production to him if he did not program The White Slave Trade. According to Olsen, the result was an unprecedented success. \\"The next day the cinema was packed and on the third day, it took twenty police officers to retain order since people were queuing around the block to get tickets.\\"Ole Olsen, Filmens eventyr og mit eget, Jespersen og Pios, 1940, pp. 85-88. 103 copies were sold worldwide in comparison to a 1910 average of 40 copies per film. In the United States however, the film could not be released as it was forbidden by censorships boards.Ron Mottram, The Great Northern Film Company: Nordisk Film in the American Motion Picture Market, Film History, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), Indiana University Press, pp. 79-81 Apparently the censors, shocked by the brothel scenes, were not convinced by the argument that the film exalted the innocence of the heroin and that white slavery had the power of metaphor \\"to reduce the complex problem of prostitution to a simple story of villain and victim.\\"Frederik K. Grittner, White Slavery: Myth, Ideology and American Law, Garland, New-York, 1990, p. 97. Given the success of the film, Nordisk produced two sequels, Den hvide slavehandel II (In the Hands of Impostors) in 1911 and Den hvide slavehandel III (The White Slave Trade III) in 1912.Russell Campbell, Marked Women: Prostitutes and Prostitution in the Cinema, The University of Wisconsin Press, 2006, p.15 ReferencesExternal links * *Den hvide slavehandel (1910) The White Slave Trade at A Cinema History Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:Danish films Category:Danish drama films Category:Danish silent films Category:Films directed by August Blom Category:Danish black-and-white films ","title":"The White Slave Trade"},{"id":"64075067","text":"The General Agri-Food Federation (, FGA) is a trade union representing workers in the agricultural and food processing sectors in France.

He ended his career as a senator with the rank of Actual Privy Councilor. Grandfather of Count Vasily Olsufiev. Biography Came from the Olsufievs. The son of Ober-Hofmeister Vasily Dmitrievich and his wife Eva Ivanovna, n√©e Golender, who was Swedish by birth. At baptism, he received the name Vasily, but at the behest of Emperor Peter I, who wished to be godfather, but who was late to his baptism, was named by a name uncommon among the Russians, Adam.A game came out with the names: mother was called Eve, son Adam Therefore, Adam Vasily had two names, but on all acts and documents he was signed by Adam. At the age of seven, he lost his father and remained in the arms of his mother, who soon after the death of her husband remarried Colonel Wenzel. Wenzel took up his education and on February 17, 1732 identified him in the then-newly opened Gentry Cadet Corps. Here Adam Vasilyevich spent seven years, and managed to attract attention with his remarkable talents and ability to languages; therefore, when the War with Turkey began in 1735 and Field Marshal Count Minikh turned to the Corps with a request to give him a young man who knows languages, the choice of superiors immediately fell on young Olsufiev. He was released from the Corps with the promotion from corporal to commissioner on assignments in the army Carabinier Regiment and was appointed to be a member of Minikh circle to conduct his foreign correspondence. At the end of hostilities, during which he was inseparably at the field marshal, Olsufiev joined the diplomatic service and was appointed secretary of the Russian embassy in Copenhagen under envoy Baron Johann Korf. Olsufiev‚Äôs overseas stay was very long; he became so settled in Denmark that he married a Danish woman, who, however, soon died, leaving him no offspring. Returning to Russia and soon marrying Maria Vasilyevna Saltykova, Olsufyev expelled from the Copenhagen mission and entered the service in the Collegium of Foreign Affairs to Chancellor Bestuzhev. Through the relatives of his wife, in particular through her brother, Sergei Saltykov, who enjoyed the great location of Grand Duchess Catherine Alexeyevna, Adam Vasilyevich became known to the young Grand Duchess and soon rose into the ranks of her adherents still rare then; he helped the Grand Duchess correspond with her mother, relations with which she was most strictly forbidden, and earned her favor with his cheerful, accommodating character, wit and wide education. In November 1756, Olsufiev was promoted to state councilor and then made a member of the reorganized by him and Pugovishnikov in 1758, on behalf of Chancellor Vorontsov, the Foreign College, as well as personal secretary of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna. Since that time, he began to quickly move up the ranks, and, on the recommendation of the cabinet minister, Baron Cherkasov, who had asked the Empress for retirement in old age, began to carry out his duties, managing the Empress‚Äôs personal income and Siberian gold and silver mines, and after death the baron took his place, becoming the cabinet minister. When Chancellor Bestuzhev was disgraced, Adam Vasilievich, as cabinet minister, drafted a manifesto on his dismissal. The position of Olsufiev, as a person close to the empress, was at that time very ticklish among the three warring camps, that is, the empress herself, the heir to the throne and the young grand duchess. It was necessary to have a lot of tact and dexterity, so as not to annoy one or the other side, and he succeeded completely. He did not lose the empress‚Äôs confidence until the last days of her life and, being at the bedside of the dying empress, had the opportunity to once again make sure of her great disposition to him; the empress alone left him at her bed, making death orders to the heir and in his presence expressed to the Grand Duke her last will. At that time, Adam Vasilievich was already a Privy Councilor and Knight of the Order of Alexander Nevsky. Under the new reign, he remained in all his posts and ranks and invariably maintained the gracious attitude of Emperor Peter III to himself. Upon the accession of Catherine II, Olsufiev received the Empress's private office in management. Appointed on July 8, 1762, along with Teplov and Elagin, the State Secretary to the empress, he was introduced into a circle of affairs of a very diverse nature. The Empress's money affairs, secret instructions to the governors and participation in a number of large public and private affairs of the Empress ‚Äì this is his circle of activity. Very pleased with his ordering, the empress appreciated the work of Olsufiev, and in January 1763 appointed him senator to the 1st Department of the Senate. In the same year, he was involved in active participation in the negotiations on a trade agreement with England, and managed by his attitude, knowledge and experience to gain a very flattering characterization of the British ambassador, who in his reports to his court stated that \\"he considers Olsufiev according to his abilities and education above all Russians with whom he dealt\\". On March 20, 1764, Olsufiev resigned from the duties of accepting petitions submitted to the Highest Name, but retained all his other posts and continued to be among the closest persons to the empress. After the promulgation of the famous Nakaz, Olsufiev was elected as a deputy to the Commission on Cities, acted as an ardent defender of noble interests, acting in this regard along with historian Prince Mikhail Shcherbatov. On January 8, 1769, he was elected among nine people to the Directorate Commission. In the rank of senator, Olsufiev often took part in many major affairs. Having begun his Senate practice in 1765 with the first report on the need to leave workers unnecessary at salt factories, Olsufyev in 1766 came up with a project on the collection, from 1767, of all Roma living in the Slobodsko-Ukrainian and other provinces, a tax of seven hryvnias. Distracted by other studies from senatorial duties, Olsufiev, appointed December 6, 1767 to attend the 1st Department, although he continued to participate in Senate meetings, did not make major reports, and only in 1776, after a long break, in a thorough report The Senate outlined the unlawful actions of the Tobolsk Provincial Chancellery, which placed at the state-owned factories yasak Tatars, Ostyaks and other foreigners, without any right, and carried out other lawlessness. Having examined this question on the spot, Olsufyev on February 16, 1782, in a detailed report to the Senate, revealed the abuses of levying taxes on peasants assigned to the Kolyvano-Voskresensky salt mines and Barnaul mines, pointing out the absence of free ration workers, due to which many mines were closed. In addition, Olsufiev spoke several times in the Senate with reports on unrest and careless conduct of business at the Justice College. However, disagreements and even clashes with some senior administrative officials (incidentally, with the prosecutor general, Prince Vyazemsky) led the unyielding Olsufiev to ask the empress to dismiss him from being in the Senate. In 1782, disorders and abuses were revealed in the affairs of the Imperial Theaters; these theaters chronically began to give a deficit to the government, which finally decided to establish a committee to regulate the administrative and financial aspects of theater management, while paying attention to the situation of artists. The Empress appointed Adam Vasilyevich at the head of this Committee, appointing him chairman on July 12, 1783. His duties and competencies were carefully set out in 44 paragraphs found in the reprint of the Empress to Olsufiev. Death, however, prevented Olsufiev from completing the work entrusted to him; he died of dropsy. Contemporaries agree on the characterization of Adam Vasilyevich, portraying him as a very intelligent, sociable person who did not take an active part in the struggle of temporary workers and therefore did not inspire a hostile attitude towards himself. Johann Bernoulli certifies him as \\"a man of outstanding abilities, not only knowing different languages, but even dialects and dialects thereof in great perfection\\". Several times recalls Olsufiev on the pages of his notes by Casanova: Literary activity Loving a quiet, relaxed life, with a cheerful character and great wit, Olsufiev devoted his leisure time to music, theater, literature, but sometimes he was not averse to taking part in the noisy life of Catherine's nobles. Fluent in French, German, English, Italian, Swedish and Danish, Olsufiev was well acquainted with foreign literature and wrote satirical original works himself, and also translated a lot of foreign authors, however, he printed very little. The Italian operas he translated were played at the court of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, and the German comedy Six Dishes, which Empress Catherine really liked, was redone by Olsufev for the Russian scene at her request and played at court. This play was then published. Italian operas are known from his translations: Eudokia the Crowned or Theodosius II of 1751, Seleucus of 1744, Mithridates of 1747, Bellerophon, printed in Saint Petersburg. In addition, he translated most of the comedies of the poet Boneka. The literary activities of Adam Vasilyevich, without bearing the seal of great talent, were soon forgotten, but his wide education, acquaintance with literature, languages, love of art and his own works in connection with his high social position gave Olsufyev pride of place in the Free Economic Society, Academy of Sciences and Academy of Arts. The first steps in the activities of this scientific society are inextricably linked with the name of Olsufiev: he was elected to the first presidents of the Society even before the approval of the charter and remained with him until January 1, 1766; in addition, he was elected two more times: in 1769 and 1773. He was an honorary member of the Academy of Arts (from September 21, 1765) and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (from October 21, 1788), in the vocabulary of which he promised to take part, reporting \\"different root words from foreign languages\\". In 1784, at the special request of Catherine II, Olsufiev published in Saint Petersburg the third part of Vasily Tatishchev's History of Russia, based on the Nikon Chronicle and bringing the story to 1462. After the death of Olsufiev, a rich collection of paintings and engravings remained, which died in the Moscow Fire of 1812; only the collection of Russian portraits and Russian folk pictures has survived ‚Äì the one of a kind collection that Olsufiev has been compiling since 1766. Catherine II's Letters to Olsufiev were published in the 19th century. Family and children The first wife (from 1741) was the Danish aristocrat Sophia Amalia Tuxen (1723‚Äì1751). The second wife (from February 6, 1752) was Maria Vasilyevna Saltykova (1728‚Äì1792), the maid of honor of the court (12/09/1752), the daughter of Vasily Saltykov, who assisted Empress Elizaveta Petrovna on her accession to the throne, from his second marriage with Princess Maria Alekseevna Golitsyna. As a dowry, the village of Ershovo was given after it. 4 sons and 3 daughters were born in the marriage. *Sofya Adamovna (1753‚Äì1786), was the first wife of Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Petrovich Devier, grandson of Anton Devier; *Sergei Adamovich (1755‚Äì1818), from 1769 he studied at the University of Leipzig, Major General; since 1780 he was married to maid of honor Ekaterina Ivanovna Molchanova (1758‚Äì1809), one of the best graduates of the Smolny Institute; *Maria Adamovna (1757‚Äì1820), from 1777 she was married to her cousin, mother, stalmaster Prince Nikolai Golitsyn (1751‚Äì1809).

He was organist at Storkyrkan, the main church of Stockholm, and chief conductor at Kungliga Hovkapellet (the Royal Court Orchestra). Arguably his most accomplished composition is an opera, Il Giudizio Di'Aminta, written on the occasion of the birthday of future Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. Biography Ferdinand Zellbell the Younger was born in Stockholm. He was the son of , who was also a musician and a composer. He was taught music by his father but also studied for Johan Helmich Roman. He spent the years between 1739 and 1741 with further studies in Lower Saxony; his teachers there included Georg Philipp Telemann. He started working as a substitute for his father as an organist in Storkyrkan, the main church of Stockholm, and from 1753 was permanently employed there. His father also helped him secure a position as a musician at the royal court, and he eventually rose to the position of chief conductor at Kungliga Hovkapellet and concertmaster, but this work was largely without a salary. Only from 1758 did he receive payment for his services to the court. The same year he became a member of the Freemasons and in 1763 he joined (The Worshipful Company of Carpenters). In 1758‚Äì59, he traveled to Saint Petersburg. There he received the commission to write the music for the opera Il Giudizio Di'Aminta (with text by Lodovico Lazaroni), performed as part of the celebrations of the birthday of the future Empress Catherine. Invigorated by this success, Zellbell pursued his musical career with more energy on his return to Stockholm. During the 1760s and 1770s he organised many concerts, especially in the House of Nobility, which at the time was a popular concert venue. Il Giudizio Di'Aminta was performed there again in 1759 and 1760, and in 1767 he organised a concert in memory of his former teacher Roman. In 1771 he was also one of the co-founders of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and the only of the co-founders who was a professional musician. He was active as a teacher at the academy following its foundation. In 1778 he organised a concert in Stockholm for the last time. He died impoverished in his native city in 1780, \\"but left a violin, some keyboard instruments, a collection of scores and an important book collection.\\" He also left a legacy through his work as a teacher. Perhaps his most successful student was Olof √Öhlstr√∂m. Works The opera Il Giudizio Di'Aminta has been described as Zellbell's most accomplished work. He wrote an opera-ballet, Sveas H√∂gtid eller De fria konsternas v√∂rdnadsoffer √•t dygderna (with libretto by Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg), but only the overture has been preserved. He wrote several cantatas, some music for orchestra as well as a few pieces for organ and keyboard. His style is very similar to that of his father, and it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the two. They share a style \\"marked by the transition from baroque to gallant style, with baroque features in the church music, in pompous introductory movements to cantatas and fugue parts in the symphonies.\\" Some of the works attributed to him have turned out to be by other composers, e.g. Roman and Andrea Bernasconi.

After being taken out of service, Kuskanook was sold for use as a floating hotel, finally sinking in 1936. The vessel name is also seen spelled Kooskanook.  Route  Kootenay Lake was a long glacially-carved lake running north to south in the Kootenay region in British Columbia. About half-way along the lake's length, an extension called the Western Arm curved in to Nelson, BC. Near the junction of the Western Arm with the main lake were, on the north of the arm, Balfour, and on the south, Proctor. North of Balfour, about halfway between the Western Arm and Lardeau, was the town of Kaslo, British Columbia. Just to the east across the lake from the Western Arm there were landings at Kootenay Bay, Crawford Bay, and Pilot Bay. At the southern end of the lake was Kootenay Landing, which was the furthest point reached by railroad when Kuskanook was built.  Construction  Kuskanook was built by James M. Bulger (c1859-1925) at Nelson, British Columbia in 1906 for the Canadian Pacific Railway. No sternwheeler had been built in Nelson since Moyie was launched in 1898. Kuskanook was one of a pair of nearly identical vessels ordered by CPR, the other being Okanagan, which was placed into service in 1907 on Okanagan Lake. Both Kuskanook and Okanagan were based on the design of an earlier vessel, the Arrow Lakes sternwheeler Rossland. The vessel cost $104,145.37. The parts had been manufactured in eastern Canada and brought to Nelson to be assembled. The launch on May 5, 1906 was reportedly attended by 3,500 people.  Dimensions  Kuskanook was , long, measured over the hull, exclusive of the fantail on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The steamer had a beam of with a depth of hold of . The Canadian merchant vessel registry number was Canada #121758. According to one source, Kuskanook had 37 staterooms and was licensed to carry 450 passengers. Another, more detailed source, states that Kuskanook had four dining room tables, with total seating for 32 persons, with 39 staterooms, and a total passenger capacity of 400.. By the mid-1920s Kuskanook could carry eight motor vehicles, mostly on the route between Nelson and the settlement of Kuskonook, just north of Kootenay Landing. Kuskanook had three decks, the freight and machinery deck, above which were the passenger deck and the texas deck. The wheelhouse was placed just forward of the funnel and stepped back from forward edge of the texas deck cabins. The passenger accommodations were the finest yet seen on the Canadian Pacific's sternwheelers. Kuskanook required a crew of twenty-eight, including seven officers.  Engineering  Kuskanook was driven by twin steam engines turning a stern-wheel. Each steam engine was horizontally mounted, with a cylinder bore of , and a piston stroke of . The steam plant generated 32.3 nominal horsepower; 560 indicated horsepower. The boiler generated steam pressure ad 180 p.s.i. Career Kuskanook and other lake steamers were often the only connections the communities along Kootenay Lake had with the outside world. Kuskanook made its initial trip on July 19, 1906, running from Nelson BC to Kootenay Landing. Kootenay Landing was the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which reached the landing from points east through Crowsnest Pass. Increasing demand for lake transport on this run was the main reason for placing Kuskanook into service. Because of the connection to the Crowsnest railway, the Nelson- Kootenay Landing run was called the ‚ÄúCrow Boat‚Äù route. Increasing demand for lake transport on this run was the main reason for placing Kuskanook into service. Kuskanook was extensively refitted in 1911, and in 1913 was replaced on the Nelson-Kootenay Landing run by the new steel-hulled steamer Naskookin. Kuskanook was refitted in 1914 and placed on the Nelson-Kaslo run. From 1914 to December 31, 1930 Kuskanook was also operated as a relief steamer for Nasookin, and for excursions departing from Nelson. Kuskanook also called at Balfour, where before the First World War, to encourage tourism, the Canadian Pacific had built a 50-room hotel.  Steam pipe explosion  Kuskanook (left) and other lake steamers tied up at Proctor BC in May 1931, after completion of the rail link between Kootenay Landing and Proctor. In 1925 there was a steam pipe explosion on Kuskanook. A water trap failed in the main steam pipe leading aft to the boiler, and high pressure steam burst out all through the engine room. Three crew members were scalded to death. This was probably the worst fatal accident in the history of the Canadian Pacific's Lake and River Service.  Last years  The completion of the B.C. Southern rail link between Kootenay Landing and Proctor eliminated the need for steamboat service between the two points. Road construction had already reduced the demand for steamer transport. In 1931, Kuskanook was worked on the Proctor-Crawford Bay- Lardeau run, and on excursions.. Disposition In December 1931, Canadian Pacific sold Kuskanook to Arthur D. Pochin (1885-1950). Canadian Pacific decided to keep Moyie in service, even though older, because Kuskanook‚Äôs wooden hull made the boat surplus. Pochin tied Kuskanook up to a wharf at Nelson for use as a floating hotel. The boat was later towed to Kootenay Landing, where it sank in 1936.  Wreck status  The wreck of Kuskanook lies at Kokanee Landing, on Highway 3A, about 30 km east of Nelson.Royal BC Museum Living Landscapes The wreck lies perpendicular to the shore, and can be readily seen during low water.

The building was designed and owned by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and completed by Nanni di Baccio Bigio or his son Annibale Lippi. After Sangallo, the palace belonged among others to the Ricci, Ceoli and Sacchetti, important families of the Roman nobility. Among the artworks that decorate the interior, the cycle of frescoes depicting the Storie di David by Francesco Salviati represents an important work of Mannerism. The palace also housed hundreds of paintings that would become the nucleus of the Pinacoteca Capitolina. Palazzo Sacchetti is widely considered the most important palace in Via Giulia. Location The building is located in Rome, in the Ponte Rione, at n. 66 of Via Giulia, on the western side of the northern part of the street. To the southeast it overlooks Vicolo del Cefalo, to the northwest Vicolo Orbitelli, while to the southwest, with the side once reflecting in the Tiber, it faces Lungotevere dei Sangallo.Pietrangeli (1981), inside front cover History Antonio da Sangallo the Younger built on buildings and land that had been sold to him in 1542 by the Vatican Chapter this palace, which was one of the three properties of the architect on Via Giulia.Pietrangeli (1981), p. 40 On the main fa√ßade of the building still stands out the coat of arms ‚Äì today chiselled ‚Äì of the Pope and his main client, Paul III Farnese (r. 1534-1549), together with the inscription: alluding perhaps to the generosity of the pope towards him. On the same fa√ßade is still visible the plaque walled ab antiquo that attests the ownership of the architect: The attribution of the building to Antonio is also confirmed by various drawings and sketches by the artist's own hand of his house by San Biagio preserved in the Uffizi and by Giorgio Vasari, who writes that Sangallo:Giorgio Vasari: Vita d'Antonio da Sangallo Architettore Fiorentino (1568) Sangallo's original project foresaw two storeys plus the attic, each with five windows. After Antonio's death in 1546, on 23 July 1552 his son Orazio sold the property to Cardinal Giovanni Ricci from Montepulciano, Tuscany, for the sum of 3,145 Roman scudi.Fragnito (2016) The cardinal had the palace freed from the censo tax (the fact is remembered on a plaque on Vicolo del Cefalo) and had it completed, merging adjacent houses purchased by him. The author of the works was probably Nanni di Baccio Bigio, or according to another hypothesis (based on the stylistic kinship between the palace and the suburban villa ‚Äì the future Villa Medici ‚Äì that the cardinal had built in those same years) his son Annibale Lippi.Callari (1932), p. 254Portoghesi (1970), p. 196 On this occasion the fa√ßade of the palace on Via Giulia was extended by adding two windows, while the main door was enlarged and moved to the right. Between 1552 and 1554 the cardinal also had the piano nobile decorated by Francesco Salviati and other mannerist artists. Economic difficulties forced him in 1557 to a fictitious sale of the palace for 25,000 scudi to his friend Tommaso Marino di Terranova, a very rich Genoese financier who in the same period had the Palazzo Marino built in Milan. Marino allowed the Cardinal to live there and sold it to the latter‚Äôs nephew Giulio Ricci in 1568. When the cardinal died in 1574, his nephew Giulio sold it definitively to the Pisan banker Tiberio Ceuli.Pietrangeli (1981), p. 42 The Ceuli family invested a lot in the building: the wing towards Vicolo Orbitelli, the courtyard and the completion of the rear part are due to it. They also had the fa√ßades towards the river decorated by Giacomo Rocca with sgraffiti, of which few traces remain today. The Ceuli also had the building raised one floor higher, decorating the cornice with the heraldic motif of the double eight- pointed star taken from their coat of arms.Merg√© (2015), p. 45 The name of the house, corrupted in Cefalo (), has passed to the alley that runs along the palace to the south, called Vicolo del Cefalo. In 1608, the Ceuli family sold the Palace to Cardinal Ottavio Acquaviva d'Aragona, whose coats of arms still decorate the chapel of the palace, built by him. The Acquaviva family sold the building in turn in 1649 to Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, a member of the noble Florentine family.Merg√© (2015), p. 46 The Cardinal had Carlo Rainaldi carry out the last important works in the building, modifying the rear part and having the stairs built that went down to the Tiber. With him the palace acquired a great importance, hosting a picture gallery rich of almost 700 paintings. His heirs sold part of it in 1748 to Pope Benedict XIV (r.1740-1758), who made it the original nucleus of the Pinacoteca Capitolina. The Sacchetti family has been in possession of the palace since then until 2015: in that year, part of the palace corresponding to the entire piano nobile inherited by Giovanna Zanuso, spouse of the deceased Giulio Sacchetti, was sold to the banker Robert De Balkany. After the latter's death it has been put on sale again by Sotheby's. Architecture The Loggia of Palazzo Sacchetti towards the Tiber, once overlooking the river The main fa√ßades of the palace overlook Via Giulia and Vicolo del Cefalo, where there are 9 windows.Pietrangeli (1981), p. 44 Both fa√ßades are made of brick with travertine windows, while the portal on Via Giulia is made of marble, and is surmounted by a balcony surrounded by fine bronze balustrades. On the ground floor, which is attributed to Sangallo, there are 6 windows of the inginocchiato () type.Portoghesi (1970), p. 356 Each of them, closed by a grille, has an architrave and frame, and a protruding threshold supported by two large corbels. Between each pair of these opens a small window that gives light to the cellars. The first floor has a row of 7 windows with frames and corbels; among these, the central one has been enlarged to fit the balcony. Above one of the windows is the chiselled coat of arms of Paul III. Each window on the first floor is surmounted by a small window of approximately square shape. The second floor also has seven windows, but simpler than those on the first floor. A corbelled cornice concludes the building. Near the left corner of the facade on Via Giulia there is a fountain embedded in a niche flanked by caryatids. In its interior there is a cupid with two dolphins and the chiseled Ceuli coat of arms. The motif of the fountain is inspired by the arms of the house of Ceuli. The courtyard is bordered by an arcade (the lateral arches being infilled) on Doric pillars, and ends with a doric frieze adorned with weapons and the Ceuli coat of arms. In the middle of the courtyard there is a nymphaeum adorned with stuccoes. On the left there is an overhang caused by the chapel added by the Acquaviva family, probably made by Agostino Ciampelli to a design by Pietro da Cortona. The Sacchetti coat of arms was added later. On the side towards the Lungotevere the palace ends with a loggia once overlooking the river, created by the Ceuli and modified by the Sacchetti, adorned with a colossal marble head (possibly Juno)Pietrangeli (1981), p. 48 and two mascarons. The loggia is the backdrop to a citrus garden. Interiors and decoration David dances in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the presence of Mikal, fresco by Francesco Salviati in the audience hall In the hallway is a Roman relief of the third century AD, depicting an episode of the reign of Septimius Severus. Above this is a Madonna and child of 1400's Florentine school.Pietrangeli (1981), p. 46 On the first floor, noteworthy is the hall of the audiences of Cardinal Ricci, called the Sala dei Mappamondi from two globes () ‚Äì one terrestrial and one celestial ‚Äì by Vincenzo Coronelli placed there: the presence of a canopy testifies to the frequent papal visits. It is decorated with frescoes by mannerist painter Francesco Salviati and aids, painted in 1553‚Äì1554 and depicting Stories of David (the descriptions start from the wall to the right of those who look at the windows in a clockwise direction). *First wall **Saul attempts to stab David; **Death of Saul and Jonathan; **Announcement to David of the death of Saul; *Second wall **The killing of Uriah; **Bathsheba's bath; **Bathsheba goes to David; *Third wall **David speaks to the soldiers; **Death of Absalom; **Announcement to David of Absalom's death; *Fourth wall **David saves Saul; **David dances before the Ark of the Covenant in the presence of Mikal; **David saved from Mikal; On Vicolo del Cefalo there are 4 rooms adorned with stuccoes and frescoes, while a group of French and Italian mannerist artists, including Maitre Ponce, Girolamo da Faenza known as Fantino, Marco Marcucci from Faenza, Giovanni Antonio Veneziano, Marco Duval known as il sordo (Marco Francese), Stefano Pieri (Stefano da Firenze), Nicol√≤ da Bruyn, and G. A. Napolitano decorated other rooms towards the garden between 1553 and 1556 with grotesques, Old Testament scenes and mythological scenes. The Gallery, converted into a dining room and banquet hall, is situated towards the Tiber and decorated with paintings depicting biblical subjects by Pietro da Cortona. Also noteworthy is the dining room built by Cardinal Ricci in 1573, decorated with frescoes on the walls by Giacomo Rocca from Salerno, depicting pairs of sibyls and prophets on the model of the Sistine Chapel.Merg√© (2015), p. 47 The room is also adorned with two frescoes by Pietro da Cortona depicting The Holy Family and Adam and Eve. The ceiling of the dining room was made in 1573 by woodcarver Ambrogio Bonazzini, who later sculpted the ceiling of the Oratorio del Gonfalone. ReferencesSources   External links * Category:Rome R.

Conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I on 17 May 1915, Mashchenko was sent to the 223rd Reserve Infantry Regiment at Aleksandropol. After graduating from the regimental training detachment in January 1916 he served as a junior and senior unter-ofitser in the Caucasus campaign at Erzurum. Mashchenko was wounded and hospitalized at Baku and Yekaterinodar between June and August, and then until late January 1918 served with the Expeditionary Corps of General Nikolai Baratov in Persia. During the Russian Civil War, Mashchenko joined the 1st Caucasian Cavalry Regiment of the Caucasian Cavalry Division of the Red Army on 15 February 1918, serving as regimental adjutant and commissar. With the regiment, he fought against the Volunteer Army in Don Host Oblast and in the retreat of the 11th Army from the North Caucasus to Astrakhan via Kizlyar. Mashchenko commanded a platoon of the 37th Cavalry Regiment of the 7th Samara Cavalry Division, formed from the 1st Special Cavalry Division of the army, beginning in April 1919. He rose to command a squadron of the 40th Cavalry Regiment of the division in September 1920 and a month later became commander of the barrier detachment of the division. With the division, he fought in battles on the Astrakhan steppe and at Tsaritsyn, in the invasions of Azerbaijan and Georgia, the elimination of Ulagay's Landing, and the fighting against the Army of Wrangel at Yuzovka, Melitopol, and Dzhankoy. From January 1921 he returned to squadron command in fighting against the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine in south Ukraine and the Ukrainian People's Army troops of Yuriy Tyutyunnyk near Kiev.  Interwar period  From August 1922 to September 1924 Mashchenko studied at the Higher Cavalry School in Petrograd, and upon graduation returned to the his regiment, now stationed in Belarus. During the next several years, he served as chief of the regimental school of the 40th, commander of the school battalion of the 38th Cavalry Regiment and assistant regimental commander for supply of the 39th Cavalry Regiment. After completing the Remount Commander Improvement Course at Moscow between January and October 1929, Mashchenko became the senior member of the 3rd Ukrainian Remount Commission at Odessa and Kirovo. In October 1930 he became chairman of the 2nd Ukrainian Remount Commission at Kiev. Mashchenko served on the staff of the Kharkov Military District from June 1935 as chief of the 3rd section of the 4th department, and from November 1937 to February 1938 temporarily commanded the 2nd Reserve Cavalry Regiment. In November 1938, by now a colonel, he became commander of the 66th Reserve Cavalry Regiment. Appointed commander of the 127th Rifle Division on 16 July 1940, he was transferred to command the 159th Rifle Division on 29 July. In the same month, Mashchenko went to the Frunze Military Academy for the Improvement Course for Higher Commanders. After completing the course, he returned to his command on 21 May.  World War II  When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Mashchenko's division was part of the 6th Rifle Corps of the 6th Army. The division was able to hold its positions briefly, utilizing the defenses of the 6th (Rava-Ruska) Fortified Region, giving little ground on the first day of the war. On 23 June, the army commander ordered the division to counterattack the German troops in the gap between the 41st and 97th Rifle Divisions of the corps. In the fighting near Magerov on the same day, Mashchenko was killed by a grenade.

She is co-founder and president of the women's rights organization Promotion et Appui aux Initiatives Feminines (PAIF) which works to combat sexual violence and increase the participation of women in civic life.  Early life and education  Birhaheka was born in a rural part of South Kivu in 1960. She studied rural development as a college student in Bukavu. Her interest in improving the lives of women first began while working on a nutrition study looking at the types of labor done by rural women. This area of study would become the subject of her college thesis. After witnessing the marginalization of women in Congolese society, both in the rural communities she studied and in her own experiences of higher education, Birhaheka began speaking up in favor of women's rights.  Career  Birhaheka began working for an NGO after completing her university studies. She was hired to work on gender issues as part of their women's department, but encountered the same patriarchal culture within the organization itself. After working on behalf of several other NGOs, and becoming frustrated with the way women were universally sidelined, she and her colleagues decided to create a new NGO to focus specifically on women and women's rights. They founded PAIF, or Promotion et Appui aux Initiatives Feminines (Promotion and Support of Women's Initiatives) in Goma in 1992. The initial mission of PAIF was to improve women's status in public life: to stop women from being relegated to housework and the home, and instead educate them and facilitate their participation in politics, the law, and human rightscauses. They began by working on water supply systems, to allow girls who would otherwise have to fetch water in the mornings to attend school. PAIF also worked to educate both men and women in rural communities about women's rights, using radio stations to promote \\"the inclusion of women as a development strategy\\". PAIF later broadened its mission to include advocacy on behalf of victims of sexual violence. In the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, as conflict escalated in the region, Birhaheka became aware of the prevalence of victims of wartime sexual violence among the displaced persons she was working with. She worked to raise awareness of rape as a tactic of war, and to support survivors. PAIF began to provide legal and medical support, especially for those who have been disowned by their families, and to operate a safe house in Goma. The organization also advocated for greater enforcement and prosecution of rape as a crime. In 2006 PAIF successfully campaigned for reform in the DRC's laws pertaining to rape, including increased penalties for perpetrators. Amid ongoing violence in the region, Birhaheka and PAIF continue to raise awareness of issues like sexual exploitation of minors. Because of her work on behalf of women and survivors of sexual violence, Birhaheka received death threats from within the government and from militia groups. She was detained twice by the Congolese Intelligence Service.  Awards  Immacul√©e Birhaheka was a recipient of the 2000 Martin Ennals Award for human rights defenders. She received the 2006 Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

It is part of the district of Ludwigslust- Parchim and belongs to the municipality of Barkhagen. About 100 people live in Zarchlin on an area of about 17.5 ha.  History  Zarchlin was first documented in 1253 and at that time still bore the name \\"Zochelin\\". Until 1552 the village belonged to Dobbertin Abbey, a Cistercian monastery. Pitsch, Ruth, 2003: Zarchlin, Chronik eines mecklenburgischen Dorfes, 1253 ‚Äì 2003. Gemeinde Plauerhagen In 1591 it was mentioned in writing that there was a chapel in Zarchlin. It was a half-timbered building and a pastor came every three weeks. The Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648) reached the village in 1625/26 and brought looting, hunger and plague, so that 80% of the then population died. Zarchlin was completely burnt and reduced to ruins. The chapel was also devastated: the roof was missing and the bells lay smashed on the ground. Because it could no longer be preserved, Zarchlin then became part of the parish of Plauerhagen. From the middle of the 18th century the farming village developed into an estate; the farmers were resettled to the village of Plauerhagen, 3.3 km away. In the second half of the 19th century the estate developed further. It had an area of 480 ha large and developed quite well under the tenants Schumacher and Steinkopf. In 1945 the estate was expropriated, used by a Soviet military administration and then looted. One year later the Zarchlin estate was divided among 45 new settlers. Berg, R., 2007: Die Gutsd√∂rfer, Gutsanlagen und Parks im Naturpark und seinem Umfeld Later Zarchlin was merged with the villages of Karow and Plauerhagen to form a large agricultural enterprise, and an agricultural cooperative (LPG) was established. Today the farmland is privately operated and the manor house is also privately owned. Some buildings from the later development stages of the village are still preserved.  Climate and geography  The average temperature in Zarchlin is about 8¬∞ to 9¬∞ C, with average values of about 2¬∞ C in winter and 18¬∞ C in summer. There is about 550 to 600 mm of precipitation per year and the duration of daylight varies between 7 and 17 hours.

Westermann Schroedel Diesterweg Sch√∂ningh Winklers GmbH, Braunschweig The village is located in the Mecklenburg Lake Plateau and lies south of the river Mildenitz. In the northeast, south and northwest there are small forest areas, otherwise there are arable land and pastures around the village. Zarchlin is 68 meters above sea level. The surroundings of Zarchlin are formed by a ground moraine of the Vistula Ice Age (ca. 75000 - 10000 B.C.) and the ground is flat to even.  Infrastructure  Zarchlin obtains water from the waterworks of the city Plau am See. There is no central village drainage system: mechanically treated wastewater seeps away or reaches a receiving watercourse via ditches, from where the water is discharged into the Lake in Daschow. The village has wind power plants located south of Zarchlin. The electric current from these is transmitted to Plau am See and comes back to Zarchlin from the transformer station there. Zarchlin is connected to the natural gas supply of Hansegas.  Manor house  Around 1935, the manor house in the west of the village included a complex of several buildings and other objects. Of these, only the manor house and the foal stable are preserved today as renovated private homes. The complex also included a horse stable, two barns, a sheepfold, a cattle shed, a pigsty, a granary, a farmhouse, a henhouse, a well and two ponds. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the manor house served as the town hall, the office of the LPG of Zarchlin, a kindergarten and a consumer shop (Konsum). Today the restored manor house is a listed building and is privately owned. It includes a small park, which is located south of the house. On the green area in front of the manor house there is a monument built of boundary stones, with the inscription \\"\\" (\\"Alone we are nothing, united we are everything\\"). The monument refers to the collectivisation of agriculture in the middle of the 20th century.  Railway station  Zarchlin has a single-track railway station about 1.5 km north of the village. It has been out of service for about 20 years. It gives its name to \\"\\" (Station Street), which is one of the two streets of the village.

They are former one-time and longest reigning WWE Women's Tag Team Champions and have headlined the 2019 TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event.  History Women's Tag Team Champions (2019‚Äì2020)= After spending some weeks away to promote the movie Fighting with My Family, retired wrestler Paige made a backstage appearance on the 9 April 2019 episode of SmackDown, where she announced that she would be bringing a new tag team to the division to feud with The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce) for their Women's Tag Team Championship. A week later, Paige introduced the newly formed team of Asuka and Kairi Sane, known as \\"The Kabuki Warriors\\", who subsequently made their debut as a team by teaming with Bayley and Ember Moon to defeat The IIconics and the team of Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville. Kabuki Warriors would then pick up wins over local wrestlers on the April 30 episode of SmackDown and the team of Rose and Deville on the May 14 SmackDown, before beginning a feud with IIconics over the Women's Tag Team Championship throughout the summer. After defeating IIconics at live events in Tokyo on June 28, Kabuki Warriors received an opportunity against IIconics for the Women's Tag Team Championship on the July 16 episode of SmackDown which they won by count out however, the IIconics retained their titles. On the August 5 episode of Raw, the Kabuki Warriors participated in a fatal four-way elimination tag team match for the Women's Tag Team Championship but were the last ones eliminated by Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. They unsuccessfully challenged Bliss and Cross for the titles on the August 12 episode of Raw. Kabuki Warriors received another title shot against Bliss and Cross at the Hell in a Cell event, where the Kabuki Warriors won the Women's Tag Team Championship, after Asuka used green mist on Cross, thus showing signs of a villainous turn. Kabuki Warriors were then drafted to the Raw brand on the October 14 episode of Raw. They solidified their status as villains on the October 28 episode of Raw by turning on their manager by Paige when Asuka spat mist into Paige's face and thus ending their association with Paige. The Kabuki Warriors retained the Women's Tag Team Championship against Dakota Kai and Tegan Nox on the October 30 episode of NXT and Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair on the November 11 episode of Raw. At Survivor Series, the Kabuki Warriors represented Raw in the 5-on-5-on-5 women's elimination match against Team SmackDown and Team NXT, which Team NXT won. Asuka turned on her teammate Charlotte Flair by spitting green mist on her, causing Flair to get eliminated, which led to Kabuki Warriors beginning a feud with Lynch and Flair. Kabuki Warriors successfully defended the Women's Tag Team Championship against Lynch and Flair, Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross and Bayley and Sasha Banks in a fatal four-way match at Starrcade. Kabuki Warriors continued their feud with Lynch and Flair, which led to them defending the titles against Lynch and Flair in the namesake main event of the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event, which Kabuki Warriors retained. This led to Asuka entering a feud with Lynch in 2020 over the latter's Raw Women's Championship, which Asuka failed to win in subsequent matches at the Royal Rumble and the February 10 episode of Raw. Kabuki Warriors would then begin feuding with Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross, which led to a match between the two teams at WrestleMania 36, where Kabuki Warriors lost the titles back to Bliss and Cross. They unsuccessfully challenged Bliss and Cross for the titles in a rematch on the April 10 episode of SmackDown. =Asuka's Raw Women's Championship reign (2020)= On the April 13 episode of Raw, Asuka defeated Ruby Riott to qualify for the women's Money in the Bank ladder match while Kairi Sane lost to Nia Jax in a qualifying match. Asuka went on to win the match at the namesake event, thus winning the women's Money in the Bank contract which allowed her to cash in for a future title shot at the time and place of her choosing. The following night on Raw, Asuka was awarded the Raw Women's Championship by former champion Becky Lynch, who vacated the title due to her pregnancy, which led to Asuka embracing Lynch and it resulted in Kabuki Warriors turning into fan favorites. Kabuki Warriors then began feuding with Sasha Banks and Bayley as Banks and Asuka fought to a no contest at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules after Bayley interfered and counted the pinfall for Banks though Banks was not recognized as champion. On the July 27 episode of Raw, Sane was viciously attacked by Bayley backstage during the Raw Women's Championship match between Asuka and Sasha Banks which led to Asuka running to the backstage area where she was counted out and lost the title. This was done to write Sane out of the storylines as she announced her departure from WWE on Twitter as she was heading back to Japan to be with her husband, effectively disbanding The Kabuki Warriors.

Eighth Judicial District Court, 135 Nev. Adv. Op. 42 (2019), was a landmark decision of the Nevada Supreme Court in which the Court entitled every defendant charged with misdemeanor domestic battery to a jury trial in the State of Nevada. The case has been called \\"the most significant Nevada Supreme Court case of the 21st century.\\" Background In Andersen v. Eighth Judicial District Court, the defendant was charged with battery which constitutes domestic violence, a first offense, and was set to stand trial in the Las Vegas Municipal Court. He asked for a jury trial, but in accordance with longstanding Nevada law, was told he was not entitled to a jury for a misdemeanor charge. He pled no contest and was found guilty, and appealed his conviction based on the fact that he was denied his right to a jury. Decision The case eventually made it to the Nevada Supreme Court. Andersen's attorney Michael Pariente argued that a defendant charged with battery constituting domestic violence has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because a defendant loses his or her Second Amendment right upon conviction of the offense by letting a judge, and not a jury, decide guilt or innocence. The Court reversed the defendant's conviction, and declared that henceforth, for the first time since Nevada became a state in 1864, every defendant charged with misdemeanor domestic battery is entitled to a jury trial. \\"The Nevada Supreme Court‚Äôs Sept. 12 decision held that misdemeanor domestic violence defendants are entitled to a jury trial because of a 2017 law banning those convicted of the crime from owning guns. The ban on gun ownership elevated the crime from a petty offense that doesn‚Äôt entitle a defendant to a jury to a more serious offense with jury rights, the court said.\\" References Category:Trials in the United States Category:Crimes in Nevada Category:Nevada state case law ","title":"Andersen v.

Searching is directed by Aneesh Chaganty, co-written by Chaganty and Ohanian, and stars John Cho and Debra Messing. The film premiered at Sundance in 2018 and sold to Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions. Searching was made on a budget of under a million dollars and went on to gross over $75M at the box office. The film also received multiple awards including, the Sundance Next Audience Award and Alfred P. Sloan Award. Qasabian and Ohanian produced Run, a thriller directed by Chaganty and starring Sarah Paulson for Lionsgate. Run was expected to release on Mothers Day Weekend 2020, but due to the coronavirus outbreak the release has been delayed. Qasabian has also been announced to be producing an upcoming sequel to Searching.

During the arrest Derek Chauvin, a white police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department, knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes after he was already handcuffed and lying face down. Two police officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, assisted Chauvin in restraining Floyd, while a further officer Tou Thao prevented bystanders from interfering with the arrest and intervening as events unfolded. Floyd had complained about being unable to breathe prior to being on the ground, but after being restrained he became more distressed, and continued to complain about breathing difficulties, the knee in his neck, and expressed the fear he was about to die and called for his mother. After several minutes passed Floyd stopped speaking. For a further two minutes, he lay motionless and officer Kueng found no pulse when urged to check. Despite this Chauvin refused pleas to lift his knee until medics told him to. The following day, after videos made by witnesses and security cameras became public, all four officers were dismissed. Two autopsies found Floyd's death to be a homicide. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, to which was later added second-degree murder. The three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Floyd's death triggered worldwide protests against police brutality, police racism, and lack of police accountability. In early June, the Minneapolis City Council voted an intent to restructure the police department as a \\"new community-based system of public safety\\". The Minneapolis Police Chief cancelled contract negotiations with the police union and announced plans to bring in outside experts to examine how the union contract can be restructured to provide transparency and \\"flexibility for true reform\\". People involved George Floyd in 2016 George Perry Floyd (aged 46) was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and raised in the Third Ward of Houston, Texas. In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis, Minnesota area. Though he resided in the nearby suburb of St. Louis Park, he was a frequent customer at the Cup Foods convenience store in south Minneapolis. Derek Michael Chauvin (age 44) had been a police officer in the Minneapolis Police Department since 2001. Chauvin and Floyd sometimes worked overlapping shifts as security guards for a local nightclub, but the club's former owner was unsure of the extent to which they knew each other. Tou Thao (age 34) started as a part-time community service officer in 2008 and graduated from the police academy in 2009. After a two-year layoff he resumed work for the police in 2012. Six complaints had been filed against Thao, none resulting in disciplinary action. In 2014, a man claimed Thao handcuffed him without cause, threw him to the ground, and punched, kicked, and kneed him; the man's teeth were broken and he was hospitalized. The resulting lawsuit was settled for $25,000. James Alexander Kueng (age 26) and Thomas Kiernan Lane (age 37) were licensed as law enforcement officers in August 2019. Kueng and Lane had trained together, and were in their first week as Minneapolis police officers when Floyd was killed. Chauvin was the superior officer responsible for the majority of Kueng's field training. Thao is Hmong-American, Kueng is African-American, and Chauvin and Lane are white Americans.  Arrest and death  Initial events = alt=Corner store near site of Floyd's death with crowd of protesters On the evening of May 25, 2020, at about 8:00 pm, Floyd purchased cigarettes at Cup Foods, a grocery store at the intersection of East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood of Minneapolis. A store employee believed Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 bill. (video @ YouTube ) (video @ YouTube ) Employees of the store approached Floyd while he was in his vehicle and demanded that Floyd return the cigarettes; he refused. A store employee called the police to report that Floyd had passed \\"fake bills\\", was \\"awfully drunk\\", and \\"not in control of himself\\". The interaction between Floyd and the employees was recorded by the restaurant's security camera. At 8:08, Kueng and Lane arrived, briefly entering Cup Foods before crossing the street to Floyd's SUV. Lane tapped his flashlight on the window, startling Floyd. He asked Floyd to show his hands, and tapped again when he did not obey. Floyd apologized as he opened the car door. Lane instructed him three more times to show his hands. Six seconds after the door opened, he drew his gun and ordered Floyd to show his hands. When Floyd complied, Lane holstered his weapon. Someone parked behind Floyd's SUV began recording a video at 8:10. Following a brief struggle, Lane pulled Floyd from the SUV and handcuffed him. At 8:12, Kueng sat Floyd on the sidewalk against the wall in front of the restaurant. Lane asked Floyd if he is \\"on something right now\\", and Floyd replied \\"No, nothing\\". Kueng told Floyd he was acting \\"real erratic\\" and Floyd said that he was scared. Kueng asked Floyd about foam around his mouth, to which Floyd responded that he had been \\"hooping\\" earlier. According to criminal complaints filed against the officers by state prosecutors, Floyd was \\"calm\\" and said \\"thank you\\". At 8:13, Kueng and Lane told Floyd he was under arrest and walked him to their police car across the street. Floyd fell to the ground next to the car; the officers picked him up and placed him against the car's door. According to prosecutors, Floyd told the officers that he was not resisting, but that he was recovering from COVID-19, that he was claustrophobic and suffered from anxiety, and that he did not want to sit in the car. While Kueng and Lane attempted to put him in the car, Floyd begged them not to, repeatedly saying \\"I can't breathe\\" and offering to lie on the ground instead. During his interview with crime investigators, Lane said that he first saw Floyd bleeding from the mouth at that moment, which he attributed to his \\"thrashing back and forth\\" in the car and hitting his face on the glass that goes to the front seat. A Minneapolis Park Police officer arrived and guarded Floyd's vehicle (across the street by the restaurant) and the two people who had been in it with Floyd. At 8:17, Chauvin and Thao arrived in a third police car joining Kueng and Lane with Chauvin assuming command. He asked if Floyd was going to jail, and Kueng replied that he was arrested for forgery. Floyd said \\"I can't fucking breathe\\" twice. Around 8:18, security footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd for at least a minute in the driver side backseat while Thao watches. According to The New York Times, at 8:19, Chauvin pulled Floyd across the backseat from the driver side to the passenger side. Then, according to NPR, Floyd exited the vehicle, either pulled out by police or willingly. Still handcuffed, he fell to the pavement. =Chauvin kneels on Floyd's neck= While Floyd lay on his chest with his cheek to the ground, Chauvin knelt on his neck. Floyd stopped moving around 8:20, though he was still conscious. Multiple witnesses began to film the encounter, and their videos were circulated widely on the internet. At 8:20, a witness across the street began recording video showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, Kueng applying pressure to Floyd's torso, and Lane applying pressure to Floyd's legs, while Thao stood nearby. This witness stopped filming when one of the officers ordered him to leave. Also at 8:20, a second person, standing near the entrance of Cup Foods, began recording the incident. Floyd can be heard repeatedly saying \\"I can't breathe\\", \\"Please\\", and \\"Mama\\"; Lane then asked for an ambulance for Floyd, \\"for one bleeding from the mouth\\". Floyd repeated at least 16 times that he could not breathe. At one point a witness said: \\"You got him down. Let him breathe.\\" After Floyd said, \\"I'm about to die\\", Chauvin told him to \\"relax\\". An officer asked Floyd, \\"What do you want?\\"; Floyd answered, \\"I can't breathe\\". Floyd said, \\"Please, the knee in my neck, I can't breathe.\\" At approximately 8:22, the officers called for an ambulance on a non-emergency basis, escalating the call to emergency status a minute later. Chauvin continued to kneel on Floyd's neck. A passerby yelled to Floyd, \\"Well, get up, get in the car, man\\", and Floyd, still handcuffed and face down on the pavement, responded, \\"I can't\\", while Chauvin's knee remained on his neck. Floyd cried out \\"Mama!\\" twice. Floyd said, \\"My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts\\", requested water, and begged, \\"Don't kill me.\\" One witness pointed out that Floyd was bleeding from the nose. Another told the officers that Floyd was \\"not even resisting arrest right now\\". Thao countered that Floyd was \\"talking, he's fine\\"; a witness replied that Floyd \\"ain't fine... Get him off the ground... You could have put him in the car by now. He's not resisting arrest or nothing. You're enjoying it. Look at you. Your body language explains it.\\" As Floyd continued to cry for help, Thao said to witnesses: \\"This is why you don't do drugs, kids.\\" By 8:25, Floyd appeared unconscious, and bystanders confronted the officers about Floyd's condition. Chauvin pulled out mace to keep bystanders away as Thao moved between them and Chauvin. Bystanders repeatedly yelled that Floyd was \\"not responsive right now\\" and urged the officers to check his pulse. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist but found no pulse; the officers did not attempt to provide Floyd with medical assistance. According to the criminal complaint against Chauvin, Lane asked Chauvin twice if they should move Floyd onto his side, and Chauvin said no. =Medical response and death= At 8:27 pm, a Hennepin County ambulance arrived. Shortly thereafter, a young relative of the owner of Cup Foods attempted to intervene, but was pushed back by Thao. Emergency medical technicians checked Floyd's pulse. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for almost a minute after the ambulance arrived, despite Floyd being silent and motionless. Prosecutors said that Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for seven minutes and forty-six seconds. Around 8:29, Floyd was lifted by paramedics onto a stretcher, then loaded into an ambulance which departed for Hennepin County Medical Center. En route, the ambulance requested assistance from the Minneapolis Fire Department. At 8:32, firefighters arrived at Cup Foods; according to their report, the police officers gave no clear information regarding Floyd's condition or whereabouts, which delayed their ability to find the ambulance. Meanwhile, the ambulance reported that Floyd was entering cardiac arrest and again requested assistance, asking firefighters to meet them at the corner of 36th Street and Park Avenue. Five minutes later, the fire department reached the ambulance; two fire department medics who boarded the ambulance found Floyd unresponsive and pulseless. Floyd was pronounced dead at 9:25 at the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency room. Investigations and criminal charges Minneapolis police response = Early on May 26, the Minneapolis Police Department issued a statement which said nothing about Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck: \\"After Floyd got out [of his car], he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.\\" Hours later, witness and security camera video circulating on the internet showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. * The department updated its statement by stating that new information had \\"been made available\\" and that the FBI was joining the investigation. The four officers were briefly placed on paid administrative leave before being fired later that day. = Autopsies = The medical examiner's final findings,Press Release Report: Floyd George Perry, Case No: 2020‚Äì3700. Hennepin County Medical Examiner. June 1, 2020.Autopsy Report, George Floyd, Deceased, ME No.: 20‚Äì3700. Hennepin County Medical Examiner. June 1, 2020. (20 pages.) issued June 1, found that Floyd's heart stopped while he was being restrained and that his death was a homicide caused by \\"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\\". Other significant conditions were arteriosclerotic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and recent methamphetamine use. The report states that on April 3 Floyd had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but does not list it as a fatal or other significant condition. Floyd's family commissioned a second autopsy, carried out by Michael Baden, a pathologist and former New York City chief medical examiner who had autopsied Eric Garner, and attended by Allecia Wilson, director of autopsy and forensic services at the University of Michigan Medical School. At a joint press conference with Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump on May 31, Wilson said the evidence available to her, which did not include a toxicology report nor unspecified bodily samples, \\"is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as the cause of Floyd's death\\", and that the death was a homicide. Baden said Floyd died from \\"asphyxia due to compression of the neck\\", affecting \\"blood flow and oxygen going into the brain\\", and also from \\"compression of the back, which interferes with breathing\\". He said Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death, and that being able to speak does not mean that someone is able to breathe. Neither examiner mentioned excited delirium, a condition which concerned Lane and that he discussed with Chauvin while Floyd was pinned down. = State investigations and criminal charges = On May 29, 2020, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second- degree manslaughter, and held at Oak Park Heights state prison. According to the criminal complaint, police are trained that the neck restraint that he applied \\"with a subject in prone position is inherently dangerous\\". On June 3, 2020, the charge against Chauvin was upgraded to second-degree murder, and the three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. On June 10, Lane was released on bail; his attorney asserted that he warned Chauvin of the danger of severe harm to Floyd, and that doing so was all that was required under Minneapolis police regulations at the time. On June 19, Kueng became the second charged officer to be released on bail. Thao then followed suit on July 4. Chauvin was released on conditional bail on October 7, 2020 after a non-cash bond of $1 million was posted.https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile- Cases/27-CR-20-12646/NonCashBond10072020.pdf Court documentation provided that Chauvin's release is more supervised and will be forfeited if he declines to appear before a magistrate, refuses to appear in court on scheduled dates, leaves the state of Minnesota without court approval, or has contact with Floyd's family.https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile- Cases/27-CR-20-12646/NoticeofRelease10072020.pdf On June 17 the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training took up a review of the four officers' law-enforcement licenses. On June 29 the presiding judge in the case indicated that continued public comments on the case, by defense attorneys or public officials, were likely to lead to the case being transferred to another county. = Federal investigations = On May 26, the FBI announced it was reviewing the incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department. On May 28, the United States Department of Justice released a joint statement with the FBI, saying that their investigation into Floyd's death was \\"a top priority\\" and outlining the investigation's next steps: a \\"comprehensive investigation will compile all available information and thoroughly evaluate evidence and information obtained from witnesses ... If it is determined that there has been a violation of federal law, criminal charges will be sought\\". According to some commentators, the statement was considered stronger than usual as the department often had a more muted tone. = Failed plea bargain agreement = On May 28, state and federal prosecutors held a press conference at a regional FBI office in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb, in what was anticipated to be a major development to the case against the officers who were at the scene of Floyd's death. However, Hennepin County Attorney Michael O. Freeman, the local official with jurisdiction to bring forth criminal charges for police misconduct, said his office needed more time to investigate. In explaining the anticipation of the media briefing and its two- hour delayed start, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said, \\"I thought we would have another development to talk to you about, but we don‚Äôt\\". Weeks later, on June 9, it was revealed that state and federal prosecutors were negotiating a plea deal with former officer Derek Chauvin that would have included state murder charges and federal civil rights charges, but the deal fell apart for reasons that were not fully explained. = State civil rights action = The Minnesota Department of Human Rights opened an investigation into the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department on June 2. On June 5, the Minneapolis City Council authorized the mayor to enter a restraining order with the State of Minnesota banning chokeholds and neck restraints, requiring police officers to intervene against other officers' use of excessive force, and requiring authorization from the police chief or other designate before using crowd-control weapons such as chemical agents and rubber bullets. On June 8, a Hennepin County Court judge ordered the Minneapolis Police Department to cooperate with a civil rights investigation, and extended the restrictions on the department to require that the chief make discipline decisions in a timely and transparent manner, and that certain outside investigators be given authority to audit body-worn camera footage and to file or amend complaints on behalf of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department. = Civil litigation = The family of George Floyd filed a lawsuit in federal court against the City of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department in July 2020. The complaint said Floyd's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by \\"excessive use of unjustified, excessive, illegal, and deadly force\\". The lawsuit did not specify the amount of monetary damages the family sought. =Criminal proceedings= On August 29, 2020, attorneys for Derek Chauvin filed a motion for dismissal, claiming that Floyd most likely died as a result of drug use and preexisting medical conditions. On the same day, prosecutors moved to increase potential sentences for the four officers beyond the guidelines for all four accused, arguing that Floyd was vulnerable while being held down on the ground in handcuffs and was treated cruelly.  Memorials, protests, and reactions  A makeshift memorial outside the store where Floyd was killed The area near the location where Floyd was killed became a makeshift memorial throughout May 26, with many placards paying tribute to him and referencing the Black Lives Matter movement. As the day progressed, more people came to demonstrate against Floyd's death. Hundreds of people, then marched to the 3rd Precinct of the Minneapolis Police. Participants used posters and slogans with phrases such as \\"Justice for George\\", \\"I can't breathe\\", and \\"Black Lives Matter\\". On September 18, the Minneapolis City Council approved designating the section of Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th Streets as George Perry Floyd Jr. Place, with a marker at the intersection with 38th Street where the incident took place. The intersection has been closed and occupied by demonstrators who said they won't leave until their demands regarding anti-racism and property tax are met. Unrest began in local protests in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area before quickly spreading nationwide and in over 60 countries internationally supporting Black Lives Matter. Over 2,000 cities in the US have seen demonstrations as of June 13. While the majority of protests have been peaceful, demonstrations in some cities descended into riots and looting, with more being marked by street skirmishes and significant police brutality, notably against peaceful protesters and reporters. At least 200 cities in the U.S. had imposed curfews by June 3, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C, activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel due to the mass unrest. Floyd's brother stands where Floyd was killed The protests were initially peaceful, but later there was vandalism of stores; at the 3rd Precinct police station windows were broken and fires set. Police in riot gear used tear gas, flash grenades, rubber bullets and smoke bombs, and some protesters threw rocks at the police. The media highlighted the apparent differences in aggression between the police response to these protests versus the more measured response to the 2020 United States anti-lockdown protests featuring gun-wielding white protesters. This sentiment also spread on social media. While peaceful protests continued, others again became violent after sundown, with the pattern repeating for several days. As of June 9, the Star Tribune estimated 570 businesses in the MinneapolisSt. Paul area had been vandalized or destroyed, including 67 destroyed by fire. A memorial vigil at alt=Protester holding up a sign reading # I can't breathe George Floyd '93 Following the rioting, a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul and Dakota County was established on May 29. 500 Minnesota National Guard soldiers were later dispatched to the area to enforce the curfew, but to little effect, with about 1,000 protesters being able to march peacefully on Interstate 35 well into curfew. A public memorial, with Al Sharpton delivering the eulogy, was held June 4 at North Central University in Minneapolis. A public viewing and a family memorial was held in Raeford, North Carolina on June 6, near Floyd's hometown. Floyd's family held a public memorial in Houston on June 8, and a private service on June 9. The family said professional boxer Floyd Mayweather paid for the services. Floyd's body was on public view on June 8 in his hometown of Houston. Former Vice President and the 2020 Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, met with the Floyd family privately and gave a video message at the funeral. Floyd is buried next to his mother in Pearland, Texas. alt=Protesters along funeral procession wearing COVID mass and holding signs Mass Protests demanding justice for George Floyd, in some cases also to demonstrate against issues with police brutality in their own countries, took place in over 2,000 cities in the US and around the world, including New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago; Toronto; Mashhad; Milan; Columbus, Ohio; Denver; Des Moines; Houston; Louisville; Memphis; Charlotte, North Carolina; Oakland; Portland, Oregon; San Jose; Seattle; outside the White House in Washington; outside Chauvin's summer home in Windermere, Florida; and in many other locations. On May 30, 12 states called up the National Guard, and at least 12 major cities imposed curfews that weekend. By June 14, protests had extended into a third week after Floyd's death in many cities, accompanied by calls to reform and defund police departments throughout the United States. alt= The length of time that Chauvin was originally reported to have had his knee on Floyd's neck, eight minutes forty-six seconds, was widely commemorated as a \\"moment of silence\\" to honor Floyd. It was also used in chants, protest signs, and messages, as were the words \\"I can't breathe\\". Numerous statues and monuments honoring persons or events associated with slavery and racism were vandalized, removed, or destroyed during the protests in the U.S. and elsewhere. Conspiracy theories began spreading soon after Floyd's death. The Los Angeles Times said on June 22 that some theories had been \\"amplified by a growing number of people on the far right, including some Republican leaders\\" but that \\"some Republicans (had) begun pushing back\\" on false claims and those spreading rumors.

Its main theme is sociopolitical conflict ‚Äì in Krasi≈Ñski's words, \\"[between] aristocracy and democracy\\". It is Krasi≈Ñski's best-known work and is regarded as one of the most important works of Polish Romantic literature.  History  Krasi≈Ñski began work on The Undivine Comedy in June 1833 in Vienna, and finished it in autumn the following year in Venice. It was published in Paris in 1835 anonymously, likely to protect the author's family from any repercussions in the Russian Empire, of which they were subjects. Krasi≈Ñski's writings often contained thinly veiled references to current politics. Krasi≈Ñski would later work on another drama related to The Undivine Comedy. He considered composing a trilogy, of which the Undivine Comedy would likely have been the middle part, but he never finished the project (the draft of the first part would eventually be published in 1852 as Sen. Pie≈õ≈Ñ z ‚ÄûNiedoko≈Ñczonego poematu‚Äù, wyjƒôta z pozosta≈Çych rƒôkopis√≥w po ≈õwiƒôtej pamiƒôci J. S., and more extensively, posthumously as Niedoko≈Ñczony poemat ‚Äì The Unfinished Poem in 1860). The entire trilogy was to have featured the same protagonist, Count Henry, called \\"The Youth\\" in the unfinished prequel, and \\"The Husband\\" in The Undivine Comedy. The play has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Within a few years it received a French translation by . Based on the French translation, in 1868 Robert Lytton published a drama titled Orval, or the Fool of Time which has been inspired by Krasi≈Ñski's work to the point it has been discussed in scholarly literature as an example of a \\"rough translation\\", paraphrase or even plagiarism.The Undivine Comedy was first translated to English in 1864 by Marthy Walker Cook (although she based it on earlier French and German translations), again in 1924 (by Harriette E. Kennedy and Zofia Umi≈Ñska, with a preface by G. K. Chesterton), for the third time in 1977 (By Harold B. Segel) and most recently in 1999 (by Charles S. Kraszewski). Initially it was considered too difficult to be adopted properly into a theatre, and it was never staged during Krasi≈Ñski's liftetime. It was finally put on the stage in 1902 in the Juliusz S≈Çowacki Theatre in Krak√≥w by and since that time it has been staged numerous times in Poland and abroad. Gordon M. Wickstrom, writing in 1972, noted that \\"since World War II nearly all leading Polish directors have undertaken\\" directing the play, also noting that while it has been produced in a number of other European countries, it has remained \\"unproduced and nearly unknown in English\\". In 1988 Michael Finnissy directed an operatic version of it, shown in Paris and London. In Poland, it has been directed by among others Arnold Szyfman (Warsaw 1920), Leon Schiller (Warsaw 1926, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ 1938), (Warsaw 1959), (Krak√≥w 1965), Adam Hanuszkiewicz (Warsaw 1969) and (Warsaw 2002) to the music of composers such as Ludomir R√≥≈ºycki, Jan Maklakiewicz, Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz and Krzysztof Penderecki staged the play from the 1920s onward. It has been a part of secondary-education curriculum in Poland since at least 1923.  Plot  The plot of the drama takes place in the near future, where Krasi≈Ñski used recent contemporary events, such as the French Revolution, and the ensuing power struggle between the Jacobins and other factions as inspiration and extrapolating a number of social trends, describing a fictional pan-European revolution against the Christian aristocracy. The protagonist of the drama, Count Henry (in Polish, Henryk), is a conflicted poet, who find himself leading, together with his fellow aristocrats, a defense of the Holy Trinity castle, against revolutionary forces professing democratic and atheist ideals, commanded by a leader named Pancras (in Polish, Pankracy). In the end, both sides are portrayed as a failure: while the revolutionaries take the castle, their leader increasingly doubts the righteous of their cause, and the drama ends with him seeing the vision of the Christianity being triumphant after all. The play is divided into four parts and thirty-two scenes. The first two parts of the work build up the character of Count Henry, focusing on his private life as a husband, father, and artist; while the next two are focused on large revolutionary struggle.  Analysis  The initial title of the drama was MƒÖ≈º (The Husband). Another title that Krasi≈Ñski considered was Ludzka Komedia (The Human Comedy). That title as well as the final title of the drama that Krasi≈Ñski settled on were both inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy and have a double meaning: it depicts history as a work of humanity, or as a comedy taking place in absence of divine intervention, but contrary to God's will. The work has been influenced by Krasi≈Ñski's thoughts about the Polish November Uprising and the contemporary French July Revolution of 1830, coupled with his study of the changes wrought by the emerging capitalism to Western Europe. Krasi≈Ñski's work effectively discussed the concept of class struggle before Karl Marx coined the term. It has been described as the \\"first literary expression of class war\\" and a \\"queer prefiguring of Marx\\". The philosophy of the revolutionaries in the drama has been described as \\"nothing other than dialectical materialism\\". The drama's themes are social revolution and the destruction of the noble class. It is critical both of the weak and cowardly aristocracy, whose destruction it prophesized, but also of the revolution, which he portrayed as a destructive force. The work is also tackling the topics of the identity of a poet, the nature of poetry, and myths of romantic ideals such as perfect love, fame and happiness. Count Henry has been analyzed as an example of the \\"worst possible version of Romantic individualism\\", conceited and egoistical, only partially redeemed by his service to humankind, a task in which he will ultimately fail in as well. Professing to defend the Christian ideals, he ultimately commits the sin of suicide. He has also been described as influenced by Goethe's Faust. Halina Flory≈Ñska-Lalewicz summarized the message of the work as follows: \\"Krasi≈Ñski seems to say that in historical reality neither side can be fully in the right. Righteousness resides solely in the divine dimension, and it can be brought into the world by none other than Providence and the forces aligned with it. Man caught up in history is always a tragic figure, condemned to be imperfect and make the wrong choices.\\" One aspect of the Undivine Comedy that has attracted criticism is its presentation of Jews as conspirators against the Christian world order. Published in 1835, it was one of the first works - perhaps the first - in a string of modern antisemitic literature leading to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Maria Janion thus termed it a \\"tainted masterpiece\\". According to Agata Adamiecka-Sitek, this poses a significant problem today, as the work \\"is both canonical and profoundly embarrassing for Polish culture, on par perhaps with The Merchant of Venice in the western theatre canon.\\" The controversial nature of the material led to the cancellation of a recent stage production by director , that was due to open in 2014 in Warsaw.  Reception  19th century romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz discussed the work in four of his lectures given at the Coll√®ge de France, calling it \\"the highest achievement of the Slavic theater\\", as well as a \\"thoroughly nationalistic... [touching on] all the problems of Polish messianism.\\" He criticized Krasi≈Ñski for his depictions of the \\"Israelites\\" ‚Äì Jews ‚Äì which he characterized as a \\"national offense\\". Monica Mary Gardner in 1915 in her biography of Krasi≈Ñski described the work as \\"the masterpiece of matured genius\\". Over a century after the play was first published, writing in 1959 for The Polish Review called it a \\"masterpiece of Polish drama\\". Shortly afterward, Polish writer and Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz in his 1969 book The History of Polish Literature called this work \\"truly pioneering\\" and \\"undoubtedly a masterpiece not only of Polish but also of world literature\\". Mi≈Çosz notes that it is uprising such a brilliant work was created by an author who was barely out of his teens. Gordon M. Wickstrom in 1972 writing for the Educational Theatre Journal called it \\"the finest achievement of Polish Romantic drama\\". Robert Mann in 1983 in the Slavic and East European Journal noted that it \\"ranks alongside Mickiewicz's Forefather's Eve and S≈Çowacki's Kordian as one of the greatest dramatic works in Polish Romantic literature. In 1986 Frank Northen Magill in the Critical Survey of Drama: Authors wrote that \\"The Undivine Comedy... suffices to ensure Krasi≈Ñski's position as a dramatist of international stature\\". Writing for the same journal as Mann in 1997, Megan L. Dixon described the work as \\"a classic of 19th-century High Romanticism... worthy of comparison to Goethe or Byron\\". Gerard T. Kapolka in 2000 in The Polish Review referred to it as a \\"great play\\". Halina Flory≈Ñska- Lalewicz, in her biography of Krasi≈Ñski (published in 2004 at Culture.pl), calls it an outstanding example of Romantic metaphysical drama. Harold B. Segel, in Polish Romantic Drama: Three Plays in English Translation (2014), remarks that \\"the play has steadily gained prestige in the twentieth century and is widely regarded in contemporary Poland as one of the greatest dramatic works to emerge from the Romantic period.\\" NotesReferences Category:Romantic art Category:1835 plays Category:Polish plays Category:Polish-language plays Category:Plays adapted into operas Category:Plays about marriage Category:Plays about war Category:Plays set in the 19th century Category:Plays set in Poland Category:Plays which debuted after the writer's death ","title":"The Undivine Comedy"},{"id":"64076213","text":"Clara Ursitti is a Canadian-Italian artist based in Glasgow, Scotland.

Presentation  This condition affects women, often under the age of 30 years. The predominant complaint is the inability to urinate for a day or more with no urgency to urinate, in spite of a large bladder volume of more than 1 liters. Normally a person feels the need to urinate at a bladder volume of 400-500ml. The person usually has a progressively increasing lower abdominal pain. The condition is commonly seen in women with Polycystic ovary Syndrome and Endometriosis. It is seen in about one third of women having complaints of urinary retention. They will have no neurological or other urological complaints. Alternatively, women with FS can also present with impairment in urination, like obstructed urination or increased frequency of urination but rarely becoming incontinent.  Cause  The exact cause of Fowler's syndrome is not yet known. The probable cause is an abnormality in muscle membrane, possibly due to a hormonally dependent channelopathy. This may cause an excessive excitability of the external urethral sphincter which prevents the adequate relaxation of the muscle necessary for voiding .  Diagnosis  Cystometrogram shows large bladder capacity and absence of sensations during the filling phase. The maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) is raised. The diagnosis is done by testing the electromyographic (EMG) activity of external striated urethral sphincter. The usual findings are complex repetitive discharges without and with deceleration (decelerating bursts), suggesting an impairment in sphincter muscle relaxation.  Treatment  Sacral neuro modulation is the commonly practiced treatment for restoration of normal micturition. This technique involves modulation of micturition reflex by stimulating S3 nerve root.  History  This disease was described first by Fowler et al in 1985.

Fonthill Splendens was a country mansion in Wiltshire, built by Alderman William Beckford; building began in 1755 and was largely complete by 1770. The construction followed the destruction by fire of the previous Fonthill House. The new mansion had a life of only fifty years, being demolished in 1807. Beckford is usually referred to as Alderman Beckford to distinguish him from his more well-known son, William (Thomas) Beckford of Fonthill Abbey. Fonthill Splendens was a major country house of its time, but knowledge of it has largely been eclipsed by the story of Beckford‚Äôs Gothic edifice, Fonthill Abbey. As with the earlier building, the mansion was in its time just known as Fonthill House. The name Fonthill Splendens may have been used colloquially but only appeared in print in 1829, some twenty years after the house was demolished.  Alderman Beckford's house  This very substantial mansion was built in the Palladian style, largely based on the design of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. It seems that a formal architect may not have been engaged. Credit is usually given to a ‚ÄòMr Hoare a London builder‚Äô. Given the closeness of Fonthill to Stourhead, James or George Hoare may have had some connection to the Hoare family. ground plan, illustrated in Vitruvius Britannicus, Volume 4, 1767.alt=335x335px The building consisted of a nine bay central block on three floors. This was connected by quadrant colonnades to free standing five bay pavilions of two floors. Two flights of steps on the north front led to a portico with pediment on four giant Ionic columns. The principal rooms were all on the first floor or piano nobile, set around a vast central hall, the Organ Hall. The basement or ‚ÄòRustick Story‚Äô floor seems to have been used for everyday living. All the services such as the kitchen and brewhouse were confined to the separate wings, internal passageways in the quadrants connecting them to the central block. Architecturally, the house was considered to be a rather old-fashioned design, some twenty years out of date in comparison to the latest styles. The interior, however, was fitted out by the Alderman in the current taste of the 1760s and was extremely richly decorated throughout, with painted ceilings, elaborate chimney pieces, velvet and damask wall hangings, a library, many oil paintings and tapestries. He also carried out extensive landscaping works to the grounds. The stream flowing north/south through the grounds was dammed to form Fonthill Lake. A bridge crossed the lake, and on the shore a boathouse and several grottoes were built, by Joseph and his son Josiah Lane. The fine North Lodge entrance remains: an archway with pediment over and lodges either side, the facades decorated with vermiculated block rustication. The house seems to have suffered from a low lying position close to the lake, there being many complaints over the years of it being damp.  William Beckford‚Äôs period of ownership  North Gateway to Fonthill Splendens, south face, built for Alderman Beckford, circa 1756 Alderman Beckford died in 1770, thereafter the house was the property of his son William Beckford, then aged ten. He lived in the house for some thirty years before moving to his Fonthill Abbey in 1801. He was brought up in the house, and while he travelled extensively to Europe from 1777 on and had various London townhouses, he nevertheless continued to carry out alterations and improvements. In particular, he restyled the interior in the neoclassical taste, even into the 1790s while he was planning and building the Abbey. His architect for Fonthill Abbey, James Wyatt, was involved in much of the re-design. Also, in 1787 Sir John Soane prepared drawings for a picture gallery on the bedchamber floor, but the design seems not to have been carried out. Beckford ordered the demolition of the mansion in 1807, this despite being urged not to by his architect, Wyatt, and his son- in-law, Alexander Marquess of Douglas (later the 10th Duke of Hamilton). Writing to the Marquess, he described the house as He first ordered the demolition of the east pavilion in 1801 to obtain stone for the Abbey. Then the main central block was sold and demolished in 1807. Only the remaining west pavilion was saved, this being converted into guest accommodation. Some contents were removed to the Abbey, sales of the remainder were held in 1801 with a final sale in 1807.  Significance  Variously described at the time as a ‚Äúpalace‚Äù and ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù, recent research has restored Fonthill Splendens to its place as an important building in the history of the English country house in the second half of the 18th century. In his biography of Beckford, the noted architectural historian James Lees-Milne states that ‚Äòthe Marquess of Douglas begged him piteously to save what was a classical masterpiece‚Äô. The volumes William Beckford 1760 ‚Äì 1844: an Eye for the Magnificent and Fonthill Recovered ‚Äì A Cultural History provide detailed summaries of the building, its appearance and how it was used. In 1987 the extensive landscaped park was recorded as Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

It widely understood to have a profound effect on the lives of patients who experience it. ICF is a common illness of unknown origin, and remains poorly understood. Classification Idiopathic chronic fatigue is classified as a physical medical condition of unknown origin by the World Health Organization. Diagnosis ICF is fatigue of unknown origin, persistjng or relapsing for a minimum of six consecutive months, and failing to meet the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. There is no agreed upon international criteria for idiopathic chronic fatigue however the CDC's 1994 Idiopathic Chronic Fatigue criteria, known as the Fukuda criteria, is commonly used. =Signs and symptoms= * Clinically evaluated fatigue * New or definite onset (not lifelong) * Not resulting from exertion * Fatigue persists or is relapsing for six consecutive months or longer * Fails to meet the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome * The cause is unknown = Exclusions = * Fatigue which begins within 2 years of a substance use disorder (addiction) or at any time after * major depression with psychotic or melancholic features * bipolar disorder * schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders * delusional disorders * the eating disorder bulimia nervosa * dementia of any form * chronic fatigue syndrome * fatigue caused by an active medical condition * fatigue caused by a previous medical condition that may not be fully resolved * fatigue caused as a known side effect of medication * severe obesity (a body mass index greater than 45) =Common medical causes of fatigue= These must be ruled out before a diagnosis of ICF can be made. * Infectious diseases including viruses and TB * Vascular diseases (affecting heart and circulation) * Toxins and drug effects including poisons and substance use (addiction) * Diseases affecting the lungs, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) * Endocrine and metabolic problems, e.g., thyroid diseases and diabetes * Diseases involving benign or cancerous tumours, including cancer fatigue * Psychological or psychosocial conditions, including major depression * Anaemia, Lupus and certain autoimmune or neurological diseases * Occupational stress or other life stress and burnout * Domestic violence Management Idiopathic chronic fatigue is typically managed in general medicine rather than by referral to a specialist. There is no cure, no approved drug, and treatment options are limited. Management may involve a form of counseling, or antidepressant medication, although some patients may prefer herbal or alternative remedies. =Counseling= A form of counseling known as cognitive behavioral therapy may help some people manage or cope with idiopathic chronic fatigue. =Medication= There are no approved drugs for ICF. Anti-depressants Antidepressants drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be appropriate. Alternative and complementary treatments Only limited trials had been conducted for alternative and complentary treatments; there is no clear evidence of these treatments being effective for ICF due to a lack of randomized controlled trials.  Prognosis  Over half of patients remain fatigued after one year. Epidemiology Fatigue is common in the general population and often caused by overwork, too much activity or a specific illness or disease. Around 20% of patients who visit their clinician report fatigue. Prolonged fatigue is fatigue that persists for more than a month, and chronic fatigue is fatigue that lasts at least six consecutive months. Idiopathic chronic fatigue affects between 0.62% and 6.42% of patients, with females more likely to be affected than men. Age at onset is typically between age 15 and 24, or over 60 years of age. A significant number of patients present with idiopathic chronic fatigue as part of a mix of symptoms, while others present with a primary problem of fatigue alone.

Early life, education, and career  Francis was born and raised in Jamaica. She attended St Hugh's High School and the University of the West Indies, receiving a Bachelor of Science, magna cum laude, in 2001. Francis operated a bar and a trucking company while attending college in Jamaica. Francis moved to Florida in 2004 and graduated from Florida Coastal School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 2010. She began her legal career as a law clerk at Florida's First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee from 2011‚Äì2017. Francis worked briefly as a litigator at the law firm Shutts & Bowen in Miami before being appointed to the Miami-Dade County Court in 2017 by Governor Rick Scott. Scott elevated her to Miami-Dade's Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court in 2018, and Governor Ron DeSantis laterally appointed her to the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in Palm Beach County in 2019. Francis was assigned to the probate and family division at the Fifteenth Circuit.  Florida Supreme Court  On January 23, 2020, the Florida Judicial Nominating Commission submitted a list of names for two existing Florida Supreme Court vacancies to the Governor. Under the state constitution, the Governor was allowed up to 60 days to make an appointment from that list of a person constitutionally eligible for the office. Judge Francis' name was on the list. On May 26, 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis announced he was appointing Francis to the Supreme Court of Florida. Had she been allowed to take her seat, Francis would have been the first non-Cuban Caribbean-American on the court and possibly the first non-Cuban Caribbean- American to sit on any state‚Äôs supreme court. DeSantis said the delay in making the appointment was due to conditions created by the coronavirus pandemic. Because the Florida Constitution requires Supreme Court justices to have been a member of the Florida Bar for ten years, Francis was ineligible. At first, she did not plan to take her seat until September 24, 2020, when she reached the ten year mark. For this reason, Representative Geraldine Thompson filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Florida to invalidate the appointment and require the State's Judicial Nominating Commission to certify a new list of nominees for the Governor to appoint from. On August 27, 2020, the Court ruled that Governor DeSantis exceeded his authority in appointing Judge Francis because she is not eligible. But the court also ruled that the proper remedy was to choose someone else's name from the list previously submitted to him, and it denied the petition.Thompson v. DeSantis, SC20-985 (Fla. Aug. 27, 2020), https://www.floridasupremecourt.org/content/download/643604/7309482/file/sc20-985.pdf Subsequently, Representative Thompson sought rehearing and asked to amend her petition. The Court denied rehearing but granted amendment to seek the proper remedy. On September 11, 2020, the Court granted Representative Thompson's petition and ordered Governor DeSantis to appoint someone else from the same list. The court determined that Judge Francis was ineligible by the date the appointment was required to be made on March 23, 2020, the end of the 60-day period imposed by the state constitution. Later that same day, Judge Francis withdrew her name from further consideration. The following Monday before announcing the appointment of Jamie Grosshans to the Florida Supreme Court DeSantis announced that he recommended Francis to President Donald Trump for appointment to the Federal Southern District of Florida.https://www.floridabulldog.org/2020/09/florida-supreme-court-reject- renatha-francis-in-line-federal-judgeship/  Personal life  She and her husband Phillip are the parents of two sons.

It premiered in April 2010 at 6pm and was shifted to 8:30pm from July 2010 . During the lock-down imposed in Mar 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all shooting at sets was shut. Following huge audience request, Subarnalata was re-telecast.  Plot  Subarnalata chronicles the life and times of Subarno who is brought up in a progressive household by her mother Satyabati, by enrolling her to Bethune School and imparting in her a deep sense of love for the motherland and respect for the freedom fighters who fought the British. However, Subarno is tricked into marrying at the tender age of 9 into an orthodox family. The marriage is held against Satyabati's wishes and her knowledge by her mother-in-law and Subarno's grandmother, Elokeshi. The incident prompts Satyabati to not acknowledge the marriage in front of Subarno's inlaws. Satyabati's reaction infuriates the in-laws of Subarno, that forms the crux of the treatment meted out to Subarno in later days. The plot mainly revolves around the pathetic circumstances and oppression women of that era were subjected to in orthodox families, who had no voices of their own. Subarno, a strong headed courageous but kind and generous woman, defies all the brutalities of her husband, Prabodh, a hot headed orthodox man, who is unable to accept his beautiful wife's progressive thoughts and is always suspicious of her noble intentions. Subarno's kindhearted ways are supported by her eldest brother-in-law Subodh, and elder sister-in-law Susheel and her open-minded husband Kedar babu.She forges a strong bond with her youngest sister-in-law,Raju (Biraaj) who though dislikes Subarno in the initial days after Subarno's entry in the family, but grows fond of her gradually. The show presents Subarno's realization that to bring about a change, one does not need to wield a weapon like the revolutionaries fighting the British in India but by trying to gradually peel off the harmful traditions by staying within the same society. It documents her daily struggles and turmoils to win the little victories with her perseverance, courage and intelligence and the hardships that she has to go through to achieve them.

Due to his exposed role during the National Socialism period, he was dismissed from university service after 1945. His writings were nevertheless reprinted until the 1970s.  Life  Ansch√ºtz was born in Braunschweig as the son of the late deaf-mute teacher Chr. Ansch√ºtz and his wife Elwine, both of Prussian nationality and Evangelical Lutheran faith. He attended the citizen school there for three and a half years and the Wilhelm- Gymnasium for nine years. After Abitur in 1905 he studied philosophy, psychology and pedagogy in Leipzig and Munich. In 1908 he received his doctorate in Munich under Theodor Lipps with a thesis.√úber Gestaltqualit√§ten. Inaugural-Dissertation ... von Georg Ansch√ºtz on WorldCat Afterwards he stayed for studies in W√ºrzburg and Berlin and went to Paris for one year, where he worked with Alfred Binet in his psychology-pedagogy laboratory. From this time he wrote the German adaptation of Binet's work \\"Les idees modernes sur les enfants\\" under the German title Die neuen Gedanken √ºber das Schulkind.Die neuen Gedanken √ºber das Schulkind on WorldCat In 1910 he returned to Munich, where he stayed until the end of 1911. During this time he published his first major work √úber die Methoden der Psychologie,√úber die Methoden der Psychologie on WorldCat which was soon followed by a second Spekulative, exakt und angewandte Psychologie.Spekulative, exakte und angewandte Psychologie : Eine Untersuchung √ºber die Prinzipien d. psychol. Erkenntnis on WorldCat To support his scientific work he was twice awarded the Froschammer Philosophy Scholarship by the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Munich. After further stays abroad, mainly in Austria, Italy and Switzerland, he moved to Leipzig in early 1912, where he worked with Wilhelm Wundt and Eduard Spranger. = Activity in Hamburg = In Hamburg from 1913 to 1915 Ansch√ºtz was assistant to the experimental psychologist Ernst Meumann in his psychological laboratory. From 1915 to 1918 he taught as a visiting professor in Constantinople. In 1920 he was habilitated at the newly founded University of Hamburg and appointed as a private lecturer, but under Meumann's successor (William Stern) he could not at first obtain a permanent position. In addition to teaching and non-scientific activities, Ansch√ºtz distinguished himself at the time as a pioneer of synaesthesia and, from 1927, organized several congresses on this topic, which were aimed at both scientists and interested laypeople. In 1931, Ansch√ºtz was appointed as an (unpaid) associate professor. = Period of National Socialism = Ansch√ºtz profited directly from the rise of the National Socialists: After his Jewish institute director Stern had already been dismissed in April 1933 under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Ansch√ºtz finally received the longed-for assistant position in November 1933. The position had previously been held by who had been driven to suicide by the Nazis.Guhl in Hamburgische Biografie. Already on 1 May 1933, Ansch√ºtz had joined the NSDAP and on November 11, 1933 he signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High- Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. From 1939 to 1945, Ansch√ºtz was the leader of the teaching staff at Hamburg University and Gaudozentenbundf√ºhrer of Hamburg. In this capacity he was responsible for the political scrutiny of his colleagues and influenced the appointment of professorships. In 1942, he finally received an associate professorship for psychology and at the same time took over the management of the Psychological Institute, which had until then been provisionally headed by the National Socialist . In 1944 Ansch√ºtz was awarded the War Merit Cross I. Class/ = Post-war period = Due to his exposed position as a lecturer leader, Ansch√ºtz was temporarily interned after the war and permanently dismissed from university service. At the end of the 1940s, he founded a \\"Free Research Center for Psychology and Frontier Areas of Knowledge\\" in which he worked with laymen and other dismissed Nazi scientists and which dealt, among other things, with phenomena of occultism. In addition, Ansch√ºtz also supervised dissertations in the Soviet occupation zone.Harry Waibel: Servants of many masters : Former NS functionaries in the SBZ/GDR. Lang, Frankfurt am Main 2011, , . Shortly before his death he published under the title Psychology a comprehensive overall presentation of the subject, which was honoured by colleagues as a \\"life's work\\". Especially his Abriss der Musik√§sthetik from 1930 was received and repeatedly published until the 1970s. Ansch√ºtz died in hambourg at the age of 67.  Literature  * Anton F. Guhl: Ansch√ºtz, Georg.
