In April 2013, the Disney Channel announced a new version of Win, Lose or Draw, to be hosted by Justin Willman. As with Teen Win, Lose or Draw, the two teams on each program are made up of two young contestants plus a teenage celebrity (this time, from a Disney Channel or Disney XD program). New motion-control technology is featured. Jennifer Convy, daughter of original series co-creator Bert Convy, serves as the executive producer. Since the season finale aired on May 21, 2014, no news sources have indicated that Win, Lose or Draw was renewed for a second season. Challenges The 2014 version featured the following rounds (all 90 seconds): Get a Clue: For each word, two team members work on a drawing while the third guesses. The host announces a clue, leading to the answer, with additional clues provided and the two artists alternate working on a drawing every 10 seconds. Each right answer is worth 10 points, with team members alternating after each word is either guessed or passed. Draw-Obstacle Course: The clue givers endure a variety of challenges while drawing, such as using an over-sized stylus, drawing on a spinning touch-screen board, the current drawing disappearing if the clue giver lifts his/her finger, or drawing while standing on a vibrating stool. The challenges rotate from episode to episode, and three are presented per round. As before, right answers are worth 10 points. Fill in the Blank: Adapted from the original final round, Willman reads a pun-styled clue with a blank, with the clue-giver drawing the word that filled in the blank. As in all previous versions, the team that was trailing goes first (or the team that went first in round one going first if the score was tied), and clues are worth 20 points, with as many clues played as possible within the time limit. Prize Round: The winning contestants paired up with both of the day's guest stars to win up to four prizes. Four words or phrases were played, each right guess earning a prize which the contestants picked out from four boxes on stage. Three different bonus round games were played: *The Wand: Most frequently played, each artist faces away from the video wall and drew a picture in the air, using a hand-held wand, which is transmitted to the video wall for their teammates to guess. If an artist turns around to look at the wall, they are disqualified. *Follow Your Art: Similar to the \\"Get a Clue\\" round, the artist starts drawing on one screen and every five seconds the drawing will \\"swoop\\" to one of the other two screens. *Sit & Spin: The artist sits in a rotating chair and try to draw the word/phrase while the chair rotates, without standing up. Episodes Broadcast The series originally aired as a preview on January 17, 2014, and officially premiered on March 3, 2014, on Disney Channel. Family Channel premiered it on April 7, 2014, and Disney Channel (UK and Ireland) premiered on May 5, 2014. Eventually it premiered on May 30, 2014, on Disney Channel (Asia) and on June 2, 2014, on Disney Channel (Australia and New Zealand). In late June 2014, the series premiered on Disney Channel (Europe, Middle East and Africa).

The film had its world premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2014, and won the Special Jury Prize at the 2014 Locarno International Film Festival. Plot Philip (Jason Schwartzman) is an acclaimed but abrasive young writer waiting for the publication of his second novel. He feels bored of his daily life and his shaky relationship with photographer girlfriend Ashley (Elisabeth Moss). In all of this chaos, his idol, veteran novelist Ike Zimmerman (Jonathan Pryce), offers him accommodation at his summer home, an isolated place where he might find peace. Cast * Jason Schwartzman as Philip Lewis Friedman * Elisabeth Moss as Ashley Kane * Krysten Ritter as Melanie Zimmerman * Joséphine de La Baume as Yvette * Jonathan Pryce as Ike Zimmerman * Eric Bogosian as Narrator * Jess Weixler as Holly * Flo Ankah as Brandy * Brandy Burre as Flo * Daniel London as Seth * Dree Hemingway as Emily * Kate Lyn Sheil as Nancy Reception Listen Up Philip received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film 85% based on 122 critics, with an average rating of 7.58/10 and an audience rating of 55%. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"As thought provoking as it is uncompromising, Listen Up Philip finds writer-director Alex Ross Perry taking a creative step forward while hearkening back to classic neurotic comedies of (19)70s cinema\\". On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, it has an average score of 76 from 34 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Scott Foundas of Variety, in his review said that \\"Jason Schwartzman shines as a self-absorbed writer who doesn't quite learn the error of his ways in Alex Ross Perry's sharp and darkly funny third feature.\\" Todd McCarthy in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film by saying that \\"[An] indisputably talented work for its risk-taking, dark humor and barbed portraiture of creative individuals.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker, praised the film by saying that \\"I can't think of a recent movie that stages with as much joy and wonder the sense of living a life that becomes, directly or obliquely, in action or in idea, the stuff of art.\\" Sam Fragoso in his review for RogerEbert.com said that \\"Alex Ross Perry's third feature film is his most narratively satisfying and intellectually demanding one, demonstrating a maturation in both style and substance.\\" Rodrigo Perez of Indiewire, graded the film A- and said that \\"A deeply misanthropic portrait of narcissism, the brittle nature of artistic talent and the struggles of living in New York City, this toxic comedy pulls very few punches when it needs to get really nasty.\\" The A.V. Clubs Ignatiy Vishnevetsky called it \\"a howlingly funny black comedy with really sharp teeth\\", going on to say: \\"Writing pithy wisecracks is easy. What Perry does is write banter that reveals his character’s insecurities and weaknesses; [...] There's a level of criticism at play in the film, which immediately sets it apart from similarly set New York art-world horror stories, but it doesn’t cancel out the writer-director’s clear empathy for his characters, who never quite manage to empathize with each other. This sort of mature perspective is a rare thing, and Listen Up Philip establishes Perry as a major talent.\\" References External links  * Category:2014 films Category:2014 comedy-drama films Category:2014 independent films Category:American comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Alex Ross Perry Category:Films scored by Keegan DeWitt Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Greek comedy-drama films Category:Greek films Category:Films with screenplays by Alex Ross Perry ","title":"Listen Up Philip"},{"id":"42816461","title":"SAT Subject Tests"},{"id":"42816464","text":"Macrobathra micropis is a moth in the family Cosmopterigidae.

She is a Hammond organ virtuoso whose musical career began in the United States in the 1960s and continues in France where she has lived since 1994. She has recorded four solo albums. Biography =Beginning= Judy Blair was born in East Texas to a family of Scottish Irish and Native American origins. She learned to play piano by ear at a very early age and was already playing piano at the Baptist Church alongside her cousin by the time she was 6 years old. At the age of 8 or 9, she began lessons with Mrs Louise Powell (who also played by ear and helped her to develop this ability as well as teaching her to read music). When she was 11, she joined her first band, a group of young (13 years old) local jazz musicians, and together they won first prize at \\" The Battle of the Bands \\", a competition held in Shreveport, Louisiana. Judy Blair began playing organ after becoming completely passionate after playing her cousin's Hammond. At that time, she was mostly listening to Blues and Rhythm & Blues artists (Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye to name a few) while hearing a lot of jazz at home because her father loved Louis Armstrong and jazz from the 1940s. She began playing in nightclubs at the age of 16 (her parents chaperoned) and worked with a band, \\"Larry Stanley and The One Eyed Jacks\\". = American period = At the age of 17, Judy began doing some recording sessions at Robin Hood Brian's recording studio in Tyler, Texas, playing the Hammond B3. There she recorded a single called \\"Old Laces\\" with the group The Glory Rhodes. Paul Varisco, a musician who had come to Brian's studio and attended this session, offered her a job in his band called Paul Varisco & The Milestones, a 9 piece R&B; band from New Orleans including the late drummer \\"Big\\" Johnny Thomassie. She left Texas in 1967 at age of 18 to join them. In 1969, Judy and Johnny left the Milestones to join another R&B; \\"pop\\" recording group called \\"Eternity's Children\\", who had a record on the charts named \\"Mrs. Bluebird\\". This band had several \\"incarnations\\" and Judy replaced Mike MacClain who was called up to do his military service. She stayed with the group 9 months before returning to Texas with Dino Vera, a drummer who she met in New Orleans during this time. They formed a band together called \\"Love Era\\" which toured Texas, California, New Mexico and Colorado with different formations (mostly 4 piece groups where Judy was played Hammond B3) from 1970 to 1984. Judy Blair went to the Caribbean (St. Martin / St. Maarten) in 1986 where she stayed a couple of years working with a band called \\"Tropix\\". She then returned to the States where she continued to make her living playing jazz, blues and R&B; 6 nights a week in clubs. Her influences were Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff, Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes, Oscar Peterson without forgetting Ray Charles. She lived in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Carmel, California, Santa Fe, New Mexico among other places, living the life of a nomad, as it was easy at that time to have a \\"sit down\\" music gig and stay in a place for a month or two or longer. = French period = In 1994, Judy Blair moved to Southwest France, settling in the Quercy region near the city of Cahors in the Lot. As she was spending more time focusing on writing and composing music, she recorded and published 4 albums which all include some of her original material. *In 1997, she recorded and produced an album in France called Les Couleurs du Noir et Blanc on which she plays solo piano and sings ballads and American Standards. *In 1999, she recorded The Other Place in Dallas (Texas) in collaboration with her brother, Donny Blair (guitarist), Bruce Tate (bass) and Dino Vera (drums). Judy plays piano and Hammond B3 organ. This album also contains original compositions by Donny Blair. *In 2000, she recorded Close Encounter in collaboration with Alvin Queen (drums) in New-York on which she sings and plays Hammond B3 and piano. This album also includes her brother Donny Blair (guitar), Houston Person (tenor saxophone), and Reggie Johnson (bass). *In 2005, Judy returned to Dallas, Texas to record her 4th album, Sunshine on which she sings and plays piano and Hammond B3 along with her brother Donny Blair (guitar), Abdu Salim (tenor saxophone), Christian \\" Ton Ton \\" Salut (drums) and guest artist Lucky Peterson (vocals, piano, Hammond B3 on 2 of the songs). All the songs on this album were written by Judy and one was co-written by Lucky Peterson. Blair performs at numerous concerts as a solo artist as well as with different musical formations, especially in France (3 times at Jazz in Marciac in 1995, 1998 and 2006, twice at Cahors Blues Festival in 1996 and 2009, in Aiguillon, Montauban, Mirepoix, Le Touquet, Villeneuve-sur-Lot Jazz & Blues Festival, Rion International Piano Festival, Monsegur 24 Hour Swing, Enghien les Bains, Toulouse, Souillac, Vaison la Romaine) as well as in other countries. In Spain at the Autumn Jazz Festival in Castilla with Alvin Queen (drums) and Reggie Johnson (bass), also in Leon, Valladolid, Reus, Palencia. In Tunisia at Tabarka Jazz Festival in 2006 (with Abdu Salim on sax and Christian Salut on drums). In Sicily in 2007 (Catania and Syracuse) with Sarah Morrow (trombone) and Julie Saurey (drums). She was in a travel film for Japanese TV with Dino Vera (drums). Blair helps organize charity concerts near and dear to her heart such as : SOS Katrina in 2005 in Cahors and SOS Haïti in February 2010 where she invited her friend Gary Brooker, singer, keyboard player and founder / leader of the famous group Procol Harum. She was invited by Gary to play in Woking, England alongside himself, Eric Clapton & band which included Andy Fairweather Low and Dave Bronze in 2009 & 2011 (New Year's Eve). Blair and Brooker played two concerts, August 2010 and 2011 at Abbaye Nouvelle in S.W. France (Lot). She played two evenings of Blues & Rock as a member of the band \\"Gary Brooker and Friends\\" Gary (vocals, keyboard), Andy Fairweather Low (guitar and vocals), Dave Bronze (bass) and Paul Beavis (drums) at Le Vigan in August 2013. She played in duo (vocals, piano) with the late Serge Oustiakine (bass) at Albas Jazz in the Lot earlier in 2013 (June). On Valentine's Day (February 14, 2014) she played a solo concert in Lherm (in the Lot). On May 7, 2014, she teamed up with François Bréant (composer, keyboard player, vocalist & producer) to play for charity again for the Rotary Club of Cahors. This concert was dedicated to music from the sixties and all benefits went to medical research for children's kidney disease. Personal life She is the sister of jazz guitarist Donny Blair.

Theodor Baierl (8 November 1881, Munich – 1932, Munich) was a German painter and fresco artist.  Life and work  He came from a humble background, but was able to attend the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he studied with Martin von Feuerstein, Carl von Marr, Hugo von Habermann and Franz von Stuck.Biography and paintings @ ArtMagick He became a member of the Munich Secession.Theodor Baierl @ Bildergeschichte However, he was also fond of art from the Middle Ages and the Quattrocento, both of which heavily influenced his style and thematic content. Several paintings, such as \\"Ritter mit Tod\\" (Knight with Death), are obvious homages to Albrecht Dürer. His mastery of the old techniques led to his popularity as a church painter and many of the frescoes he executed throughout Bavaria are often mistaken for older pieces. Some of his most prominent works include: the apse of St. Maximilian Church (Munich), the Stations of the Cross in the Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Augsburg), the apse in St. Johanniskirche (Schweinfurt) and the altarpiece at the Fugger Chapel at Kirchheim in Schwaben. He also designed glass paintings. During the First World War, his church-related commissions disappeared and were never fully restored. As a result, he changed his approach, devoting himself to easel paintings of an allegorical or historical nature, eventually modernizing his style; although he never reattained his earlier level of popularity and died in obscurity.

He undertook pioneering work in the field of operating systems and programming software and is the father of the GEORGE Operating System. He held the world record for the computation of π.  Early life, education, and military service  George Felton was born in Paris in 1921 to English parents - his mother, Muriel Felton, worked at Bletchley Park during the war.Bletchley Park Roll of Honour He was brought up in Paris and Menton but moved to England following the early death of his father. Felton attended Bedford School and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he read the Mathematical Tripos. His university studies were interrupted by World War II during which Felton joined the RAF with a commission. Exploiting his interest in electronics he served as a Radar engineer and instructor. He was demobilised and returned to Cambridge in 1946. At Cambridge he met his wife Ruth Felton at meetings of The Round Country Dance society. After commencing research in theoretical physics he switched his attention to Numerical Analysis and Programming, spurred on by his close contact with the construction of the EDSAC prototype computer in the Mathematical Laboratory, under Maurice Wilkes.  Career  In 1951 Felton joined Elliott Brothers in Borehamwood where he designed the programming systems and wrote software for the Nicholas and Elliott 402 computers. From mid-1954 at Ferranti's London Computer Centre Felton led the team developing innovative and comprehensive operating system and programming software for the Ferranti Pegasus and Orion computers. Hugh McGregor Ross records that \\"George Felton tells how, when Pegasus was new, he would borrow a front door key on Friday evenings so he could get in during the weekends. Then, alone in the building, he would start up the computer to sum a series to calculate the value of π to a then record 10,024 decimal places. This was a good test of the reliability of Pegasus\\". His computations of π were records in their day 1957. The team at Ferranti included Simon Lavington, The Pegasus Story: A history of a vintage British computer, Science Museum, 2000. Bill Elliott, Conway Berners-Lee, Christopher Strachey, Charles Owen, Hugh Devonald, Henry Goodman and Derek Milledge. The business computing division of Ferranti was merged with International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1963, and ICT was in turn merged with English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) computers in 1968 to form International Computers Limited (ICL). Following the mergers Felton ran the division responsible for the operating system and basic software for the 1900 Series. The new system was named George, was based on ideas from the Orion and the spooling system of the Atlas computer.  Personal life  Felton was also a notable photographer. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society and had regular acceptances in its International Print Exhibition. Examples of his work can be found online at the London Salon of Photography and at Arena Photographers. He married Ruth A. R. Holt in Cambridge, 1951, and they had 4 sons. One of their sons, Matthew Felton, moved to the United States and became one of the designers of the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. Another son, Eric Felton, worked at ICL on CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools.Biography of Eric Felton in ICL Technical Journal, May 1992, page 38, available online at https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/Images/ICL-Technical- Journal-v08i01.pdf Felton died in June 2019 at the age of 98.Martin Campbell- Kelly \\"George Felton obituary\\", The Guardian  Titles, honours, and awards  * Fellow of the British Computer Society. * Fujitsu Gold Medal for Computing * Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society.

History The Helena Elisabeth Church was originally built in 1802 on the largest island of the Holmöarna group near Umea. This was the first church in the area, and it was required because the population could not travel to the mainland to worship. The church was named for Helena Elisabeth Grahn from Umeå who contributed the cost of the communion silver. Oscar Hultgren of Stockholm was commissioned to paint here. The church was decorated in a simple fashion, and did not have any heating until 1970.Helena Elisabeth Kyrkan, Vasterbotten Museum, retrieved 20 May 2014 The church building served as the local church until 1891 when a larger church was built. Until 1955 this church was used for various secular purposes, including use as a sheep barn. The church building was sold to the local priest, Sigfrid Landin; in 1955 he sold the building to Västerbottens museum who had the building rebuilt at the external Gammlia museum.

Since 1843, the original has been kept in the British Museum.British Museum Collection Discovery In 1830s an inscribed gold tablet was unearthed at the ancient Greek site of Petelia near Strongoli in Calabria. Little is known of the circumstances of the find and its subsequent provenance before it was acquired by the British Museum from the archaeologist and collector James Millingen in 1843. Description The small gold tablet is inscribed in ancient Greek with an Orphic saying and dates from between 300-200 BC. The gold case and chain designed to hold it is much later in manufacture, having been made over 400 years later during the Roman times. The ancient Thracian prophet Orpheus, who was often represented as a musician or poet, founded a cult that promised a happy afterlife to the initiated. Many of his temples or shrines were considered oracles by his devotees. The Petelia Gold Tablet probably came from one of his shrines in southern Italy and demonstrates the widespread distribution of Οrphism in antiquity.

The film had its world premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2014. Gravitas Ventures acquired the distribution rights of the film; they released the film theatrically and by video on demand on June 6, 2014. Millennium Entertainment handled the home release of the film.  Plot summary  In 1985, 13-year-old Rad Miracle goes on a summer vacation to Ocean City, Maryland, with his family. Experiencing lots of things for the first time, he finds a mentor for his obsession with ping pong. Production = Development = Director Michael Tully has said that the movie was inspired by growing up with 1980s Hollywood films, ping pong and sunny summer times in Ocean City, Maryland. With Ping Pong Summer he also wanted to pay tribute to those comedy filmmakers from the 1980s that took their time to craft heart-felt stories. Tully focused on breaking the \\"connect-the-dot\\" contemporary comedy by infusing personal experience and genuine characters. Tully grew up in Maryland, and he and his family vacationed at the resort where he shot the movie when he was an adolescent. George Rush and Tully collaborated on the sale of Tully's last film, Septien. Rush had worked primarily as an entertainment lawyer, but took on the role of producer for Ping Pong Summer. Tully had been polishing the script since 1992 and was eager to make a movie so reminiscent of his childhood. The duo had a clear vision for the look and feel of the movie. They wanted to make a movie that truly captured the 1980s culture and felt like it was an old reel someone had found in a vault. Wyatt Garfield was instrumental in designing a specific look in the cinematography. Also, by casting generational icons like Susan Sarandon and Lea Thompson, they were able to pay homage to time periods that parents in the audience would be familiar with.Grady, Pam. \\"'Ping Pong Summer' Producer George Rush Partial to Indies.\\" . SFGate, 23 Apr. 2014. Web. 30 May 2014. In the opening shots of the film, viewers see a boom box, Nike shoes, and a Run-D.M.C. tape, which, as NPR wrote, are \\"cultural markers that would clearly peg the film to a particular decade even without a subtitle further specifying the year: 1985.\\" = Pre-production = The production opened up in Ocean City, Maryland. According to Tully the town was excellent at preserving the nostalgic feel of summer vacations. The local authorities and citizens were very cooperative with the filmmakers. To further capture the style of the movie, the entire picture was shot on Super 16 film stock. Tully felt very passionate about this choice and it was approved by Rush and the other producers. The film was shot in Ocean City Maryland, marking the first time since 1986 (Violets Are Blue) that a movie was filmed in Ocean City. = Cast = { style=\\"float:center;border:1px light gray;border- collapse:collapse;background:#fafafa;font-size:70%;\\" cellpadding=10px width=70% +Main cast and characters for Ping Pong Summer -style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Actor  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Susan Sarandon  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  John Hannah  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Lea Thompson  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Amy Sedaris  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Judah Friedlander  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Robert Longstreet  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Marcello Conte  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Maddie Howard -style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Image  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  center  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  center  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  center  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  center  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  center  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  -style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  Character  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Randi Jammer\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Mr. Miracle\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Mrs. Miracle\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Aunt Peggy\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Anthony\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Uncle Jim\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Rad Miracle\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid gray;\\"  \\"Rhonda\\" }  Awards  Ping Pong Summer played at the 2014 Sarasota Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature Film. Reception Ping Pong Summer received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 55% of 29 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. Justin Lowe in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, saying that \\"Rose-tinted as the film's perspective may be, Ping Pong Summer is still a lingering, entertaining glance back at an era that Americans just can't seem to get enough of, whether in music or movies.\\" Mark Adams of Screen International wrote that \\"Ping Pong Summer may well feel rather familiar, but there is a lot of good-natured and very accessible fun to be had about its tale of one 13-year-old's dream of glory on the table tennis table.\\" Chris Michael, in his review for The Guardian, said \\"It's gawky and awkward, but just like Rad's breakdancing worm, this one gets better as it goes along.\\" NPR was less positive, with reviewer Tomas Hachard calling the film \\"a sometimes intriguing experiment in upended expectations, though not a particularly successful one,\\" that was largely lacking \\"coherent purpose\\". Calum Marsh of Film.com criticized Ping Pong Summer as \\"a cool ninety minutes of vapid 80s fetishism packaged to resemble a proper feature film\\" that was \\"resoundingly pointless\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times focused criticism on the \\"limp hero\\" and \\"lifeless plot\\", arguing that the positive qualities of the film did not \\"excuse characters that are little more than props for embarrassing fashion or delivery systems for dated slang.\\" Ann Hornaday at The Washington Post argued that \\"its relatively uninvolving story, starchily directed by Tully and given little zing by an uneven cast, makes 'Ping Pong Summer'\\" an \\"okay-not-great\\" film.

Early life and education Born May 22, 1857 in St. Louis, Missouri, son of James McDonald and Margaret McCartney (Gordon) Gardiner. Educated at Hackensack Academy and Harvard University graduating with a degree in architecture in 1879. Mission work and architectural career in Japan Gardiner first came to Japan in 1880 and designed numerous school, church and private residential buildings while in the country. As a lay missionary in the Anglican Church in Japan his connection with Bishop Channing Moore Williams and the work of US Episcopal Church mission was close, leading in part to his appointment as one of the first Presidents of St. Paul's School, the founding institution of Rikkyo University. Holy Trinity Cathedral, Tsukiji completed in 1890Gardiner's first task on arrival in Japan was to design and supervise the construction of new school and dormitory facilities for St. Paul's School in Tsukiji, Tokyo. The three-story, red brick, school buildings in an American Victorian Gothic style were completed in 1881, but suffered significant damage in an earthquake in 1894. Gardiner was also responsible for the design of adjacent Holy Trinity Cathedral, completed in 1890, which served as the center of Episcopal Church mission activity in the city. Other than St. Agnes Cathedral (Kyoto), other buildings of note designed by Gardiner and still preserved in Japan include St. John's Church, Kyoto (1907), now in the historic building collection at Meiji-mura, and the former residence of Sadatsuchi Uchida, known as The Diplomat's House (1910), since 1995 a feature of the Italian Garden park in Yamate, Yokohama. Additionally, Ascension Church in Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, completed in 1921. Grave located at the True Light Church, Nikkō, Tochigi, Japan; an Anglican church of his own design.

It was designed and built by Edwin Lutyens in a Queen Anne style in 1911–12, as a weekend home and country retreat for members of the Farrer family. It was one of the first 20th-century building to be given a grade I listing, in 1950. Other structures in the grounds received a grade II listing in 1986. It has been described by Nigel Jones as \\"the perfect house that many in Britain aspire to own\\", and by Arthur Stanley George Butler as \\"Sir Edwin's supreme rendering of the full Georgian idiom … This very perfect work establishes itself as a high peak in Sir Edwin's achievement\\". In recent years, the house was operated as a bed and breakfast establishment, and since 2017 as a hotel and restaurant. House The house is at eastern end of Upper Strand Street in Sandwich, with the Quay beside the River Stour to the north and St Clement's church to the south. It is named after an inn that used to occupy part of the site. The plot of is surrounded by boundary walls of flint, stone and brick, including part of the Sandwich town wall, and the site includes several older grade II ancillary buildings. The main entrance leads east from Knightrider Street, through an arch formed by Lutyens through two-storey 18th century brick buildings, supported by a plaster cornice, to a forecourt in front of the west façade of the house. The main house is a rectangular red brick block with stone quoins, comprising two storeys, plus attic and semi-basement. The west front is symmetrical with seven bays, the central bay and two neighbouring narrow bays projecting slightly, topped by a tile hipped roof with three dormer windows and two tall brick chimney stacks. A single-storey wing to the north was originally servants' quarters, in a more vernacular Kentish style also with two tall brick chimneys. The east façade similarly has seven bays, with three French windows on the ground floor and a sundial in the central bay of the first floor, and four dormer windows in the roof. The south façade has five bays and three dormers. The interior, approximately excluding the attic, is based on a Palladian 3×3 grid, with an unusual cut-out in the north façade to allow light to reach the central stairs, creating a U-shape. Steps sweep up from the forecourt to double entrance doors in the west façade, with carved stone door case and broken pediment. The reception hall has two corkscrew columns, and leads to five principal rooms on the ground floor: one to either side of the hall – the wood-panelled library and another room – and three across the east front – a kitchen, oval dining room and drawing room. A passageway leads to the single-storey north wing, which includes the main kitchen. Stairs lead down to the cellar, and a wide central staircase provides access to the bedrooms on the first and second floors. Gardens Three sets of French windows from the dining room lead out of the east front to a garden terrace, with stone steps down to a rectangular garden to the east which has wide mixed borders containing herbaceous plants and shrubs. The garden was probably also originally designed by Lutyens, but inspired by his collaborations with Gertrude Jekyll (no record remains of her direct involvement). A further triangular area of the garden lies the south, with yew hedges and roses. The gardens also include a kitchen garden and tropical garden, an informal water garden to the north with \\"Lake Patricia\\" installed in the 1960s, extensive collections of dahlias and echinops, a jungle garden, and an avenue of holm oaks. The gardens took several years to recover from seawater flooding after Cyclone Xaver caused a tidal surge on the River Stour on 6 December 2013. History Henry Farrer, son of solicitor Sir William Farrer, commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens to design and built the house in 1911–12. It was occupied by Henry and his two brothers (all bachelors) William (also solicitor, like Henry and their father) and Gaspard Farrer (a partner at Barings Bank). Lutyens also build a town house for the brothers at 7 St James's Square, and renovated the premises of the law firm Farrer & Co in Lincoln's Inn Fields. After the death of Henry Farrer, the house was inherited by his brother Gaspard. Following Gaspard's death in 1948, it was bought by sculptor Leonard Harold Robert Byng. It was sold in 1977 and run as a plant nursery. Items on the house were published in Country Life in 13 and 20 September 1962, 10 September 1981 and 1 September 1983. After various proposals for redevelopment were rejected, the house remained in private ownership. It was sold for £2.6m in 2004 to Dominic and Stephanie Parker, who renovated the house and garden, and used it to run an up-market bed and breakfast establishment. They later became known from their appearances on Channel 4's television programme Gogglebox. The B&B; appeared in episode 19 of the fourth series of Channel 4's Four in a Bed in 2013. The house was put up for sale in April 2013 for £4.5m. The house was sold in December 2016 after the asking price was dropped to £3.5m. After a period of refurbishment, the building reopened as a hotel and restaurant in 2017.

It was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Clavaria militaris. Description =Macroscopic characteristics= The fungus forms 20–50 mm high, club-shaped and orange/red fruiting bodies, which grow out of dead underground pupae. The club is covered with the stroma, into which the actual fruit bodies, the perithecia, are inserted. The surface appears roughly punctured. The inner fungal tissue is whitish to pale orange. =Microscopic features= The spores are smooth, hyaline, long-filiform, and often septate. They decompose to maturity in 3-7 μm × 1-1.2 μm subpores. The asci are long and cylindrical. Sometimes an anamorphic state, which is Isaria, is found. Masses of white mycelia form around the parasitised insect; however, these may not be of the same species. Ecology and dispersal Cordyceps militaris is a entomopathogenic fungus, meaning it parasitizes insects. Many authors consider it quite common, spread throughout the northern hemisphere,Pilz des Jahres 2007: Cordyceps militaris (L.) Link, Puppenkernkeule and fruiting bodies appear in Europe from August to November. Cultivation and use A jar of dry C. militaris fruiting body. C. militaris can be cultivated in a variety of media including silkworm pupae, rice, or liquid nutrition. It is considered inedible in American sources, but in Asia the fruiting body is cooked as a mushroom in dishes like chicken soup. C. militaris is a potential harbour of bio-metabolites for herbal drugs and evidences are available about its applications for revitalization of various systems of the body from ancient times. In traditional Chinese medicine, this fungi can serve as a cheap substitute of Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Both contain cordycepin. C. militaris contains a protein CMP18 that induces apoptosis in vitro via a mitochondrion-dependent pathway. It is thought that it might be toxic when eaten. Cooking destroys this protein.

The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issuesSee for example, Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR [2007] HKEC 1356. and minority rightsSee for example, W v Registrar of Marriages [2013] HKCFA 39; Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration & Anor [2013] HKCFA 17. are among the most litigated areas. Origin of Public interest law in Hong Kong One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.Robertson, Geoffrey. \\"Pam Baker\\", \\"The Guardian\\", Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014. Later a small group of lawyers followed in her footsteps, safeguarding and strengthening human rights protection in the city. In 1995 the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong. Today, the majority of cause lawyers who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.Tam, Waikeung. \\"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong\\" 3 [2010] 35 Law & Social Inquiry 663, 664. They practise in different settings: some are members of large barristers’ chambers, while some practise in small law firms.Tam, Waikeung. \\"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong\\" 3 [2010] 35 Law & Social Inquiry 663, 668. Legal Aid Schemes In Hong Kong, the Legal Aid Department provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test. The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.Tam, Waikeung. \\"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong\\" 3 [2010] 35 Law & Social Inquiry 663, 673. However, NGOs and charities are ineligible to legal aid.Kong, Karen. \\"Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?\\" 39 HKLJ 767, 768. This has prompted cases in which these NGOs and charities invited persons who lacked particular interests in the litigation but qualified for legal aid to stand as the applicant. In his article, an academic has challenged decisions of the Hong Kong courts that allowed those lacking sufficient standing (locus standi) to be the applicants in public interest lawsuits involving either generalised or specific grievances.Yap, Po Jen. \\"Locus standi and public interest litigation in Hong Kong\\" in PJ Yap and H Lau (eds), Public Interest Litigation in Asia (MPG Book Groups 2011) Duty Lawyer Schemes Apart from legal aid, the Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance. They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test. However, eight out of nine Centres at the District Offices only operate once a week in the evening, with five consultation sessions lasting about 20–30 minutes each. Applicants generally wait eight weeks for a consultation. The Scheme does not offer any follow-up service or representation to the applicants, meaning they must seek further advice elsewhere after obtaining some general advice from the duty lawyers. Free legal services Apart from the above schemes, The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Schemehttp://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ and Free Legal Consultation Scheme respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.Chung, Eugenie. \\"Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse\\" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732. In the former scheme, each barrister volunteers up to three days or twenty hours per year in a case.http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free- legal-service/free-legal-service2.html While it is generally sufficient for most types of advisory work and representation in courts and tribunals for short cases or hearing, the barrister is unable to advise on a continuing basis over a long period or provide assistance in long or complex cases in courts. In the latter scheme, successful applicants are entitled up to 45 minutes of free initial consultation.http://www.choosehklawyer.org/tc/images/Choosehklawyer_form.pdf The areas provided by participant law firms are diverse, such as wills and probate, administrative law, banking and finance and intellectual property law. There are currently more than 100 participating law firms in Hong Kong. For obtaining free legal advice, people who require this service can get help from the Government departments such as the Home Affairs Department, but have to wait for months to obtain legal advice. However, there are some private practising lawyers in Hong Kong who are willing to provide free legal advice to the public. The advantage of it is that people who require legal advice can get help immediately, and hence their legal rights and interests can be protected without delay. Comparison with other jurisdictions Unlike some other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia, neither contingency nor conditional fee arrangement is allowed in Hong Kong under The Hong Kong Solicitors’ Guide to Professional Conduct,Rule 4.17 of The Hong Kong Solicitors’ Guide to Professional Conduct (Volume 1, Third Edition) the Code of Conduct of the Bar,Paragraph 124 of the Code of Conduct of the Bar and Legal Practitioners Ordinance.Section 64 of Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159). The Bar Association of Hong Kong maintains that the status quo is necessary as it reduces the likelihood of lawyers engaging in unprofessional conduct in order to ensure victory in litigation, or quickly settling a case even when the terms are not most favourable to their clients.\\"The Hong Kong Bar Association’s Position Paper on Conditional Fees: A Response to the Law Reform Commission’s Consultation Paper\\" (28 April 2006) para 21. The former Director of Public Prosecutions (now a judge of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance), Kevin Zervos, also commented that Hong Kong should not blindly follow the other jurisdictions without considering whether lifting the prohibition suits Hong Kong’s local conditions and circumstances.\\"Why 'no win, no fee' is no go for Hong Kong lawyers\\", \\"South China Morning Post\\" (4 April 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014. On the other hand, it is believed that one disadvantage of banning contingency fees is that economically disadvantaged litigants are discouraged from pursuing otherwise meritorious claims because in case they lose they are still required to finance their litigation.Chung, Eugenie. \\"Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse\\" 40 [2010 HKLJ 719, 727. They must be careful in weighing their chances of success against their resources before bringing a public interest lawsuit to court. For example, in a typical judicial review application, even if a public interest party succeeds, it is still required to bear around one-third of their legal costsKong, Karen. \\"Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?\\" 39 HKLJ 767, 776. on a party to party basis, which is the normal costs order under such circumstances. Therefore, it has been argued that the wider usage and recognition of a Protective Costs Order (PCO) will fill the gap in legal aid. Under a PCO, either the losing party is not liable for the opponent’s legal costs or its liability is capped at a certain amount.Kong, Karen. \\"Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?\\" 39 HKLJ 767, 775. Hong Kong Courts’ jurisdiction to grant PCOs was recognised in Chan Wai Yip Albert v Secretary for Justiceunreported, HCAL 36/2005 but scholars caution that the development must be cautious lest it be open to abuse.Kong, Karen. \\"Funding public interest litigation in Hong Kong\\", LexisNexis Hong Kong Legal Community (11 August 2009). Retrieved 4 April 2014. A consultation paper was published in 2005 by The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong Conditional Fees Sub-committee to evaluate the pros and cons of conditional fees arrangement but it was rejected by the Law Reform Commission in 2007 primarily due to the lack of support from the insurance industry.Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong, Report on Conditional Fees (Hong Kong: Printing Department, Jul 2007), para 7.30; Chung, Eugenie. \\"Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse\\" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 728. In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.Precht, Robert. [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1310978/more-public- interest-lawyers-can-help-ease-hong-kongs-social \\"More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions\\", \\"South China Morning Post\\" (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014. Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong. Public interest law education in Hong Kong Law schools in Hong Kong also organise various programmes to promote the idea of pro bono legal service to students.http://www.ke.hku.hk/eng/highlights/2010/legal In January 2009, the University of Hong Kong (“HKU”) launched its first clinical education scheme in conjunction with the Hong Kong Refugee Advice Centre (“HKRAC”), which has been renamed Justice Centre Hong Kong in March 2014.http://visionfirstnow.org/2014/03/05/hkrac-changes-name-to-justice- centre-hong-kong/ Students are given the opportunity to learn and practice domestic and international refugee law directly under the supervision of Justice Centre staff. The Chinese University of Hong Kong also runs a similar programme with the Justice Centre Hong Kong. In January 2010, HKU pioneered the Free Legal Advice Scheme on campus under the Duty Lawyer Scheme. Concurrently, it introduced the Clinical Legal Education Course (General Stream, as distinct from the Refugee Stream), where enrolled students are supervised by faculty members to attend interviews, conduct research and help prepare legal advice to the general public on areas other than refugee law. The Centre of Comparative and Public Law at HKU plays a pivotal role in promoting public interest law in Hong Kong. It was established in 1995 as a non-profit virtual research centre within the Faculty of Law at HKU. Over the years, it has organised a large number of conferences, seminars and rights talks in areas ranging from political reform to LGBT rights. It administers the Human Rights Portal, a compendium of information, and in January 2014 it hosted Hong Kong’s First Annual Public Interest Law Conference to encourage and support the growth of public interest law in the city. Pro bono services Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.Mayer Brown LLP, \\"Pro Bono Update\\" (Spring 2010), page 19. Initially chartered in 2008, the Roundtable comprises attorneys from more than 30 international law firms with operations in the city.Latham & Watkins LLP, \\"2011 Pro Bono Annual Review\\" (2011), page 9. These Roundtable meetings have included briefings by a number of local NGOs about their activities and legal needs.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates, \\"Asia Pacific Careers Guide\\" (2012), page 24.

Delegates from Spain and the Spanish Netherlands on the left, the English on the right. The Somerset House Conference, 1604, National Maritime Museum The Somerset House Conference, 1604 is an oil-on-canvas painting depicting the Somerset House Conference held in 1604 to negotiate the end the Anglo-Spanish War. It is a group portrait, depicting the 11 representatives of the governments of England, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, seated around a conference table, probably in Old Somerset House. Background Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, and her successor James I quickly sought to end the 18 years of conflict. Philip III of Spain had also inherited the war from his predecessor Philip II. Both new kings were happy to end the expensive and distracting conflict. The conference was held in 18 sessions between 20 May and 16 July 1604. The treaty was signed on 16 August, and restored the status quo ante bellum. Spain was compelled to recognise the Protestant monarchy in England, and England ended its financial and military support for the Dutch rebellion since the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585. Following the signing of the treaty, England and Spain remained at peace until 1625. James gave the Spanish delegates generous gifts, including the Royal Gold Cup which was given to the leader of the Spanish delegation, Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías. Painting The painting bears a signature of Spanish painter Juan Pantoja de la Cruz and is dated 1594, but both signature and date are thought to be false. The painter is unknown but may be Flemish, possibly John De Critz (the Elder). The room depicted is likely to be an interior in Old Somerset House (rebuilt from 1775). The work includes portraits of the 11 government representatives, each seated in an elaborate chair of estate to either side of a long rectangular table covered by a fine oriental carpet of the so-called Holbein carpet type, a common object of luxury to display in Jacobean portraiture. In front of Robert Cecil are a pewter ink-pot, a quill and a piece of paper. Leaded window behind the sitters reveals a courtyard with shrubs. The tapestries on the walls to either side bear the date 1560, and there are rushes on the floor. Depicted on the right side of the table are the five English delegates representing James I; in order of precedence, from the window: * Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (1536-1608), Poet and Lord Treasurer, who led the English delegation * Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham (1536-1624), Lord High Admiral and Lord Steward * Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire (1563-1606), Master-General of the Ordnance * Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton (1540-1614), Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports * Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, later 1st Earl of Salisbury (1563-1612), Secretary of State, James I's leading minister On the left is the delegation from Spain representing Philip III; in order from the window: * Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías, Constable of Castile, leader of the Austro/Flemish and Spanish delegation (although he was ill and did not attend the conference) * Juan de Tassis, 1st Count of Villamediana * Alessandro Robida, Senator of Milan And then the delegation from the Spanish Netherlands representing Albert VII, Archduke of Austria: * Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg * Jean Richardot, President of the Brussels Privy Council * Louis Verreyken, Audiencier of Brussels and Principal Secretary One version, thought to be the original, is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London, and a copy at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

She was married to Major-General Horatio P. Van Cleve. Born during her parents' journey to help build the future Fort Snelling, she lived to see a fledgling community grow into an urban center. Early life In 1819 the U.S. government looked to protect its fur trading interests in the northwest. To do this it ordered the 5th Infantry Regiment from its headquarters in Detroit to the junction of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers to build a fort. On July 1 the infantry stopped to rest at Fort Crawford in Prairie du Chien (present- day Wisconsin). A short time later a daughter was born to Lieutenant Nathan Clark and his wife, Charlotte Ann Seymour. Also named Charlotte, she came to be affectionately known as a \\"daughter of the fifth regiment\\" and was given the middle name Ouisconsin (a French spelling of Wisconsin) by its members in recognition of her birth site. The regiment continued north and arrived at the site of Fort St. Anthony (later renamed Fort Snelling) on August 23. Having a father in the army meant that Clark moved many times throughout her childhood. She spent the first sixteen years of her life traveling from fort to fort. During that time she developed an abiding love for the military. The patriotism and altruism she learned within its confines guided her decisions throughout her life. Clark observed many of the changes that marked the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region's growth from a rural outpost into an urban center. At Fort St. Anthony in May 1823, four-year-old Clark witnessed the arrival of the Virginia—the first steamboat ever seen that far north along the Mississippi. It carried supplies for the fort and its inhabitants. In 1862 she saw the area's first train pull its cars into the city of St. Anthony. In 1905, during the sunset of her life, Clark was driven to the fort by automobile. Adulthood Charlotte Clark met her future husband, Lieutenant Horatio P. Van Cleve, at Fort Winnebago in Wisconsin Territory in 1833. The two married on March 22, 1836, shortly before Charlotte's seventeenth birthday. Horatio left the military to begin a life with his wife. The couple moved between Ohio, Missouri, and Michigan over the next twenty years, but Charlotte longed for the open prairies of her childhood home. She and her family returned to Minnesota Territory in 1856, settling in Long Prairie to farm. After five years the American Civil War broke out and Horatio, then fifty-one years old, volunteered to join the fight. In July 1861 he was commissioned as colonel of the 2nd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. The Van Cleves left Long Prairie and moved to Fort Snelling, and later St. Anthony, where they would spend the rest of their lives. The strain of the war years aged Charlotte. Her hair prematurely grayed and her sight and hearing eventually failed. In spite of the challenges of her ailments, Charlotte remained devoted to causes that she believed in. She entered public life in 1876 as the first woman elected to the Minneapolis School Board, and used her prominence to champion women's causes. Charlotte fiercely supported the rights of so-called \\"fallen women.\\" In 1879 she helped incorporate Bethany Home and acted as its first president. The house helped women that society looked down on—generally prostitutes and unwed pregnant girls—to better their lives. Residents committed a year to the house and in turn were offered a safe place to stay and a chance to learn job skills like cooking and sewing. By 1884 Charlotte had become such a powerful voice for women's suffrage that she was named an honorary vice president of the National Woman Suffrage Association, despite having no formal involvement with the organization. Legacy The Horatio P. Van Cleve House in Minneapolis Horatio died in 1891 and Charlotte on April 1, 1907, just short of her eighty-eighth birthday. In February 1938 a group of senior high school girls formed the Charlotte Van Cleve Good Citizens Club in her honor. They carried on her legacy of good works, providing need- based scholarships to school children, donating to school libraries, and assisting in nursing homes. The Horatio P. Van Cleve House, where Charlotte and her husband lived beginning in 1862, still stands in the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 in part for her accomplishments.

Novarese also established the Marian Priest League and the Brothers and Sisters of the Sick; he built several homes for those who were ill and disabled. He served in the Secretariat of State until leaving that position to work alongside the Italian Episcopal Conference and to dedicate more time to the ill and to the work of his orders. Novarese was beatified in mid-2013; Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone beatified him on the behalf of Pope Francis in the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura. Life Luigi Novarese was born in 1914 as the last of nine children to the farmers Giusto Carlo Novarese and Teresa Sassone. His father died in 1915 from pneumonia. Due to illness one leg was shorter than the other (fifteen centimetres) and so he had to wear special orthopedic shoes his entire life in order to compensate for the difference in leg height. In 1923 he was diagnosed with bone tuberculosis and his mother exhausted all available funds for treatment despite doctors giving up all hope on him recovering; he sent a letter to Filippo Rinaldi - the third superior of the Salesians of Don Bosco - and asked that he and his students intercede for him. Rinaldi replied and said he and the students would ask for the intercession of John Bosco. He was able to leave the hospital on 17 May 1931 after having been cured of his ailment at a rapid pace. During his numerous visits in the hospital he decided that he would become a doctor if he was able to recover though decided instead to join the priesthood after his mother died in 1935. He studied at Casale Monferrato and then at the Capranica College in Rome. Novarese was ordained to the priesthood on 17 December 1938 in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. He received degrees in theological studies in 1939 (from the Gregorian) and in canon law on 9 April 1943. On 1 May 1942 he accepted an invitation from Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini - the future Pope Paul VI - to join his staff in the Secretariat of State and he remained there until 12 May 1970 when he decided to leave and take up a new post elsewhere. He founded the Marian Priest League on 17 May 1943; he later co- founded the Volunteers of Suffering in 1947 and later the Silent Workers of the Cross in 1950. Novarese also founded the Brothers and Sisters of the Sick in 1952. In 1949 he obtained permission from Pope Pius XII to launch an hour dedicated to the sick on the Vatican Radio. Pope John XXIII - in 1962 - placed him in charge of the chaplains of all Italian hospitals. In 1970 he left the Secretariat of State and was put in charge of the health sector of the Italian Episcopal Conference where he remained until 1977. He met Pope John Paul II on one occasion and the two embraced. Novarese died in 1984; his remains were interred in the Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio in Via Giulia in Rome. Beatification The beatification process launched in Frascati in a diocesan process that was inaugurated on 17 December 1998 and later concluded on 13 December 2003 - the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process in Rome on 26 November 2004. The official start to the cause came under John Paul II on 1 July 1994 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later received the Positio in 2008 and the theologians approved it on 19 December 2008 as did the C.C.S. members on 5 February 2010. Pope Benedict XVI confirmed that Novarese led a life of heroic virtue on 27 March 2010 and titled the late priest as Venerable. The process for a miracle spanned from 22 June 2007 and concluded its work on 8 January 2008; the C.C.S. validated this on 13 June 2008. Medical experts approved this miracle on 14 October 2010 as did theologians on 7 June 2011 and the C.C.S. on 15 November 2011. Benedict XVI approved the miracle on 19 December 2011 and Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone presided over the formal beatification in the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura on 11 May 2013 on the behalf of Pope Francis. The miracle in question was the 2002 healing of Graziella Paderno. The current postulator for this cause is the Dominican priest Vito Tomás Gómez García.

She operated in the Pacific Ocean from 1940 to 1960, seeing service there during World War II, and in the Atlantic Ocean from 1960 to 1968. Construction and commissioning The Seattle, Washington, firm of W. C. Nickum Sons developed a detailed design and unusual construction procedures for Explorer from United States Government designs. The largest ship constructed in the Pacific Northwest since 1924, she was built by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, as a Coast and Geodetic Survey \\"ocean survey ship\\" (OSS). Launched on 14 October 1939, she was delivered to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 9 March 1940. She was commissioned in the spring of 1940 as USC&GS; Explorer (OSS 28).NOAA History, A Science Odyssey: Tools of the Trade: Ships: Coast and Geodetic Survey Ships: ExplorerNOAA Photo Library: Coast and Geodetic Survey Ship EXPLORER OSS28Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1940, p. 121-122, at noaa.gov NOAA Central Library: U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer Commander A. M. Soberalski supervised her construction and became her first commanding officer. Technical characteristics Explorer was designed to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding in the event of a collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she was designed to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and cooking water, and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964 km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8 mph; 22.2 km/hr). To avoid electrical interference with her sensitive hydrographic surveying equipment, Explorer′s deck machinery and major auxiliary equipment all was driven by high-pressure steam. When commissioned, Explorer was considered to have the finest and most extensive hydrographic surveying equipment in the history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s fleet, all entirely electrically powered. The equipment included a fathometer, a Dorsey sonic depth finder, a Hughes automatic depth recorder system, a special taut-wire measuring gear with 120 nautical miles (138 statute miles; 222 km) of fine wire and several tons of iron balls, and hydrophones. Electrolysis eliminators mounted to her hull ensured that she would be grounded so as to avoid interference with her electrical surveying equipment. Explorer had two 1,500-U.S.-gallon (1,249- Imperial-gallon; 5,678-liter) tanks for gasoline and diesel oil for the fleet of 16 boats she operated, consisting of four 30-foot (9.1-meter) heavy launches powered by 30-hp (22.4-Kw) diesel engines and outfitted for hydrographic surveying, two additional launches carried on heavy davits, two 24-foot (7.3-meter) whaleboats powered by gasoline engines, two non-magnetic whaleboats, and six 16- and 20-foot (4.9- and 6.1-meter) skiffs and dories. She also had a 5-ton magazine for the storage of explosives used in radio acoustic ranging operations. When commissioned, Explorer was painted a brilliant white, with a brown deckhouse and red funnel and masts. Her paint scheme, raked masts and funnel, yacht-like stem, and cruiser stern gave her the appearance of a yacht or cruiser when her large fleet of boats were not stowed on deck. Service history USC&GS; Explorer (OSS 28) at anchor.Upon her commissioning, Explorer toured ports in California in April 1940. She entered service in time to take part in the 1940 field season, during which she was assigned to conduct hydrographic surveys in the Aleutian Islands westward from Umnak Island with the smaller vessel E. Lester Jones (ASV-79) assisting. After an assignment in the Strait of Juan de Fuca-San Juan Islands area of Washington during the winter of 1940-1941, she returned to the Aleutians for the 1941 field season to survey the waters westward from Yunaska Island.Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1941, p. 124, at noaa.gov NOAA Central Library: U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports After the conclusion of the 1941 season in the Aleutians, she began survey work around Midway Atoll, but was recalled from Midway after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of 7 December 1941 brought the United States into World War II. Steaming from Midway to Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, she rescued the crew of an aircraft which had ditched in the Pacific Ocean due to fuel exhaustion. She then returned to the Aleutians for the 1942 field season, extending triangulation work as far as the eastern end of Atka Island and hydrographic surveys as far as Seguam Island.Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1942, p. 71, at noaa.gov NOAA Central Library: U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports During the season, in June 1942, the Aleutians became a front-line combat area after Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft attacked Dutch Harbor and Imperial Japanese Army and Navy forces occupied Attu and Kiska, beginning the Aleutian Islands campaign. After the conclusion of Aleutians work in 1942, Explorer returned to survey operations around the San Juan Islands in Washington and performed wire-drag survey work around the Hein Bank with USC&GS; Patton, but during the 1943 season she resumed operations in combat areas in the Aleutians as U.S. and Canadian forces drove the Japanese out of the islands.Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1943, p. 7, at noaa.gov NOAA Central Library: U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports On one occasion during the fighting in the Aleutians in 1942-1943 she fought off an attacking Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft.

Postwar, she spent the 1946 field season in the Aleutians cooperating with the Coast and Geodetic Survey ships USC&GS; Surveyor and USC&GS; Derickson in extending an arc of triangulation from Kiska to Attu, completing an arc extending across the continental United States, Territory of Alaska, and Aleutians, and conducted triangulation, topographic, and hydrographic surveys in the coastal waters north and south of Attu and in other parts of the Near Islands.Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1946, p. 100, at noaa.gov NOAA Central Library: U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports In 1960, Explorer transferred to the United States East Coast, where she spent the remainder of her career, focusing mainly on oceanographic research. In 1963, she participated in the EQUALANT I and EQUALANT II subprojects of the International Cooperative Investigations of the Tropical Atlantic (ICITA) project, the first international cooperative oceanographic/meteorological project in which a United States Government scientific agency took part.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Sussex, New Brunswick. Her name was altered to prevent confusion with other Allied warships named Sussex. After the war she was converted to a and served until 1966. She was the last frigate launched by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. Sussexvale was ordered as Valdorian on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 15 November 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 12 July 1944. At some point during 1944, her name was changed to Sussexvale. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 November 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up at Bermuda in January 1945, Sussexvale was assigned to escort group EG 28. She joined the group in Derry in March and spent the rest of the war in Europe patrolling the waters around the United Kingdom. From 14 March to 20 April, EG 28 was among the escort groups deployed in the English Channel.Rohwer, p. 400 In May 1945, she returned to Canada to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water-cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. The refit was performed at Shelburne but was never finished, having been cancelled due to the surrender of Japan. She was paid off on 16 November 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and placed in reserve at Shelburne. =Postwar service= Sussexvale was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. after the war. However, with the increasing Soviet submarine threat, the Royal Canadian Navy sought to augment its anti-submarine forces. Sussexvale was reacquired and converted into a Prestonian-class frigate at Halifax. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. On 1 January 1955, Sussexvale was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. She emerged from her conversion and was recommissioned on 18 March 1955 with the new pennant number 313. The frigate sailed for the west coast on 17 April arriving at Esquimalt in May. Sussexvale served with the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron. She served as a training ship, having a deckhouse fitted midships to provide classrooms and mess facilities for officer cadets undergoing sea training. This deckhouse did not affect her combat capabilities. She remained in this role until being paid off 30 November 1966. In January 1960, Sussexvale and three other Prestonian-class ships made a tour of South American ports, visiting San Diego, Balboa, the Galapagos Islands, Callao and Valparaíso, Talara and Long Beach. Sussexvale was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. From January to March 1961, Sussexvale, and performed a training cruise to the South Pacific, visiting Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and Samoa. She was sold to Kennedy & Mitsui of Vancouver for breaking up in Japan in 1967. References =Notes= =Sources= * * Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Early life Lewis C. Dowdy was one of 14 children born to William Wallace Dowdy and Alice Shiver Dowdy, on September 1, 1917 in Eastover, South Carolina. Dowdy was educated in the public schools of Eastover, and later graduated cum laude from Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina. He married his wife Elizabeth Smith on June 26, 1943 in Terre Haute, Indiana, where she was a native. Dowdy would later earned a Master’s degree from Indiana State College in 1949, and a doctorate of education degree from Indiana University in 1965. Career In 1951, Dowdy began his career at the Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina in Greensboro, North Carolina as an instructor of education and director of student teaching; he would later go on to serve as an assistant professor of education, dean of the School of Education and General Studies, and dean of Instruction before ascending to the position as president of the college. Dowdy served as acting President of A&T; college from January, 1962 to September, 1963, while then President Samuel D. Proctor took a leave of absence to serve the country as Peace Corps director in Nigeria. Dowdy would then be inaugurated as the College’s sixth president on April 10, 1964, in the wake of Proctor's resignation. Under the Dowdy's leadership, the college experienced one of its greatest periods of growth, in academics, athletics, and capital improvements. During this time, A&T; reorganized, and created new, academic departments such as the Schools of Education, Business and Economics and the College of Arts and Sciences. The college also received national accreditation for its College of engineering, and schools of nursing, business; and for its programs in teacher education, industrial technology, chemistry, and social work. The Dowdy administration also brought significant growth in research funding, grants, and financial support from the private sector. Under Dowdy’s urging, A&T; developed the university relations office which gained more than $8 million in external support from corporations, foundations and the school's national alumni association. In addition, A&T; attracted $19.9 million in federal support for research by faculty and students that related to issues faced by the state, nation and world. As a result, the college became the third ranked educational research center in the state. During this period, many capital improvements including a new student dining center, student union, five major classroom buildings; Corbett Sports Center, a health, physical education and recreation complex, in addition to the construction of Aggie Stadium. In 1972, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation bringing all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor degrees into the University of North Carolina System. As a result of the consolidation, NC A&T; became a constituent institution and president Dowdy was reappointed as the college's first chancellor. In that same year, Dowdy was elected President of the National Association of State Universities and Land-grant Colleges. As president, he conferred with three U.S. Presidents on matters affecting higher education and he testified before numerous congressional committees. On October 31, 1980, Dr. Dowdy resigned from his position as chancellor, effectively ending a 21-year career of serving North Carolina A&T.; Death and legacy Dowdy died on December 17, 2000 at the age of 83. He left behind a legacy of accomplishments including honorary degrees from Allen University, Indiana State University, University of Maine-Orono, Indiana University and Duke University: special commendations from Indiana State University, The Danforth Foundation and the Chamber of Commerce of Greensboro, North Carolina. In addition, Dowdy was a deacon at Providence Baptist Church in Greensboro for many years, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Beta Epsilon boule of the Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, and the Greensboro Men’s Club and Neighbors United. The university's administrative building was named for him on May 1, 1981 and the Lewis and Elizabeth Dowdy endowed scholarship bears the name of him and his wife.

The band's previous album, ...Imagine a Music, was released in 1986 when they were known as In Flight. Background After In Flight disbanded in 1990, Lee Kohler reformed the group with his brother Rob and their friend drummer Michael Blessing in 1995. There was much interest in the group's work left over from their days as In Flight, and so funding was easily obtained for recording an album. Many of the compositions were previously unperformed songs from In Flight. The group's composition process will generally start with one member bringing in an idea and the rest building off that idea until an entire song has been composed. Subsequently, each member composed their own parts for their instruments. \\"Harvest Circle,\\" composed by the band's bassist Rob Kohler, features Bobcat singers Frank Caplette, Shane Doyle, and Crit Held. This fusion between electric Jazz and traditional Native American music is Rob Kohler's trademark sound. This sound is clear on Kohler's album A Thousand Faces, released in 1998. Recording The album was recorded at The Garage in Reese Creek, Montana. The studio had been built and was run by Michael Blessing, the band's drummer. Grammy-winning producer Cookie Marenco was flown in from Los Angeles to produce and engineer the album. Marenco, now the owner and founder of Blue Coast Records, has worked with many legendary musicians, including Max Roach, Paul McCandless, Brad Mehldau, Charlie Haden, and many others.

Service Chieftain was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Squadron based at Malta and served with the Royal Navy's 1945-8 Palestine Patrol, intercepting illegal immigration into Mandate Palestine. In 1947 Chieftain intercepted three immigrant ships: a schooner, a former USCG cutter, and a former USN vessel. The ex-cutter Unalga renamed Chaim Arlosoroff got past the RN destroyer and managed to beach near Haifa: the other two were detained at sea.Palestine Patrol by the Royal Navy, article in Shipping - Today & Yesterday No. 203 January 2007 p.42, photograph p.38 She was given an interim modernization in 1954, which saw her 'X' turret at the rear of the ship replaced by two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She saw duty during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Decommissioning and disposal Chieftain was decommissioned after the Suez Crisis and was scrapped in Sunderland on 20 March 1961.

Early life Hoppin was born on April 17, 1856 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was a son of Dr. Washington Hoppin (1824–1867), a homeopathic physician, and Louise Claire (née Vinton) Hoppin (1832–1891). Among his siblings were Francis L. V. Hoppin, Louise Claire Hoppin (a founder of the Red Cross), Harriet (née Hoppin) Jacob, and Washington Hoppin, Jr. Hoppin was from a prominent and talented Providence family; his paternal grandparents were Thomas Coles Hoppin and Harriet Dunn (née Jones) Hoppin. His maternal grandparents were Maj. John Rogers Vinton (who was killed during the Siege of Veracruz and became the namesake of Fort Vinton) and Lucretia Dutton (née Parker) Vinton of Boston. Among his paternal uncles were Augustus Hoppin, a prominent illustrator (who wrote about the family in his novel, Recollections of Auton House), and Dr. Courtland Hoppin, also a homeopathic physician, was the grandfather of Courtland Hector Hoppin, a pioneer in the field of animated film. His maternal uncle, David Hammond Vinton, Quartermaster General of Florida (who married Pamela, a daughter of Maj. Gen. Jacob Brown), was the father of The Right Reverend Alexander Hamilton Vinton, the first Bishop of Western Massachusetts, and Harriette Arnold Vinton (wife of Dr. John Clarkson Jay, son of Dr. John Clarkson Jay). Career Fruit Hill, 1879. Providence, 1905. Central High School, Providence, RI, 1921 Hoppin began his architectural practice in Providence in the late 1870s. Early on, he developed a specialty in small churches. He worked alone until 1890, when he was joined by Spencer P. Read and his brother, Francis L. V. Hoppin. The new firm was known as Hoppin, Read & Hoppin.\\"Hoppin, Read & Hoppin, Architects\\". Industries and Wealth of the Principal Points in Rhode Island. 1892. They worked together until 1896, when Francis left to found the firm of Hoppin & Koen in New York City. It was at this time that Hoppin took Edward F. Ely (1858-1920) into the firm, as Hoppin & Ely. In 1907, Ely left to become a member of the city's Board of Park Commissioners.Resolutions and Ordinances of the City Council of the City of Providence. 1920. At this point, Frederick E. Field became partner. This arrangement lasted until 1922, when Thomas J. Hill Peirce, joined, the firm becoming Hoppin, Field & Peirce.

He claimed to be a son of Ștefan IX Tomșa, and as such a Moldavian, but was generally identified as a Greek of lowly origins, and reportedly an oyster-monger. He was imposed on the throne by the Ottoman Empire, one of a line of Princes who were primarily subservient to Ottoman power. In his first year, he also supported the political ascendancy of Greeks and Levantines, many of whom made their way into Wallachia's traditional aristocracy, or boyardom. This upset the local boyars, who were further alienated and impoverished by Leon's fiscal policies, which in turn reflected Ottoman demands for tribute. The regime was threatened by an Oltenia-centered rebellion, initially led by Ban Aslan, and later by Matei Basarab. Though often depicted as an anti-Greek movement, it had Greeks and Romanians fighting on either side. In its second phase, Leon's rule became more conciliatory, granting massive fiscal privileges to the administrative class, the clergy and, selectively, the serfs. The Prince also issued a ban on Greek immigration, though he was still lenient toward naturalized Greeks; he ended some of the privileges granted to Mount Athos, and made foreigners subject to taxation, while also reinforcing special rules against the social integration of Muslim converts. Such measures failed to convince the boyar rebels, who organized an invasion of Wallachia from over the border, in the Principality of Transylvania. They managed to occupy Oltenia and threatened Bucharest, but were routed by Leon in August 1631. Aslan abandoned the cause, while Matei continued with his plotting from Transylvania. In his final months, Leon, persuaded that he owed his triumph to Saint George, was a noted patron of religious art, building Slobozia Church and refurbishing Viforâta Monastery. His contribution also extended to lay themes, and he was one of the first Wallachians to sponsor Western-style portrait painting, employing the services of a master Benedetto. He was nevertheless deposed by Sultan Murad IV; his later life and date of death are unknown. In the 1660s, his presumed son Radu Leon ascended to the Wallachian throne, and initially also pursued the Hellenophile line. After an extended conflict with the Cantacuzino family, he was forced to reinstate Leon's ban, and, like Leon, was ultimately deposed. Leon's alleged grandson, Ștefan Radu Tomșa, was titular Hetman of Right-bank Ukraine, and a nominal heir to the Moldavian throne. Reign =Context= Little is known about the Prince's early life, beyond clues suggesting he was not a local. Visitor Paul Strassburg described him an Ottoman Greek.Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 48; Popescu-Băjenaru, p. 177; Theodorescu, p. 170 The 1660s chronicler and compiler Macarios Zaim sees him as entirely a \\"Greek foreigner\\" from Istanbul,Cândea, pp. 678, 691 while other authors believe that he was at least half-Greek, on his father's side.Rezachevici (1978), p. 73 However, Leon viewed himself as the son of Ștefan IX Tomșa, who had served as Moldavian Prince in the 1610s and had died in exile in Istanbul.Iorga (1899), p. 174 He therefore also regarded himself as brothers-in-law with the Moldavian boyar Pătrașco Boul, who had wed Ștefan's daughter, and whom he invited to Wallachia.Stoicescu, p. 353 Apparently, Leon also took with him one of Ștefan IX's Greek advisers, known locally as Alexandri,Păun, pp. 164, 188 though the identification remains uncertain.Stoicescu, p. 339 Leon's genealogical claim was already widely discredited in his lifetime, with various accounts showing that he had worked as an oyster-monger.Iorga (1899), p. 174; Rezachevici (1978), p. 73 In such sources, he is sometimes referred to as Leon Stridie (\\"Leon the Oyster\\"), Leon Stridiacul (\\"Leon of the Oyster\\"), or Pescarul (\\"Fisherman\\"). According to scholar Constantin Rezachevici, Leon's claim of princely descent was \\"formulaic\\", with a minimal effort to ensure legitimacy under the Wallachian canons.Rezachevici (1996), pp. 108–109 Nevertheless, a lity of Probota Monastery, compiled in 1781 and rediscovered in 2008, confirms at least that Ștefan and his wife Axanina had had a son of that name. The list also mentions Leon being married to a Lady Roxanda, and having a son, Bogdan, who was probably dead by 1630.Ștefan S. Gorovei, \\"Un nou izvor genealogic și prosopografic: pomelnicul Mănăstirii Probota\\", in Analele Putnei, Vol. X, Issue 2, 2014, pp. 287–290 Leon's life coincided with a decline of sovereignty in both Wallachia and Moldavia, which were already tributary states of the Ottoman Empire (see Early Modern Romania). In 1629, both countries were still struggling with the consequences of the Long Turkish War, when Michael the Brave and Radu Șerban successively attempted to restore Wallachian independence. As historian Ion-Radu Mircea notes, \\"a grave conflict opposing Wallachia to the Sublime Porte had occurred in 1595–1611, provoked by heavy feudal duties and the Turks' ever-increasing interference in country affairs\\".Mircea, p. 78 Radu Mihnea, as the first Prince of Wallachia directly appointed by the Porte, had helped to \\"relaunch these antagonisms\\" in the 1610s and 1620s.Mircea, pp. 78–79 As scholar Neagu Djuvara notes, the Ottomans made sure that both Wallachia and Moldavia were \\"militarily insignificant\\" by this moment in time, on their way to becoming \\"mere pawns in games of the great powers\\".Djuvara, p. 25 In both countries, Ottoman fiscal demands had declined after the Long War, stabilizing themselves at possibly a third of the previous decade (see Transformation of the Ottoman Empire).Murgescu, pp. 32–40, 54 Nevertheless, a European-wide contraction of the cattle trade brought recession, especially in Wallachia.Murgescu, p. 46 The increase in Ottoman political controls also came with a cultural and social shift, which generated internal conflicts. According to social historian Răzvan Theodorescu, Radu Mihnea's takeover marked a \\"Levantine wave\\" and \\"Oriental cultural climate\\", also preserved under Alexandru Coconul, then under Alexandru IV Iliaș.Theodorescu, pp. 105, 109–111, 207–208, 219–220, 234–235, 242 Scholar Radu G. Păun argues that Greeks and Phanariotes were \\"indispensable\\" as experienced diplomats. Păun concludes that, for this reason, foreigners were over-represented among the most powerful boyars, accounting for 14 out of 30 Wallachian Chamberlains (Postelnici, singular Postelnic) in 1600–1700.Păun, p. 168 Both the local boyardom and peasantry acted against this state of affairs, and more specifically against the influx of Greeks. Resentments peaked under Iliaș, with violent revolts centered on Oltenia. One was led by Paharnic Lupu Mehedințeanu, and another by a commoner or a boyar's son, Paisie.Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 64–72, 83–84 Historian Constantin Iordachi counts three \\"violent anti-Greek plots\\" in the 1611–1618 interval.Iordachi, p. 67 Under Alexandru Coconul, the peasant cavalry, or Călărași, staged a tax revolt, and was only narrowly defeated, by other branches of the Wallachian military forces, outside Buftea.Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 81–82 =Rise and clientele= Miniature portrait of an Ottoman Greek man. From the 1657 muraqqa preserved by Claes Rålamb One account suggests that Leon engaged in bribing the Ottoman officials, who would have ensured his appointment as Prince, running into massive debt.Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 284; Popescu-Băjenaru, p. 177 Eventually, Sultan Murad IV ordered Alexandru IV to step down and proclaimed Leon as the Prince; he took the throne at some point before October 15, 1629,Cernovodeanu & Vătămanu, p. 25 and continued the process of Hellenization. Aside from questions regarding his own ethnic origin, his Princess-consort, Victoria, was referred to as a \\"Levantine\\".Iorga (1971), p. 167Aurel I. Gheorghiu, \\"Note.

Noi contribuții documentare\\", in Analele Științifice ale Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Istorie, Vol. LX, 2014, pp. 209–211, 214, 218–222 Leon's own court was largely perceived by adversaries as a \\"Greek\\" cabal, but, according to Rezachevici, this point is rhetorical, not factual: \\"We must not view 'Greeks' as meaning only persons of this background, but generally south-of-the-Danube people, and even Romanians, who were loyal to the Prince.\\" Iordachi also describes Leon as having been \\"accompanied by a large Greek clientele\\".Iordachi, p. 101 However, \\"the meaning of generic terms such as 'Greeks' [...] changed gradually, both in the official imperial discourse and in the self-understanding or self-identification of the peoples living in the empire, from predominantly social categories in the pre- nationalist age to modern ethno-national categories in the age of nationalism.\\"Iordachi, p. 73 As Rezachevici notes, in 1630 Leon's Boyar Divan comprised four Greeks, including Postelnic Alexandri and Paharnic Balasache Muselim, four Romanians, and one Albanian—Miho, brother of the more famous Leca Racotă. Among the leading courtiers was Vistier Necula Catargiu. He was a member of a culturally Greek family, described by chronicler Matthew of Myra as \\"archons of the Eastern Empire\\",Gheorghe G.

In February 1630, he received from Leon a share of the Bucharest princely vineyards.Giurescu, p. 318 Part of Wallachia's army was led by Ghiorma Alexeanu, an orphaned adventurer of Phanariote origin.Stoicescu, p. 105 Leon's retinue also included a Muslim convert, Apostolos or Kürt Salman Çavuş, who was the son of a Ban Iane,Mircea, p. 79; Țighiliu, p. 138 and as such probably a renegade member of the Cantacuzino family.Stoicescu, p. 64; Radu Ștefan Vergatti, \\"Mihai Viteazul și Andronic Cantacuzino\\", in Alamanah Bisericesc (Episcopia Giurgiului), 2013, pp. 230, 238 The regime was endorsed by a Bosnian banker, identified in sources as Matei \\"Latinul\\" (\\"the Latin\\") of Saraybosna. He was recognized by Leon as the owner of Pleașov village, while also serving as Postelnic.Donat, p. 214Lia Lehr, \\"Camăta în Țara Romînească pînă în secolul al XVIII-lea\\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie, Vol. 23, Issue 4, 1970, p. 700 =Aslan's revolt= Early stages In addition to heightening tensions between the boyar factions, the new regime also imposed a fiscal policy that was increasingly unpopular. In 1629, George Apafi, an itinerant Hungarian aristocrat, noted that tax increases had \\"depleted the country\\", pushing taxpayers into hiding or exile, to the point where even horses had become a scarce commodity. His travel account is also the first source mentioning a multitude of derelicts, or calici, living on the outskirts of Bucharest. Leon also enforced the treatment of serfs as immovable assets on the land they labored, explicitly confirming rules set under Michael the Brave. During a trial July 1630, he clarified that the peasants of Ciomăgești could never apply for manumission.Panaitescu (1956), pp. 95–96 He also clamped down on itinerant trades, being the first Wallachian ruler to collect a tithe from shepherds,Ștefan Meteș, \\"Păstori ardeleni în Principatele-Române\\", in Anuarul Institutului de Istorie Națională, Vol. III, 1924–1925, p. 301 and possibly the first of several Princes to impose a special tax on Moldavian artisans.Giurescu, p. 267 In private, Leon reportedly complained that his policies were driven by the haraç and other Ottoman demands. He claimed that gold and silver were not being mined in Wallachia on purpose, \\"so that the Turk cannot enjoy a full taste of [Wallachia's] treasures and nab [Wallachia] away from her Christians.\\"Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 50 The series of rebellions and riots was resumed in October 1630, when Aslan, deposed Ban of Oltenia, led the local boyars into open revolt, aiming to crown himself Prince. Though this movement also presented itself as nativist to some degree, Aslan was himself a Greek on his father's side; its immediate cause was another tax hike, which had driven the lesser boyars into insolvency.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 73–74, 83–84 The Oltenian Matei Basarab, a former Aga in the Wallachian military forces, provided Aslan with significant backing, as did other boyars whom Leon had had replaced.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 73–74 According to various reports, Catargiu \\"invaded\\" land retained by the Craiovești house in Romanați County, splitting the Agas inheritance; as a tax farmer, Matei was also confronted with the massive flight of his fiscal base into the Principality of Transylvania.Rezachevici (1978), p. 74; Stoicescu, pp. 209, 218. See also Mioc, pp. 42–45; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 43–44 Moreover, Leon held boyars \\"responsible for levying taxes in the territories under their jurisdiction, thus making them liable for those taxes that had to be covered by eventual fugitives from their estates.\\" The boyar party also crossed the border in protest, placing their faith in a Transylvanian alliance. Most of them, including Aslan, passed into Țara Hațegului on October 13–18 (New Style: October 23–28).Iorga (1899), p. 176; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 43–44, 50, 284; Rezachevici (1978), p. 74 They incited serfs and other social categories to join them there, while also inviting Transylvanian Romanians to rally to their cause and help them conquer Oltenia.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 74–75 One contemporary account suggests that they were able to enlist 1,000 runaway Wallachian serfs, whom they also used to confirm petitions they addressed to the Sultan and to George II Rákóczi, the reigning Prince of Transylvania.Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 44–45 Rákóczi was interested in the planned insurrection, receiving the fugitives at his court in Feyérvár (Bălgrad).Iorga (1899), p. 176; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 44–45 He hoped to use the boyars as negotiators of an alliance between his country and the Ottoman Empire. Through Rákóczi, Aslan was able to contact Abaza Mehmed Pasha.Rezachevici (1978), p. 75 However, some of the rebels were intimidated by Leon's threats of land confiscation, and began returning from Transylvania; Leon issued them safe conducts, or \\"pacification charters\\" (cărți de împăcare). Similarly, he pardoned some of the runaway serfs of Jiblea and Spinu, in exchange for their protection of Transylvanian traders who still supplied ropes to the Oltenian salt mines.Aurora Ilieș, \\"Știri în legătură cu exploatarea sării în Țara Romînească pînă în veacul al XVIII-lea\\", in Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. I, 1956, p. 177 In May 1631, faced with the disappearance of an entire serf community at Tutana, he made an exemption from his old ruling against manumission.Matei D. Vlad, \\"Asemănări și deosebiri între 'sloboziile' și satele de colonizare din Țara Românească și Moldova\\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie, Vol. 25, Issue 1, 1972, p. 140 Concessions Map of Aslan and Matei Basarab's revolt, 1630 through 1632 By then, however, the Aslan uprising had become a \\"strong popular movement\\",Djuvara, p. 346 or \\"the strongest anti-Greek reaction from all the 'privileged' social categories\\".Neagoe, p. 120 This threat forced Leon to reconsider his core policies. In July 1631,Iorga (1899), pp. 177–178; Rezachevici (1978), p. 75 he called upon the estates of the realm, though the process was still controlled by the Divan's grand boyars. At the end of the proceedings, Leon granted tax privileges and a degree of immunity to the major boyar families, including their virtual exemption from the capital punishment. Lesser fiscal privileges were extended to other categories: non-titular boyars, scribes, professional soldiers, and priests of the Wallachian Church.Rezachevici (1978), p. 75. See also Giurescu, p. 69 Leon also ordered the expulsion from Wallachia of all \\"evil Greeks of Tsargrad\\"—that is, Greeks who had not been naturalized by that point in time.Rezachevici (1996), p. 105 The Divan was supposedly purged, though, as Rezachevici notes, only some of the Greek \\"Divanites\\" were ever demoted; others, such as Constantin Cantacuzino and Pavlakis Caradja, were simply moved to a privy council.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 75, 83–84 and (1996), p. 105. See also Popescu-Băjenaru, pp. 176–177 The new measures mostly affected lesser categories: all Greek property owners were made subject to the income tax, while males who had married locals were required to perform military service alongside free peasants and burghers, as \\"Redcoats\\". Tomșa's reign provided an additional landmark case in Wallachian law, reinforcing existing provisions against the spread of Islam and dismissing equality for Muslims. In late 1631, the Divan ruled against Leon's Muslim courtier, Kürt Salman, preventing him from recovering property his father had owned in Wallachia; the plaintiff was described as being \\"unprotected by laws\\".Mircea, pp. 78–79; Stoicescu, p. 64; Țighiliu, p. 138; Michał Wasucionek, \\"Danube- Hopping: Conversion, Jurisdiction and Spatiality between the Ottoman Empire and the Danubian Principalities in the Seventeenth Century\\", in Claire Norton (ed.), Conversion and Islam in the Early Modern Mediterranean: The Lure of the Other, pp. 83, 86, 90–91. Abingdon: Routledge, 2017. Such edicts were never expanded to discriminate against the Greek or Levantine clergy, which remained distinctly cosmopolitan. As noted by theologian Constantin C. Cojocaru, \\"the Wallachians were never as intransigent as the Moldavians\\" in this respect.Constantin C. Cojocaru, \\"Daniil Vlahovici – episcop al Bucovinei (23 aprilie 1789 – 20 august 1822) (I)\\", in Analele Bucovinei, Vol. VII, Issue 1, 2000, pp. 45–46 Leon's other nativist concessions included an order to dispossess Mount Athos of some Wallachian monasteries, namely those that Greek monks had received, as metochia, without explicit consent from the ktitors. This process returned to the Wallachian Church full ownership of Argeș, Bistrița, Cotmeana, Cozia, Dealu, Glavacioc, Snagov, and Tismana.Țighiliu, p. 128 However, one record shows that Leon himself donated Dealu, with its agricultural reserve, its customs revenue, and its Gypsy slaves, to the Athonite monks of Iviron.Petroniu Florea, Literatura patrologică românească în secolul XX, Vol. I, p. 175. Zalău: Editura Episcopiei Sălajului Credință și Viață în Hrisos, 2015. Iviron also received from him the estate of Stelea Church, Bucharest.Iorga (1971), p. 81 Separate from this, he donated a Wallachian village to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Jerusalem Patriarchy.Iorga (1971), p. 163 The restrictive measures, Iordachi argues, were \\"highly illustrative of the transformation of the anti-Greek campaign into a militant program of social and political change.\\"Iordachi, p. 102 According to Rezachevici, the expulsions were not designed to \\"obtain the goodwill of exiles\\", who may have \\"conditioned their return on the promulgation of such writs\\". However, they failed to convince the bulk of insurgents: Leon's boyar delegation to Feyérvár ran into Matei and his \\"Redcoats\\" at Vulcan Pass; Miho Racotă, sent in to repel this invasion, was defeated at Ungureni, allowing Matei temporary control over Oltenia.Iorga (1899), p. 178; Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 45 Victims of his retribution included Iovan Latinul, father of Leon's Postelnic, who was decapitated at Caracal. Leon prepared for a defense of Muntenia, sending Princess Victoria to a safe haven, in the Ottoman fortress of Giurgiu. The main rebel force pushed toward Bucharest, but, following his grants of privilege, Leon had fuller confidence in his own troops, to whom he promised payments in bullion coin;Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 45 he was also backed by a native Logothete, Papa Greceanu.Stoicescu, p. 192 On August 13 (23), 1631, Aslan's boyars were defeated on Beilicului Highway, just south of the capital city.Giurescu, pp. 69–70, 251, 319; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 21, 40, 43–46, 50, 220, 237, 268, 285, 299; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 75–76. See also Iorga (1899), p. 178 and (1928), p. 70–71; Stoicescu, pp. 209, 217, 232 The rebels encountered various losses. A leading partisan, Preda \\"Floricoiu\\" of Cepturoaia, was killed in battle of beheaded soon afterward.Giurescu, p. 70; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 45, 299; Stoicescu, p. 232 The Armaș Pușa (or Nușa) was captured alive, alongside some 40 Transylvanian mercenaries. He was impaled on the spot, while the others were dispatched to Istanbul as war slaves.Giurescu, p. 70; Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 45 Loyalists also captured the Agas nephew, Preda Brâncoveanu, who bought his way out of captivity.Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 45, 285, 299; Stoicescu, p. 125 Another victory for the loyalists, reportedly led by Ghiorma, was at Aninoasa. A final punitive expedition, led by Pătrașco Boul and Nedelco Boteanu,Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 46; Stoicescu, pp. 119, 353. See also Iorga (1899), p. 178; Székely, p. 206 drove Aslan, Matei and their followers to the northwestern corner of Oltenia. The beleaguered rebels resisted at Tismana and Izvarna,Iorga (1899), p. 178; Stoicescu, pp. 119, 353; Székely, p. 206 but were finally pushed back into Transylvania. On their return, Boul and Boteanu reportedly ransacked Oltenia \\"in the worst way.\\"Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 46 =Downfall= Following these setbacks, Matei switched tactic, moving to another section of the border, at Făgăraș Citadel, and making more overtures to obtain help from Abaza.Iorga (1899), p. 178 From Bucharest, Leon focused on dismantling the Agas personal estate. By September 5, he had confiscated \\"all [his] villages and assets\\",Rezachevici (1978), p. 76. See also Stoicescu, p. 209 including the ancestral demesne at Betejani-Moldoveni.Donat, p. 159 Matei remained an irreconcilable opponent, whereas most leading figures of the uprising gave up arms. They included Aslan, who swore fealty to Leon and returned, possibly serving another term as Ban in Oltenia.Iorga (1899), p. 179; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 46–47; Rezachevici (1978), p. 76; Stoicescu, pp. 108, 120, 227 Leon believed that he owed his triumph to the miraculous intervention of Saint George, to whom he dedicated a place of worship, built on the very spot of the Bucharest battle—a building currently known as Slobozia Church.Iorga (1899), p. 179 and (1928), pp. 70–71. See also Cernovodeanu & Vătămanu, p. 39; Giurescu, pp. 78, 251; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 21, 40, 43–44, 237, 268, 299 According to popular tradition, the wayside cross erected there by Leon a mass grave containing people killed in the battle.Giurescu, p. 70; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 21, 40, 43–44, 46, 50, 237, 299 In March 1632, a diplomatic mission from the Swedish Empire passed through Wallachia on its way to the Porte. Leon made a point of welcoming it to Bucharest with military honors, presenting his guard of 100 boyars and 200 Seimeni mercenaries.Giurescu, p. 70; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 48–50 The delegation was headed by Paul Strassburg, and also included an Italian painter, Benedetto. Tomșa enlisted the latter's services for one or several paintings, and generously rewarded the effort.Theodorescu, pp. 140, 169–170 More concessions to the peasants came in January–April. Leon unusually authorized the Hegumen of Sfânta Troiță to collect the state tax on monastery land, without the intervention of tax farmers. On his orders, one of these estates, at Parapani, only owed one ducat as tax.Mioc, pp. 87, 104 Additionally, Leon protected the monastery headquarters against Catargiu's illegal land encroachment, reviewing and restoring traditional property borders.Giurescu, p. 341; I. Ionașcu, Vlad Zirra, \\"Capitolul II. Mănăstirea Radu Vodă și biserica Bucur\\", in I. Ionașcu (ed.), Bucureștii de odinioară în lumina săpăturilor arheologice, p. 69. Bucharest: Editura științifică, 1959 His ruling is one of several period documents mentioning the overabundance of boyar watermills on the lower Dâmbovița.Giurescu, p. 341 With one of his final contributions as reigning Prince, he also exempted Alexeanu's shops from the tax on chimneys.Mioc, p. 89 Leon was ultimately deposed by the Porte since, as historian Nicolae Iorga asserts, he had been found to be an \\"untalented prevaricator\\".Iorga (1899), p. 179 Zaim briefly mentions that Leon, a cultural alien, \\"could not get along with [his subjects]\\", and suggests that this was a main reason for his ouster. According to various calculations, Leon's reign ended on July 2 or July 31,Iorga (1899), p. 179. See also Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 47 1632\\\\. An overall estimate in contemporary chronicles argues that his reign had lasted \\"eight days short of two and a half years\\".Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 47 In September of that year, Greceanu, Catargiu, Dumitru Dudescu and Neagu of Strâmba led a boyar delegation to Moldavia. They demanded and obtained from Iliaș Alexandru, the Moldavian Prince, that his son, Radu Iliaș, take the throne in Bucharest.Stoicescu, pp. 173, 192, 216, 217, 369 Other boyars pleaded with the Seimeni of Moldavia to join them in defending Wallachia against the foreseeable return of Aga Matei.Stoicescu, pp. 107, 134 According to Iorga, this short-lived new regime proved widely unpopular;Iorga (1899), pp. 179–180 it is one of several reigns entirely omitted in Zaim's chronicle. It ended once Matei Basarab returned with help from Abaza and Rákóczi, entering Oltenia through its westernmost town, Orșova.Iorga (1899), p. 180; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 47–48 Matei was instantly followed by the mass of the boyars at Radu Iliaș's court. Of this group, Mihai Coțofeanu helped the intruding force take control of Buzău; Barbu Brădescu was appointed Matei's Paharnic, commanding upon a section of his troops.Rezachevici (1978), p. 84 Ghiorma Alexanu and Nedelco Boteanu also defected, being welcomed at Matei's court.Stoicescu, pp. 105, 119–121 On October 25 (November 5), at Plumbuita or Obilești, east of Bucharest, Matei won a decisive victory, and took the throne for himself.Giurescu, p. 70; Iorga (1899), p. 180; Rezachevici (1978), p. 76; Stoicescu, pp. 115, 120–121, 159, 192, 195, 209, 212, 217, 221, 233 Greceanu was killed in the clashes, whereas Miho Racotă was driven into exile; Boul and Catargiu left for Moldavia, never to return.Stoicescu, pp. 192, 217, 233, 353, 369. See also Iorga (1899), p. 180 Legacy =In politics and culture= Icon of Saint George, Leon and Victoria's gift to Viforâta Monastery The legend of Căldăruşani Monastery, recorded in 1924 by Hieromonk Damian Stănoiu, recounts that \\"the boyars and Redcoats and all of the country greatly rejoiced that Aga Matei had emerged as ruler of the country, for they all knew him to be a decent right-believing man, one who felt for his poor country, which had fallen prey to the Greeks of Leon Vodă\\".Viorica Istrate, Damian Stănoiu, \\"Ieromonahul Damian Stănoiu și monografiile sale (IV)\\", in Memoria Oltului și Romanaților, Vol. IV, Issue 11, November 2015, p. 100 In 1633, Prince Matei passed an amnesty of the runaway serfs, but only if they has escaped before 1629. Those \\"settled [abroad] during the days of Leon Vodă\\" were to be marshaled back into their home villages.Panaitescu (1956), p. 107 He also phased out the shepherd's tithe, paying a ransom to Rákóczi for damages encountered by Transylvanian pastoralists. Although, overall, Matei returned to increasing the taxes, the economic and fiscal crisis was surpassed with relative ease; commercially, Wallachia became reliant on the lucrative salt trade, and Ottoman fiscal demands were offset by inflation.Murgescu, pp. 32–33, 54 In other fields, Leon's legislation was also left untouched. As argued by Djuvara, the \\"charter\\" of 1631 established a pattern of boyar independence and immovability, making Princes themselves into \\"representatives or instruments of the grand boyars' party\\". Overall, according to Iordachi, a \\"legal regime of estates\\" was emerging in both Wallachia and Moldavia, with 1631 as a key moment in its evolution: \\"The anti-Greek campaign increased estate solidarity and the bonds between local nobles, paving the way toward the emergence of future paradigms of collective identity.\\"Iordachi, pp. 102–103 Rezachevici notes that the local boyars lost interest in \\"anti-Greek\\" agitation; the revolutionary initiatives fell exclusively on Seimeni and other mercenaries, as with Hrizea of Bogdănei's rebellion.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 76–77, 84 Prince Matei selectively upheld the provisions against non-naturalized Greeks. Racotă was pardoned and assigned the rank of Logothete, before being sidelined in 1640.Stoicescu, p. 233 Matei chased out Leon's Postelnic, Mano, but allowed him back into the country by 1648, without including him on the Divan.Stoicescu, p. 208 As noted by Theodorescu, the Benedetto episode marked an early and isolated contribution to Western-style portrait painting in Wallachia.Theodorescu, pp. 138–141 In addition to sponsoring this venture and erecting Slobozia's cross, Prince Leon influenced the art of Romania through his furbishing of Viforâta Monastery, which celebrated his victory at Aninoasa. In October 1631, he and Victoria donated an icon of Saint George. The few parts of the painting that are visible under the silver riza are identified as belonging to the Venetian or Veneto–Cretan School.Maria Georgescu, \\"Icônes grecques de Târgoviște\\", in Annales de l'Université Valahia Târgoviște, Serie Archéologie et Histoire, Vols. II–III, 2000–2001, p. 184 It is reportedly the only item of the old monastery building to have survived into modernity.Iorga (1928), p. 66 As \\"Alion\\" or \\"Talion\\", the Prince became a minor character in Romanian folklore, the hero of a children's rhyme.Dumitrescu, p. 338 He may also be the character \\"Olea\\", whose gun battle with \\"a Prince Basarabă\\" is caricatured in a similar poem, recorded at Ciomăgești.Dumitrescu, pp. 338–339 The Strassburg visit is also one of the early recorded instances of a monarch employing Lăutari for musical entertainment, with a repertoire of patrium carmen (\\"songs of the country\\").Giurescu, pp. 70, 284 =Later \\"Tomșas\\"= In 1664, following an especially bloody civil war between the Cantacuzino and Băleanu boyars, the throne of Wallachia was taken by a Radu Leon. This relatively unknown figure claimed to be Prince Leon's son, but was more likely a Greek commoner; his political rise is attributable to him being a favorite of Ahmed Köprülü, the Grand Vizier.Rezachevici (1996), pp. 111–112. See also Iorga (1899), p. 214 Ca. 1650, he had married Luchiana, sister of a Latin Catholic Dragoman, Michele Paradà.Luca, pp. 661–664 Like his putative father, Radu was allegedly involved in the oyster trade, and for this reason was also nicknamed StridieRezachevici (1996), p. 112 or Stridigiul.Iorga (1899), p. 214 In 1664–1665, he underscored his genealogical claims by restoring the cross of Slobozia.Giurescu, p. 69; Iorga (1899), p. 179 and (1928), p. 71; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 285, 299 Radu also fully re-instituted pro-Greek policies. He populated the Divan with recent immigrants such as Nicula Sofialiul and Paharnic Manolache, while preserving a major role for Leon's boyar, Balasache Muselim; he was also especially unpopular for welcoming in an unusually large number of Greek bankers.Rezachevici (1996), pp. 106–107, 112. See also Stoicescu, pp. 108–109, 198–199, 242 He tried to maintain a pacifying balance, assigning offices of the court to the Cantacuzinos and their various rivals.Rezachevici (1996), pp. 110, 112–113, 117 As noted by historian Petre P.

It is a hemimetabolous organism. Eusociality evolved independently within several orders of insects, directed by different selection pressures. Nevertheless, termites and other eusocial insects from Hymenoptera evolved similar physiological and social characteristics. Subspecies Z. nevadensis is subdivided into two subspecies, Z. n. nevadensis and Z. n. nuttingi. The genome of Zootermopsis nevadensis nuttingi has been sequenced. Genome The main objective of sequencing Zootermopsis nevadensis genome was to find the molecular traces of eusociality. The authors compared the whole sequenced and assembled genome and 25 transcriptomes from different development states and castes with the already sequenced genomes of eusocial Hymenoptera and ants. This termite only has two opsin genes copies, the smallest number of opsin genes among the insects, as a result of living in the dark their whole lives. Further, we tested linage specific gene families to study expansion or contraction. Nine families exhibit expansion in Z. Nevandensis; the majority of them have differential development, castes or gender expression. Four gene families are not expanded but show the same differential expression among castes. The proteins coded on these genes probably have an important role in mating biology, reproduction or communication. =Male fertility= Among the gene families with a significant expansion, four of them exhibit overexpression on fertile males and they are linked to male spermatogenesis or cellular division: Kelch-like proteins 10 (KLHL10) and Seven-in-abstenia (SINA). The codified proteins are associated with E3-ubiquitine-ligase complex implicated in espermatide proteins degradation. There are other gene families which are not expanded, but shows a differential expression pattern among developmental stages and castes. Collectively, the data suggest an expanded role around spermatogenesis regulation and termite evolution. Male termites completes gamete maturation after their moult. Male Z. nevadensis mate repeatedly during his mature stage and needs to increase sperm production. Moreover, males activate and deactivate their testes cyclically. =Chemoperception= Z. nevadensis shows expansion on genes implied in chemical communication, a crucial component in insects societies. It has approximately 280 functional chemoreceptor genes. This number is over the average of insects, but intermediate among ants or bees. Although the total number of genes is comparable, its distribution within different gene families diverge from what has been observed in Hymenoptera. * The olfactive receptors (ORs) confers most of the specificity and sensitivity of insect olfaction. These genes are pretty expanded on ants (344-400 genes) and bees (163 genes) but in Z. nevadensis there are only 63 genes. * The gustative receptor (GRs) are similarly expanded in Z. nevadensis (87 genes) and other eusocial insects (10-97 genes). * The ionotropic receptors (IRs) are implied in gustation and olfaction in Drosophila melanogaster and they are expanded in Z. nevadensis too with 137 genes. The great difference between ORs and IRs gives an opportunity to study the organization of the olfactive lobe. The antennal lobe is formed by glomeruli. The glomeruli are tightly packed and they are composed by terminal axons projected from receptor neurons to the antennae. The sensor neurons which express the same chemoreceptors extend their axons to the same glomeruli. Z. nevadensis only has 72 glomeruli, the majority of them are joined to the 63 ORs. As a result, only a few number of IRs and GRs are implied in olfaction, the rest may be implied in gustation. The termite Z. nevadensis has a limited ability to discriminate odours. The majority of the termites live their lives within a single log. A colony rarely meet other termites outside the log. In the other hand eusocial insects like bees has a developed sense of smell. This feature provide bees a sophisticated weapon to identify their colony partners. =Immunity= Homogeneous populations living in high density are perfect targets for infections. This termite concretly lives in a pathogen-rich environment. The genome was analyzed in order to establish the relationship between eusociality and disease resistance. There were found all the vias related to immunity in Drosophila and other insects, including pattern recognition receptors, signaling pathways and regulatory genes. *6 Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs), more than in other insects. One of them is specific of insect and the rest are specific of termites. This feature means that this kind of genes were expanded early within the evolution of this species. *5 signaling pathway genes related to immune system are overexpressed in reproductive females. *3 antimicrobian peptides (AMPs) (attacin, dipericine and a termicine ortologue). It was unexpected because the ant response against living in a pathogen rich environment is the expansion of AMPs. Pathogens play an important role in eusocial insects, but the mechanisms improved to combat them differs in a taxon-specific manner. =Reproductive division of labour= The differentiation in castes and the reproductive division of labour is a marker of insect eusociality. Within Hymenoptera it has been proposed some regulators including vitelogenines (Vgs), juvenile hormone (JH), biogenic amines and other regulator like juvenile hormone binding proteins and some signaling pathways like insulin/insulin growth factor and yellow/major royal jelly protein like genes. The main genes involved in the reproductive division of labour are: *Vitellogenines (Vgs) are precursors of the egg yolk protein vitellin. This proteins, had been found outside egg production and they were implied in the regulation of caste differentiation in Apis melifera. There were identified four Vgs. Two of them seem to be recent tandem duplications pretty conserved. One of these duplications is closely related to Neofem3 a specific gene implied in reproduction in other termite species. Three of the Four Vgs are significantly expressed in reproductive queens. One of the Vgs genes is moderately expressed in nymphs and non-reproductive workers. Vgs seem to have acquired a role in the regulation of caste behaviour. Overexpression of Vgs plays an important role as antioxidant and ths feature could participate in reproductive females' longevity. *Juvenil hormones (JHs) are implied in insect development, reproduction, longevity and both, solitary and social behaviour. In termites is well known that JHs module caste differentiation and adult gonadal activity. JHs have different functions among development stages and a lot of different functions within a development stage. In Z. nevadensis there was found all the enzymes of the JHIII biosynthetic pathway and major regulators such as JH-binding proteins. Squeme about Z. nevadensis's caste differentiation. The reproductive division of labour is associated with an increased longevity of reproductives and histone-modifying enzymes take part in lifespan regulation. There was found two histone-deacetylases overexpressed in reproductive females, sirtuin 6 and sirtuin 7. Overexpression of sirtuin 6 in mice increases their longevity. In eusocial insects and the reproductive division of labour is regulated by cuticular hydrocarbons. The reproductive status in Z. nevadensis is directed by the abundance of four long chain polyunsaturated alquenes. From 16 elongases and 10 desaturases found in Z. nevadensis one of each group is highly expressed in reproductive forms. The reproductive co-expression of these genes makes them hydrocarbon signaling regulators candidates in Z. nevadensis. Previously studies indicates that cytochromes P450 (CYP450) and hexamerins are implicated in caste differentiation. * Cytochromes P450 are haeme-thiolate enzymes. In insects they contribute in endogenous and xenobiotics compounds degradation. CYP4 and CYP5 families are implied in JH synthesis and degradation. CYP450 is relationated with the JH-dependent differentiation from worker to soldier termites. There were found 55 CYP450 genes. This number is lower than in solitary Diptera, but intermediate compared with eusocial Hymenoptera. 10 of this genes are overexpressed in worker termites. * Hexamerins are usually storage proteins in solitary insects. There were found 5 hexamerin genes in Z. nevadensis. Two of them are implicated in JH availability. Hexamerins reduce the JH availability in workers and nymphal stages. The overexpression during this plastic stages inhibits the differentiation to soldiers. =DNA methylation and alternative splicing= During the genome analysis of Z. nevadensis, it was studied the methylation state of the DNA by using empirical and computational tools. First of all, there were identified two homologous enzymes to DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3. This feature shows that exists a functional machinery for DNA methylation. CpG islands meethylation levels in Z. nevadensis are 1.5-3 times higher than in the rest of insects. The methylation is preferently performed within introns. There was found a strong correlation between DNA methylation in CpG islands and alternative splicing.

It comprises a suite of fossilised prehistoric animals from the late Early Miocene (Altonian) period, with an age range of 19–16 million years ago. The layer in which the fossils are found derives from littoral zone sediments deposited in a shallow, freshwater lake, with an area of 5600 km2 from present day Central Otago to Bannockburn and the Nevis Valley in the west; to Naseby in the east; and from the Waitaki Valley in the north to Ranfurly in the south. The lake was bordered by an extensive floodplain containing herbaceous and grassy wetland habitats with peat-forming swamp–woodland. At that time the climate was warm with a distinctly subtropical Australian climate and the surrounding vegetation was characterised by casuarinas, eucalypts and palms as well as podocarps, araucarias and southern beeches. The fossiliferous layer has been exposed at places along the Manuherikia River and at other sites in the vicinity of the historic gold mining town of St Bathans. The fauna consists of a variety of vertebrates, including fish, a crocodilian, a rhynchocephalian (a relative of tuatara), geckos, skinks, and several kinds of birds, especially waterbirds. Of tree-dwelling birds, parrots outnumber pigeons thirty to one. Proapteryx, a basal form of kiwi, is known from there. The Miocene ecosystem was recovering from the ‘Oligocene drowning’ a few million years earlier, when up to 80% of the current land area of New Zealand was submerged. The wildlife that lived in, on, and around the palaeolake Manuherikia was uniquely New Zealand, which strongly suggesting that some emergent land remained during this near drowning event. Marked global cooling and drying during the Miocene, Pliocene and the Pleistocene Ice Ages resulted in the extinction of the ‘subtropical’ elements of the St Bathans’ fauna. Those that survived adapted to the dynamic geological and climatic changes, and would form part of the enigmatic fauna that characterised New Zealand when humans arrived in the late 13th century.

Research is currently funded by Vanesa De Pietri’s Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fast Start grant, but this long-running (since 2000) collaborative research programme also includes scientists from the University of New South Wales in Sydney and from the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Mammals Surprisingly, given modern New Zealand's dearth of land mammals, there is a basal theriiform mammal, the St Bathans mammal. Several species of mystacine bats are also known, as well as a vesper bat and several incertae sedis species. This bat fauna included a giant burrowing bat three times the size of today’s relatives, and more closely related to South American bats. This suggests that small land mammals were a common component of New Zealand's fauna in the Miocene, with even bats being significantly more diverse than today. Birds =Palaeognaths= New Zealand's two modern palaeognath clades, the kiwi and moa, have early representatives in the St Bathans fauna. The former is represented by the diminutive, possibly volant Proapteryx. The latter is represented by several bones and egg shells of currently unnamed species, but already identifiable as true moa, being large sized and flightless. The fact that moa are already recognisably modern in anatomy, and possibly ecology, while kiwis are fairly unspecialised and probably still flighted, confirms the previous suspicions that neither clade is closely related and that they arrived in New Zealand independently: moa arrived and became flightless earlier in the Cenozoic, while kiwi were then recent arrivals. =Charadriiformes= Charadriiformes, including gulls, terns, noddies, snipes, dotterels, plovers, jacanas, oystercatchers, sheathbills and the plains-wanderer, are a large group of birds that are mostly found in marine or semi-marine environments. There are about 350 species, and they are mostly small to medium-sized. Two of these are known from the St Bathans Fauna, the New Zealand lake-wanderer (Hakawai melvillei), a relative of the plains-wanderer, and Sansom's plover (Neilus sansomae), a plover-like bird of uncertain affinities but possibly related to sheathbills and the Magellanic plover. =Parrots= Two parrot genera are represented. Heracles is represented by its sole species, Heracles inexpectatus, the largest known parrot, weighing 7 kilograms and standing 1 meter tall. Nelepsittacus is represented by at least four species. These vary drastically in size, suggesting that they occupied a wide variety of ecological niches, having diversified in the relative absence of other parrots. =Pigeons= Two pigeon species have been described. Rupephaps is a large fruit pigeon, possibly related to the modern Hemiphaga species. The Zealandian dove is similar to the Nicobar pigeon. =Passeriformes= A New Zealand wren, Kuiornis indicator, is known from these deposits, possibly similar to the modern rifleman. Two or three other species remain undescribed. = Palaelodids = Palaelodids are ancient relatives of flamingos. The new species from St Bathans (Palaelodus aotearoa) is smaller than, and morphologically distinct from, the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene Palaelodus wilsoni from Australia. = Petrels = Petrels are seabirds in the order Procellariformes. This group includes albatrosses. Petrels today make up most of all species of seabird, and the order is the only order of birds to be entirely marine. One species of petrel is known from the St Bathans Fauna-a diving petrel in the same genus as modern diving petrels, the Miocene diving petrel (Pelecanoides miokuaka). =Herons= At least two herons are known: Pikaihao bartlei and Matuku otagoense. The former is a bittern, while the latter is a much larger species that appears to be basal within Ardeidae (the herons). = Eagles and hawks = One eagle similar in sized to a wedge-tailed eagle, and another taxon similar in size to a small hawk, are present in the St Bathans fauna, but await formal description. = Rails and allies = The St Bathans adzebill (Aptornis proasciarostratus) was only sightly smaller than its more recent descendants. There were two flightless rails: the common Priscaweka parvales and uncommon Litorallus livezeyi. Priscaweka parvales was no bigger than a sparrow. =Waterfowl= Anseriforms dominate the St Bathans fauna. There are at least nine species recognised from St Bathans, making it the richest waterfowl fauna in the world. All the waterfowl species are unique to New Zealand. These include: bones attributable to Cape Barren Goose (Cereopsis spp.) thought to represent the ancestors of extinct Pleistocene-Holocene Cnemiornis goose, and those of a second possible goose species. In both instances, there is not enough material currently to erect species. Stiff- tailed ducks dominate the fauna with Manuherikia lacustrina, M. minuta, M. douglasi, Dunstanneta johnstoneorum and a further undescribed species of Manuherikia. Only one species of shelduck Miotadorna sanctibathansi, though common, was present in the St Bathans fauna. The dabbling duck Matanas enrightii remains poorly known as only a few fossils of this species have been found. Herpetofauna The St Bathans fauna is rich in reptile and amphibian remains. Several groups present in modern New Zealand are represented, such as leiopelmatid frogs, a sphenodontian similar to the modern tuatara, geckos, and skinks. However, there are also several species not seen in modern-day New Zealand, such as a mekosuchine crocodile up to 3 metres in length and pleurodire and meiolaniid turtles. This suggests that New Zealand's herpetofauna was much richer in this epoch, probably because its climate was considerably warmer than today.  Fish  The vast majority of the bones excavated from St Bathans are those of freshwater fish such as the ancient relatives of today's bullies, galaxiids, and the extinct New Zealand grayling.  Aquatic invertebrates  As well as fishes, shellfish, including freshwater mussels, and freshwater crayfish dominated the aquatic life in the palaeolake Manuherikia. A new species of St Bathans freshwater limpet, Latia manuherikia, was described by malacologist Bruce Marshall in 2011. This was both the first known fossil Latia and the first record of this genus from the South Island.  Absent taxa from St Bathans  Notable examples include marsupials, snakes, agamid and varanid lizards, lungfish, eels, cockatoos, and all but one lineage (bellbirds and tui) of the 80 species of Australian honeyeaters.

Leaders of the LDS Church, in recent years, have placed great emphasis on the full name of the church and have resisted the application of informal or shortened names, especially those which omit \\"Jesus Christ\\". These informal and shortened names include the \\"Mormon Church\\", the \\"LDS Church\\", and the \\"Church of the Latter-day Saints\\". Historical names of the church The LDS Church traces its founding to April 6, 1830, when Smith and five other men formally established the Church of Christ.Doctrine and Covenants 20:1.\\"Chapter 2: Establishing the Foundations of the Church\\", Our Heritage: A Brief History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1996). The church was known by this name from 1830 to 1834.Susan Easton Black, \\"Name of the Church\\" in Daniel H. Ludlow ed., Encyclopedia of Mormonism (Macmillan: New York, 1992) p. 979.Richard Lloyd Anderson, \\"I Have a Question: What changes have been made in the name of the Church?\\", Ensign, January 1979. In the 1830s, the fact that a number of U.S. churches, including some Congregational churches and Restoration Movement churches, also used the name \\"Church of Christ\\" caused a considerable degree of confusion. In May 1834, the church adopted a resolution that the church would be known thereafter as \\"The Church of the Latter Day Saints\\".K. Shane Goodwin, “The History of the Name of the Savior's Church,” BYU Studies Quarterly 53, no. 3 (Fall 2019): 14-21.http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/5889 \\"Minutes of a Conference\\"], Evening and Morning Star, vol. 2, no. 20, p. 160 (May 1832). At various times the church was also referred to as \\"The Church of Jesus Christ\\", \\"The Church of God\\",Joseph Smith (B.H. Roberts ed.), History of the Church 3:24, footnote. and \\"The Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints\\". Adoption of the current name In the late 1830s, Smith founded a new headquarters in Far West, Missouri. At Far West on April 26, 1838, Smith recorded a revelation from God renaming the organization the \\"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\".Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989). The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) 1:302–03.H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160. The church was known by this name until after Smith's death in 1844; occasionally the name would be written with a hyphen between the words \\"Latter\\" and \\"Day\\". After Smith's death, competing Latter Day Saint denominations organized under the leadership of a number of successors. The largest of these, led by Brigham Young, continued using \\"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\" until incorporation in 1851 by the legislature of the provisional State of Deseret, when the church standardized the spelling of its name as \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\", which included a hyphenated \\"Latter-day\\" and a British- style lower-case \\"d\\".J. Reuben Clark Law Society, \\"Law and the Church as an Institution\\", jrcls.org. In January 1855, the legislature of Utah Territory re-enacted the charter which incorporated the church under this name. In 1876, the LDS Church issued a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants which contains the text of significant revelations received by Joseph Smith. In this new edition—the first revision since before Smith's death—the capitalization and hyphenation of the church's name in the 1838 revelation to Smith was changed to reflect the name format the church had since adopted: > [A]nd unto all the elders and people of my Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- > day Saints, scattered abroad in all the world; For thus shall my church be > called in the last days, even the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day > Saints.Doctrine and Covenants 115:3–4. The definite article \\"The\\" was not capitalized in D&C; 115:4 of the 1876 edition. It is not until the 1921 edition that the definite article \\"The\\" was capitalized in verse 4 of the revelation.K. Shane Goodwin, \\"The History of the Name of the Savior's Church,\\" BYU Studies Quarterly 53, no. 3 (Fall 2019): 33-36. Until the late-20th century, church publications inconsistently capitalized \\"The\\" in the name of the church in running text. Today, church publications invariably capitalize \\"The\\" in all contexts. Today, \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\" is a registered trademark owned by the LDS Church. In contrast, \\"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\" is a public-domain name and is used by some smaller Latter Day Saint denominations, including the Strangites. Meaning of the name The church teaches that its name is a significant indicator of its origin and mission. The following teachings have been given on the meanings of the various components of the church's name: * The Church: \\"Note that the article The begins with a capital letter. This is an important part of the title, for the Church is the official organization of baptized believers who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ.\\"Russell M. Nelson, \\"'Thus Shall My Church Be Called'\\", Ensign, May 1990. \\"The word The indicates the unique position of the restored Church among the religions of the world.\\"M. Russell Ballard, \\"The Importance of a Name\\", Liahona, November 2011. \\"The word the is significant: not just Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, because to say 'The Church' distinguishes this as the only true church on the face of the earth.\\"President Joseph F. Smith, “An Authoritative Declaration,” in EightyEighth Annual General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1918), 52, accessed July 23, 2019, https:// archive.org/details/conferencereport1918a/page/52.Harold B. Lee, \\"The Way to Eternal Life\\", Ensign, November 1971. * of Jesus Christ: \\"By divine directive, the title of the Church bears the sacred name of Jesus Christ, whose church this is. ... We know Him to be 'the chief corner stone' upon which the organization of His Church is based. ... We know Him to be the Rock from whom revelation comes to His authorized agents ... and to all who worthily seek Him\\". \\"The words Church of Jesus Christ declare that it is His Church. In the Book of Mormon, Jesus taught: 'And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if it be called in the name of a man [like Mormon] then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel' (3 Nephi 27:8).\\" \\"By implication, calling the Church by the name Mormon would make it Mormon's Church. While most Church members are not offended by the title Mormon, they prefer the name that properly underscores their relationship to Christ.\\" * of Latter-day: \\"Of Latter-day explains that it is the same Church as the Church that Jesus Christ established during His mortal ministry but restored in these latter days.\\" *Saints: \\"Saints means that its members follow Him and strive to do His will, keep His commandments, and prepare once again to live with Him and our Heavenly Father in the future. Saint simply refers to those who seek to make their lives holy by covenanting to follow Christ.\\" \\"Despite its use in ninety- eight verses of the Bible, the term saint is still not well understood. Some mistakenly think that it implies beatification or perfection. Not so! A saint is a believer in Christ and knows of His perfect love. ... A saint serves others . ... A saint is tolerant, and is attentive to the pleadings of other human beings . ... A saint 'refrain[s] from idleness' ... and seeks learning by study, and also by faith. ... A saint is honest and kind . ... A saint is an honorable citizen . ... A saint resolves any differences with others honorably and peacefully and is constant in courtesy . ... A saint shuns that which is unclean or degrading and avoids excess even of that which is good. Perhaps above all, a saint is reverent. Reverence for the Lord, for the earth He created, for leaders, for the dignity of others, for the law, for the sanctity of life, for chapels and other buildings, are all evidences of saintly attitudes.\\" Informal and abbreviated names Since its founding, church leaders have resisted attempts to apply informal or abbreviated names to the LDS Church. Because of the belief in the Book of Mormon among Joseph Smith's followers, in the 1830s people outside the church began to refer to its members as \\"Mormonites\\" or \\"Mormons\\" and the church as the \\"Mormon Church\\". Smith and other church leaders considered these terms to be derogatory and inappropriate. Concerning these names, a church newspaper editorialized in 1834: > Others may call themselves by their own, or by other names, and have the > privilege of wearing them without our changing them or attempting so to do; > but we do not accept the above title, nor shall we wear it as our name, > though it may be lavished out upon us double to what it has heretofore > been.\\"\\"The Saints\\", Evening and Morning Star, vol. 2, no. 20, pp. 158–59 > (May 1834) (italics and bold in original). Today, it remains common for individuals and media outside of the church to refer to it as the \\"Mormon Church\\". Church leaders have resisted these practices and have instructed the members of the church to not refer to the church in these ways.George Albert Smith, Conference Report (April 1948) p. 160: \\"Don't let the Lord down by calling this the Mormon Church. He didn't call it the Mormon Church. It is all right for us to believe in the Book of Mormon. He expects us to do that, but he told us what to call this Church.\\"Harold B. Lee, \\"The Way to Eternal Life\\", Ensign, November 1971: \\"When [the Lord] revealed the name by which the Church was to be called, he used some interesting expressions. ... He didn't say Mormon Church; he didn't say LDS Church, but the clear, firm, unequivocal statement, 'even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.'\\"Marion G. Romney, \\"We, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\", Ensign, May 1979: \\"Members of the Church do not resent being referred to as Mormons, nor does the Church resent being referred to as the Mormon church. As we have said, however, it is not the correct name of the Church. Its correct name is ... 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints'\\".Member–Missionary Class—Instructor's Guide (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1982) p. 2: \\"We feel that some may be misled by the too frequent use of the term 'Mormon Church'\\".Russell M. Nelson, \\"'Thus Shall My Church Be Called'\\", Ensign, May 1990: \\"Note carefully the language of the Lord. He did not say, 'Thus shall my church be named.' He said, 'Thus shall my church be called.' ... Before any other name is considered to be a legitimate substitute, the thoughtful person might reverently consider the feelings of the Heavenly Parent who bestowed that name.\\"Boyd K. Packer, \\"What Every Elder Should Know—and Every Sister as Well: A Primer on Principles of Priesthood Government\\", Ensign, February 1993: \\"Rather than using 'Mormon Church,' we should call the Church by its name—The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 'for thus,' the Lord told us in a revelation, 'shall my church be called in the last days.'\\"Dallin H. Oaks, \\"'Another Testament of Jesus Christ'\\", Ensign, March 1994: \\"The First Presidency has requested that we not refer to ourselves as 'the Mormon Church' but by the name the Lord gave his church by revelation: 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'\\".\\"Church should be called by its revealed name\\" [editorial], Church News, February 17, 2001.First Presidency (Gordon B. Hinckley, Thomas S. Monson, and James E. Faust), \\"Letter to Members of the Church\\", February 23, 2001: \\"The use of the revealed name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is increasingly important in our responsibility to proclaim the name of the Savior throughout all the world. Accordingly, we ask that when we refer to the Church we use its full name wherever possible.\\"Boyd K. Packer, \\"Guided by the Holy Spirit\\", Liahona, May 2011: \\"Obedient to revelation, we call ourselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rather than the Mormon Church. It is one thing for others to refer to the Church as the Mormon Church or to us as Mormons; it is quite another for us to do so.\\"M. Russell Ballard, \\"The Importance of a Name\\", Liahona, November 2011: \\"While Mormon is not the full and correct name of the Church, and even though it was originally given by our detractors during our early years of persecution, it has become an acceptable nickname when applied to members rather than the institution. We do not need to stop using the name Mormon when appropriate, but we should continue to give emphasis to the full and correct name of the Church itself. In other words, we should avoid and discourage the term 'Mormon Church.'\\"M. Russell Ballard, \\"Following Up\\", Liahona, May 2014: \\"[T]he Lord makes clear that [the full name of the church] is not only a formal title but also the name by which His Church is to be called. Given His clear declaration, we should not refer to the Church by any other name, such as 'Mormon Church' or 'LDS Church.'\\"Russell M. Nelson, \\"The Correct Name of the Church\\", Liahona, November 2018: \\"What's in a name or, in this case, a nickname? When it comes to nicknames of the Church, such as the 'LDS Church,' the 'Mormon Church,' or the 'Church of the Latter-day Saints,' the most important thing in those names is the absence of the Savior's name. To remove the Lord's name from the Lord's Church is a major victory for Satan. When we discard the Savior's name, we are subtly disregarding all that Jesus Christ did for us—even His Atonement.\\" In 2001, the church issued a \\"style guide\\" on its name—which it expanded in 2018—in which the church requested that those writing about it adhere to the following guidelines. > In the first reference, the full name of the Church is preferred: \\"The > Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\" When a shortened reference is > needed, the terms \\"the Church\\" or the \\"Church of Jesus Christ\\" are > encouraged. The \\"restored Church of Jesus Christ\\" is also accurate and > encouraged. While the term \\"Mormon Church\\" has long been publicly applied to > the Church as a nickname, it is not an authorized title, and the Church > discourages its use. Thus, please avoid using the abbreviation \\"LDS\\" or the > nickname \\"Mormon\\" as substitutes for the name of the Church, as in \\"Mormon > Church,\\" \\"LDS Church,\\" or \\"Church of the Latter-day Saints.\\" Since the release of the new style guide media in Utah, including the church- owned Deseret News, KSL-TV, and KSL radio, tend to use \\"Latter-day Saints\\" when referring to the church in headlines. On publication of the 2001 style guide, The New York Times reported that the release of the style guide recommendations was a \\"'deliberate reaffirmation' of a long effort in favor of wider use of the church's full title\\". Apostle Dallin H. Oaks told the Times that \\"church leaders decided it was possible to begin using the abbreviated name of Church of Jesus Christ because no other major Christian body in the United States had laid claim to it.\\"Gustav Niebuhr, \\"Adapting 'Mormon' to Emphasize Christianity\\", The New York Times, February 19, 2001. Jan Shipps, an expert on the LDS Church, suggested that the continuing efforts of the church to emphasize its full name reflects the long-standing desire of members of the church that their beliefs \\"be understood as a Christian tradition.\\" In August 2018, church president Russell M. Nelson asked members of the church and others to cease using the terms \\"LDS\\", \\"Mormon\\", and \\"Mormonism\\" to refer to the church, its membership, or its belief system, and instead to call the church by its full and official name. Subsequent to this announcement, the church's premier vocal ensemble, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, was officially renamed and became the \\"Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square\\". Reaction to the name change policy in the media, by the general public, and even among church members has been mixed, with the preferred second–reference terms (such as \\"the Church of Jesus Christ\\" and \\"the restored Church of Jesus Christ\\") generally being shunned except by the church's own adherents.

Under this system, which first went into effect during the 2012 election year, all candidates will appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. In the primary, voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. The top two finishers, regardless of party, then advance to face each other in the general election in November. The 2014 elections for statewide offices also coincided with those for all of California's seats to the House of Representatives, all of the seats of the State Assembly, all even-numbered seats of the State Senate, and statewide ballot propositions. The primary election was held on June 3, and the general election on November 4. Although the general election saw the California Republican Party lose every statewide election (including the gubernatorial race), the party did make gains in both houses of the California State Legislature, with a net gain of four seats in the Assembly and two seats in the Senate. In both cases, the Republican gains ended the supermajorities of the California Democratic Party in those chambers.

It also eliminates the reimbursement for the costs of such compliance.http://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2014/primary/pdf/41-title-summ- analysis.pdf Supporters argued for the need for such open public access, while opponents disagreed with provisions that would impose the costs of compliance upon the local governments involved instead of the state. = November general election = The following propositions have qualified for the November ballot: * Proposition 1 - Passed *: The Safe, Clean, and Reliable Water Supply Act is a legislatively referred statute that authorizes bonds to upgrade California's water system. The original bill was going to be appear on the November 2010 ballot, but the California Legislature postponed the vote until now. This measure was then originally numbered as Proposition 43, but on August 13, the legislature passed a revised version of the proposal for the 2014 ballot to address issues of the ongoing statewide drought, and numbered this new one as Proposition 1. This updated proposal authorizes $7.12 billion in general obligation bonds, and reallocates $425 million of unused bond authority from prior water bond acts, for various state water supply infrastructure projects. Supporters believed that this will help provide safe and reliable supplies of water to farms, businesses and communities, especially during the current drought. Opponents argued that the proposed specific projects in the initiative are misplaced, saying that there is too much emphasis on building new dams, which does not really help to relieve the drought. * Proposition 2 - Passed *:This legislative constitutional amendment makes several changes relating to state's reserve policy. It, among others, establishes a replacement version of the Budget Stabilization Account (first enacted per Proposition 58 in 2004), in which it will annually receive 1.5% of the estimated amount of General Fund revenues for each respective fiscal year. The Act also creates another reserve fund for public schools funding (as mandated per Proposition 98 in 1988) called the Public School System Stabilization Account. This measure was then originally numbered as Proposition 44, but was then re-numbered as Proposition 2. Supporters argued that this provides a strong rainy day fund, while opponents disagreed (among others) with provisions setting a maximum amount of reserves that school districts could keep at the local level. * Proposition 45 - FailedTracy Seipel and Jessica Calefati for the Mercury News. Nov. 4, 2014 California voters reject Propositions 45, 46, 48; pass 47 *:Under this initiative, any health insurance rate change will need to be approved by the state's Insurance Commissioner before it can take effect. Any health insurer requesting such approval will need to provide information to justify their rate changes. The measure also provides procedures for public notice, disclosure, hearing, and subsequent judicial review for this approval process; it was different than similar states in allowing members of the public to sue the commissioner over approved rate hikes.Ian Lovett for the New York Times. Oct. 29, 2014. California’s Proposition 45 Would Offer Public a Say on Health Insurance Rates Supporters believed that this will stop price gouging. Opponents were concerned about giving that much power to the Insurance Commissioner, who as an elected politician could be easily influenced be special interest groups. * Proposition 46 - Failed *:This initiative will require the regular drug and alcohol testing of doctors. Administration of this will be given to the California Medical Board. Doctors will also be required to report any other doctor suspected of being under the influence while on duty. In addition, doctors will be required to check the state's CURES (Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System) prescription drug history database before prescribing certain controlled substances to patients. Furthermore, the $250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages in medical negligence lawsuits will be increased to account for inflation. Supporters argued that this will reduce medical negligence, while opponents were concerned that the cap increase in medical negligence lawsuits will eventually lead to higher health care costs. * Proposition 47 - Passed *:This initiative downgrades the sentencing classification, from felonies to misdemeanors, for the crimes of petty theft, receiving stolen property, and forging/writing bad checks when the value or amount involved is $950 or less. However, a person who has a previous conviction for crimes such as rape, murder or child molestation or is a registered sex offender will still get a felony sentence. In addition, people currently serving felony sentences for these crimes will be re-sentenced unless a court determines that they are an unreasonable public safety risk. The resulting net savings in the state's criminal justice system will then be applied to a new \\"Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund\\" for mental health and drug treatment programs, K-12 schools, and crime victims. Supporters argued that this will reduce spending and government waste in the state's overcrowded prisons; opponents argued that this could potentially release over 10,000 prisoners, reduce penalties for stealing guns and sex crimes, and overburden the state justice system. * Proposition 48 - Failed *:This was a referendum on Assembly Bill 277. Passed by the legislature and signed by the governor in July 2013, it ratified gaming compacts with the Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians and the Wiyot Tribe. Under the compacts, the Northfork tribe were permitted to build a casino with 2000 slot machines in Madera County on land that was accepted into federal trust for gaming, instead of building one on their reservation near Yosemite. The Wiyot Tribe would have then receive a percentage of the revenue from the Northfork's casino, in exchange for not building one of their own on their land near the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The tribes were also given exemptions to the California Environmental Quality Act \\"in deference to tribal sovereignty\\". Supporters of the compacts argued that the proposed casino will bring jobs and tax money, as well as avoid potentially negative environmental impact in both Yosemite and Humboldt Bay; opponents said that this would have paved the way for massive off-reservation casinos. * ~~Proposition 49~~ \\\\- Removed from the ballot by order of the California Supreme Court *:Originally put on the ballot by the state legislature, Proposition 49 would have been non-binding advisory question presented to voters, asking if the U.S. Congress should propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the government is prohibited from restricting campaign contributions and other political independent expenditures by corporations, associations, or labor unions. This proposition alone would have no binding legal effect, and it will only be submitted to Congress as a formal request; under Article Five of the U.S. Constitution, the process for amending the Constitution can only be initiated by either Congress or a national convention assembled at the request of the legislatures of at least two-thirds (at present 34) of the states. On August 11, the California Supreme Court ordered that the measure be pulled from the November ballot pending further state constitutional review: at issue is that the state legislature has no defined specific power to place such advisory measures on the ballot. Local races Local races included: * A runoff in the San Diego mayoral special election was held on February 11. The special election was necessary following the resignation of Bob Filner on August 30, 2013. A primary election was held on November 19, 2013. Since no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, a runoff election was held between the top two vote-getters on February 11. In the runoff, Republican Kevin Faulconer defeated Democratic candidate David Alvarez. * The San Jose mayoral election will determine the successor to incumbent Democratic Mayor Chuck Reed, who is term-limited out of office. A primary election was held on June 3. As no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election will be held between the top two vote- getters, Dave Cortese and Sam Liccardo, on November 4.

Cantacuzino, also known as Costache Cantacozino or Costandin Cantacuzino (transitional Cyrillic: Кonстanтin Кanтaкozino; 1790s–1877), was the Caimacam (Regent) of Wallachia in September 1848–June 1849, appointed directly by the Ottoman Empire. A member of the Cantacuzino family, he had emerged as a leader of the conservative boyardom during the Regulamentul Organic period. As a commander in the Wallachian militia, he organized in 1831 the first elections for Bucharest's Town Council, and subsequently served as one of the Bucharest Governors. He first played a major part in national government from 1837 to 1842, when he served Prince Alexandru II Ghica as Postelnic and Logothete. During that interval, he clashed with his own brother Grigore Cantacuzino, who sided with the liberal current. Falling out of favor with the Russian Empire, Cantacuzino was deposed ahead of Ghica himself, and was an unsuccessful candidate in the princely election of December 1842. After years in self-imposed exile, Cantacuzino returned with the Ottoman Army in September 1848, helping to quell the 1848 Revolution—although his own son, Ion C. Cantacuzino, had been active within the revolutionary movement. Supervised by Fuad Pasha, Constantin sent the revolutionary leadership, including his immediate predecessors, into exile. He then oversaw the imprisonment and mistreatment of various others, being allegedly responsible for the death in custody of writer Ion Catina. He also disarmed the rebel forces, while restoring both Regulamentul and its symbols of power, as well as reintroducing slavery. Cantacuzino resigned when Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei took over as Prince, but remained active within Știrbei's successive governments, being granted the office of Great Vornic. He opposed the Prince's views on agrarian reform, taking an ultra-conservative stance which favored indentured servitude for Wallachian farmers. Throughout the early 1850s, Cantacuzino actively sought the crown of Wallachia for himself, championing Ottoman loyalism. His in-law Nicolae Mavros also attempted to make him ruler of both Danubian Principalities. Cantacuzino's final moment in power was in late July 1854, during an interregnum caused by the Crimean War. He became the president of an Administrative Council created by Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov just before the Russian withdrawal from Wallachia. The Ottomans then recognized him as head of a caretaker government, jointly with Constantin Năsturel-Herescu, although both resigned after Știrbei's second return that September. After rallying with a larger conservative coalition, he served a final ministerial term in 1856, and was a minor contender in the princely election of 1859, also taking a seat in the Ad hoc Divan. While the Caimacam spent the remainder of his life abroad, his sons Ion and Adolf remained active in the administration of the United Principalities. Constantin was the father-in-law of General Gheorghe Manu, as well as the grandfather of microbiologist Ioan Cantacuzino and of poet Scarlat Cantacuzino. Biography =Early life= Of distant Greek origins, the Cantacuzinos had reached prominence in both Wallachia and Moldavia, which were governed as tributary states of the Ottoman Empire. According to diverging accounts, Constantin was born in 1791,Bezviconi, p. 82 1793,Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 276 or \\"about 1798\\".Rizo-Rangabé, p. 26 His father was the Clucer Gheorghe (Iordache) Cantacuzino (1747–1803), grandson of Constantin I Cantacuzino; through his two paternal great-grandparents, Constantin descended from Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu and Prince Radu Șerban.Rizo-Rangabé, pp. 17–18, 24–26 Constantin was born from Gheorghe's marriage to Maricuța, daughter of Ban Ștefan Pârșcoveanu. The couple had another son, Grigore (1800–1849), who also served as Wallachia's Vornic.Rizo- Rangabé, pp. 25–26. See also Bezviconi, p. 82 Cantacuzino's involvement with the Wallachian administration began during the late stages of the Phanariote era, when both Principalities were being Hellenized. He first became a titled boyar in 1813, under Prince John Caradja, when he was appointed Serdar of the Wallachian military forces; in 1820, he was an Aga, or head of Wallachia's police.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 276–277 In 1821, following the Greek War of Independence and the anti-Phanariote uprising, he and his family took refuge in the Austrian Empire, joining a colony of boyars in Corona (Brașov).Filitti, pp. 62–65; Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 An anonymous letter, tentatively dated to April 1821, cites him as one of the boyars attracted into the anti- Phanariote faction of this diaspora, alongside Grigore Brâncoveanu, Scarlat Rosetti and Alexandru Vilara.Filitti, pp. 64–65 The Aga had returned home by 1822, the year when he probably married Zoe Slătineanu, from whom he had his four children.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 In 1828, under Grigore IV Ghica, he issued the first-ever decree regulating Wallachia's police, which also marked a first step in its transition to modern metropolitan law enforcement.Dana Cadeschi, \\"Câteva aspecte privind aplicarea Legii pentru autorizarea comunelor urbane de a avea poliție municipală (1878)\\", in Annals of the University of Bucharest. Political Science Series, Vol. 3, 2001, p. 45 That year, he was also appointed as the first ethnic Romanian to serve as Efor (Curator) of the Wallachian theaters.Potra (1990 I), p. 524 Cantacuzino's political climb was accelerated during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828, when he welcomed the Imperial Russian Army and became a protege of Governor Pavel Kiselyov. Following the Treaty of Adrianople, both Principalities became protectorates of Russia under Ottoman suzerainty. In 1831, Cantacuzino was Vornic of the Wallachian Police in Bucharest. In this capacity, together with Gheorghe Bibescu he organized the very first elections for the Town Council, which took place in November 1831. When this was convened, he also presented himself as a candidate for an executive function (mădulăr), earning endorsements from 56 out of 80 councilors, and emerging as one of five town governors.Constantin Moisil, \\"Primul sfat orășenesc al Bucureștilor\\", in Bucureștii Vechi, Vols. I–IV, 1935, pp. 136–154 Still serving as Aga in 1832, Cantacuzino was directly involved in the hunt for brigand Ioniță Tunsu.Potra (1990 II), p. 75 Kiselyov also assigned him to committees which supervised the paving and beautification of Bucharest's streets; his colleagues were Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei and Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea.Potra (1990 I), pp. 230, 292 With Iancu Văcărescu and Costache Golescu, he also collected funds for the establishment of a national theater.Bogdan-Duică, p. 31 His own townhouse, located outside Lipscani, was fitted with a bathhouse—one of the few private ones existing in 1830s Wallachia.Potra (1990 I), p. 265 In parallel, Cantacuzino also ran in Wallachia's first legislative election, taking one of the 19 Ordinary Assembly seats reserved for the high-ranking boyars. Ștefan Grigorescu, \\"Regulamentul organic și primele alegeri din Olt și Romanați\\", in Memoria Oltului și Romanaților, Vol. V, Issue 2, February 2016, pp. 75–76 After the election of 1836, there were protracted debates between the National Party and the conservative boyars. A ministerial crisis was finally ended in June 1837, when Cantacuzino agreed to enter a cabinet that also included his rival Știrbei.Iorga (1910), p. 29 He served as Postelnic or Secretary of State, and was also Logothete or Justice Minister.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277; Tiron, p. 93 He contributed to the pacification of Brăila in July 1841, signing Prince Alexandru II Ghica's proclamation to the rebellious Bulgarians.Andronescu et al., pp. 86–88 Acting on Ghica's behalf, he welcomed at Calafat the Ottoman inspector, Hüseyin Pasha, with whom he discussed means of tackling Russian intrigues in Wallachia.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 123–128 By 1842 Logothete Cantacuzino had been received into three orders of chivalry by Wallachia's protective powers: he had the Order of Saint Anna, Second Class; the Order of Saint Vladimir, Fourth Class; and the Ottoman Order of Glory.Tiron, pp. 93, 99 His friendship with Kiselyov afforded him a say in the legislative framework of Wallachia, codified as Regulamentul Organic. From within the Ordinary Assembly, Cantacuzino supported tagging the controversial \\"additional article\\" to Regulamentul, and thus revealed himself as a vocal backer of Russian influence in the Principalities.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 This pitted him against the National Party, whose leaders included Emanoil Băleanu, Ioan Câmpineanu, and his own brother, Grigore Cantacuzino.Bogdan- Duică, pp. 132, 134; Xenopol & Kretzulescu, p. 12 =Bibescu's reign and 1848 Revolution= Participants in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848 prosecuted by boyars. Political allegory in Ghimpele, 1868 Constantin was still a member of the Assembly following the election of 1841. However, on May 20, 1842, Russian commissioner Alexander Osipovich Duhamel obtained that he be deposed as Postelnic and replaced with Știrbei.Andronescu et al., pp. 90–91 Cantacuzino presented himself as a candidate in the princely election of December, but only managed 41 of 188 votes;Andronescu et al., pp. 91–94 the winner was Bibescu. Initially, Bibescu promoted him, assigning him office as an Efor of the Wallachian schools, jointly with Filipescu-Vulpea and Mihalache Ghica.Potra (1963), pp. 138–139, 166–167, 191, 349–351 Like his brother Grigore (who sat in the Assembly's committee for educational review), Constantin was a reactionary who objected to educational reform.Potra (1963), pp. 166–167 Still present in the Assembly in 1843, he soon rallied with the anti-Bibescu opposition, blocking his legislative projects.Bibescu, pp. 69–70, 128–130 He later chose to expatriate himself,Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 although his family remained behind. His eldest son, Ion C. (Iancu), was by then married to Maria, daughter of the numismatist and Russian spy Nicolae Mavros, making Constantin in-laws with politician Ion Ghica and with the Kotzebue family.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 208, 254. See also Bogdan-Duică, pp. 37–38, 183; Florescu, pp. 381–382; Panaitescu, pp. 36, 73, 146, 148; Parusheva, pp. 159–160, 161 In June 1848, Wallachia's liberal revolution toppled Bibescu and installed a Provisional Government. Two of Cantacuzino's three sons, Ion and Grigore, were enthusiastic participants in the events.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 160, 270. See also Xenopol & Kretzulescu, pp. 266–267 In the early stages, both Constantin and his Mavros daughter-in- law helped the radical Nicolae Bălcescu evade police round-ups at Telega.Panaitescu, pp. 73, 147–148 On June 11, the day of revolutionary victory, he wrote to Bălcescu a congratulatory and \\"rather humble\\" letter.Dan Berindei, \\"Contradicțiile de clasă în desfășurarea revoluției muntene din 1848\\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie, Vol. XI, Issue 3, 1958, p. 36 During the subsequent weeks, the new regime sought to obtain recognition from the Sublime Porte. The Cantacuzino home was also where the Provisional Government, represented by Ioan Voinescu II, welcomed Suleiman Pasha in August.Albini, pp. 130–131 In September, following its radicalization, the revolutionary movement was repressed by an Ottoman–Russian expedition; at the time, Cantacuzino Sr had again fled for safety to Corona. On September 21, he rode back to Bucharest, presenting his services to the Ottoman Army under Fuad Pasha; reportedly, he had been called back by Duhamel.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 179–180, 277. See also Ghica, pp. 33, 819 Favored by both Russian and Ottoman overseers,Ghica, pp. 107–108; Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 he was subsequently appointed Caimacam by Fuad, on September 22. The short ceremony was witnessed by Ion Cantacuzino, who reportedly shouted out: \\"Father, do not accept this sort of offices!\\"Albini, p. 148 Constantin's ascendancy led to the mass arrest of revolutionary leaders, who were then kept under armed guard at Cotroceni Monastery.Albini, pp. 147–148; Ghica, pp. 53, 643; Iorga (1939), pp. 703–704; Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 180, 182, 276; Xenopol & Kretzulescu, pp. 264–267 His acts became the topic of a protest, submitted to Âli Pasha, the Ottoman Foreign Minister, by revolutionary agents Ion Ghica and Abdolonyme Ubicini. According to Ghica, Âli informed them that Cantacuzino had only been appointed Caimacam because Reshid Pasha had mistaken him for his more reformist brother.Ghica, pp. 54–55 By then, the Revolution's triumvirate of Princely Lieutenants had dispersed: though Christian Tell and Nicolae Golescu suggested armed resistance, Ion Heliade Rădulescu resigned and retreated to his home, leaving the palace to be taken by Ottoman soldiers.Albini, p. 150 On September 24, Fuad and the Caimacam issued a deportation order for some of the core figures of the previous regime. The list included Bălcescu, Heliade, Voinescu II, and Nicolae Golescu, alongside Costache Aristia, Cezar Bolliac, Ion C. Brătianu, Dimitrie Brătianu, Ștefan Golescu, C. A. Rosetti, and Ioasaf Znagoveanu.Albini, pp. 155–156; Dumitru Popovici, \\"Santa Cetate\\" între utopie și poezie, p. 57. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Istorie Literară și Folclor, 1935. . See also Ghica, pp. 36–37; Potra (1990 I), p. 452 Cantacuzino's other preoccupation as Caimacam was an investigation into looting and arson by rebellious peasants, for which purpose he founded and led a specialized boyar committee.Iorga (1910), pp. 54–55 In tandem, he and Fuad ordered Neofit II to expel revolutionary sympathizers from the ranks of his Wallachian Orthodox Bishopric.Albini, p. 190 Assigning the direct supervision of education to Băleanu, Filipescu-Vulpea, and Petrache Poenaru, he initiated the purge of radical teachers, and, on November 1, personally ordered for all schools to be shut down.Potra (1963), pp. 166–169, 195, 219 Ordering the remnants of the revolutionary army, under Gheorghe Magheru, to disband,Albini, p. 159 he took hold of the arsenal of weapons collected by the deposed Lieutenants. He sent these arms to the Transylvanian Saxons, who used them in battle against the Hungarian State.Ghica, p. 188 The Caimacam stood accused of orchestrating the ransacking of Heliade's homeBogdan-Duică, p. 194 and of various acts of cruelty, including being seen as responsible for the prison death of poet Ion Catina, which his regime tried to conceal. Catina's brother was allegedly forced to deny that was the case, in a newspaper notice which also addressed thanks to the Russian army.Albini, pp. 210–211 According to a Heliade disciple, Nicolae Rusu Locusteanu, the new regime imposed an \\"executioner\\" in each Wallachian county.Iorga (1939), p. 709 Though he endorsed additional clampdown measures, Cantacuzino was a moderate in this respect: Colonel Grigore Lăcusteanu, who organized the round-up, recalls that Fuad ordered him to limit the scope of his investigations, and also to submit to the Caimacams every command.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 202–203 His son Ion was released from Cotroceni, and then successfully intervened to free another revolutionary, Nicolae Crețulescu.Xenopol & Kretzulescu, pp. 266–267. See also Albini, p. 151 =Under Știrbei= On September 28, 1848, Cantacuzino and Fuad annulled the abolition of slavery, ordering the emancipated Romanies to return to their masters.Potra (1963), pp. 192–193 The Caimacam also had a direct say in Wallachia's industrialization when, in March 1849, entrepreneur V. G. Browning presented him with designs for a large gristmill and bread factory.Potra (1990 I), pp. 237–238 Additionally, Cantacuzino set aside funds for the restoration of Bucharest's Monument to the Russian Soldiers, which had been nearly completely vandalized during the Revolution.Potra (1990 I), pp. 357–358 His municipal policies blended with repressive measures when he demoted Alexandru Orăscu, previously Bucharest's council architect, and promoted Xavier Vilacrosse.A. Pănoiu, \\"Izvoare. Un memoriu adresat de arh. Al. Orăscu Căimăcămiei Țării Românești în 1848\\", in Buletinul Comisiei Monumentelor Istorice, Vol. II, Issue 3, 1991, p. 64 He also staged an inquiry into Iacob Melic's activity as a revolutionary architect, ordering him to pay back sums he owed to the city government of Bucharest and to Clucer Barbu Catargiu, and sequestering some of his assets.Potra (1990 I), pp. 452–453 Lăcusteanu's attempt to arrest Melic's father-in-law, Hagi Nazaretian, was curbed by a riot of the local Armenians.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 201–202 Cantacuzino intended to make his status permanent by being recognized as Prince. This project was backed by Nicolae Mavros, who also wanted Cantacuzino to take the Moldavian crown. Nevertheless, Mavros also proposed as a better candidate the Duke of Leuchtenberg.Bogdan-Duică, pp. 36–37 During 1849, the exiles continued to maneuver against Wallachian reactionaries: writing from Istanbul, Bălcescu insisted that the Caimacam was a Russophile who \\"feigned friendship with the Turks.\\"Panaitescu, p. 100 During the Cantacuzino regency, Wallachia was forced to accept a loan of 300,000 rubles, most of which went to paying for the upkeep of the Russian occupation force—meaning that Russia turned a profit from the expedition.Albini, p. 197 The national militia was at the time placed under a Russian commander, Anton Horbatsky (Horbațki).Paul Cernovodeanu, \\"Români și ruși: politică și încuscriri\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 1996, p. 65 Cantacuzino's mandate expired in June 1849.Lăcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 277 His attempt to be recognized as Prince was frustrated, as Russia imposed Știrbei on the throne. That moment marked the peak of Duhamel's participation in Wallachian affairs, as Știrbei soon turned against his Russian backers.Iorga (1910), p. 32 His bipartisan cabinet included Cantacuzino, purposefully selected among his rivals to serve as Logothete.Iorga (1910), pp. 49, 139 On August 23, he was advanced to Great Vornic and cited as \\"honest and faithful to His Highness\\".Iorga (1910), p. 139 His 1848 victim Bolliac claimed that Cantacuzino had amassed a fortune from \\"things he stole while in office\\", having also received a prize of 25,000 ducats.Ghica, p. 819 The latter sum was ordered to be paid from the Wallachian treasury by Ottoman Sultan Abdulmejid I, who also granted Cantacuzino a snuffbox encrusted with precious stones.Albini, pp. 221–222 Știrbei took offense with this new duty, and, according to diverging sources, either refused to grant Cantacuzino the sum,Iorga (1910), pp. 49–50 or only paid it in installments.Albini, pp. 221–222 He also signed an order ending Cantacuzino's investigation of the peasant revolt.Iorga (1910), p. 55 The former Caimacam remained involved in the agrarian debates, opposing measures to liberalize transactions between boyars and tenant farmers. Against Știrbei's own recommendations, he supported keeping peasants under a system of leases which closely resembled indentured servitude.Iorga (1910), pp. 57–61 As Știbei's Vornic or Interior Minister in 1849–1850, Cantacuzino introduced more leniency toward imprisoned liberals, assessing pleas for amnesty and reporting on revolutionary Tănasie Macovei's sufferings from scrofula.Pippidi, pp. 330–338 However, he also recommended that the agitator Teodor Borcănescu be arrested and exiled to Poiana Mărului Monastery.Pippidi, p. 332 In June 1851 Cantacuzino and his rival Bibescu were both visiting the French Republic, both of them courting the Wallachian revolutionaries in exile, ostensibly to win their support for their candidacies for the throne. News of this infuriated Bălcescu, who suggested \\"that we kick these slick ciocoi [buzzards] in a certain spot on their bodies.\\"Ghica, p. 594 By November 1850, Maria Mavros- Cantacuzino had also joined Bălcescu in exile, writing back to Vasile Alecsandri about their \\"fraternal intimacy\\".Panaitescu, p. 146 From October 1853, Russia and the Ottoman Empire fought with each other in what became known as the Crimean War. Știrbei left the country and Wallachia's fate remained uncertain. On July 31, 1854, the withdrawing Russian army, under Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov, assigned Wallachia's administration to an Administrative Council, presided upon by Cantacuzino.Cosmin Lucian Gherghe, Emanoil Chinezu – om politic, avocat și istoric, p. 92. Craiova: Sitech, 2009. ; Iorga (1937), p. 355 Immediately after, he wrote to the Duke of Teschen, inviting the Austrian army to occupy Wallachia as a buffer zone.Iorga (1937), p. 355 In early August, Cantacuzino welcomed in his home Halim Pasha, whose small expeditionary force restored an Ottoman presence in Bucharest; Austria's consul Anton Ritter von Laurin was also present.Ciachir, p. 199; Duzinchevici, p. 250; Iorga (1910), pp. 161–162 Presiding over a delegation that also included Câmpineanu and Alexandru II Ghica, Cantacuzino presented Sadyk Pasha and his Ottoman Cossacks with the keys to the city.Duzinchevici, pp. 250–251 Later that month, he similarly welcomed the Austrian troops, under Count Coronini, clearing the Mavros palace to serve as their headquarters.Ciachir, p. 200 =Return to power and later life= Wallachian bird and double-headed eagle of the Cantacuzinos; from Caimacam Canatacuzino's copy of his family's genealogy Again hoping to be made Caimacam or Prince, Cantacuzino also welcomed Omar Pasha and lent him a luxurious carriage.Iorga (1910), p. 163 On August 31, Dervish Ibrahim Pasha partly satisfied Cantacuzino's request, appointing him and Constantin Năsturel-Herescu to lead a provisional government which was to handle affairs until Știrbei's promised return.Ciachir, p. 200; Iorga (1910), pp. 163–167. See also Duzinchevici, p. 251 The new Council also included Ion Cantacuzino and another young boyar, Ioan Alecu Filipescu-Vulpache.Ciachir, p. 200; Iorga (1937), p. 260 According to the memoirs of Sadyk Pasha, the new regime also involved Alexandru Ghica and Câmpineanu; it was primarily pro-Ottoman, fearing Russia and, \\"above all\\", Austria.Duzinchevici, pp. 250, 251, 254 Grigore Cantacuzino was included in this administrative apparatus: with Sadyk and Carol Davila, he took measures to control the cholera epidemic, earning kudos from the Ottoman overseers.Duzinchevici, pp. 254, 255 Constantin Cantacuzino and other \\"old boyars\\" found themselves tactically allied with Heliade and the Golescus in their repeated attempts to prevent Știrbei's return from Austria.Duzinchevici, p. 255 He finally resigned on September 23, when Știrbei appointed an entirely new cabinet.Iorga (1910), pp. 166–167. See also Ciachir, p. 201; Iorga (1937), p. 260 During the following years, he was mainly noted as a patron of the arts. In 1855, he sponsored a debut play by lawyer Ioan Em.

Also a member of the Divan (or Elective Assembly), Constantin validated the election and signed the address which sought to obtain Cuza's recognition as Domnitor.

Early lives Hanzelka was born on 24 December 1920 in Štramberk; Zikmund on 14 February 1919 in Plzeň. Both were deeply interested in foreign countries, nature, travel writing, and adventure stories from childhood onward. In 1938, both began post-secondary studies at the University College of Business in Prague, met, and became good friends. Their studies were delayed when the school was closed during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, forcing their graduation to be postponed until 1946. While at school, they discovered each other's love of travel and developed what they called the \\"5\\" project, referring to the five continents they hoped to visit. While waiting to graduate, they made detailed plans for travel, copying maps and studying their destinations from historical, meteorological, economic, and social perspectives. Both took university Russian lessons, but also studied to prepare for international travel: Hanzelka spoke German and French and studied Swahili, and Zikmund spoke English, studied Arabic, and had a basic understanding of Italian and Dutch. Travels A Tatra 87 similar to the one used by Hanzelka and Zikmund In 1947, Hanzelka and Zikmund pitched the \\"5\\" project to the automotive company Tatra. The company, impressed by the plan and seizing the opportunity to promote its vehicles, decided to sponsor the trip, and gave them a silver Tatra 87. After three months of gaining experience with the car at the Tatra factory in Kopřivnice, the duo set out on their first trip. It was a continuous three-and-a-half-year voyage through Africa and Latin America, from April 1947 to November 1950 and covering 44 countries and 111,000 kilometers. Having traveled from the north coast of Africa to Mexico, the duo returned home, but their country had greatly changed during their absence. The 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état resulted in a change of government and public life. Initially, the government treated Hanzelka and Zikmund well; though most Czechs and Slovaks were barred from going abroad, the duo were allowed to publish the fruits of their travels because their descriptions were not seen as politically threatening. They were able to launch a second trip, running five and a half years continuously from 1959 to 1964, taking them to Eastern Europe, Asia, and various Pacific islands with two prototypes of the Tatra 805 truck. On this trip, the duo reported on Indonesia, Irian Jaya, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Throughout their travels, both captured still photographs and films as well as writing articles. In addition, they wrote a weekly radio program about their travels for Czechoslovak Radio, which became one of the most popular on the station; since they lacked the means to broadcast from the locations, they simply wrote the scripts and sent them back to Czechoslovakia, where their voices were recreated by two actors. Their works of travel literature include eleven full- length books full of photographs and descriptions of the economic and socio- political situations of the places they visited, four picture books, three children's books, and 150 short travel documentary films. Their books were also serialized in the newspaper Mladá fronta. In Czechoslovakia, where the tight control of the Communist government made it impossible for most Czechs and Slovaks to travel out of the country, the works of Hanzelka and Zikmund offered a rare chance for vicarious escape into exotic climes. They became the best-selling writers of twentieth-century Eastern Europe; their books sold 6,525,000 copies in the Soviet Bloc and were translated into eleven languages. They became a national institution in the Czech lands, and were equally popular in Soviet Union, where the premier Nikita Khrushchev demanded of his aides that the three volumes of Hanzelka and Zikmund's Africa: Dreams and Reality be on his bedside table no matter where he went. Hanzelka and Zikmund visited 83 countries in total. Banning and aftermath Hanzelka and Zikmund had initially planned to travel around the world, but they ran afoul of the Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev in May 1965, when, as part of their second trip, they delivered a detailed and critical report of the poverty and political corruption they saw in the Soviet Union in 1963 and 1964. The Czechoslovak government, still under Soviet control, blacklisted the duo for the report. They were banned by the government from publishing, but went on writing in samizdat. They got into further trouble with the government for their anti-Communist activities during the Prague Spring in 1968 and for Hanzelka's signing of Charter 77. Their last book, Ceylon: Paradise Without Angels, was in preparation with the state-owned printer and had already received 120,000 advance orders when it was banned. Hanzelka and Zikmund shared the fate of other Czechoslovak dissidents in the post-Prague Spring era, living meagerly for 21 years in menial jobs until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Hanzelka was one of the dissident speakers at Wenceslas Square when the revolution began on 19 November. With the fall of the Communist government, Hanzelka and Zikmund were again acclaimed as heroes, with extensive interviews and rebroadcasts of their films. Life of Dreams and Reality, a new book about their travel experiences, was published on 22 April 1997, the fiftieth anniversary of the start of their first trip. In 1989 Zikmund finally completed the around-the-world plan by visiting Australia. Hanzelka, though still active politically, was too ill to join him. He retired to a small farmhouse in the south of Bohemia, where he continued to write political criticism of government corruption, this time in the new atmosphere of free-market capitalism in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Hanzelka died on 15 February 2003. As of his 100th birthday in 2019, Zikmund lives in Zlín, where a museum commemorates the duo's travels with a large archive of memorabilia, including travel journals, 700 newspaper articles, 120,000 photographs, 1,290 taped radio broadcasts, and souvenirs from around the world. In 2005, when an exhibition of 160 of their photographs was presented at the Old Royal Palace of the Prague Castle, Zikmund commented: \\"Jiří, my best friend in my life, he passed away two years ago, unfortunately. But I still live with him because every day something happens which is bound, is connected with his name. So actually we are still two.\\" Hanzelka and Zikmund remain well-known and well-regarded in the Czech Republic for their travels and works. The original Tatra 87 they used on their first trip was added to the Czech national cultural heritage list in 2005, and is on display at the National Technical Museum in Prague. In October 2014, President Miloš Zeman awarded Zikmund with the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. On the suggestion of the astronomer Jiří Grygar, the main-belt asteroid 10173 Hanzelkazikmund was named for the duo in 1995.

Carter is recuperating at his private lodge in Indiana when he is summoned by AXE chief, David Hawk, to uncover a traitor within the organization. Hawk reveals that Raymond Lee Bennett – a minor civil servant working in AXE – has apparently murdered his wife and disappeared only a few weeks after his retirement. His wife's body was discovered in a secret basement room in their house. Further background checks reveals that Bennett has a photographic memory and is capable of recalling every classified document he has had access to in the last 30 years. AXE fears that Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies also intend to capture Bennett to exploit his knowledge. The FBI traces Bennett to Cologne. Carter follows with orders to get Bennett dead or alive. He tracks Bennett to the Hotel Dom. Carter breaks into Bennett's room intending to kill him. Instead he discovers the bodies of a Chinese and Russian agent. Bennett and his female companion have escaped. Carter traces their steps over the rooftops of buildings adjacent to the hotel and discovers the body of his German AXE contact. Carter allows himself to be captured by three Russian agents on his tail. Carter is tortured in a warehouse by Colonel Zoe Kalinski – a sadistic MGB agent. She is only interested in finding Bennett and the Yellow Widow – a known Chinese agent and the woman with whom Bennett has escaped. Under duress, Carter gives a false location for the Yellow Widow’s hideout. Carter escapes from the Russian agents and attempts to pick up the trail of Bennett and the Yellow Widow. Carter suspects that the Yellow Widow and Bennett will try to enter China through North Korea. AXE agents stake out the ports of South Korea. Carter picks up the trail again in Pusan where a disguised Bennett and Yellow Widow intend to take the train to Seoul. Zoe Kalinski and her Russian colleagues have followed Carter to Pusan. They board the train and capture Carter. Carter escapes and immediately attempts to capture the Yellow Widow and Bennett in their train compartment. The train is halted by bandits loyal to the Yellow Widow. The Yellow Widow and Bennett escape and run down the tracks. The Yellow Widow is killed in crossfire and Bennett falls down the embankment. Carter captures him and together they head into the Korean hinterland. They stumble upon the bandits' secret hideout. Carter steals some weapons and rigs booby traps to surprise the bandits when they return from besieging the train. Carter sets the camp on fire which attracts the attention of Jimmy Kim and Pok who have been searching the environs of the train for him in a spotter plane. The plane crash-lands. While Carter goes to help the crew Bennett escapes but is attacked and killed by a tiger. Carter, Kim and Pok walk back to the nearest town.

It was Sri Lanka's first republican constitution, and its second since independence in 1948. The constitution changed the country's name to Sri Lanka from Ceylon, and established it as an independent republic. The country was officially designated \\"Republic of Sri Lanka\\", leading to this constitution being known as \\"the 1972 Republican Constitution\\". The constitution was promulgated on 22 May 1972.  History  The arrival of the Portuguese in 1505 and their interest in the island altered the political landscape of the Sri Lankan state: the island had been ruled by seven native kingdoms in succession (at times several concurrently), with the Kingdom of Kotte first coming under Portuguese occupation. The Dutch ended Portuguese influence, and continued colonial occupation on the island from 1640 until 1796, when the British in turn replaced them. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch, the British were eventually able to occupy the entirety of the island as a Crown colony, creating British Ceylon in 1815. With British influence came ideas of democratic principles and governance, including the concept of a constitution- indeed, the Sri Lankan independence movement was notable for demanding self- rule and reform on a constitutional basis rather than through popular movements such as that in neighbouring India. The Dominion of Ceylon gained independence on 4 February 1948, retaining the Monarchy of the United Kingdom as Head of State and adopting the Soulbury Constitution as its constitution. Executive power was nominally vested in the Sovereign of Ceylon, while legislative powers were vested with a semi-independent parliament. Several perceived weaknesses of the 1947 Soulbury Constitution, however, eventually led to calls for a replacement, particularly from nationalists and the Left, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party's Colvin R. de Silva being a central figure in the movement. The United Front, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, won the 1970 general election with a two-thirds majority. As Prime Minister, Bandaranaike convened a number of committees to draft a new constitution, including a drafting committee chaired by the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Colvin R. de Silva. The resulting document was tabled in parliament, voted on and adopted on 22 May 1972 by a vote of 119 to 16 against.  Impact and criticism  The 1972 constitution paved the way for Sri Lanka to become a republic, cutting the final ties with its colonial past and British influence, and imparted a firm leftist nature to the state, allowing for the heavily socialist economic policies of the Bandaranaike government. The main opposition party at the time, the United National Party (UNP), voted against the constitution's adoption on the following grounds: # Making a particular ideology a constitutional principle, and thereby depriving the people of the right to determine economic policies from time to time at periodic elections, # Including a truncated list of fundamental rights and almost nullifying their effect by making them subject to excessive restrictions and numerous principles of so-called state policy, # Failing to provide a simple and suitable remedy for the violation of a fundamental right, # Preserving laws hitherto in force even if they are inconsistent with fundamental rights, # Departing from the practice of all existing republics of directly or indirectly electing the Head of State, and providing instead for nomination by a political migratory figure, # Giving the members of the first National State Assembly a term of seven years, #Introducing control by the Cabinet of Ministers over the subordinate judiciary, #Depriving the judiciary of the power to determine the constitutional propriety of laws, and #Abandoning the principle of the neutrality of the public service. A key point of criticism levelled at the constitution has centred around the non-inclusive and non-representative nature of its drafting process. The committees tasked with the drafting were overwhelmingly populated with members of the UF: the Steering and Subjects Committee, responsible for drafting resolutions on basic principles to base the new constitution on, consisted of 17 MPs, 12 of whom were cabinet members of the UF government, one member from the UF's minority All Ceylon Tamil Congress partner, one independent representative (also from the ruling coalition), and three opposition MPs (J. R. Jayewardene and Dudley Senanayake from the UNP, and S. J. V. Chelvanayakam from the Federal Party). Moreover, the drafts of the resolutions of basic constitutional principles were drawn up via a process that left the Steering and Subjects Committee with no true powers of its own: # Drafts of resolutions were prepared by a drafting committee under the purview of Colvin R. de Silva's Ministry of Constitutional Affairs, # Draft resolutions were then submitted for vetting and approval by a group of senior SLFP MPs, and the leadership of the LSSP and CP- the two junior partners in the UF coalition, # Vetted resolutions were submitted for formal cabinet approval through a 12-member ministerial sub-committee, and # Finally tabled at meetings of the Steering and Subjects Committee. The Federal Party exited the Constituent Assembly in June 1971, citing these and other reasons. The UNP also made several complaints about the lack of consideration given by the committees to recommendations made by the opposition, and warned from the outset that they would not vote in favour of the final product. In addition, a considerable portion of public feedback was said to have been ignored on the grounds that such recommendations ran contrary to basic principles. Another major point of criticism has been the lack of considerations or safeguards made for the country's minority communities and their basic rights, including religion and language- the new constitution having largely done away with the few such provisions present in the previous one. Overall, the 1972 constitution has been seen as a key turning point for governance in the country, leading to less impartiality throughout the Executive-, Legislative and Judicial systems. Several characteristics of this constitution may be noticed in the newer constitution.

Biography Lea was born in 1946 in Fitzroy and was soon after given up by his biological mother. He was adopted at the age of 13 months, along with another brother and sister, into the famous Darrell Lea family in Toorak. At the hands of his adoptive mother, Lea suffered and ran away from home at the age of 12. After a series of criminal charges in his youth (including being homeless which was a crime under the Vagrancy act) led to stints in boys homes, and finally entered juvenile detention at Turana where he first started to write poetry. His first poem began with a rhyming couplet that was not his own - (forewarned by legends of my youth/i trust not an associate's truth..) and then he completed the poem with his own words which later appeared in Poems from a Peach Melba Hat. He regularly performed this first poem, because like much of his work, it was autobiographical. While in Turana he also discovered the writing of Ezra Pound which he claimed determined the course of his life. Lea entered Pentridge Prison at 17, which he described as the nihilism of Kafka and the horror of Dante. He was released two months into a three-month sentence but he never really recovered. He was also incarcerated in Long Bay and the Goulburn Prison for minor offences. He did not return to prison after he turned 21. After his release, he went on to publish many collections of his work, as well as establishing Eaglemont Press and publishing the poetry of others. He also opened a number of bookshops, specialising in rare books. He was closely associated with the \\"Heide\\" Collective and mentored over thirty years by his close friend, the poet and librarian, Barrett Reid. His final collection of poetry was Nebuchadnezzar, published by \\"Black Pepper Publishing\\" shortly before his death in 2005. Lea's poetry has been widely anthologized., Auslit: The Australian Literature Resource, 21 May 2014 Death On Friday 13 May 2005 Lea died of lung cancer only days after the launch of his final collection. At the time of his death a documentary on his poetry was being filmed by Robert Price and Taylor Coventry and is available to view on Vimeo.

Life Born in London about 1780, he was the second son of Thomas Uwins (died 1806), clerk in the Bank of England, and brother of Thomas Uwins, the artist. After working in London hospitals he graduated with an MD from the University of Edinburgh on 12 September 1803. Returning to London, he held for a short time the post of assistant physician at the Finsbury dispensary, and then established himself at Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. On 22 December 1807 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1815 was elected physician to the City dispensary, and later to the new Finsbury and central dispensary. In 1828 Uwins was appointed physician to the lunatic asylum at Peckham. In later life, through his friend Frederic Hervey Foster Quin, he became one of the first English converts to homeopathy. He encountered opposition, and suffered a breakdown. Uwins died in London at his house in Bedford Row on 22 September 1837, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. Works Uwins published in 1833 A Treatise on those Disorders of the Brain and Nervous System which are usually considered and called Mental. It established his medical reputation.

China  On behalf of King and Talbot, Olyphant arrived in Canton in 1820, where he met the Scottish missionary Robert Morrison. Thereafter he began a long-term involvement with Protestant missionary endeavors in China. Olyphant returned to China following the birth of his son Robert Morrison Olyphant to find the man after whom he had named his son alone in Canton and suffering from chronic depression following the death of his fellow missionary William Milne. Delays by the London Missionary Society in sending Morrison assistance led to Olyphant writing to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) with the news that his ship Roman would be departing for Canton in December 1829, and \\"if a missionary could be sent out in her, the passage should be free.\\" As a result, the chosen individual, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, became the first American Protestant Christian missionary in China. Olyphant offered all subsequent missionaries free passage on his ships and free lodgings in Canton as well as supporting the locally produced newspaper The Canton Register. In addition, Olyphant allowed the physician and missionary Peter Parker to use one of his warehouses as a hospital \\"so that patients could come and go without annoying foreigners by passing through their hongs, or excite the observations of natives by being seen to resort to a foreigner's house, rendered it most suitable for the purpose.\\" On November29, 1834, Olyphant, along with James Matheson, William Wetmore, James Innes, Thomas Fox, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, Karl Gützlaff and John Robert Morrison, formed a committee to inaugurate the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in China. In 1838, Olyphant was elected to the board of the ABCFM. In 1842, Samuel Wells Williams, an American Sinologist, described him as a \\"steady and munificent friend of all efforts for the good of China\\"., dedication  Olyphant & Co.  In 1828, along with Charles N. Talbot, Olyphant founded the trading house Olyphant & Co. in Canton, trading in \\"silk, mattings and fancy articles\\" after their former employer King and Talbot went bankrupt. The new firm was unusual in that it eschewed the opium trade unlike many of its contemporary competitors.  Death  Forced by ill- health to leave China for the US, Olyphant died en route in Cairo, Egypt, on June10, 1851.  Offspring  Olyphant's son Robert Morrison Olyphant joined his father at Olyphant & Co. and was later progressively Assistant President, Vice-President, and for twenty years President of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company (later the Delaware and Hudson Railway).

From its initial involvement in the \\"Old China Trade\\", the firm expanded into other countries including Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Olyphant & Co's business dealings in Peru caused the company to collapse in 1878.  History  The firm was founded in Canton (now known as Guangzhou) by David Olyphant and Charles N. Talbot, after their former employer, King & Talbot went bankrupt. In Canton, the two partners established themselves as supercargoes trading in \\"silk, mattings and fancy articles\\", operating from the No. 1 building of the American factory. Olyphant was a vociferous opponent of the opium trade, and the firm was one of the only large foreign trading firms not to engage in opium smuggling. The firm's anti-opium stance led to its offices becoming known as \\"Zion's Corner\\". Over the next 30 years, the company continued to grow in competition with other traders including Augustine Heard and Company, Russell & Company and Wetmore & Co., opening offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Foochow (now known as Fuzhou) and overseas in Australia and New Zealand. = Morrison Incident = In 1837, Olyphant & Co's ship Morrison made an attempt to repatriate seven shipwrecked Japanese sailors and at the same time open trade with Japan.

As an extension to these dealings with Peru's rulers, Olyphant & Co. agreed to import coolie laborers by steamer from China. However, the firm proved unable to procure the requisite human cargoes, allegedly as a result of jealously on the part of their competition with support from the British government. To the surprise of the mercantile community, the subsequent losses incurred caused Olyphant & Co. to cease trading in late 1878 while owing money to creditors including Drexel, Morgan & Co. and the government of Peru.

During his many years of service the younger Machado advanced rapidly in rank holding many military offices. He commanded the military guards at Mission San Luis Rey and Mission San Diego. He was involved in the founding of the mission stations at Las Flores, Pala and Temecula. In 1808, Machado was married to María Serafina Valdez, the daughter of Eugenio Valdez a fellow soldier from the garrison at Los Angeles.

For loyal service he was granted the Rancho El Rosario in 1827 on lands of the Misión El Descanso in Baja California. During the early 1830s he became a citizen of the new pueblo of San Diego where he built a one story adobe house for his family below the presidio, on what became 2724 Congress Street. In 1836 he was a Regiador (city councilman) in the ayuntamiento of the San Diego Pueblo.

His son followed in his father's footsteps and grew to also become a Spanish Leather Jacket soldier.

Rogers attended Smith College and was inspired in 1904 by graduating Protestant students preparing to leave for missionary work in China. After her graduation, she returned to the school and founded a mission club for Catholic students in 1905. While organizing the club, she met Father James A. Walsh, director of Boston’s Office for the Propagation of the Faith, later founder of Maryknoll Fathers & Brothers, through whom she was inspired to establish a mission congregation for women. Rogers moved to Boston in 1908 to teach at public schools and attend the Boston Normal School. The Maryknoll Sisters were founded in 1912. By 1955, the Maryknoll Sisters had over 1000 sisters working in some twenty countries. Mother Mary Joseph Rogers was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2013.National Women's Hall of Fame, Mother Mary Joseph Rogers, MM  Early Life  Mary Joseph Rogers was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Rogers was one of eight children. she was the first girl born to her parents Abraham T. Rogers and Mary Josephine Plummer. Her grandfather Patrick Henry, emigrated from Ireland to Canada before crossing the border into the United States were he settled in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time Henry made the move to the United States, Irish immigrants were a focus of public persecution. The Rogers family practiced their faith discreetly, as to not draw unwanted attention from anyone. They evaded a lot of persecution from traditional protestant Americans by keeping their religious practices to a minimum outside the home. Rogers and her siblings attended Mass, Sunday school, and received the Eucharist weekly. They did these out of duty to their religion, but most of the Catholic principles that are taught and implemented by constant unrestricted immersion in church life came from time at home. Henry also chose to send his children and grandchildren including Rogers into public schools. In 1901 she graduated top of a Roxbury protestant public high school class, and spoke as the valedictorian.  Education/College  Rogers went on to complete her undergraduate in 1905 at Smith College in Northampton, Massachussetes. Her degree was in zoology. While at Smith College Rogers found herself drawn to volunteerism and service of the student body. In June of Rogers junior year she felt so strongly moved by the mission- sending of five Protestant fellow classmates she decided she wanted to reconnect with the church. It would not be until a few years later that Rogers would come to understand how she would connect back with the church life. After graduating, Smith College invited Rogers back with a position in the Zoology department. It was her plan to work as well as study to get her Masters degree. While taking classes at Smith College, she also received a teaching certificate from Boston Normal School. During her time in the Masters program, Rogers was recruited by a professor to help inspire the student body to get involved with service programs on campus. Smith College faculty member Elizabeth Hanscom of the college's English department suggested forming a group on campus. Rogers was not sure at first if she would be able to start and lead such a group, as she did not have a vast knowledge or background in how to start a mission club. The only example she had to base her choices on came from the protestant mission work she witnessed while an undergraduate. Because she liked what she witnessed in the Protestant mission sending, she agreed to Hanscom's request. Rogers got help and guidance for the club from Father James A. Walsh who at the time was director of the Boston office of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. At their first meeting, Walsh explained to Rogers that he believed Catholic Americans needed to be more involved with foreign missions. By the end of that first encounter Rogers found herself moved and asked what else she could be doing to help with Father Walsh's mission. Walsh invited her to help with his magazine The Field Afar. She worked translating documents that came from French missioners to English, and made basic edits to the magazine drafts. It was not long before she was devoting any and all free time to helping with the magazine. In order to commit more fully to the magazine, Rogers dropped out of the Masters program at Smith College and took a job teaching in Boston Public schools. Her role in the Boston public school was an assistant in the biology department. After working on the magazine for some time, Father Walsh began to pay Rogers for the time she was putting in. The magazine is still around today, it is now called Maryknoll. Despite not finishing her Masters degree, before Rogers death she received two honorary degrees and a Doctor of Letters from Smith College.  Religious work  In 1908 Pope Pius X announced that the Catholic Church could support itself as America was no longer considered mission territory and did not need missioners traveling around the country teaching about the Catholic faith. The Catholic Church turned its focus to global missions and Father Walsh and a North Carolina priest soon began the process of forming a foreign mission seminary in America. Father Walsh In 1911 the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America was established. They are known today as the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers. They set up their head office in New York. Rogers was chosen by Father Walsh in 1912 to take lead of the women that had come forward to help in his foreign mission society. Rogers previous establishment of the mission club at Smith College equipped her with a small amount of knowledge on how a mission based group was run. What Father Walsh asked required her to think broader and even though she did not know yet would reach an international level. What Rogers and the other women did know is that they wanted to be diverse in the type of work they did and who they helped. After the announcement in 1912 by Father Walsh that Rogers would be leading, she took a trip in 1914 to Europe with a friend. She arrived in France and ended the trip in Italy, were they were able to attend Pope Pius X funeral. This trip left Rogers with a deeper knowledge and understanding for religious life. Recognizing that Rogers would need help to establish the group, the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa, Wisconsin offered guidance. The group took some time to be approved as errors in administration and patriarchal concern prolonged the process. Paperwork between the Vatican and the women took a while to go back and forth. At one point some of the paperwork was sent back to the wrong address in New York. Word also got back to the women that there were doubts from those in charge in Rome about how successful the women's group would be. Those in power were quoted saying \\" American girls would not make good Missioners.\\" Rogers and the women continued their work despite the reluctance of the authorities in Rome. At the start there was only three women including Rogers that were helping Father Walsh and the society. In February of 1920, the Archbishop of New York relayed the news that the group of now 35 women was a church approved Diocletian congregation. There title was The Foreign Mission Sisters of St. Dominic, it was later changed to the Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic. Rogers was voted to be the official leader in 1925, upon which point she took the name Mother Mary Joseph. She stayed head of the Maryknoll sisters until she retired. Mother Mary Joseph espoused a belief that God was present wherever a Maryknoll is present, even if the actions taking place were not considered typical of a Catholic missionary. She would use the term cultivate as a way to explain what she felt that Maryknolls should aim to do, stating that \\"In our active religious life we don’t have time for sustained and long prayer. We must cultivate union with God at every possible moment.\\" Mother Mary Rogers and the other Maryknoll sisters kept this motto in mind on all missions throughout the world.  Later years  Toward the end of her life Mother Mary Joseph took extra care in making time to mentor the new members of the Maryknoll Sisters. She lived with them for a short period of time, until 1952 when she became paralyzed on one side of the body due to a blood clot in her brain. Mother Mary Joseph died at a New York Hospital in October of 1955. The Maryknoll Sisters that brought her to the hospital said that even near death she put others before her insisting that the doctors working with her be sure to get a break.

Distribution Boesemania microlepis lives in Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia (Borneo and Sumatra), Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. It is found in several rivers such as the Mekong, Chao Phraya River, Mae Klong, Nan River, Tha Chin River, and Bang Pakong River. Habitat and behaviour  This species appears to be sedentary. It prefers large, flowing rivers. During the peak of the dry season, it spawns in deepwater pools. During this time, common to other croakers, it can be heard to make loud, continuous, croaking sounds. Diet Boesemania microlepis eats mostly small fishes and crustaceans such as shrimps. Threats Desired as food, and expensive in southern Laos and northeast Cambodia, this species has become increasingly threatened due to overfishing. Despite this, it remains common in much of its range.

Life He was baptised in a Dutch family at King's Lynn, Norfolk in November 1756, and was an elder brother of George Vancouver. He learned farming in Norfolk, and then was found, around 1776, a post in Ireland working for Lord Shelburne by Arthur Young, at Rahan. He worked there on bog drainage, and during the 1780s took on related reclamation work in Kentucky. Kentucky was being settled at this time by westward migration, and Vancouver had a large holding (53,000 acres) there. In 1789 Vancouver was trying to establish a settlement on the Big Sandy River, where he had 15,000 acres from 1785. The plan encountered resistance from Native Americans, who (by the account of John Hanks who accompanied Vancouver) stole the party's horses. Vancouver was hoping the intended road from Staunton, Virginia to Lexington, Kentucky would open up the area, and he went back east to lay in stores. But he also lost financially in schemes of James Wilkinson. The trial settlement, around where Louisa, Kentucky now is, lasted to April 1790. Vancouver returned to Sussex in England.Harry G.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40486926 On the establishment of the Board of Agriculture in 1793, Vancouver was engaged by Sir John Sinclair to write reports on the state of agriculture in some of the English counties. Maria Josepha Holroyd wrote of him in July 1795 as a sensible well-informed man, who had visited several countries. From the late 1790s Vancouver travelled again, working in the Netherlands and marrying there, in particular. He returned also to his American estates, and he stated in 1807 that he has been engaged in \\"cutting down the woodland and clearing the forests in Kentucky\\". In 1806 he was again in England, and Young mentions that he was consulted by Nicholas Vansittart. He reportedly died in 1815, in Virginia. Works Vancouver's first book A general Compendium of Chemical, Experimental, and Natural Philosophy, with a complete System of Commerce, was published at Philadelphia in 1785. In 1786 he was described as \\"Vancouver of Philadelphia\\" in Arthur Young's Annals of Agriculture, to which he contributed a glowing account of the farming of Kentucky. The Board of Agriculture published in 1794 an account of Vancouver's tour in Cambridgeshire, and in 1795 an account of a similar tour in Essex. He wrote two more reports for the Board's General View of Agriculture county surveys: on the county Devon, (1808, republished in 1813); and on Hampshire (1813). William Marshall, who criticised most of the board's reports, spoke of Vancouver's Cambridgeshire, though not of the other reports. Vancouver wrote in 1794 a paper on the drainage of the fens of the Great Level, and especially of Cambridgeshire. It remained unprinted for 17 years, and finally appeared as an appendix to the Huntingdon Report.C.

Accredited by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), it gives refuge to children of unwed mothers, indigent families, tuberculosis patients, mentally or physically-incapacitated parents, prisoners, or victims of incest or rape. These children are provided with medical assistance, educational care, and financial support to help them in their early years. History =Early Beginnings= In the early 20th century when there was an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines, the orphanage was established to shelter the children of the TB patients of the Quezon Institute. It was founded by Victoria Lopez de Araneta in 1936. Its founding board members include Mercedes McMicking, Conrado Dayrit, Emmanuel J. Dymek, Teodoro Evangelista, Mrs. Carl Hess, Manuel Mañosa, Vincente Marasigan, Paulino Miranda Sampedro, Gonzalo Puyat, Juan Tuason, and Soledad Zulueta. Through the leadership of de Araneta, the board purchased the land in Santolan, San Juan, which is four-hectare lot, where the structure would be built. One of its recognized supporters at that time was President Manuel Quezon and in his honor the orphanage was also known as the Quezon Preventorium. He signed a bill that allowed a portion of horse race revenues to be channeled to the orphanage. In 1938, two years after its initial operations, the institution was run under the care of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul who took in 20 children of TB patients as its wards. The nuns managed the orphanage until they turned it over to the current board in 2004. =World War II= On 20 June 1944, during the time of World War II, the Japanese took over the orphanage and the nuns transferred the children to Welfareville in Mandaluyong for safety. Although the board gave Sr. Consuelo Muró, then overseer of White Cross, the authority to close down the institution, she continued the mission and fed the children in its temporary home in Welfareville. When the war ended and through the help of the American liberation forces, they restored White Cross and the children and the staff returned to San Juan in 1946. Architecture Relief of children at play. The services of architect Pablo Antonio, who was later recognized as National Artist for Architecture, was obtained to design White Cross, which was aimed to be a fresh-air shelter for the children of TB patients. The building was an Art Deco design with its façade shaped like a large white cross. The bas-relief of children at play that was designed by Italian sculptor Francesco Monti softened the linear and sharp structure of the façade. Among Antonio's works, which included the Far Eastern University (FEU), Ideal Garden, Orchid Garden Hotel, and Syquia Apartments, only the Manila Polo Club and White Cross remain as the stalwarts because most of his designs have been demolished or in a state of decline.

Stehaufchen or Der Dresdener Stehaufchen, later relabelled the Akaflieg Dresden D-B1 Stehaufchen, was an unequal span biplane glider designed and built in Germany in 1921. It flew with some success at the second and third Rhön competitions on the Wasserkuppe and was also used to train pilots. Design and development Before the formal formation of the Akaflieg Dresden in about 1924, there was collaboration between the Technical High School Dresden (TH Dresden) and the local flying club, the Flugtechnischer Verein Dresden (F.V.D.). The Stehaufchen was one result, named and designed by three TH Dresden students, Horst Muttray, Reinhold Seiferth and Rudolf Spies. The biplane configuration was chosen to ensure strength against rough handling and its small size by the need to fit within the limit set by rail transport. Construction began on 11 June 1921 and the first flight took place only about ten weeks later on 23 August on the Wasserkuppe. During its career, the glider was known in England at least as the F.V.D. Stehaufchen after the club, or just as the F.V.D. glider to distinguish it from the F.V.D. monoplane or Doris of 1922. After the founding of the Akaflieg Dresden it was retrospectively renamed the D-B1 Stehaufchen, numbering it as the first of their ten designs. The Stehaufchen was a single bay biplane with two spar wings of unequal span mounted without stagger but with an unusually large interplane gap of . The lower wing was mounted on the lower fuselage and the upper one held high above it by three pairs of inverted V-struts, one pair leaning backwards from the nose to the forward spar and the two other running vertically from the upper fuselage longerons to the two spars on the centre line. On each side a pair of parallel, slightly outward leaning interplane struts connected the forward and rear spars from the lower tips and the bays were cross braced with wires. Both wings were roughly rectangular in plan and slightly swept (1.2°); only the lower one carried dihedral (2°). The ratio of upper to lower wing areas was about 1.6:1. The wings, like the rest of the aircraft had a wooden structure: the spars were both wooden boxes and the leading edges were double ply skinned. Elsewhere the wings were fabric covered. Roll control was by wing warping on both planes. The glider had a simple, wide, rectangular cross section fuselage with four cross braced longerons forming trusses. It was skinned with two-ply, with a final fabric covering. From the side the nose was smoothly rounded into a single curvature form with the open cockpit behind it, placing the pilot's seat close to quarter chord. Aft the depth decreased and the tailplane was attached to the top with the fuselage ending at the coincident elevator and rudder hinges. The horizontal tail surfaces were roughly rectangular and the elevator was a single piece structure. The fin was a quadrant and the rudder almost semicircular but cut away below for elevator movement. All the tail surfaces were wood framed and fabric covered. The Stehaufchen's undercarriage was a parallel pair of skids, intended to protect the low set lower wing on take-off and landings. The unusually broad fuselage enabled the skids to be separated by . These were ash, laminated and of double curvature attached at three points, one below the pilot's feet and the others below each wing spar. The final section behind the rear mounting point curved down a little to protect the tail. Operational history At the 1922 Rhön contest The Stehaufchen first flew at the 1921 Rhön contest, the second of the series. Muttray began with a flight on 23 August which lasted just 38 seconds but five days later flew it for three minutes. More than one third of the competing aircraft were biplanes but of these the Stehaufchen was the most successful and its three designers received a 1,500 Mark prize. After the competition the Stehaufchen stayed on the Wasserkuppe until September, making flights of up to 4.5 minutes and enabling Seiferth and Spies to get their pilot's certificates. The Stehaufchen was damaged on the rail journey home and during the rebuild the upper wing was increased in span from to . It resumed test flying in the spring of 1922, launched by bungee cord. In this period several more pilots gained flight experience and their certificates. It then went to the third Rhön contest, where it gained first prize for total time in the air (1851 seconds) and second prize for distance covered in a single flight (). It went once more to the Wasserkuppe in 1923 but did not take part in the contest; during a practice flight, it crashed and was destroyed.

History The area around the park used to be a geological limestone mountain called Mount Banping. It used to be an important source of Taiwan's limestone ore needs. In 1997, the mining activities ceased to operate after 30 years of activity and the mining area began to recover to its original condition. Several years later, the Kaohsiung City Government carried out a conservation plan to protect the soil and water for the abandoned mine area. After years of restorative afforestation and rehabilitation, the mountain slowly regained its original beauty. In 2004, the Kaohsiung Association of Hydraulic Engineers was commissioned by Kaohsiung City Government to execute an evaluation of the possibility of using the Chien Tai Cement Company's grit chamber area at the southern side of Banping Mountain for a wetland park. The result of the evaluation was positive and that in 2005 the City Government budgeted for and built up a nature park at the foot of the northwestern side of the mountain. They also afforested and constructed five flood-detention grit chambers at the southern side of the mountain foot. Man-made wetlands were also created to effectively function as grit-removal and flood-detention bodies. Geology The park spans over an area of 12 hectares.

The term was also used in several countries in the title Kammerjunker, the German and Scandinavian equivalent of the French valet de chambre, a position usually given to young noble men in the service of a princely rank person at the court. A Kammerjunker was ranked below a chamberlain, but above a chamber page. It has also been used in military roles in the German and Scandinavian realm, such as Fahnenjunker and its Scandinavian equivalents (for instance: fanjunkare). In Denmark, the term Junker connotes a young lord, originally the son of a medieval duke or count, but also a term for a member of the privileged landowner class. Before 1375 the honorific was also suitable for Danish royal sons. It was also used in the title Kammerjunker within the royal household. Modern popular usage in Prussia In modern Prussian history, the term became popularly used as a loosely defined synecdoche for the landed nobility (particularly of the east) who controlled almost all of the land and government, or by extension, the Prussian estate owners regardless of noble status. With the formation of the German Empire in 1871, the Junkers dominated the central German government and the Prussian military. A leading representative was Prince Otto von Bismarck.Francis Ludwig Carsten, A history of the Prussian Junkers (1989). \\"The Junkers\\" of Prussia were often contrasted with the elites of the western and southern states in Germany, such as the city-republic of Hamburg (which had no nobility) or Catholic states like Bavaria, in which the \\"Junker class\\" of Prussia was often viewed with contempt.Percy Ernst Schramm: Gewinn und Verlust.

This species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. Its typical habitat is shallow sandy areas. Its yellowish-brown colouration enables it to blend into its surroundings making it well-camouflaged when stationary. In the Caribbean it has been found that when it moves around, it does so in such a way as to closely resemble the swimming behaviour of the plate fish (Bothus lunatus), a bottom-dwelling flounder which inhabits the same waters. Description Macrotritopus defilippi is a small octopus with relatively long arms and a mantle length of up to . As is the case in most octopuses, the skin is variable in colour. It is usually either plain or speckled and closely matches the colour of its surroundings, the sandy plains on which it lives. Where the substrate includes gravel among the sand, the mottled pattern is often larger, there can be small papillae (fleshy protuberances) on the skin, and some light and dark barring on the arms. In some circumstances a white leucophore has been observed on the mantle tip; this may provide a disruptive camouflage when there are white pebbles in the vicinity. Like other octopuses, this species is able to vary its appearance to match its surroundings; when an individual is stationary on the sandy seabed, its colouring, patterning, and even brightness, so closely match the surroundings that the animal is very difficult to discern. This octopus can also bury itself in the substrate without leaving any visual trace of its position. Distribution Macrotritopus defilippi has been reported from the Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the northern Indian Ocean and the coast of Somalia. Behaviour Macrotritopus defilippi is well camouflaged on a sandy seabed, but it is a predator and needs to move around in order to feed. When it does this, its camouflage breaks down. Humann and DeLoach (2002) reported that Macrotritopus defilippi sometimes swam backwards in a normal octopus-style but that on other occasions, it moved forwards in a flattened position with its arms streaming beside it, making it superficially resemble a flatfish. The octopus swims close to the contours of the sand surface, even hugging ripples in the sand, so that no shadows are formed. Living on the same sandy plains in the Caribbean as this octopus is a small, bottom-dwelling flounder, the plate fish (Bothus lunatus). The colour of this fish is also variable and usually resembles the substrate, which makes it well-camouflaged when stationary but more visible when it moves about, at which time it engages in characteristic short bursts of swimming activity. Hanlon, Watson, & Barbosa (2010) studied Macrotritopus defilippi in the wild in the Caribbean, and consider it to be a mimic of the flounder when it swims. There are similarities in both the speed and duration of bouts of swimming, the style of movement and the posture adopted by the two. Typically, the plate fish swims for about 6 seconds (3-43s) and the octopus for 2 seconds (1–20s) and both then rest for 2 or 3 seconds (1–8s flounder, 1–13s octopus) before swimming again. Both keep close to the rippled sand contours of the seabed and the octopus keeps its eyes on the upper side of its body, which increases its resemblance to the lefteye flounder. In her study of Abdopus aculeatus, Huffard (2006) hypothesized that an octopus benefited from its mimicry of a fish by the fact that potential predators did not attack what they thought was a bony flatfish that was too large for their gape whereas a soft-bodied octopus would be more likely to be attacked. In the Pacific Ocean there are two species of octopus, Thaumoctopus mimicus and an unnamed species, which are known to mimic flounders when swimming, but Macrotritopus defilippi is the first such species known from the Atlantic Ocean. At one time, unidentified Macrotritopus larvae characterized by having long third arms were known from the Caribbean Sea but the adult form was unknown. Only when a female was raised to maturity in the laboratory was it discovered that they were the larvae of Macrotritopus defilippi. These larvae float with their arms extended and if disturbed, dart off by jet propulsion, sometimes reaching the seabed and seeking a hole in which to hide. They may be pelagic by night and benthic by day, but seem to become less nocturnal as they get older.

It was used to write Saraiki language, often considered a dialect of Western Punjabi language. The script was used for routine writing and commercial activities. Multani is one of four Landa scripts whose usage was extended beyond the mercantile domain and formalized for literary activity and printing; the others being Gurmukhi, Khojki, and Khudawadi. Although Multani is now obsolete, it is a historical script in which written and printed records exist. It was also known as Karikki and as Sarai. Background and origin The script is of Brahmic origin. The script originated from Landa script, a derivative of Sharada script. It share similarities with other Landa scripts such as Khojki and Khudawadi.Grierson, George A. 1919. The Linguistic Survey of India. Vol. VIII. Indo-Aryan Family. North-Western Group. Part III. Sindhī and Lahndā. Calcutta: Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing,India. Usage The script was used for routine writing and commercial activities. In the early 19th century it was adapted for literary usage when the Baptist Missionary Press produced metal fonts for the script in order to print Christian literature. The first book printed in the Multani script was the New Testament (1819). In the latter half of the 19th century, the British administration introduced the Arabic script as the standard for the languages of Sindh, which led to the demise of the Landa script of the region. The Multani script is no longer used and Saraiki is now written using an extension of the Arabic script.Serampore Missionaries. 1819. The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testaments translated from the originals into the Mooltani Language. Vol II – Containing the New Testament. Serampore: Mission Press Characters Two different styles are observed over the course of the 19th century, with the later style representing a simplified version of the original style. Some consonants begin to represent their aspirated and implosive forms. The script also functions more as an abjad than as an abugida, as vowels are not marked unless the word is monosyllabic and as there are no dependent vowel signs, only independent ones that can appear at the beginning of a word, as with other Indic scripts. There is no virama, and consonant clusters are written with independent consonants. There is one section mark punctuation that has been identified. The independent vowels, of which there are only four, represent both short and long forms of the independent vowels in addition to phonological variations, and 'i' sometimes represents 'ya'. Ultimately, many consonants represent multiple sounds, and the digits largely represent those found in Gurmukhi, with the exception of 6 and 7, which resemble Devanagari more closely.

This and many other famous sections of the Great Wall were built during the Ming dynasty The extent of the Ming dynasty and its walls, which formed most of what is called the Great Wall of China today The Ming Great Wall (明長城; Ming changcheng), built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), forms the most visible parts of the Great Wall of China today. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure from Jiayu Pass in the west to the sea in Shanhai Pass, then looping over to terminate in Manchuria at the Hushan Great Wall. This is made up of sections of actual wall, of trenches and of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. While the Ming walls are generally referred to as \\"Great Wall\\" (changcheng) in modern times, in Ming times they were called \\"border barriers\\" (邊牆; bianqiang) by the Chinese, since the term changcheng was said to evoke imagery of the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang (260–210 BC) and was associated with the Qin Great Wall. History =Early Ming walls and garrisons= In 1368, the Hongwu Emperor (Zhu Yuanzhang, r.136898) ousted the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty from China to inaugurate the Ming dynasty. The Mongols fled back to Mongolia, but even after numerous campaigns, the Mongol problem remained. In the early years of his reign, Hongwu envisioned a border policy where mobile armies along the northern frontier guarded the safety of China. To this end he set up the \\"eight outer garrisons\\" close to the steppe and an inner line of forts more suitable for defence. The inner line was the forerunner to the Ming Great Wall. In 1373, as Ming forces encountered setbacks, Hongwu put more emphasis on defence and adopted Hua Yunlong's (華雲龍) suggestion to establish garrisons at 130 passes and other strategic points in the Beijing area. More positions were set up in the years up to Hongwu's death in 1398, and watchtowers were manned from the Bohai Sea to Beijing and further onto the Mongolian steppes. These positions, however, were not for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not feature heavily, and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the time. Hongwu's son, the Yongle Emperor (r.140224), continued his father's policy of active campaigning against the Mongols, and in 1421 moved the Ming capital from Nanjing in the south to Beijing in the north, partially to better manage the Mongol situation. Construction of walls in stone and earth began under Yongle's reign in strategic passes, when signal towers and ditch systems were also established. Yongle's reign also saw the rearrangement of the dynasty's frontiers that led to all but one of the eight outer garrisons being abolished to cut expenses, thereby sacrificing a vital foothold in the steppe transitional zone. After Yongle's death in 1424, the Ming abandoned the last garrison at Kaiping (the former Yuan capital also known as Xanadu) in 1430. The removal of these garrisons would have long-term consequences, as Ming foreign policy turned increasingly inward and defence became preferred over offence, especially after taking into consideration the cost to maintain the outlying garrisons. Around 1442, a wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han settlers from a possible threat from the Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan. In 146768, expansion of the wall provided further protection for the region from against attacks by the Jianzhou Jurchens in the northeast. An offshoot of the future main Great Wall line, this \\"Liaodong Wall\\" was of simple design: for the most part constructed by pouring mud between parallel rows of stakes, with moats dug on both sides, although stones and tiles were used in some parts. Despite withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused the collapse of the early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols since the beginning of the dynasty, and the Ming were on the defensive from this point on. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the most pressing political concern caused by the capture of the emperor was resolved when the acting Minister of War Yu Qian (the actual minister having died at Tumu) installed the Emperor's brother as the new Jingtai Emperor (r.14501459). Military tensions with the Oirats remained high during Jingtai's reign, as peace would have caused a great deal of political awkwardness for Jingtai and Yu Qian's faction, who benefited from putting Jingtai on the throne. To maintain a military presence while compensating for the loss of soldiers, fortifications, ditches, and ramparts were constructed in key passes, including at Zijing Pass (紫荊關; through where the Mongols had entered during the Tumu Crisis), Ningwu Pass (寧武關), and Juyong Pass. The work undertaken in this period marked a major shift toward defensive construction. =The Ordos Wall= 1688 map of Ming dynasty fortresses around Taozhou (present-day Xincheng Town, Lintan County). The deterioration of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. To solve this problem, the Ming could either go on the offensive and re-establish their positions in the steppe, or concede the transitional zones to the nomads and maintain a defensive and accommodative policy. Over the late 15th and 16th centuries, the choice between the two options became the subject of fierce debate in the Chinese court and dissension that was sometimes exploited by various political factions to get rid of the opposition. The decision to build the first major Ming walls was the one of the outcomes of these debates as an acceptable compromise. As offensive action against the nomads became increasingly untenable due to a shortage of fighting men and military supplies, Yu Zijun (余子俊; 14291489) first proposed constructing a wall in the Ordos region in August 1471, but this went against the traditional offensive- based policies in place since the early Ming. Minister of War Bai Gui (白圭) had tried to implement an offensive solution since taking office in 1467, and he objected to Yu's proposal because of cost fears. On 20December 1472, amid reports of people fleeing the frontier provinces due to the harsh military levies imposed to finance offensive campaigns, Yu reasoned that his wall project would not be as costly as the offensive strategy, and that the wall would be a temporary measure that would allow the Ming to restore its military and economic strength. The court and emperor approved the plan, and the 1473 victory in the Battle of Red Salt Lake (紅鹽池) by Wang Yue (王越) deterred Mongol invasions long enough for Yu Zijun to complete his wall project in 1474. This wall, a combined effort between Yu Zijun and Wang Yue, stretched from present day Hengcheng (橫城) in Lingwu (northwestern Ningxia province) to Huamachi town (花馬池鎮) in Yanchi County, and from there to Qingshuiying (清水營) in northeastern Shaanxi, a total of more than 2000 li (about ) long. Along its length were 800 strong points, sentry posts, beacon-fire towers, and assorted defences. 40,000 men were enlisted for this effort, which was completed in several months at a cost of over one million silver taels. This defence system proved its initial worth in 1482, when a large group of Mongol raiders were trapped within the double lines of fortifications and suffered a defeat by the Ming generals. This was seen as a vindication of Yu Zijun's strategy of wall-building by the people of the border areas. By the mid-16th century, Yu's wall in the Ordos had seen expansion into an extensive defence system. It contained two defence lines: Yu's wall, called the \\"great border\\" (大邊, dàbiān), and a \\"secondary border\\" (二邊, èrbiān) built by Yang Yiqing (14541530) behind it. Following the success of the Ordos walls, Yu Zijun proposed construction of a further wall that would extend from the Yellow River bend in the Ordos to the Sihaiye Pass (四海冶口; in present-day Yanqing County) near the capital Beijing, running a distance of more than 1300 li (about ). The project received approval in 1485, but Yu's political enemies harped on the cost overruns and forced Yu to scrap the project and retire the same year. For more than 50 years after Yu's resignation, political struggle prevented major wall constructions on a scale comparable to Yu's Ordos project. However, wall construction continued regardless of court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair well into the 16th century. =The Walls of Xuanfu–Datong and the western reaches= The Great Wall at Dajingmen, part of the Xuanfu stretch of the Great Wall.

With the Ordos now adequately fortified, the Mongols avoided its walls by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding the corridor to Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and for all intents and purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence. Starting from the 1520s, proposals were made to strengthen the defences of this region, but the plan was disrupted by the local populace's resistance to the prospect of labour; only in the 1540s did work proceed in earnest. From 1544 to 1549, a defensive building program took place on a scale unprecedented in Chinese history. The project was led by Weng Wanda (翁萬達; 14981552), the Supreme Commander of the Xuan–Da defence area (宣大總督), which was responsible for the Xuanfu, Datong, and Shanxi areas. Troops were re-deployed along the outer line, new walls and beacon towers were constructed, and fortifications were restored and extended along both lines. Firearms and artillery were first mounted on the walls and towers around this time, for both defence and signalling purposes. The project's completion was announced in the sixth month of 1548, but the walls were steadily augmented for a time after that. At its height, the Xuan–Da portion of the Great Wall totalled about of wall, with some sections being doubled-up with two lines of wall, some tripled or even quadrupled. The outer frontier was now protected by a wall called the \\"outer border\\" (外邊, wàibiān) that extended from the Yellow River's edge at the Piantou Pass (偏頭關) along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province; the \\"inner border\\" wall (內邊, nèibiān) ran southeast from Piantou Pass for some , ending at the Pingxing Pass; a \\"river wall\\" (河邊, hébiān) also ran from the Piantou Pass and followed the Yellow River southwards for about . The Hebei section of the Great Wall was further fortified by planting trees along the wall. A section of the Great Wall on the Hanging Cliffs () leading up to Jiayu Pass As with Yu Zijun's wall in the Ordos, the Mongols shifted their attacks away from the newly strengthened Xuan–Da sector to less well-protected areas. In the west, Shaanxi province became the target of nomads riding west from the Yellow River loop. The westernmost fortress of Ming China, the Jiayu Pass, saw substantial enhancement with walls starting in 1539, and from there border walls were built discontinuously down the Gansu Corridor to Wuwei, where the low earthen wall split into two. The northern section passed through Zhongwei and Yinchuan, where it met the western edge of the Yellow River loop before connecting with the Ordos walls, while the southern section passed through Lanzhou and continued northeast to Dingbian. The origins and the exact route of this so-called \\"Tibetan loop\\" are still not clear. In the east, the Tümed Mongols under Altan Khan raided Sihaiye and Dabaiyang (大白陽) in the seventh month of 1548. These points were much further east than previous raids and much closer to Beijing. The terrain there proved difficult to traverse, and so fortifications were not seen as urgently needed before the raids. In response, Weng Wanda proposed to close the gaps by connecting the walls of Xuan–Da with the signal towers of the eastern Jizhou defence command (薊州鎮). Only one sixth of the 436,000 liang of silver demanded for this project was allotted, and Weng Wanda supervised only briefly before leaving office on the death of his father. =The Great Wall outside Beijing= In 1550, having once more been refused a request for trade, Altan Khan invaded the Xuan–Da region. However, despite several attempts, he could not take Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda's double fortified line while the garrison at Datong bribed him to not attack there. Instead of continuing to operate in the area, he circled around Weng Wanda's wall to the relatively lightly defended Gubeikou, northeast of Beijing. From there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of Beijing. The Ming court put up minimal resistance and watched the suburbs burn as they waited for reinforcements to drive the invaders out. According to one contemporary source, the raid took more than 60,000 lives and an additional 40,000 people became prisoners. As a response to this raid, the focus of the Ming's northern defences shifted from the Xuan–Da region to the Jizhou and Changping Defence Commands (昌平鎮) where the breach took place. Later in the same year, the dry-stone walls of the Ji–Chang area were replaced by stone and mortar. These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper, more easily defended slopes and facilitated construction of features such as ramparts, crenelations, and peepholes. The effectiveness of the new walls was demonstrated in the failed Mongol raid of 1554, where raiders expecting a repeat of the events of 1550 were surprised by the higher wall and stiff Chinese resistance. The success of the wall did not always translate into political success for its builders. Detractors cited its high costs and the drain on military manpower as reasons for their opposition and in 1557 the Grand Coordinator Wu Jiahui (吳嘉會) was jailed on charges of embezzlement due to faulty and wasteful wall-building. Construction thereafter had to be low-key: the Supreme Commander of Shanxi (山西總督), Liu Tao (劉燾), minimized political attention to himself by claiming that he was \\"building through non-building.\\" In 1567 Qi Jiguang and Tan Lun, successful generals who fended off the coastal pirates, were reassigned to manage the Ji and Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region. They submitted an ambitious proposal to build 3,000 brick towers along the Great Wall, and manoeuvred their way out of political opposition through the efforts of their allies at the imperial court. Although the number of towers was later scaled back to 1200, the project, which started in 1569 and lasted two years, marked the first large- scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall. Up until this point, most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows. In contrast, the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows. Altan Khan eventually made peace with China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened from time to time when the profits of raiding outweighed the profits of trade, and so wall-building continued. The \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" stretch of the Simatai Great Wall runs through precipitous terrain. Reinforced after the raid of 1576 so as to \\"not let a single horse in\\" (), as noted by a Ming official On 6July 1576, a minor Mongol raid broke through a small gap in the Wall and resulted in the death of several high ranking border officials in the vicinity of Simatai, east of Gubeikou. After this incident and starting in 1577, the Ming became committed to closing all gaps along the frontier around Beijing whilst strengthening the walls. As a result, the earthen defences around Beijing were torn down and replaced by ones built with stone bricks and sanhetu (三合土), an early sort of concrete made of lime, clay tiles, and sand. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today. Except for a lull in the 1590s due to resources being diverted to deal with the Japanese invasions of Korea, wall construction continued until the demise of the Ming dynasty in 1644. =The Wall and the fall of the Ming= The last decades of the Ming saw famines, floods, economic chaos, rebellions, and invasions. In 1618, the upstart Jianzhou Jurchen leader Nurhaci united the tribes of Manchuria and declared war on the Ming. After the Fushun garrison within the Liaodong Wall surrendered to Nurhaci the next year, the Ming court assembled a Chinese–Korean army numbering above 100,000 men to contain him, but they were catastrophically defeated at the Battle of Sarhu. Nurhaci made substantial progress in his conquest of Liaodong until he was mortally wounded at the 1626 Battle of Ningyuan by Yuan Chonghuan. He was succeeded by his son Hung Taiji, who worked to undermine Yuan Chonghuan by spreading rumours of Yuan's collaboration with the Jurchens. To drive the point home, Hung Taiji sent an army around Ningyuan through Mongol territories to breach the Great Wall pass at Xifengkou in the fall of 1629, taking advantage of a rift in the Ming ranks due to Yuan Chonghuan's execution of his fellow commander Mao Wenlong. This breach, known as the Jisi Incident, was the first time the Jurchens had broken through the Great Wall into China proper since the troubles in the northeast began. Yuan Chonghuan hastily sent an army to drive off the raiders from the walls of Beijing, but political damage had already been done. Yuan Chonghuan was accused of treason for letting this happen, and in 1630 he was executed by slow dismemberment while his family were exterminated or exiled. Illustration of the Shanhai Pass garrison at the time of the Manchu conquests Following Hung Taiji's raid, regular garrison troops in the western defence zones along the Great Wall were sent east to defend the capital, which had the unintended consequence of instigating more instability. The regions of Shaanxi had already been afflicted by adverse weather, heavy taxation, and fiscal mismanagement, so the removal of a substantial military presence encouraged the inhabitants to turn to banditry and rebellion; the remaining garrison forces, already unpaid and resentful, saw little choice but to throw in their lot with the rebels. A prominent leader who rose from the ranks of the rebels was Li Zicheng, the self-titled \\"Dashing Prince\\" (闖王, Chuǎng Wáng) who came to dominate Central China by 1642. Throughout his rise there were several occasions on which he could have been extinguished by the Ming, but Jurchen breaches of the Great Wall – the Jurchens had raided across the Great Wall several times since 1629, including in 1634, 1638, and 1642 – distracted the Ming court's attention. The Ming were not able to effectively deal with the simultaneous internal and external threats, much less maintain a consistent defence along the Great Wall. In 1635 Hung Taiji renamed his people the Manchus and declared himself the emperor of a new Qing dynasty the following year. However, the Manchus were not yet willing to launch an invasion of conquest against the Ming; as Hung Taiji remarked in 1642, \\"The Shanhai Pass cannot be taken.\\" In the first months of 1644, Li Zicheng, having consolidated control over his home province Shaanxi, declared himself the founder of a new Shun dynasty, and marched against the Ming court in Beijing. His invasion route brought the Shun army along the Great Wall to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. In this effort Li was met with next to no resistance as most garrisons surrendered to the Shun with no major fighting, except at the Ningwu Pass where the general Zhou Yuji (周遇吉) fought to the death. By April17, both the major garrisons at Datong and Xuanfu had surrendered to Li Zicheng, and most Ming hopes were placed on the last Great Wall pass at Juyong and its defender Tang Tong (). However, just as the Ming court was discussing the means of increasing provisions to Juyong Pass, it received word that Tang Tong had surrendered and let the Shun army through on April21. With all options exhausted, the Ming's Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself as the Shun army entered Beijing on April25, 1644. The largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China at the time of Beijing's fall was Wu Sangui's 40,000-man frontier force, who had abandoned the Ningyuan garrison to come to the emperor's aid. Halfway to Beijing, Wu received news of Chongzhen's death, so he went back to garrison the Shanhai Pass, the eastern terminus of the main Great Wall line. He and his men were now caught between the rebels within the Great Wall and the Manchus without. After some deliberation, Wu Sangui decided to resist the new Shun regime, having heard that Li Zicheng had ordered Wu's family executed. On May3 and May10 Wu Sangui twice defeated the Shun vanguard led by the turncoat Tang Tong, but he knew that his force alone was insufficient to fight Li Zicheng's main army. Wu Sangui wrote to the Manchus for help, promising \\"great profits\\" if they assisted him in defeating the rebels. The Manchu prince-regent Dorgon (Hung Taiji had died in 1643) determined that this was the opportunity to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. Dorgon made clear in his reply that the Manchus would help Wu Sangui, but Wu would have to submit to the Qing; Wu had little choice but to accept. On May27, as the Shun army approached the Shanhai Pass from the south, Wu Sangui opened the gates to let the Qing army through the pass from the north. Up to this point the Battle of Shanhai Pass between Li Zicheng and Wu Sangui had been moving in Li's favour, but the sudden appearance of the Manchu bannermen decisively routed the Shun forces. Having thus entered through the Great Wall, the Manchus seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing Qing rule over all of China. Construction =The workforce= Central policy alone did not decide whether the walls would be built, as various \\"defense commands\\" (邊鎮, biānzhèn) along the border possessed considerable autonomy to deal with the nomads, leading to a decentralized approach to wall-building along the frontier. Each wall-building project was designed to meet imminent or potential threats along short sections of the empire's northern border, never larger in scope than a single regional defence command, and were often as short as a few hundred meters. In most cases, frontier policy decisions of this period were made by the supreme commander or the grand coordinator in charge of the defence command, who would then send their proposals to the Ministry of War (兵部, Bīngbù) and the emperor for approval. If approved, funding for the project would be footed by the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Revenue (戶部, Hùbù). In essence, the Ming Great Wall was built in a piecemeal fashion by a number of regional commanders over a long period of time, not as one monumental project ordered by the central government. There were three main groups of people that made up the builders of the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty: frontier guards, peasants, and convicts. Towards the end of the Ming Great Wall building period, skilled artisans became a prominent group of wall builders as well. During the Ming period, soldiers were in shortage due to low productivity on the military colonies, called weisuo (衛所) . The northern frontier, the most heavily guarded border of Ming China, was kept at 40% strength, which was equivalent to 300,000 men across a 2,000 mile border. Because of low productivity on military farms and the need for more guards along the frontier, most of the frontier soldiers were from military families that served on the farms. Soldiers were involved in the building of the Great Wall because Ming officials preferred to fight a defensive war on the northern frontier. This took the form of building fortresses and walls along the frontier to protect the empire from invaders. Therefore, the building of the Great Wall fell on the shoulders of the military . Depending on the military colony and the general in charge, labor could be paid or unpaid. If they were paid, it averaged out to six pounds of silver per man per year. But like peasants and convicts, labor was always conscripted by the government, meaning that the government would force people to work on the wall. Like previous dynasties, the Ming officials also recruited peasants from the surrounding areas to work on the wall for seasons at a time. Not much is known about how the peasants were recruited or how they worked, but the labor was often conscripted and paid very little. The last major group of wall builders during the Ming dynasty were convicts. Convicts were the other part of the military that was not conscripted from hereditary military families. At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, only military convicts were sent into frontier exile, but as time went on, civilians convicts were also sent to the frontier. Because Ming officials wanted to create more hereditary military families, unmarried convicts were often given a wife from the female convict population to start a family with. In addition to these main groups of wall builders, there were also masons who were hired by the emperor to build the more sophisticated parts of the wall that were made of brick and mortar instead of the traditional tamped earth method. These workers were paid significantly more by the emperor because of their specialized skills in wall building, including working with kilns to create the bricks and designing the walls to fit the terrain. Living and working conditions for the wall builders were miserable and often fatal. Traveling to the Great Wall itself was a dangerous journey that many would die on. This difficult journey would also make supplying the garrisons with food and other supplies extremely difficult. Once at the wall, workers lived in “inhumane conditions” that were rampant with disease, lacked basic needs, and was incredibly dangerous to navigate. These factors, combined with the harsh working climate instituted by the generals in charge of the wall building, lead to a high mortality rate among wall builders, which is why many call the Great Wall \\"the longest cemetery in the world\\". Ming soldiers who had built and guarded the Great Wall were given land nearby for their families to settle down and farm small plots of land. There are altogether 158 such villages. One of these villages in the vicinity of the Great Wall include Chengziyu (城子峪) in Funing District of Hebei. Their ancestors were recruited from the districts of Jinhua and Yiwu in Zhejiang province and had served in the Ming military under Qi Jiguang. =Techniques= Several techniques were used to build these walls. For materials, the Ming used earth, stone, timber, and lime like previous dynasties. But they also used bricks and tiles, especially for areas with rougher terrain, which was a new technique in China at the time. These were made with kilns, which were a new invention at the time. Materials were transported hundreds of miles either on the backs of workers, by hand carts or wheelbarrows, or on animal-driven carts. There were two main techniques for building the wall. The first was the rammed earth method, which was used on level areas, and had been used by previous dynasties as well. Materials at the location were compressed together to build the wall. The Ming dynasty refined this technique by being able to do this on a larger scale than previous dynasties. The Ming builders also created a new technique, the two-layer method, which involved bricks and tiles. This was used on uneven terrain, like hills and mountains. Bricks were stacked diagonally if the incline or decline of the landscape was less than 45 degrees, and were shaped into stairs if the incline or decline was greater than 45 degrees. Siege techniques The Mongol Northern Yuan dynasty used to send ahead a force of up to a thousand men that carried pickaxes to break down the wall whose core consisted mostly of rammed earth.Atwood, Christopher P. (2004): Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, Facts On File, , p. 410 Appraisal In academia, opinions about the Wall's role in the Ming dynasty's downfall are mixed. Historians such as Arthur Waldron and Julia Lovell are critical of the whole wall- building exercise in light of its ultimate failure in protecting China; the former compared the Great Wall with the failed Maginot Line of the French in World War II. However, independent scholar David Spindler notes that the Wall, being only part of a complex foreign policy, received \\"disproportionate blame\\" because it was the most obvious relic of that policy.

He remembers Jesus teaching and wonders why they’re hurting an innocent man. Horrified, he remembers his own crime: He’s in an alley with a rich gentleman. Holding him up with a knife, he tries to take a box of coins and belongings. The thief is nervous so when he tries to go after the man, he fumbles. The man fights him with the box. Coins go flying. The thief accidentally stabs the man in the struggle. He claws at the coins and runs off. The flashback ends. He then breaks down in tears, aggrieved at seeing someone innocent suffer an even more brutal punishment as a criminal than himself. Most people in the crowds in the courtyard scream for Jesus to be crucified. The thief, another man (who is also a thief) and Jesus are loaded with the beams for their crosses and march to Golgotha. As they make their way there, the thief looks curiously to the crowds, some of whom scream that Jesus is innocent. They finally arrive at Golgotha and nails are driven through their wrists, painfully securing them to the patibulum. Each man is then hung on his cross due to a large, deep square-shaped groove carved into the stipes and their feet are nailed to a wooden sedile. They hang in agony. Like the crowd, the other thief demands that Jesus save Himself and them. But our thief rebukes the statement, claiming that they are receiving the same punishment that Jesus is, even though He has done no wrong. The thief then asks that Jesus remember him when he comes as king. Jesus tells him that today they will be in paradise together. A while later, a dark storm overwhelms the hill and Jesus dies. A Roman soldier then pierces Jesus' side with his spear causing a mixture of blood and water to erupt from the wound. Afterwards, the thief has his ankles broken and passes away with a gasp. He then sees a whole and undamaged Jesus (who greets him by reciting John 11:25) in a beautiful place which is, just as Jesus promised, paradise. Reception Amanda Lago from GMA News Online of the Philippines gave the film a positive review, praising the animation and cinematography, stating there was \\"a tendency for tight shots—a zoom-in on the eyes of the characters to show pain and regret, and a close-up of a nail being pounded into flesh to highlight the sheer brutality of the crucifixion.\\"Film review: 'My Last Day'—Christ's story for the anime generation.

Varèse's music emphasizes timbre and rhythm. He coined the term \\"organized sound\\" in reference to his own musical aesthetic.Goldman, Richard Franko. 1961. \\"Varèse: Ionisation; Density 21.5; Intégrales; Octandre; Hyperprism; Poème Electronique.

The Musical Quarterly 52, no. 2 (April): 151–170. Varèse thought that \\"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise\\", and he posed the question, \\"what is music but organized noises?\\"Varèse, Edgard, and Chou Wen-chung. 1966. \\"The Liberation of Sound\\" . Perspectives of New Music 5, no. 1 (Autumn–Winter): 11–19. Although his complete surviving works only last about three hours, he has been recognised as an influence by several major composers of the late 20th century. Varèse saw potential in using electronic media for sound production, and his use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the \\"Father of Electronic Music\\" whilst Henry Miller described him as \\"The stratospheric Colossus of Sound\\". Varèse actively promoted performances of works by other 20th-century composers and founded the International Composers' Guild in 1921 and the Pan-American Association of Composers in 1926.  Life and career  = Early life = Edgard Victor Achille Charles Varèse was born in Paris; when he was a few weeks old, he was sent to be raised by his maternal great- uncle and other relations in the small town of Le Villars in the Burgundy region of France. There he developed a very strong attachment to his maternal grandfather, Claude Cortot (also grandfather to the pianist Alfred Cortot, a first cousin of Varèse). His affection for his grandfather outshone anything he felt for his own parents. After being reclaimed by his parents in the late 1880s, in 1893 young Edgard was forced to relocate with them to Turin, Italy, in part, to live amongst his paternal relatives, since his father was of Italian descent. It was there that he had his first real musical lessons, with the long-time director of Turin's conservatory, Giovanni Bolzoni. In 1895, he composed his first opera, Martin Pas, which has since been lost. Now in his teen years, Varèse, influenced by his father, an engineer, enrolled at the Polytechnic of Turin and started studying engineering, as his father disapproved of his interest in music and demanded an absolute dedication to engineering studies. This conflict grew greater and greater, especially after the death of his mother in 1900, until 1903 when Varèse left home for Paris. In 1904, he commenced his studies at the Schola Cantorum (founded by pupils of César Franck), where his teachers included Albert Roussel. Afterwards, he went to study composition with Charles-Marie Widor at the Paris Conservatoire. In this period, he composed a number of ambitious orchestral works, but these were only performed by Varèse in piano transcriptions. One such work was his Rhapsodie romane, from about 1905, which was inspired by the Romanesque architecture of the cathedral of St. Philibert in Tournus. In 1907, he moved to Berlin, and in the same year, he married the actress Suzanne Bing, with whom he had one child, a daughter. They divorced in 1913. During these years, Varèse became acquainted with Erik Satie and Richard Strauss, as well as with Claude Debussy and Ferruccio Busoni, who particularly influenced him at the time. He also gained the friendship and support of Romain Rolland and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, whose Œdipus und die Sphinx he began setting as an opera that was never completed. On 5 January 1911, the first performance of his symphonic poem Bourgogne was held in Berlin. After being invalided out of the French Army during World War I, he moved to the United States in December 1915. Edgard Varèse in 1915 = Early years in the United States = In 1918, Varèse made his debut in America conducting the Grande messe des morts by Berlioz. He spent the first few years in the United States, where he was a Romany Marie's café regularRobert Schulman. Romany Marie: The Queen of Greenwich Village (pp. 64–65). Louisville: Butler Books, 2006. . in Greenwich Village, meeting important contributors to American music, promoting his vision of new electronic art music instruments, conducting orchestras, and founding the short-lived New Symphony Orchestra. In New York, he met Léon Theremin and other composers exploring the boundaries of electronic music. It was also about this time that Varèse began work on his first composition in the United States, Amériques, which was finished in 1921 but would remain unperformed until 1926, when it was premiered by the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski (who had already performed Hyperprism in 1924 and would premiere Arcana in 1927). Virtually all the works he had written in Europe were either lost or destroyed in a Berlin warehouse fire, so in the U.S. he was starting again from scratch. The only surviving work from his early period appears to be the song Un grand sommeil noir, a setting of Paul Verlaine. (He still retained Bourgogne, but destroyed the score in a fit of depression many years later.) At the completion of this work, Varèse, along with Carlos Salzedo, founded the International Composers' Guild, dedicated to the performances of new compositions of both American and European composers. The ICG's manifesto in July 1921 included the statement, \\"[t]he present day composers refuse to die. They have realised the necessity of banding together and fighting for the right of each individual to secure a fair and free presentation of his work.\\" In 1922, Varèse visited Berlin where he founded a similar German organisation with Busoni. Varèse contributed a poem to the Dadaist magazine 391 after an evening of drinking with Francis Picabia on the Brooklyn Bridge. The same magazine claimed that he was orchestrating a \\"Cold Faucet Dance\\". Later that year, he met Louise Norton, who edited another Dadaist magazine, Rogue, with her then-husband. She was to become Louise Varèse and a celebrated translator of French poetry whose versions of the work of Arthur Rimbaud for James Laughlin's New Directions imprint were particularly influential. Varèse composed many of his pieces for orchestral instruments and voices for performance under the auspices of the ICG during its six-year existence. Specifically, during the first half of the 1920s, he composed Offrandes, Hyperprism, Octandre, and Intégrales. He took American citizenship in October 1927. After arriving in the USA Varèse commonly used the form 'Edgar' for his first name but reverted to 'Edgard', not entirely consistently, from the 1940s. = Life in Paris = In 1928, Varèse returned to Paris to alter one of the parts in Amériques to include the recently constructed ondes Martenot. Around 1930, he composed Ionisation, the first Classical work to feature solely percussion instruments. Although it was composed with pre-existing instruments, Ionisation was an exploration of new sounds and methods to create them. In 1928, when he was asked about jazz, he said it was not representative of America but instead was, \\"a negro product, exploited by the Jews. All of its composers here are Jews,\\" meaning Gruenberg and Boulanger students including Copland and Blitzstein.Robert Morse Crunden (2000). Body & Soul: The Making of American Modernism, p. 42–3. . In 1931, he was the best man at the wedding of his friend Nicolas Slonimsky in Paris. In 1933, while still in Paris, he wrote to the Guggenheim Foundation and Bell Laboratories in an attempt to receive a grant to develop an electronic music studio. His next composition, Ecuatorial, was completed in 1934, and contained parts for two fingerboard Theremin cellos, along with winds, percussion, and a bass singer. Anticipating the successful receipt of one of his grants, Varèse eagerly returned to the United States to realize his electronic music. Slonimsky conducted its premiere in New York on April 15, 1934. = Back in the United States = Edgard Varèse in Santa Fe in 1936 Varèse soon left New York City for Santa Fe, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1936, he wrote his solo flute piece, Density 21.5. He also promoted the theremin in his Western travels, and demonstrated one at a lecture at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque on November 12, 1936. (The University has an RCA theremin in its archives which may be the same instrument.) By the time Varèse returned to New York in late 1938, Theremin had returned to Russia. This devastated Varèse, who had hoped to work with him on a refinement of his instrument. He was approached by music producer Jack Skurnick resulting in EMS Recordings #401. The record was the first release on LP of Integrales, Density 21.5, Ionisation and Octandre and featured René Le Roy, flute, the Juilliard Percussion Orchestra and the New York Wind Ensemble conducted by Frederic Waldman. Ionisation had also been the first work by Varèse to be recorded in the 1930s, conducted by Nicolas Slonimsky and issued on 78rpm Columbia 4095M. Likewise, Octandre was recorded and issued on 78rpm discs in the later 1930s, complete (New Music Quarterly Recordings 1411) and as an excerpt (3rd movement, Columbia DB1791 in Volume V of their History of Music). Le Roy was the soloist also on a 1948 (78rpm) recording of Density 21.5 (New Music Recordings 1000). When, in the late 1950s, Varèse was approached by a publisher about making Ecuatorial available, there were very few theremins—let alone fingerboard theremins—to be found, so he rewrote/relabelled the part for ondes Martenot. This new version was premiered in 1961. (Ecuatorial has been performed again with fingerboard theremins in Buffalo, NY in 2002 and at the Holland Festival, Amsterdam, in 2009.) = Background in science = While living with his father, an engineer, Varèse was pushed to further his scientific understanding at the Institute Technique, a high school in Italy that specialized in teaching mathematics and science. Here, Varèse became particularly interested in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. It was through Varèse's love of science that he began to study sound, as he later recalled: Varèse began his music studies with Vincent d'Indy (conducting) at the Schola Cantorum de Paris from 1903–05. While he was in Paris, Varèse had another pivotal experience during a performance of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony at the Salle Pleyel. As the story goes, during the scherzo movement, perhaps due to the resonance of the hall, Varèse had the experience of the music breaking up and projecting in space. It was an idea that stayed with him for the rest of his life, that he would later describe as consisting of \\"sound objects, floating in space.\\" Ouellette's biography = Unfinished projects = From the late 1920s to the end of the 1930s, Varèse's principal creative energies went into two ambitious projects which were never realized, and much of whose material was destroyed, though some elements from them seem to have gone into smaller works. One was a large- scale stage work called by different names at different times, but principally The One-All-Alone or Astronomer (L'Astronome). This was originally to be based on North American Indian legends; later it became a futuristic drama of world catastrophe and instantaneous communication with the star Sirius. This second form, on which Varèse worked in Paris in 1928–1932, had a libretto by Alejo Carpentier, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and Robert Desnos. According to Carpentier, a substantial amount of this work was written but Varèse abandoned it in favour of a new treatment in which he hoped to collaborate with Antonin Artaud. Artaud's libretto Il n'y a plus de firmament was written for Varèse's project and sent to him after he had returned to the U.S., but by this time Varèse had turned to a second huge project. This second project was to be a choral symphony entitled Espace. In its original conception, the text for the chorus was to be written by André Malraux. Later, Varèse settled on a multi- lingual text of hieratic phrases to be sung by choirs situated in Paris, Moscow, Beijing and New York City, synchronized to create a global radiophonic event. Varèse sought input on the text from Henry Miller, who suggests in The Air-Conditioned Nightmare that this grandiose conception—also ultimately unrealized—eventually metamorphosed into Déserts. With both these huge projects Varèse felt ultimately frustrated by the lack of electronic instruments to realize his aural visions. Nevertheless, he used some of the material from Espace in his short Étude pour espace, virtually the only work that had appeared from his pen for over ten years when it was premiered in 1947. According to Chou Wen-chung, Varèse made various contradictory revisions to Étude pour espace which made it impossible to perform again, but the 2009 Holland Festival, which offered a 'complete works' of Varèse over the weekend of 12–14 June 2009, persuaded Chou to make a new performing version (using similar brass and woodwind forces to Déserts and making use of spatialized sound projection). This was premiered at the Gashouder concert hall, Westergasfabriek, Amsterdam by Asko/Schönberg Ensemble and Cappella Amsterdam on Sunday 14 June, conducted by Péter Eötvös. = International recognition = The Philips Pavilion, designed by composer/architect Iannis Xenakis, at the Brussels 1958 World Fair, where Poème électronique was played By the early 1950s, Varèse was in dialogue with a new generation of composers, such as Pierre Boulez and Luigi Dallapiccola. When he returned to France to finalize the tape sections of Déserts, Pierre Schaeffer helped arrange for suitable facilities. The first performance of the combined orchestral and tape sound composition came as part of an ORTF broadcast concert, between pieces by Mozart and Tchaikovsky and received a hostile reaction. Le Corbusier was commissioned by Philips to present a pavilion at the 1958 World Fair and insisted (against the sponsors' resistance) on working with Varèse, who developed his Poème électronique for the venue, where it was heard by an estimated two million people. Using 400 speakers separated throughout the interior, Varèse created a sound and space installation geared towards experiencing sound as it moves through space. Received with mixed reviews, this piece challenged audience expectations and traditional means of composing, breathing life into electronic synthesis and presentation. In 1962, he was asked to join the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and in 1963 he received the premier Koussevitzky International Recording Award. In 1965, Edgard Varese was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal by the MacDowell Colony.  Musical influences  In his formative years, Varèse was greatly impressed by Medieval and Renaissance music – in his career, he founded and conducted several choirs devoted to this repertoire – as well as the music of Alexander Scriabin, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss. There are also clear influences or reminiscences of Stravinsky's early works, specifically Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, on Arcana. He was also impressed by the ideas of Busoni, who christened him L'illustro futuro.  Students and influence  = Students = Varèse taught many prominent composers including Chou Wen-chung, Lucia Dlugoszewski, André Jolivet, Colin McPhee, James Tenney, and William Grant Still. = Influence on classical music = Composers who have claimed, or can be demonstrated, to have been influenced by Varèse include Milton Babbitt, Harrison Birtwistle, Pierre Boulez, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Brian Ferneyhough, Roberto Gerhard, Olivier Messiaen, Luigi Nono, John Palmer, Krzysztof Penderecki, Silvestre Revueltas, Wolfgang Rihm, Leon Schidlowsky, Alfred Schnittke, William Grant Still, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis, Frank Zappa and John Zorn. The conductor of modern music, Robert Craft, recorded two LP volumes of Varèse music in 1958 and 1960 with percussion, brass, and wind sections from the Columbia Symphony Orchestra for Columbia Records (Columbia LP catalog Nos.MS6146 and MS6362). These recordings brought Varèse wide attention among musicians and musical aficionados beyond his immediate sphere. Much of the percussion music of George Crumb in particular owes a debt to such Varèse works as Ionisation and Intégrales. = Influence on popular music = Varèse's emphasis on timbre, rhythm, and new technologies inspired a generation of musicians who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s. One of Varèse's most devoted fans was the American guitarist and composer Frank Zappa, who, upon hearing a copy of The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Vol. 1 (there was never a Vol. 2) became obsessed with the composer's music. The first album Zappa heard was released on LP by EMS Recordings in 1950, and included Intégrales, Density 21.5, Ionisation, and Octandre. On Zappa's 15th birthday, December 21, 1955, his mother allowed him an expensive long-distance call to Varèse's home in New York City. At the time Varèse was away in Brussels, Belgium, so Zappa spoke to Varèse's wife Louise instead. Eventually Zappa and Varèse spoke on the phone, and they discussed the possibility of meeting each other. Although this meeting never took place, Zappa received a letter from Varèse. Zappa framed this letter and kept it in his studio for the rest of his life. Varèse's spirit of experimentation with which he redefined the bounds of what was possible in music lived on in Zappa's long and prolific career.Russo, Greg. Cosmik Debris: The Collected History and Improvisations of Frank Zappa. New York: Antique Trader Publications, Crossfire Publications, Chris Sansom, 1998, pp. 9–11 Zappa's final project was The Rage and the Fury, a recording of the works of Varèse. In the liner notes of his early albums, he often subtly misquoted the ICG manifesto, \\"The present day composer refuses to die.\\" = Tributes = * The record label Varèse Sarabande Records is named after him. * Keyboard player Robert Lamm of the jazz-rock band Chicago wrote the track \\"A Hit By Varèse\\" for the album Chicago V (1972). * Composer John Zorn has released six CDs dedicated to Varèse and Antonin Artaud: Moonchild, Astronome, Six Litanies for Heliogabalus, The Crucible, Ipsissimus and Templars: In Sacred Blood. * Alan Clayson included an arrangement of \\"Un grand sommeil noir\\" on his album One Dover Soul (2012)  Musical philosophy and composition  = Predictions = On several occasions, Varèse speculated on the specific ways in which technology would change music in the future. In 1936, he predicted musical machines that would be able to perform music as soon as a composer inputs his score. These machines would be able to play \\"any number of frequencies,\\" and therefore the score of the future would need to be \\"seismographic\\" in order to illustrate their full potential. In 1939, he expanded on this concept, declaring that with this machine \\"anyone will be able to press a button to release music exactly as the composer wrote it—exactly like opening up a book.\\" Varèse would not realize these predictions until his tape experiments in the 1950s and 60s. = Idée fixe = Some of Edgard Varèse's works, particularly ArcanaDownes, Edward, sleevenotes to CBS Masterworks 76520 make use of the idée fixe, a fixed theme, repeated certain times in a work. The idée fixe was most famously used by Hector Berlioz in his Symphonie fantastique; it is generally not transposed, differentiating it from the leitmotiv, used by Richard Wagner.

He never married, and upon his death left a fortune with the request that a hospital and school for the poor should be built, now known as James Gillespie's High School. Gillespie Crescent and Gillespie Street (both north of the school) are named after him. Life James Gillespie was born in Roslin, Midlothian, south of Edinburgh, on 28 April 1726. He grew to fame and fortune in the city as a merchant, working with his younger brother John who ran the family shop, and eventually becoming one of Edinburgh's richest men.http://www.jamesgillespiesprimary.co.uk/our- school/school-history/ He had a snuff mill at Colinton employing many people, all of whom it is said were treated well. In 1773 he built Spylaw House, an impressive Georgian mansion house, as his home.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh Most of his staff lived in the house, which was attached to his mill. He was notoriously thrifty and is credited with inventing the phrase \\"waste not, want not\\",http://www.jamesgillespiesprimary.co.uk/our- school/school-history/ though Henry Erskine, alluding to Gillespie's snuff- fortune, said of his handsome carriage, \\"Who would have thought it, that noses had bought it\\". A tablet marks the site of his shop at 231 High Street on the Royal Mile. He died on 8 April 1797 and is buried in a large enclosed vault on the north side of the church in Colinton Churchyard, near his house. His brother had died five years earlier, and as neither had married there was no direct heir. He left an estate plus £12,000, an important sum at the time. School Spylaw House, Edinburgh A quarter of Gillespie's bequest (£2,700) was left for the establishment of a free school for the education of poor boys. The school was founded in 1803. The school was to educate boys between the ages of six and twelve who were required to produce proof of their poverty and a certificate of good health. The school is still in operation and has grown significantly. Since its foundation it has moved and changed ownership several times. In 1923 it opened its doors to girls as well as boys. It now comprises James Gillespie's Primary School and James Gillespie's High School, both colocated in Marchmont. Hospital Gillespie's Hospital (built using monies left in his will) was built on the site of Lord Bargenie's baronial mansion in Bruntsfield, which was demolished in 1800,C McKean, The Wrychtshousis, 'A Very Curious Edifice' in The Book Of The Old Edinburgh Club, New Series vol 3, Edinburgh 1994 much to the chagrin of Henry Cockburn who claimed that the historic and picturesque edifice built originally by a branch of the Napier family had been \\"brutally obliterated\\" while \\"the idiot public looked on in silence\\".H Cockburn, Memorials Of His Time (1851), James Thin reprint 1977, pp.173-4 -- Cockburn alleged that Gillespie had disinherited his nearest relation \\"for the vanity of being remembered by a thing named after himself\\".

It was the first fatal attack on the city's subway system since operations began in 1996. The suspected attacker, Cheng Chieh, then 21, was arrested after the attack. He was sentenced to 144 years in prison and four death sentences, and was executed on 10 May 2016. Attack The attack started on 21 May 2014 at around 16:25 local time, inside a Bannan Line train heading west between Longshan Temple Station in Taipei and Jiangzicui Station in New Taipei. The distance between the two stations is the longest between any two stations in the Taipei metro system, lasting three to five minutes. During the attack, the assailant chased and hacked passengers with a 30 cm long fruit knife. Before the train could stop at Jiangzicui Station, a group of passengers banded together to distance themselves using umbrellas while others tried to discourage the attacker by loudly taunting him. =Victims= According to statistics compiled by the New Taipei Fire Department, the youngest victim was a 26-year-old graduate student at National Cheng Kung University, identified as Chang Cheng-han (male). The other three killed are 28-year-old Hsieh Ching- yun (male), 47-year-old Pan Pi-chu and 62-year-old Lee Tsui-yun (both female). They were all taken to different hospitals in Taipei and New Taipei, the department said. In addition, 24 others were wounded during the knife attack, 10 critically. =Perpetrator= Cheng Chieh () was born on 3 April 1993, and attended schools in Taipei. He grew up with few friends, and was extremely focused on his studies. Cheng was also interested in violent online games and had written horror stories. In elementary school, Cheng threatened to kill classmates over small disagreements. In junior high school, he had carried a knife for a month looking for a chance to stab his teacher. In high school, Cheng began blogging about his plans to kill and posted articles about murders. He enrolled in the Chung Cheng Institute of Technology in 2011 with the intention of receiving military training, but was expelled two years later. He then transferred to Tunghai University. School officials there had noticed Cheng's startling social media activity and offered him counseling before the incident, but no irregularities were discovered. At the time of the attack, Cheng lived in the Banqiao District of New Taipei with his parents and younger brother. Aftermath When the subway train arrived at Jiangzicui Station, a single suspected assailant was subdued by passengers, police and metro staff and taken to the nearby Haishan police station after a brief standoff. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin said police presence on the metro was increased soon after the incident and added that he was requesting reinforcements from the National Police Agency. On 22 May, the suspect was taken to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office for questioning. A prosecutor applied to detain him in the New Taipei District Court, which was approved by a judge around 6:20 am. He was detained in the Taipei Detention Center located in Tucheng District, with an inmate number of 1892. Trainset number 117/118, which was the setting of the stabbing attack, was temporarily withdrawn from service after arrival at Jiangzicui Station and underwent disinfection and change of seats. It was then renumbered 175/176 (173/174 was avoided as the number \\"一七三, 一七四\\" sounded like \\"一起殺、一起死\\", which literally means \\"kill together, die together\\") and returned to service in 2015. =Questioning after attack= New Taipei Police Chief Chen Kuo-en identified the suspected attacker as Cheng Chieh, a 21-year-old second-year student at Tunghai University in the central city of Taichung. Chief Chen said the suspect told police he had wanted to do something \\"shocking and big\\" and had plotted to carry out the attack from childhood. Chen said no other motive was presently known. During questioning, the suspect said he originally intended to attack after his college graduation, but decided to move earlier since he had \\"no classes\\" on 21 May and he had grown tired of living. The suspect stated that he does not admit guilt, feels no regret, wants the death sentence, and that even if his parents were on the train he attacked, he would have killed them, as well as the prosecutors questioning him. Reactions Condolence message displayed on a Taipei Metro television after the incident Tribute at Jiangzicui Station Exit 3 On the evening of 21 May, people began leaving flowers and cards at an exit of Jiangzicui Station to pay tribute to those who died in the attack. On 22 May, President Ma Ying-jeou condemned the attack and ordered the National Police Agency to investigate what led a university student to stab four people to death on a crowded subway train. The Legislative Yuan on 23 May released a joint statement signed by all political parties calling for the National Police Agency to thoroughly re-examine and increase police deployment on metro systems, railways and airports. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced that police officers from precincts in Taipei and New Taipei City are to be permanently deployed at each of the Taipei MRT commuter rail system's 109 stations. General manager Tan Gwa-guang of the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation stated that the company would pay the medical expenses of the victims and set aside NT$4 million to compensate their families. Taipei City Government also raised funds to use as compensation. Tunghai University released an open letter, saying that Cheng is part of the family, and promised to set up an expert committee to investigate the matter. Kuomintang legislator Chiang Huei-chen (江惠貞) said the passengers had put themselves in danger by focusing on their smartphones, while another KMT legislator, Lin Te-fu (林德福), said the passengers should have quickly pressed the emergency alert button in the train, and that the passengers lacked common sense. These remarks had sparked a public outcry against the legislators. The incident has sparked a debate online about whether the death penalty is appropriate punishment for such attacks. A Facebook group named \\"Indefinitely supporting death penalty for Cheng Chieh\\" had over 32,000 \\"likes\\" as of 22 May. Lin Hsin-yi (林欣怡), executive director of the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty, said that the most important thing at present is for the public to think about how to help the victims of the metro slashing spree and ease the survivors and their relatives out of the suffering brought about by the tragedy. On 27 May, Cheng Chieh's parents publicly apologized at Jiangzicui Station and called for a quick death sentence for their son. Trial Cheng was indicted by the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office on 21 July, and charged with four counts of murder and 22 counts of attempted murder. The Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, the company that runs the Taipei Metro, claimed that ridership was down by 945,000 within ten days of Cheng's actions, causing them to lose NT$20.61 million, an amount for which they are suing Cheng. Cheng was found guilty of four counts of murder and 22 counts of attempted manslaughter on 6 March 2015 in the Taiwan New Taipei District Court. For each count of murder, he was sentenced to death and deprivation of citizen's rights for life; for each count of attempted manslaughter, he was sentenced to a jail term of between five years, two months and eight years. His knife was also confiscated. On 7 August, the New Taipei District Court ordered Cheng to pay approximately NT$30 million to ten victims of the attack. His death sentence was appealed to the Taiwan High Court, which upheld the ruling. In a separate ruling on 7 January 2016, the High Court determined that Cheng owed another NT$61.39 million to victims and their families. In February 2016, Cheng was granted permission to attend the Supreme Court proceedings for his final appeal of the death sentence. Cheng became the first defendant subject to a death penalty to appear in front of the Supreme Court when his appeal was heard in April 2016. The court's final decision, to uphold all previous rulings, was issued on 22 April. Cheng's criminal penalties included a total of 144 years imprisonment and four death sentences. =Execution= Justice Minister Luo Ying-shay signed the execution order for Cheng at 17:00 on 10 May 2016. Cheng was executed at 20:47 on the same day. After eating his last meal, a biandang with stewed pork, rice and vegetables, Cheng was given general anesthesia. Soon after its administration, he was laid in a prone position and shot in the heart three times. The 18-day gap between Cheng's final guilty verdict and execution was the shortest in Taiwanese judicial history.

It's the highest located castle building in the Hron area (Pohronie). The castle is built on the north side of a relatively narrow fold of the Hron which is closed by the slopes of the Slovak Ore Mountains (Slovenské Rudohorie) from the south and by the slopes of the Low Tatras from the north. The oldest part of the castle is built on the isolated rock on the last hill of the Low Tatras jag with an altitude of 375m above sea level. History =13th century= After the plundering invasion of the Tatars in 1241 only the stone architecture fortresses withstood the invaders. Therefore Béla IV of Hungary decided to build defensive structures and castles in the middle of the 13th century. The Ľupča castle was one of them. According to preserved written reports the castle was built on an important medieval road called Via Magna and served as a checkpoint on the road from Banská Bystrica to Brezno. In 1255 the castle was mentioned in conjunction with the letters patent for the town Banská Bystrica, chartered by Béla IV in the Ľupča castle. The castle and the extramural monastery were important centres in that time. This was demonstrated by the dispute cause between Béla IV and his son Stephen V of Hungary. The cause was settled in the castle on 3 August 1263 with attendance of highly placed city dignitaries and clergy, to whom belonged also the Ľupča monastery principal, guardian Thomas. The 13th century was characterised by patronage of the monarchy to the castle. This was confirmed by frequent visits of monarchs associated with game hunting in the surrounding forests. The Ľupča caste became a temporary residence of the Hungarian kings, including Béla IV in 1258, 1263, 1265 and from 1267 till 1269. After his death his successor Stephen V visited the castle only twice, as it is reported in documents, in August 1270 and one year later when he confirmed the privilege to comes Ondrej (vogt of Banská Bystrica) for possession of part of the land. The following surrounding villeinage villages belonged to the castle in that period: * Slovenská Ľupča * Lučatín * Priechod * Sv. Ondrej * Brusno * Dubová (part of modern Nemecká) * Zámostie * Lopej * Brezno After the short period of rule of Stephen V, Ladislaus IV of Hungary mounted the throne. His mother Elizabeth the Cuman ruled during his infancy. She visited the castle for the first time in 1274. When Ladislaus IV was recognised as an adult, he visited the castle in 1278 and granted Poniky land to master Filip for his services in the battle on the Marchfeld against the Czech monarch Ottokar II of Bohemia. When the Arpad family died out with the passing of Andrew III of Hungary, the owners of the castle changed frequently. As a royal castle it was often devolved by conquests to the hands of noblemen who did not respect the royal sovereignty. In that period the castle history is connected with the name of the last district mayor of the Zólyom County, magister knight Donč. His close relationships with Ľupča were well documented in the papal memorandum of 1323 where Pope John XXII allowed Donč to be buried in the crypt of the church in Ľupča together with his ancestors. From this memorandum it is also known that not only Zvolen but also Ľupča was a final resting place of Zvolen's county mayors. During 1315-1335 Donč also constructed the stone monastery to the above-mentioned church, the presentday church (one-aisle building) of Zvolenská Ľupča (now Slovenská Ľupča). =14th century= In the 14th century the castle was alternatively the residence of the Hungarian kings. Charles I of Hungary who visited the castle in November 1310 and 1340 confirmed the municipal privileges for Zvolenská Ľupča. Visits of his successor Louis I of Hungary were more frequent. This is shown in the documents issued in the Ľupča castle in that period (1348, 1358, 1360 and 1361). In 1367 Louis I signed a document for Pavol Sclavius in the castle to invite colonists to the village Hronec. Sclavius would become the prefect of the new village. During 1369-1382 Louis I dwelled in the Ľupča castle, what is documented in the charter from 1379 promoting village Ľubietová to a town. In 1380 Louis I granted Brezno's guests the \\"Siavnica right\\", marked the chotar and allowed the free vote for mayor and priest. After one year the Brezno's representatives visited king Louis I in Ľupča castle again to ask for confirmation of their rights by the royal charter.

It was their highest-charting single, charting at #42 on the UK Singles Chart. Theme The song is a defiant response to the perceived racism of the UK Police's \\"stop and search\\" policy. In 2012, Tony Mitchell said that the song summed him up as an artist and that the song was about a real situation in that many youngsters had to deal with such police interactions. He said that he wanted people \\"to like it, for them to like the funny side of it, but understand the seriousness of it as well. At that time with a lot of artists it was cool to be macho, but bringing that wit and humour for me was important.\\" Critical reception Critical reception was mixed. John Murphy of musicOMH said the song was \\"the Mitchells at their most incendiary\\", arguing that the song could potentially be the British version of NWA's \\"Fuck Tha Police\\" and that \\"a whole generation of black youths\\" would be able to identify with it. About the featured artists on the song, he commented: \\"The appearance of both Mike Skinner and Grime's latest rising star Kano gives the track added prestige.\\" Hattie Collins of The Guardian felt that the Mitchells' contribution to the track was inferior to Kano's contribution: \\"their flat flow, perhaps meant to lend a more authentic feel, serves only to make them all the more monotonous\\". Aftermath In an interview with Music Week, Robbie Williams revealed that he had played the song \\"to death\\", and as a result was inspired to record \\"Dickhead\\", a hidden track on his ninth studio album, Rudebox.

He returned with an exclusive franchise agreement to supply LPG from BP's then-new Kwinana Oil Refinery. In September 1956, Kleenheat Gas became the first company to distribute bottled LPG and gas appliances to regional Western Australia.

It is located just north of the central business district, bounded on the north by East 5th Street, on the west by North Jefferson and North Jackson Avenues, on the east by North Madison Avenue, and on the south by East Peach and East Oak Streets. Six of the 76 houses in the district were built before 1900, including the John Newton House, one of the first buildings to be built in El Dorado. Of particular note from this early period is a highly elaborate Queen Anne Victorian at 326 Church Street. There are also only a few houses which were built prior to the discovery of oil in El Dorado in 1921. These are all Plain/Traditional in their styling, although some Craftsman details are visible in the later houses. The discovery of oil was followed by a building boom, and this district saw significant construction until about 1940. Most of the houses built have Craftsman styling, which was popular at the time. Typical features seen in these houses included low-pitch gable roofs with long overhangs and exposed rafter ends. Porches are usually supported by pillars mounted on either stone or brick piers. They are commonly a single story, although there are some that are two or 2-1/2 stories tall. There are some multiunit apartment houses and otherwise distinctive houses in the district. Along North Madison Street there are several houses reflecting popular Revival styles, notably including the Charles H. Murphy Sr. House, a separately-listed house designed by Charles L. Thompson in the English Revival style. There are two houses (711 North Madison and 528 North Jefferson) in the Spanish Revival (Mission) style. Three apartment houses are found in the district: a Mission- style block at 711 North Jefferson, a Craftsman block at 701 North Jefferson, and the Classical Revival El Dorado Apartments at 420 Wilson Place. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, as a well-preserved representative of the city's history between 1880 and 1957.

Herman instead signed the artist D Rock Starr, who had previously provided the hook for the track \\"I Feel Bad for You Son\\" on Half a Klip. D Rock's first single on Chinga Chang was \\"Sour Patch Kid\\", a diss track to Bynes. In October 2013, Chinga Chang signed the rap group G4 Boyz, with distribution provided through Sony Entertainment.

It was founded in 2010 by French entrepreneurs, Matthieu Jost and Marc Dedonder. By 2012, the website was earning 80,000 unique visitors each month. History myGayTrip was founded as a joint venture between Matthieu Jost, Marc Dedonder, and Têtu, a French magazine for gay men. The site was launched as a response to the relative dearth of gay-friendly travel websites and, in particular, the closure of Attitude Travel in 2011. myGayTrip, Têtu, and Têtu Travels (a subsidiary travel agency under Têtu) have all worked closely to provide an improved travel experience for those in the LGBT community, but the partnership has since ended. In 2011, the website achieved a milestone of 50,000 unique visitors per month and 11,000 followers on Facebook. By 2013, those numbers had increased to over 100,000 and 50,000 respectively. The number of destinations and places featured in myGayTrip increased from 15,000 to 20,000 between 2012 and 2013. Also in 2013, myGayTrip entered into a partnership with short-term apartment rental website, Sejourning, to create Misterbnb, a gay-friendly homestay service similar to Airbnb. Overview The website is designed as a travel guide that is similar in style to TripAdvisor. Users participate in rating and commenting on certain establishments and places, including hotels, bars, restaurants, beaches, and more. The site also offers city guides and a full social networking experience. The goal is to provide in-depth information about locales that are gay-friendly and/or accepting of the gay community (including a poll that asks users to rank the most gay-friendly cities in the world). Co-founders, Jost and Dedonder, are attempting to make gay-friendly establishments more accessible and obvious to gay travelers by providing multi-colored logos to participating establishments. The website also offers news that is relevant to gay tourism, travel, and other LGBT topics.

Located along New Hampshire Route 153 on a hill in northern Effingham, it is a well-preserved late 18th and early 19th-century rural village. It is named for Isaac Lord, a leading figure in its development in the early 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The area that is now the village of Lord's Hill was first settled in the 1770s, its hilltop position located along one of the area's range roads (laid out by surveyors). The village became locally prominent in the 1790s, when Isaac Lord built his large Federal-style house, and operated a tavern there. He was instrumental in securing the town's meeting house for the village, which promoted further growth. In 1822 the Effingham Union Academy opened; its building is now a historical society property. The village has seen relatively little alteration since the mid-19th century. A more recent view of the district The historic district covers about , extending from the junction of NH 153 with Plantation Road in the south (the latter a continuation of the historic range road) northward to another junction with Hobbs Road (also a continuation of the range road). It then extends for a short distance along both Hobbs Road and NH 153. At the southern junction is a triangular park around which houses and civic buildings, including the academy and church, are arrayed. The large and stylish house of Isaac Lord is set on the north side of NH 153 just east of the junction with Hobbs Road. Most of the district's 21 properties are residential properties; there are also five small cemeteries. The church was built by Isaac Lord in 1798, and extensively restyled in the 1840s to achieve its present Greek Revival appearance.

The site provides a searchable database of short-term rentals of homes, rooms, and apartments and LGBT+ friendly hotels/motels. The website operates globally and has gone from offering thousands of rooms available in 65 countries to over 200,000 hosts in over 135 countries as of 2019. misterb&b; was called the \\"gay Airbnb\\" by Forbes. The site serves as a catalyst for the gay community to connect in real life, becoming a response for the strong demand for collaborative tourism in the booming niche of gay travel. It is considered the largest gay hotelier in the world. History and formation misterb&b; started as a combination of gay travel website myGayTrip and short-term apartment rental service, Sejourning. It was envisioned as a gay-friendly alternative to Airbnb. Co-founder Matthieu Jost had used services like Airbnb in the past with mixed results. Jost suggested that it was difficult to screen potential hosts to see if they might be gay-friendly. After several uncomfortable experiences, Jost looked into starting his own alternative. The website was launched in the spring of 2014. Since that time, it has featured over 5,000 hosts with rooms and apartments in over 95 countries, including more than 600 vacation rentals in Spain and Portugal alone. By 2015, misterb&b; had 55,000 hosts in over 130 countries, making it the largest gay hotelier in the world. The company was selected for and participated in 500 Startups, one of the largest early-stage accelerators in the world. It was selected by The Next Web as one of the top notable startups from the accelerator. The company also raised $2 million in seed funding at that time. The company raised a series A round of $8.5 million in summer 2017. By 2019, the site had over 200,000 properties in 135 countries with total funding of $13.5 million. Operation The main function of the website is to match prospective LGBT travelers with LGBT-friendly hosts in numerous cities throughout the world. The website encourages its hosts to make their apartments or rooms available during major LGBT events in their city. It also acts as a social networking service, travel guide, and community for gay travelers throughout the world. There is no charge for posting an apartment or room for rent on misterb&b;, but the site charges 4% on room fare from the host and 12% of the final bill from the guest. Users can search using a number of parameters in their desired city. Some of these parameters include: willingness to accept pets, the choice between gay or simply gay-friendly hosts, and an option for seeking out \\"unusual\\" apartments or rooms. Each city also features a \\"Top Rentals\\" list which details the hosts and rooms with the best ratings, comments, and reviews. misterb&b; reported that 60% of its hosts in Paris do not use other sharing accommodation websites. It also provides curated hotels on the platform and tools to help members stay safe such as misterb&b; gift cards. The domain MisterBnB.com was purchased by AirBNB and has been left blank whilst Mister B&B; has had to operate on MisterBandB.com.

Chkhaidze finished fifth in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004) under different banners Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, and later claimed a bronze medal in the men's heavyweight division at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, when he altered his allegiances with the Uzbekistan team. Before ending his sporting career in 2008, Chkhaidze trained for the Trade Union Sports Club in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, under head coach Kamil Fatkulin. Representing his native Georgia, Chkhaidze made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). During the preliminary pool, Chkhaidze upset Polish wrestler and two-time Olympic champion Andrzej Wroński with a striking effort, and fell Turkey's Hakkı Başar off the ring to earn a spot in the knockout rounds, scoring a cumulative total of six points and a set of two triumphs. Followed by the next day's session, Chkhaidze lost his quarterfinal match to U.S. wrestler and junior world champion Garrett Lowney in overtime, until he settled for a fifth-place finish in a consolation battle against Kazakhstan's Sergey Matviyenko. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Chkhaidze qualified under the new Kyrgyzstan team for the men's 96 kg class by receiving a berth and a gold medal from the Asian Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Chkhaidze continued to deliver a more powerful performance by beating Bulgaria's Kaloyan Dinchev and Palau's John Tarkong in the preliminary pool, before he lost his quarterfinal match to Iranian wrestler Masoud Hashemzadeh. Despite receiving another defeat from Cuba's Ernesto Peña in a classification match, Chkhaidze upgraded his position again to fifth for the second time after Hashemzadeh was disqualified for a bronze medal protest. Shortly after the Games, Chkhaidze transferred his allegiance to the Uzbek team due to citizenship issues with Kyrgyzstan. When Chkhaidze competed for Uzbekistan at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, he flourished his wrestling career by picking up the bronze medal in his match against Iraq's Ali Nadhim after his sudden upset from South Korea's Han Tae- Young in the opening round.

Context within Agreement  The accords contain seven Annexes which specify the agreements on a certain topic. Annex III lays out the arrangements for the management of various spheres of civil affairs. Under this Annex, the powers and responsibilities for management of these areas are transferred from the Israeli military government and the Civil Administration to the Palestinian side. Part of the civil affairs are the provisions on the environment.  Contents  = Article 1: Agriculture = Article 1 first names all the aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to veterinary services and livestock management, water for irrigation, grazing and farming, and policies relating to raising and marketing crops. Irrigation water is mentioned and linked to Article 40 on water and sewage, and forestry is dealt with in greater detail in Article 14 on forests. Both sides should cooperate to conduct studies and research collecting scientific data for the development of the agriculture sector. Agriculture Relations such as trade between both sides are mentioned under Annex V (Economic Relations). = Article 12: Environmental Protection = Article 12 is divided into Section A on the “Transfer of Authority” and Section B on “Cooperation and Understandings”. Section A expresses mutual Israeli and Palestinian recognition of the importance of environmental protection and the need for a sustainable approach to using natural resources, and determines the transfer of power to the Palestinian side. Section B reviews various joint measures in protecting the environment relating to policy on natural resources, industrial development, avoiding damages to the environment, addressing pollution, waste and discharge regulations and biodiversity. In particular, mentioned measures are promoting public awareness on environmental issues, adopting international standards on global (ozone layer) and regional concerns (protection of endangered species, restriction of trade, preservation of forests and nature reserves) and implement Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). Schedule 2 lists 12 areas for which Environmental Impact Assessments should be prepared (e.g. power plants, quarries, treatment plants, disposal sides, air- and seaports and major roads). Additionally Israel recognizes the unsatisfactory situation of the environment in the West Bank and obligates itself to assist in improving it. Both parties agree on improving scientific, technical and political cooperation concerning the environment. An Environmental Experts Committee for environmental cooperation and understandings shall be established on both sides. = Article 13: Fishery = This article identifies the licensing and permits for all aspects of the fishing industry along the Gaza Strip, and refers to security restrictions in a separate article (Article XIV). = Article 14, 25, 26: Forests; Nature Reserves; Parks = Management of forests, parks, and nature reserves will be transferred to the Council whose responsibilities will include preservation, administration, prevention of damage, and establishment of new resources (i.e. parks, reserves, and forests). Article 14 specifically affirms the Palestinian administration's right to plant new forests, whether in the interest of environmental protection or for landscaping purposes. Article 25 (Nature Reserves) addresses the enforcement and regulation of hunting and ban on hunting species that are protected and/or endangered. All three articles identify areas for cooperation between both sides. Areas for cooperation include protection, data gathering and scientific research, and ecological services such as managing fires and pest control. The management of forests, parks, and nature reserves is linked to concerns, such as desertification and erosion, which are addressed in Article 12 (Environmental Protection). With respect to Area C, each article affirms the eventual transfer of responsibility for the application of the many provisions to Palestinian administration, except in the case of certain issues which are to be deferred until the permanent status negotiations. Israeli and Palestinian actors are to coordinate all activities with the potential to alter the condition of each sphere and which will occur within Area C, excluding settlements and military zones. = Article 40: Water and Sewage = The agreement rests on good-will and at its core is the principle of Israeli recognition of Palestinians’ rights to water in the West Bank. The main principles address developing additional water, coordinating management of water resources and wastewater systems, treating influent for eventual reuse, and ensuring water quality and the prevention of harm. Powers and responsibilities in the domain of water and sewage in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be transferred to the Palestinian Council, while the question of infrastructure ownership is deferred until the permanent status negotiations. The final principle (paragraph 25) relates to the Gaza Strip and maintains the status quo on already existing provisions and agreements relating to the water resources and sewage systems in the area; schedule 11 reviews these arrangements.  Water Supply  The section includes an estimation of future water needs for Palestinians (70-80 mcm/yr). Israel is committed to providing a total of 9.5 mcm of water per year to major Palestinian cities including Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Salfit, Nablus, Jenin, and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians are to be responsible for providing these areas with the additional supply of 19.2 mcm per year, which may be drawn from the Eastern Aquifer. Schedule 10 enumerates precise allowances for extractions and use of water from the Eastern, North-Eastern, and Western Aquifers.  Management and Cooperation (Joint Water Committee)  Israel and Palestinian administration are to cooperate in the exchange of data and in identification of sites for construction of new wells. The Joint Water Committee is formed to handle all water and sewage issues in the West Bank, including the following responsibilities: the joint management and protection of water resources and sewage systems; handling information exchange, regulation and monitoring, and the resolution of water and sewage conflict. The JWC will act to review all development projects in all their stages and determine whether to issue approval for their implementation. The role and obligations of the Joint Water Committee (Article 40, paragraph 15) are further expanded in Schedule 8. Schedule 9 expands on supervision and enforcement mechanisms (Article 40, Paragraph 17), and addresses water purchases and cost. Paragraph 20 sets forth additional areas for cooperation between various committees with respect to economics and regional development.  Protection and Prevention of Harm and Contamination  Paragraphs 21 through 23 dictate that both sides should endeavor to prevent any harm, pollution, or contamination of the quality of water resources within their respective areas as well as within that of the other's. Paragraph 24 also mandates that both sides will be responsible for compensating the other for “any unauthorized use of or sabotage to water and sewage systems situated in the areas under its responsibility which serve the other side (Article 40, paragraph 24).”  Current situation  The Oslo II accords is the latest agreement between Israel and Palestine concerning the environment. In negotiations and discussions between Israel and Palestine, the parties mainly refer to this judicial framework. However its actual relevance remains unclear. Some provisions like the Environmental Impact Assessments have never been implemented. As one example of temporary cooperation the bilateral environmental committee can be mentioned. It worked until 2000 and managed in this time several trans boundary problems concerning hazardous waste. Although the environmental negotiations that took place within the framework of the Oslo Accords can be seen as a significant milestone for environmental cooperation, many objectives were never achieved. This outcome can be attributed to four main factors: Israeli security concerns, territorial disputes, logistical ambiguities and Palestinian institutional constraints. The Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Committee is an example of still working cooperation. But it is not fulfilling its original purpose of a joint water governance institution. The Committee is now said to be an Israel dominated body that mainly rejects Palestinian requests. Current disputes between Israel and Palestine are often addressing untreated waste water flow into opponent streams.  Criticism  Since the Oslo II accords have been declared to be an interim agreement many aspects remain vague. A following agreement is needed which settles important details. In particular the unsolved dispute about water supply needs to be addressed. Both sides accuse each other for agreement violations. From the Palestinian side Israel does not keep their promise to recognize Palestinian water rights. Israel on the other hand sees Palestinian well drilling without permission as a violation of Oslo II.
