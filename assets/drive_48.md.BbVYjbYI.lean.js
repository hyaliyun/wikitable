Their music has been described as \\"geek rock\\", delving into the harrowing world of pet monitoring devices, comic books, and Middle Eastern food. Influences include what used to be called ‚Äúcollege rock,‚Äù alternative rock, and New Wave‚Äîthings along the lines of Talking Heads, R.E.M., They Might Be Giants, U2, The Cure, XTC, Cake, early The Police. Patrick Nolan played drums in the Jazz band Kurds and Whey from 1991‚Äì1993, and then released a solo album, Gone Astray in 2003. David played guitar in the rock band The Sunmasons from 1989‚Äì1992, and released one cassette, It's OK, I'm with the BAND in 1991. He then went on to sing in the a cappella group Makela along with Jerry Marzouk. Noah and Jackson were both singers in the Spizzwinks(?). Patrick and David started playing together in 2003, and in 2004 invited Jerry to join them as a keyboard player. They then asked their friend Anna London to join them as she learned to play bass. Demolition Shortly after forming, they recorded Demolition at Hit & Run Studios in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Demolition had three original songs, Aliyah L'Regel, Post-Apocalyptic Love Song, and Cyrano, and a cover of The Police song Message in a Bottle. Cover art for Demolition was created by Patrick. Shortly after releasing Demolition, Noah Kaye joined the band after attending one of the early performances. The Sound and the Furry In early 2005, they recorded most of the tracks for The Sound and the Furry, live at Avalon Recording studios in Bethesda, Maryland. Two of the songs, Lojack and King of Falafel, were recorded at the Brass Monkey Saloon in Baltimore, Maryland, and Late Summer' was recorded at Umbrella Studios in Arlington, Virginia. The cover art was an homage to the Beatles album Let it Be, featuring the band's pets. Almost immediately after Figmental Records released The Sound and the Furry, Jerry left the band, and Noah took on primary vocal duties. To the Rescue! In 2006, they decided to record another album with a more 'produced' sound, and returned to Hit & Run Studios to do so. DC comic artist Jake Warrenfelz was commissioned to design the cover, which envisioned the band defending the US Capitol from attack by a giant squid. Before the recording was finished, Anna left the band, and the other members took turns filling in for her on the CD. Jackson Maier replaced her shortly before the CD was released, but after the recording was finished. Lingua Franchise In 2008, they completed another album and hosted their launch party at The Grog and Tankard in Washington, DC on June 7, 2008.

They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers since the late 1920s, under the trade name Westector (now used as a trade name for an overcurrent trip device by Westinghouse Nuclear). In some countries the term \\"metal rectifier\\" is applied to all such devices; in others the term \\"metal rectifier\\" normally refers to copper-oxide types, and \\"selenium rectifier\\" to selenium-iron types.  Description  Copper-oxide rectifier Metal rectifiers consist of washer-like discs of different metals, either copper (with an oxide layer to provide the rectification) or steel or aluminium, plated with selenium. The discs are often separated by spacer sleeves to provide cooling.  Mode of operation  The principle of operation of a metal rectifier is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers (Schottky diodes and p‚Äìn diodes), but somewhat more complex. Both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors, in practice doped by impurities during manufacture. When they are deposited on metals, it would be expected that the result is a simple metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction and that the rectification would be a result of a Schottky barrier. However, this is not always the case: the scientist S. Poganski discovered in the 1940s that the best selenium rectifiers were in fact semiconductor-semiconductor junctions between selenium and a thin cadmium selenide layer, generated out of the cadmium-tin metal coating during processing.https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kroemer- bio.html In any case the result is that there is a depletion region in the semiconductor, with a built-in electric field, and this provides the rectifying action.  Performance  Compared to later silicon or germanium devices, copper-oxide rectifiers tended to have poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely more than a few volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure - a bridge rectifier for a 12V battery charger would often use 12 metal rectifiers. Selenium rectifiers were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.  Applications  =Radio receivers= Metal rectifiers were also used as envelope detector (AM demodulator) diodes in radio receivers. The WX6 Westector was a typical example. It was about the size and shape of an AAA battery, with threaded posts at each end to which connections were made. Selenium rectifiers were once widely used as high-tension rectifiers in transformerless radio and TV sets, before cheaper silicon diodes became available. Although they were reasonably efficient in this application, (at least compared to vacuum-tube rectifiers), their internal resistance tended to increase as they aged. Apart from reducing the available high voltage, this tends to make them run hotter, producing an unpleasant smell as the selenium starts to evaporate. =TV sets and photocopiers= High-voltage selenium rectifier Specially designed selenium rectifiers were once widely used as EHT rectifiers in television sets and photocopiers. A layer of selenium was applied to a sheet of soft iron foil, and thousands of tiny discs (typically 2mm diameter) were punched out of this and assembled as \\"stacks\\" inside ceramic tubes. Rectifiers capable of supplying tens of thousands of volts could be made this way. Their internal resistance was extremely high, but most EHT applications only required a few hundred microamps at most, so this was not normally an issue. With the development of inexpensive high voltage silicon rectifiers, this technology has fallen into disuse. =Electrolysis= Metal rectifiers have been replaced by silicon diodes in most devices, however there are certain applications where the replacement of metal rectifiers with silicon units has proven impractical. These are mostly in electroplating, aluminium smelting and similar high-current low-voltage industrial applications, where the lower forward voltage drop of metal rectifiers is more important than their reverse breakdown voltage. Many purpose-designed transformer-rectifier (\\"Rectiformer\\") units were specifically designed around the characteristics of metal rectifiers, and substituting silicon rectifiers would necessitate replacing the complete assembly. As is the case with many other industrial processes, it is often considerably cheaper and more convenient to pay someone to manufacture replacement \\"legacy\\" metal rectifiers than to replace the rectiformer. Hence, metal rectifiers are still manufactured in small quantities today.

Bollinger. He was raised there and in Baker City, Oregon. Bollinger spent a year (1963) as an exchange student in Brazil with AFS Intercultural Programs. He received his B.S. in political science (Phi Beta Kappa) from the University of Oregon, where he became a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity, and his Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School. He served as a law clerk to Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Chief Justice Warren Burger of the Supreme Court. Bollinger went on to join the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School in 1973, becoming dean of the school in 1987. He became provost of Dartmouth College in 1994 before returning to the University of Michigan in 1996 as president. Bollinger assumed his current position as president of Columbia University in June 2002. On October 19, 2010, the Board of Trustees announced through a university-wide email that Bollinger has agreed to continue as president for at least the next five years. The board explained as the rationale for its decision to extend Bollinger's contract: \\"Columbia is thriving on many levels today, and is well positioned for the long-term both locally and globally, because of Lee‚Äôs distinctive vision of the university‚Äôs vital role in serving our society.

Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger. In the Grutter case, the Court found by a 5‚Äì4 margin that the affirmative action policies of the University of Michigan Law School were constitutional. But at the same time, it found by a 6‚Äì3 margin in the Gratz case that the undergraduate admissions policies of Michigan were not narrowly tailored to a compelling interest in diversity and 20 predetermined points are awarded to underrepresented minorities, and thus that they violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2006, affirmative action in university admissions in the state of Michigan was banned by a ballot initiative known as the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative.

Background He was the only son of Marcus Beresford and his wife Frances Arabella, daughter of Joseph Leeson, 1st Earl of Milltown. Beresford was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1819 and a Master of Arts five years later. He joined the British Army and served in the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers and then in the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Royal Lancers, finally as a major. Career Beresford contested County Waterford unsuccessfully in 1837. He was elected for Harwich in the next general election in 1841, which he represented until 1847. Beresford and Charles Newdegate were the Conservative whips in the House of Commons after the party split over the Corn Laws. His relations with Benjamin Disraeli were strained, with Beresford often taking his cue from Lord Stanley in the Lords instead of the nominal leader in the commons. As Chief Whip he managed the 1852 general election, widely noted for its venality (even by the standards of the day), and was censured by the house for \\"reckless indifference to systematic bribery\\". Disraeli took the opportunity to remove Beresford, who was briefly succeeded as whip by William Forbes Mackenzie. Mackenzie, however, lost his seat for much the same reason, and was in turn succeeded by Sir William Joliffe. The management of elections Disraeli transferred to his solicitor, Philip Rose.Blake, 322; 352. Beresford was appointed Secretary at War in 1852, and on this occasion was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor. Family In 1833, he married Catherine, the youngest daughter of George Robert Heneage, and had by her two sons and a daughter.

It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1980. Medical use Ketanserin is classified as an antihypertensive by the World Health OrganizationATC/DDD Index and the National Institute of Health.Ketanserin It has been used to reverse pulmonary hypertension caused by protamine (which in turn was administered to reverse the effects of heparin overdose). The reduction in hypertension is not associated with reflex tachycardia. It has been used in cardiac surgery. A 2000 Cochrane Review found that, compared to placebo, ketanserin did not provide significant relief for people suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon attacks in the setting of progressive systemic sclerosis (an autoimmune disorder). While the frequency of the attacks was unaffected by ketanserin, there was a reduction in the duration of the individual attacks. However, due to the significant adverse effect burden, the authors concluded that ketanserin's utility for this indication is likely unbeneficial. Research use With tritium (3H) radioactively labeled ketanserin is used as a radioligand for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, e.g. in receptor binding assays and autoradiography. This radio-labeling has enabled the study of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor distribution in the human brain. An autoradiography study of the human cerebellum has found an increasing binding of 3H-ketanserin with age (from below 50 femtomol per milligram tissue at around 30 years of age to over 100 above 75 years). The same research team found no significant correlation with age in their homogenate binding study. Ketanserin has also been used with carbon (11C) radioactively labeled NNC112 in order to image cortical D1 receptors without contamination by 5-HT2 receptors. Pharmacology Ketanserin is a high-affinity non-selective antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors in rodents,NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program with Ki values of 2‚Äì3 nM for the 5-HT2A receptor and 28 nM for the 5-HT2C receptor). In primates including humans however, ketanserin is a more selective antagonist of the 5-HT2A over the 5-HT2C receptor, with Ki values of 2‚Äì3 nM for the 5-HT2Areceptor and 130 nM for the 5-HT2C receptor. In addition to the 5-HT2 receptors, ketanserin is also a high affinity antagonist for the H1 receptor (Ki = 2 nM), and has measurable albeit relatively low affinity for a number of other receptors: * Œ±1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = ~40 nM) * Œ±2-adrenergic receptors = ~200 nM) * 5-HT1D receptors (Ki = ? nM) * 5-HT2B receptors (Ki = ? nM) * 5-HT6 receptors (Ki = ~300 nM) * 5-HT7 receptors (Ki = ? nM) * D1 receptors (~300 nM) * D2 receptors (Ki = ~500 nM) receptors.

Media Democracy encompasses this idea by advocating for ideas such as free and independent press. The overarching goal is to achieve a free, open, and accessible internet for everyone. Thus creating a diverse space for media ownership from all walks of life to contribute into a larger collective without suppression. Such campaigns include ‚ÄúFreedom of The Press‚Äù, ‚ÄúBroadBand Access‚Äù, ‚ÄúNet Neutrality‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMedia Consolidation‚Äù. Media democracy is a democratic approach to media studies that advocates for the reform of mass media to strengthen public service broadcasting and develop participation in alternative media and citizen journalism in order to create a mass media system that informs and empowers all members of society and enhances democratic values. Media is also defined as \\"medium\\" a way of communicating with others. Definition Media democracy focuses on the empowerment of individual citizens and promotion democratic ideals through the spread of information. Additionally, the media system itself should be democratic in its own construction shying away from private ownership or intense regulation. Media democracy entails that media should be used to promote democracy as well as the conviction that media should be democratic itself; media ownership concentration is not democratic and cannot serve to promote democracy and therefore must be examined critically. The concept, and a social movement promoting it, have grown as a response to the increased corporate domination of mass media and the perceived shrinking of the marketplace of ideas. The term refers to a modern social movement evident in countries all over the world which attempts to make mainstream media more accountable to the publics they serve and to create more democratic alternatives. The concept of a media democracy follows in response to the deregulation of broadcast markets and the concentration of mass media ownership. In the book Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, authors Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky outline the propaganda model of media, which states that the private interests in control of media outlets will shape news and information before it is disseminated to the public through the use of five information filters. Media democracy allows people the right to participate in media, it extends the media's relationship to the public sphere, where the information that is gathered and can be viewed and shared by the people. The public sphere is described as a network of communicating information and points of view from people, which is reproduced through communicative action through the media to the public. The relationship of media democracy and the public sphere extends to various types of media, such as social media and mainstream media, in order for people to communicate with one another through digital media and share the information they want to publish to the public. The public sphere can be seen as a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through a medium of talk and a realm of social life which public opinion can be formed. The public sphere is also a democratic system that is open to any free citizen who would like to participate in media if they have any information they would like to share to society. The public sphere has changed because of the development of mass communication, giving people opportunities to participate in media and the right to share information through all channels of communications. The democracy of the public sphere is in the participation of citizens who provide information to the media and share it to society. Media democracy advocates that corporate ownership and commercial pressures influence media content, sharply limiting the range of news, opinions, and entertainment citizens receive. Consequently, they call for a more equal distribution of economic, social, cultural, and information capital, which would lead to a more informed citizenry, as well as a more enlightened, representative political discourse. A media democracy advocates: * Replacing the current corporate media model with one that operates democratically, rather than for profit * Strengthening public service broadcasting * Incorporating the use of alternative media into the larger discourse * Increasing the role of citizen journalism * Turning a passive audience into active participants * Using the mass media to promote democratic ideals The competitive structure of the mass media landscape stands in opposition to democratic ideals since the competition of the marketplace affects how stories are framed and transmitted to the public. This can \\"hamper the ability of the democratic system to solve internal social problems as well as international conflicts in an optimal way.\\" Media democracy is grounded in creating a mass media system that favours a diversity of voices and opinions over ownership or consolidation, in an effort to eliminate bias in coverage. This, in turn, leads to the informed public debate necessary for a democratic state. The ability to comprehend and scrutinize the connection between press and democracy is important because media has the power to tell a society's stories and thereby influence thinking, beliefs and behaviour. Media ownership concentration Cultural studies have investigated changes in the increasing tendency of modern mass media in the field of politics to blur and confuse the boundaries between journalism, entertainment, public relations and advertising. A diverse range of information providers is necessary so that viewers, readers and listeners receive a broad spectrum of information from varying sources that is not tightly controlled, biased and filtered. Access to different sources of information prevents deliberate attempts at misinformation and allows the public to make their own judgments and form their own opinions. This is critical as individuals must be in a position to decide and act autonomously for there to be a functioning democracy. The last several decades have seen an increased concentration of media ownership by large private entities. In the United States, these organizations are known as the Big Six. They include: General Electric, Walt Disney Co., News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom, and CBS Corporation. A similar approach has been taken in Canada, where most media outlets are owned by national conglomerates. This has led to a reduction in the number of voices and opinions communicated to the public; to an increase in the commercialization of news and information; a reduction in investigative reporting; and an emphasis on infotainment and profitability over informative public discourse. The concentration of media outlets has been encouraged by government deregulation and neoliberal trade policies. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed most of the media ownership rules that were previously put in place. This led to a massive consolidation of the telecommunications industry. Over 4,000 radio stations were bought out, and minority ownership in TV stations dropped to its lowest point since 1990 when the federal government began tracking the data. Internet media democracy The World Wide Web, and in particular Web 2.0, is seen as a powerful medium for facilitating the growth of a media democracy as it offers participants, \\"a potential voice, a platform, and access to the means of production\\". The use of digital social networking technologies to promote political dissent and reform lends credibility to the media democracy model. This is apparent in the widespread protests in the Middle East and North Africa known as the Arab Spring where social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube allowed citizens to quickly connect, exchange information, and organize protests against their governments. While social media cannot solely be credited with the success of these protests, the technologies played an important role in instilling change in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. These acts show a population can be informed through alternative media channels and can adjust its behaviour accordingly. Crowdfunded websites have also been linked to a heightened spread of media democracy. Feminism Though the model aims to democratize the opinions expressed within the mass media as well as the ownership of media entities themselves, feminist media theory argues that the media cannot be considered truly inclusive or democratic insofar as they rely on the masculine concepts of impartiality and objectivity. Creating a more inclusive and democratic media would require reconceptualizing how we define the news and its principles. According to some feminist media theorists, news is like fictional genres that impose order and interpretation on its materials by means of narrative. Consequently, the news narrative put forward presents only one angle of a much wider picture. It is argued that the distinction between public and private information that underpins how we define valuable or appropriate news content is also a gendered concept. The feminist argument follows that the systematic subversion of private or subjective information excludes women's voices from the popular discourse. Further to this point, feminist media theorists argue there is an assumed sense of equality or equalness implicit in the definition of the public that ignores important differences between genders in terms of their perspectives. So while media democracy in practice as alternative or citizen journalism may allow for greater diversity, these theorists argue that women's voices are framed within a masculine structure of objectivity and rationalist thinking. Despite this criticism, there is an acceptance among some theorists that the blurring of public and private information with the introduction of some new alternative forms of media production (as well as the increase in opportunities for interaction and user-generated content) may signal a positive shift towards a more democratic and inclusive media democracy. Some forms of media democracy in practice (as citizen or alternative journalism) are challenging journalism's central tenets (objectivity and impartiality) by rejecting the idea that it is possible to tell a narrative without bias and, more to the point, that it is socially or morally preferable. Criticism Media has given political parties the tools to reach large numbers of people and can inform them on key issues ranging from policies to elections. In theory, media should be seen as an enabler for democracy, having better-educated voters would lead to a more legitimate government. However, critics such as Julian King has argued that those exact tools can easily be hijacked by malicious actors - both state and non-state - and in turn be used as a weapon against us. And in the past few years, media has become a direct threat to democracy.King, J (2017).Democracy is under threat from the malicious use of technology. The EU is fighting back. The Guardian Two organisations of the Omidyar Group, Democracy Fund and Omidyar Network assembled to establish the relationship between media and democracy. Their initial findings presented six ways that social media was a direct threat to democracy.Omidyar, P. (2018) Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy?(PDF) Certain social media platforms such as Facebook, display adverts that would most likely appeal to the consumer and therefore, presents the first negative effect media has on democracy which is \\"Personal data capture and targeted messaging/advertising\\". With users leaving digital footprints almost everywhere they go, social media platforms are able to create portfolios of the user and target them with specific advertisements.Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy? (PDF)The Omidyar Group. pp. 11-12 This leads to the formation of \\"echo chambers, polarisation and hyper-partisanship.\\" Social media platforms therefore, create bubbles, which are forever growing, of one-sided information and opinions, trapping the users and diminishing opportunities for a healthy discourse.Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy? (PDF)The Omidyar Group. pp. 6 A commonly known effect social media has on democracy is the \\"spread of false and/or misleading information\\". Disinformation and Misinformation is commonly, at scale, spread across social media by both state and private actors, mainly using bots. Each type poses a threat as it floods social media with multiple, competing realities shifting the truth, facts and evidence to the side.Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy?

In theory, it creates a distorted system of evaluating information and provides a false representation. It's further harder to distinguish who is a troll or a bot.Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy? (PDF)The Omidyar Group. pp. 9 Social media further allows for manipulation by \\"populist leaders, governments and fringe actors\\". \\"Populist\\" leaders use platforms such as Twitter, Instagram to communicate with their electorate. However, such platforms allow them to roam freely with no restrictions allowing them to silence the minority voice, showcase momentum for their views or creating the impression of approval. Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy? (PDF)The Omidyar Group. pp. 10-11 Finally, social media causes the disruption of the public square. Some social media platforms have user policies and technical features that enable unintended consequences, such as hate speech, terrorist appeals, sexual and racial harassment, thus discouraging any civil debates. This leads the targeted groups to opting out of participating in public discourse.Omidyar, P. (2018)Is Social Media a Threat to Democracy? (PDF)The Omidyar Group. pp. 13 as much as social media has made it easier for the public to receive and access news and entertainment from their devices it has been dangerous in terms of rapid spread of fake news (2019). the public is now easily accessible to those with the intend to spread disinforming information in order to harm and misled the public. those in authority, officials and the elite use their power to dominate the narratives on social media often times to gain their support and misled them.  Restriction in Media  Restrictions in media may exist either directly or indirectly. Before internet usage of media, as well as social media, became prominent, ordinary citizens rarely had much control over media. Even as the usage of social media has increased, major corporations still maintain the primary control over media as they are acquiring more and more platforms that would be considered in public use today. Media has been compared in the sense that it is the usage of media that determines how the content is considered, rather than the actual messages of the content. According to Alec Charles edited Media/Democracy, ‚ÄúIt is not the press or television or the internet or even democracy itself that is good or bad. It is what we do with them that makes them so‚Äù.Charles, A. (2013). Media/Democracy : A Comparative Study. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing The role government plays in media restrictions in media has been viewed with skepticism as well. The government involvement in media is possibly due to distrust between the government and media, as the government has criticized media before. Partial blame for distrust between the government and the public on both sides often goes to media as the public may feel as though there is false information though media and the government may feel as though media is giving the public false information.Cammaerts, B., & Carpentier, N. (2007). Reclaiming the Media : Communication Rights and Democratic Media Roles. Bristol, UK: Intellect These functions of media in the way that it exists is described in a review of Victor Pickard's book, America's Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform, where Josh Shepperd wrote, ‚ÄúIf one approaches the historical question of media ownership from a public service model, the private emphasis of the system requires praise for its innovations and self- sustainability, but deserves deep interrogation for its largely uncontested claim that the system, as is, provides the best opportunity for social recognition‚Äù.  Normative roles of media in democracy  = ‚Ä¢Monitorial role = Media democracy organized scanning of the real world of people, status and events, and potentially relevant sources of information.

Birchenough Bridge is called after Sir Henry Birchenough. Birchenough Bridge is located 62 km from Chipinge in the Manicaland province of Zimbabwe linking Chipinge with Buhera. History The bridge was funded at a cost of ¬£145 000.00 and planned by the Beit Trust, a foundation chaired at the time by Sir Henry Birchenough whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge.Rhodesian Heritage Ralph Freeman, the bridge's designer, was also the structural designer on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935. At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time. In the 1970s a 40-tonne load limit was imposed on the bridge but in 1984 the bridge was widened (roadway: 7.2 m to 10 m wide) and strengthened as part of the World Bank's Highway Project One. The village which sprang up next to the bridge has become the centre of a small-scale farming area. The bridge is widely considered by Zimbabweans as being one of the country's finest pieces of engineering, and as such, it appears on the twenty-cent coin. The Zimbabwe Department of Roads has reduced its load capacity not to allow any vehicle weighing more than 25 tonnes. This had reduced business activities in the areas nearby since heavy vehicle trucks will not be allowed to cross the bridge.

Early life and education Muhlenberg was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, in Berks County on September 25, 1887. He was the son of Dr. William Frederick and Henrietta Augusta (Muhlenberg) Muhlenberg, a grandson of Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, and a great-great-grandson of Rev. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg. A 1904 graduate of Reading Boys' High School, Muhlenberg attended Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1908. Muhlenberg earned his Bachelor of Science in Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1912, followed by his Master of Science from Gettysburg College in 1915, while serving as an officer of the T-Square Club. He received an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1942 from Muhlenberg College of Allentown. Military service During World War I, he was a captain in the 314th Infantry Regiment serving from September 1917 to March 1919. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart, the Legion of Merit, the Verdun Medal, the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur and the Croix de guerre with Palm for his actions in World War I. Muhlenberg served continuously in the regular army reserves for more than 20 years. He re-entered the United States Army in 1940, where he served during World War II as a Lieutenant colonel and Colonel in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, as an aide to Gen. Brehon Summervell, and as district engineer in Cincinnati. Architecture As an architect, Muhlenberg apprenticed with Charles Barton Keen, Magaziner & Potter, and John T. Windrim in Philadelphia. In 1917 he began operating independently, and on May 1, 1919, following his service in World War I, he announced a reopening of his Philadelphia office. In 1920, Muhlenberg joined the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and opened an office of Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Architect, in Reading. He is listed in the Philadelphia city directories as an architect in 1921, 1922 and 1923, with his residential address given as Reading. By the mid-1920s, the practice, now located exclusively in Reading, was thriving. The firm continued through several reorganizations to its present form as Muhlenberg Greene Architects. During the intervening years, to accommodate the reorganizations, the firm operated for various periods under the following names (dates, in some cases, are approximate): *Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Architect, 1920‚Äì1930 *Muhlenberg & Muhlenberg, 1925‚Äì1935 :(Partner was Frederick Hunter Muhlenberg II, previously of Muhlenberg Brothers) *Muhlenberg, Yerkes, Muhlenberg, 1935‚Äì1954 :(Partners were Simeon M.

Greene, Jr. and Elmer Veres) *Muhlenberg Greene Architects, 1972‚Äì1980 *Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd., 1980‚Äìpresent In the 1950s, Muhlenberg was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Politics Muhlenberg served on the Reading City Council from 1932‚Äì1936, and he was a councilman for the Borough of Wernersville during the 1920s, where he returned to live in his later years. He became the Republican Party chairman for Berks County from 1935‚Äì1940. In 1946, Muhlenberg was elected to the 80th Congress from Pennsylvania. He became the seventh member of his family to be elected to the U.S. Congress, where he served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1947, until January 3, 1949; but he lost a re-election bid in 1948, defeated by Democrat George M. Rhodes. Retirement In a personal biography he furnished to the Reading Eagle, Muhlenberg listed the accomplishments of a \\"life built on service in four separate careers: architecture, military, social service and political.\\" Retiring officially from Muhlenberg Greene Architects in 1977, one week after his 90th birthday, Muhlenberg continued to go to the office daily, until physical limitations prevented him from doing so about a year later. \\"You can't actually retire,\\" he said at the time. \\"There really isn't any such thing. I don't intend to sit on my fanny and do nothing. At 90 years old, you change and have physical limitations. The pace may slow down, but the ideas are still there.\\" Muhlenberg died at 92 years of age in Reading on January 19, 1980. As a veteran, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. A collection of awards, military medals, paperwork and other items related to Representative Muhlenberg is held by the Historical Society of Berks County. Associations Frederick Muhlenberg served as chairman for numerous civic and professional organizations, including the Association of Schuylkill River Municipalities, Director of the American Red Cross Berks County Chapter (1929-), Chairman of the Red Cross Disaster Relief Commission (1935), the State Board of Examiners of Architects, President of the Social Welfare League (1922-1935), Public Charities Association (1927-), and the State Art Commission (1952-1963). Most notably, he served at the Berks County Planning Commission, leading as Chairman from the Commission's founding in 1954 until 1972 when he retired. In addition, he was a member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board. Muhlenberg served as commander of Gregg Post, American Legion, in 1924, and a member of General Hunter Liggett Post, No. 38, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Reading Post, No. 10, Disabled American Veterans. Awards Listed in Who's Who in America, Muhlenberg received scores of educational, civilian, military and social service awards, including: *Man of the Year, Reading Chamber of Commerce, 1960 *Community Service Award, Reading Chamber of Commerce, 1967 *Good Citizenship Award, Gen.

In other words, the density altitude is the air density given as a height above mean sea level. The density altitude can also be considered to be the pressure altitude adjusted for a non-standard temperature. Both an increase in the temperature and a decrease in the atmospheric pressure, and, to a much lesser degree, an increase in the humidity, will cause an increase in the density altitude. In hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be significantly higher than the true altitude. In aviation, the density altitude is used to assess an aircraft's aerodynamic performance under certain weather conditions. The lift generated by the aircraft's airfoils, and the relation between its indicated airspeed (IAS) and its true airspeed (TAS), are also subject to air- density changes. Furthermore, the power delivered by the aircraft's engine is affected by the density and composition of the atmosphere. Aircraft safety Air density is perhaps the single most important factor affecting aircraft performance. It has a direct bearing on:AOPA Flight Training, Volume 19, Number 4; April 2007; Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; ISSN 1047-6415 * The lift generated by a wing ‚Äî a reduction in the air density reduces the wing's lift. * The efficiency of a propeller or rotor ‚Äî which for a propeller (effectively an airfoil) behaves similarly to lift on a wing. * The power output of an engine ‚Äî the power output depends on the oxygen intake, so the engine output is reduced as the equivalent dry-air density decreases, and it produces even less power as moisture displaces oxygen in more humid conditions. Aircraft taking off from a ‚Äúhot and high‚Äù airport, such as the Quito Airport or Mexico City, are at a significant aerodynamic disadvantage. The following effects result from a density altitude that is higher than the actual physical altitude: * An aircraft will accelerate more slowly on takeoff as a result of its reduced power production. * An aircraft will need to achieve a higher true airspeed to attain the same amount of lift ‚Äî this implies both a longer takeoff roll and a higher true airspeed, which must be maintained while airborne to avoid stalling. * An aircraft will climb more slowly as a result of its reduced power production and reduced lift. Due to these performance issues, an aircraft's takeoff weight may need to be lowered, or takeoffs may need to be scheduled for cooler times of the day. The wind direction and the runway slope may need to be taken into account. Skydiving The density altitude is an important factor in skydiving, and one that can be difficult to judge properly, even for experienced skydivers. In addition to the general change in wing efficiency that is common to all aviation, skydiving has additional considerations. There is an increased risk due to the high mobility of jumpers (who will often travel to a drop zone with a completely different density altitude than they are used to, without being made consciously aware of it by the routine of calibrating to QNH/QFE). Another factor is the higher susceptibility to hypoxia at high density altitudes, which, combined especially with the unexpected higher free-fall rate, can create dangerous situations and accidents. Parachutes at higher altitudes fly more aggressively, making their effective area smaller, which is more demanding for a pilot's skill and can be especially dangerous for high- performance landings, which require accurate estimates and have a low margin of error before they become dangerous. Calculation The density altitude can be calculated from the atmospheric pressure and the outside air temperature (assuming dry air) using the following formula: : \\\\text{DA} = \\\\frac{T_{\\\\text{SL}}}{\\\\Gamma} \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{P / P_{\\\\text{SL}}}{T / T_{\\\\text{SL}}} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma R}{g M - \\\\Gamma R}} \\\\right]. In this formula, : \\\\text{DA} = Density altitude in meters ( \\\\mathrm{m} ); : P = (Static) atmospheric pressure; : P_{\\\\text{SL}} = Standard sea-level atmospheric pressure ( 1013.25 hectopascals ( \\\\mathrm{hPa} ) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), or 29.92 inches of mercury ( \\\\mathrm{inHg} ) in the U.S. Standard Atmosphere); : T = Outside air temperature in kelvins ( \\\\mathrm{K} ) (add 273.15 to the temperature in degrees Celsius ( {^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}} )); : T_{\\\\text{SL}} = ISA sea-level air temperature = 288.15 ~ \\\\mathrm{K} ; : \\\\Gamma = ISA temperature lapse rate = 0.0065 ~ \\\\mathrm{K}/\\\\mathrm{m} ; : R = Ideal gas constant = 8.3144598 ~ \\\\mathrm{J}/(\\\\mathrm{mol} ~ \\\\mathrm{K}) ; : g = Gravitational acceleration = 9.80665 ~ \\\\mathrm{m}/\\\\mathrm{s}^{2} ; : M = Molar mass of dry air = 0.028964 ~ \\\\mathrm{kg}/\\\\mathrm{mol} . =The National Weather Service (NWS) formula= The National Weather Service uses the following dry- air approximation to the formula for the density altitude above in its standard: : \\\\text{DA} = (145442.16 ~ \\\\mathrm{ft}) \\\\times \\\\left( 1 - \\\\left[ \\\\frac{(17.326 ~ {^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{F}}/\\\\mathrm{inHg}) \\\\times P}{459.67 ~ {^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{F}} + T} \\\\right]^{0.235} \\\\right). In this formula, : \\\\text{DA} = Density altitude in feet ( \\\\mathrm{ft} ); : P = Station pressure (static atmospheric pressure) in inches of mercury ( \\\\mathrm{inHg} ); : T = Station temperature (outside air temperature) in degrees Fahrenheit ( {^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{F}} ). Note that the NWS standard specifies that the density altitude should be rounded to the nearest 100 ~ \\\\mathrm{ft} . =Approximation formula for calculating the density altitude from the pressure altitude= This is an easier formula to calculate (with great approximation) the density altitude from the pressure altitude and the ISA temperature deviation: : \\\\text{DA} = \\\\text{PA} + (118.8 ~ \\\\mathrm{ft}/{^{\\\\circ} \\\\mathrm{C}}) \\\\times (\\\\text{OAT} - \\\\text{ISA temperature}).

A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill of materials is often tied to a production order whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the bill of materials that are in stock and requisitions for components that are not in stock. A BOM can define products as they are designed (engineering bill of materials), as they are ordered (sales bill of materials), as they are built (manufacturing bill of materials), or as they are maintained (service bill of materials). The different types of depend on the business need and use for which they are intended. In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase \\"bill of material\\" (or \\"BOM\\") is frequently used by engineers attributively to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test. Sometimes the term \\"pseudo-bill of materials\\" or \\"pseudo-BOM\\" is used to refer to a more flexible or simplified version. Often a place-holder part number is used to represent a group of related (usually standard) parts that have common attributes and are interchangeable in the context of this BOM. In electronics, the BOM represents the list of components used on the printed wiring board or printed circuit board. Once the design of the circuit is completed, the BOM list is passed on to the PCB layout engineer as well as the component engineer who will procure the components required for the design. BOMs are of hierarchical nature, with the top level representing the finished product which may be a sub-assembly or a completed item. BOMs that describe the sub- assemblies are referred to as modular BOMs. An example of this is the NAAMS BOM that is used in the automotive industry to list all the components in an assembly line. The structure of the NAAMS BOM is System, Line, Tool, Unit and Detail. The first hierarchical databases were developed for automating bills of materials for manufacturing organizations in the early 1960s. At present, this BOM is used as a data base to identify the many parts and their codes in automobile manufacturing companies. A bill of materials \\"implosion\\" links component pieces to a major assembly, while a bill of materials \\"explosion\\" breaks apart each assembly or sub-assembly into its component parts. A modular BOM can be displayed in the following formats: * A single-level BOM that displays the assembly or sub-assembly with only one level of children. Thus it displays the components directly needed to make the assembly or sub-assembly. * An indented BOM that displays the highest-level item closest to the left margin and the components used in that item indented more to the right. * Modular (planning) BOM A BOM can also be visually represented by a product structure tree, although they are rarely used in the workplace. For example, one of them is Time-Phased Product Structure where this diagram illustrates the time needed to build or acquire the needed components to assemble the final product. For each product, the time phased product structure shows the sequence and duration of each operation. Configurable BOM A configurable bill of materials (CBOM) is a form of BOM used by industries that have multiple options and highly configurable products (e.g. telecom systems, data- center hardware (SANS, servers, etc.), PCs, cars). The CBOM is used to dynamically create \\"end-items\\" that a company sells. The benefit of using CBOM structure is that it reduces the work-effort needed to maintain product structures. The configurable BOM is most frequently driven by \\"configurator\\" software, however it can be enabled manually (manual maintenance is infrequent because it is unwieldy to manage the number of permutations and combinations of possible configurations). The development of the CBOM is dependent on having a modular BOM structure in place. The modular BOM structure provides the assemblies/sub-systems that can be selected to \\"configure\\" an end-item. While most configurators utilize top-down hierarchical rules syntax to find appropriate modular BOMs, maintenance of very similar BOMs (i.e., only one component is different for various voltages) becomes highly excessive. A newer approach, (bottom-up/rules-based structuring) utilizing a proprietary search engine scheme transversing through selectable componentry at high speeds eliminates the planning modular BOM duplications. The search engine is also used for all combinatorial feature constraints and GUI representations to support specification selections. To decide which assembly variant of the parts or components is to be chosen, they are attributed by the product options which are the characteristic features of the product. If the options of the product build an ideal Boolean algebra, it is possible to describe the connection between parts and product variants with a Boolean expression, which refers to a subset of the set of products. Parts which will not be assembled at all in one or more variants are typically marked as \\"DNP\\" (for \\"do not populate\\" or \\"do not place\\") in the affected variants. Other less frequently used designators for this include \\"NP\\" (\\"no placement\\", \\"not placed\\"), \\"DNM\\" (\\"do not mount\\"), \\"NM\\" (\\"not mounted\\"), \\"DNI\\" (\\"do not install\\", \\"do not insert\\"), \\"DNE\\" (\\"do not equip\\"), \\"DNA\\" (\\"do not assemble\\"), \\"DNS\\" (\\"do not stuff\\"), \\"NOFIT\\" etc. Multi-level BOM A multi-level bill of materials (BOM), referred to as an indented BOM, is a bill of materials that lists the assemblies, components, and parts required to make a product in a parent- child, top-down method. It provides a display of all items that are in parent- children relationships. When an item is a sub-component, of a (parent) component, it can in-turn have its own child components, and so on. The resulting top-level BOM (item number) would include children; a mix of finished sub-assemblies, various parts and raw materials. A multi-level structure can be illustrated by a tree with several levels. In contrast, a single-level structure only consists of one level of children in components, assemblies and material.

Asimov's depiction of Multivac, a mainframe computer accessible by terminal, originally by specialists using machine code and later by any user, and used for directing the global economy and humanity's development, has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period (1950s-1960s), and Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL 9000.  Description  Like most of the technologies Asimov describes in his fiction, Multivac's exact specifications vary among appearances. In all cases, it is a government- run computer that answers questions posed using natural language, and is usually buried deep underground for security purposes. According to his autobiography In Memory Yet Green, Asimov coined the name in imitation of UNIVAC, an early mainframe computer. Asimov had assumed the name \\"Univac\\" denoted a computer with a single vacuum tube (it actually is an acronym for \\"Universal Automatic Computer\\"), and on the basis that a computer with many such tubes would be more powerful, called his fictional computer \\"Multivac\\". His later short story \\"The Last Question\\", however, expands the AC suffix to be \\"analog computer\\". However, Asimov never settles on a particular size for the computer (except for mentioning it is very large):86 or the supporting facilities around it. In the short story \\"Franchise\\" it is described as half a mile long (c. 800 meters) and three stories high, at least as far as the general public knows, while \\"All the Troubles of the World\\" states it fills all of Washington D.C.. There are frequent mentions of corridors and people inside Multivac. Unlike the artificial intelligences portrayed in his Robot series, Multivac's early interface is mechanized and impersonal, consisting of complex command consoles few humans can operate. In \\"The Last Question\\", Multivac is shown as having a life of many thousands of years, growing ever more enormous with each section of the story, which can explain its different reported sizes as occurring further down the internal timeline of the overarching story.:20 Storylines Multivac appeared in over a dozen science fiction stories by American writer Isaac Asimov, some of which have entered the popular imagination. In the early Multivac story, \\"Franchise\\", Multivac chooses a single \\"most representative\\" person from the population of the United States, whom the computer then interrogates to determine the country's overall orientation. All elected offices are then filled by the candidates the computer calculates as acceptable to the populace. Asimov wrote this story as the logical culmination ‚Äì and/or possibly the reductio ad absurdum ‚Äì of UNIVAC's ability to forecast election results from small samples. In possibly the most famous Multivac story, \\"The Last Question\\", two slightly drunken technicians ask Multivac if humanity can reverse the increase of entropy. Multivac fails, displaying the error message \\"INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER\\". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally the universe dies. At that point Multivac's final successor, the Cosmic AC (which exists entirely in hyperspace) has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Cosmic AC drew all of humanity into hyperspace, to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Cosmic AC did decipher the answer, announcing \\"Let there be light!\\" and essentially ascending to the state of the God of the Old Testament. Asimov claimed this to be the favorite of his stories. In \\"All the Troubles of the World\\", the version of Multivac depicted reveals a very unexpected problem. Having had the weight of the whole of humanity's problems on its figurative shoulders for ages it has grown tired, and sets plans in motion to cause its own death.  Significance  Asimov's depiction of Multivac has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period, just as his development of robots defined a subsequent generation of thinking machines, and Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL 9000. Though the technology initially depended on bulky vacuum tubes, the concept ‚Äì that all information could be contained on computer(s) and accessed from a domestic terminal ‚Äì constitutes an early reference to the possibility of the Internet (as in \\"Anniversary\\"). \\"About MultiVAX\\". Multivac has been considered within the context of public access information systems and used in teaching computer science, as well as with regard to the nature of an electoral democracy, as its influence over global democracy and the directed economy increased (\\"Franchise\\"). Asimov stories featuring Multivac have also been taught in literature classes. In AI control terms, Multivac has been described as both an 'oracle' and a 'nanny'.

The West End is so named because it was the westernmost part of the original L'Enfant Plan for the city of Washington, before the annexation of Georgetown. It is home to the embassies of Spain and Qatar as well as the Delegation of the European Union to the United States. The George Washington University and George Washington University Hospital are on the edge of the West End, at Washington Circle. The West End is home to numerous luxury hotels, upscale condominiums, and fine dining restaurants. The neighborhood exists due in large part to a 1972 urban renewal plan prepared by the city's Office of Planning and Management, designed \\"to bring life to a declining part of the city.\\" Titled \\"New Town for the West End,\\" the aerial photograph on the cover of the study showed the area that was planned to become a \\"new intown community.\\" The neighborhood is adjacent to Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, and Downtown. History Historically, West End was a predominantly African American community with brick Victorian rowhouses and warehouses. Jazz pianist and composer Duke Ellington was born in the neighborhood in 1899. Recent developments The West End is currently a hotbed of development, with hundreds of new luxury condominiums either under construction or in the planning phase. In 2007, controversy began over the last remaining \\"underdeveloped\\" parcel of land, known as Square 37. Bordered by 23rd Street, 24th Street, L Street, and an alleyway, this anomaly, composed of low-rise buildings from the 1800s to the 1960s, stands out amid a sea of new luxury highrises. Square 37 was home to the Tiverton, the last remaining rent-controlled apartment building in the West End. The Tiverton tenants gained local media attention for successfully battling two upzoning attempts by developers in an effort to maintain the square as-is. Trader Joe's grocery store opened in the neighborhood in September 2006, next to the former Columbia Hospital for Women, now a luxury condominium. The D.C. Council passed controversial emergency legislation in 2007 to sell the West End public library branch, the D.C. Special Operations Police Station (both on Square 37), and a firehouse (on neighboring Square 50) to the developer Eastbanc. A new West End Neighborhood Library opened in 2017.

The plot centers on Kermit the Frog who, after losing all hope for saving the Muppet Theatre, is assisted by an angel who shows him a world in which he was never born. The film is a homage to Frank Capra's 1946 film, It's a Wonderful Life, which has a similar plot. This was the first Muppet production without the involvement of veteran Muppet performer Frank Oz. Instead, Eric Jacobson performed Oz's characters Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and Animal, marking his feature film debut as those characters and Kevin Clash performed Oz's character Sam the Eagle. This is also one of the few Muppets- related productions that are currently not owned by The Walt Disney Company, and the only one owned by NBCUniversal with MGM Television handling distribution for 1974-2004 NBC Studios library. Plot During the holiday season, the Muppet Theater is going through financial hardship, and the Muppets are seeking Kermit the Frog for guidance. Kermit eventually feels he is not useful to anyone and an angel named Daniel (David Arquette) brings this up with his Boss (Whoopi Goldberg) as they review what has gone on with Kermit in the past hours. Hours earlier, Kermit prepares a Christmas show with his fellow Muppets with Bobo the Bear playing Santa Claus. Kermit is approached by Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack), a banker/real estate agent who says that she will foreclose the Muppet Theater if Kermit does not pay her. Pepe the King Prawn leaves the Muppets because he has fallen in love with Bitterman. While trying to raise money to pay Rachel, Kermit tries to find a celebrity to participate in his Christmas play to no avail. Meanwhile, after learning from Pepe that the deadline is midnight, Bitterman changes it to 6:00 p.m. Pepe overhears this and warns Kermit about the deadline change. Upon learning this, Kermit sends Fozzie to deliver the money to Bitterman. Fozzie confronts a crazed nature-show host (spoofing Steve Irwin), and a gang of Whos after being dyed green at a Christmas tree lot and mistaken for the Grinch. Fozzie goes through the steam baths and ends up back to normal. When Fozzie eventually makes it to the bank and Bitterman's office, he goes through a gigantic web of burning lasers leading to Bitterman's office several times before finally discovering that he's too late and that he has grabbed the wrong bag containing clothes for the Salvation Army following his incident at the Christmas tree lot. After witnessing these events, the Boss allows Daniel to help Kermit. When Daniel arrives, and after Kermit wishes he has never been born, he ends up showing Kermit what would have happened if he had not existed. In the world without Kermit, Bitterman has turned the park near the Muppet Theater into a shopping mall called Bitterman Plaza, the Muppet Theater itself has become a nightclub called Club Dot owned by Bitterman, Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs has become a famous fast-food restaurant, and all of Kermit's friends have fallen into various detrimental situations. Kermit has Daniel restore him back to his reality and returns to the Muppet Theater. However, Bitterman arrives to shut the theater down and fights with Miss Piggy. Pepe arrives and announces he has made the Muppet Theater into a historical landmark, foiling Bitterman's plan. Embittered and defeated, Bitterman storms out of the Muppet Theater. Outside, the Muppets sing \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\".

The exception was Nelson's character Lew Zealand, who was performed by Bill Barretta. Sam Eagle, a character originally performed by Frank Oz, was voiced in the film by Kevin Clash, while John Kennedy provided the puppetry. Scooter, performed in the film by Brian Henson, makes his first major appearance since the death of his initial performer, Richard Hunt. Hunt's character Janice was also performed by Henson and has a speaking role for the first time since Hunt's death. The film contains an original song, \\"Everyone Matters\\", performed by Kermit and Gonzo as part of the world in which he had never been born, and then reprised at the end. The film also makes reference to the classic Muppet song \\"Rainbow Connection\\", featuring a statue of Kermit in a park, erected in dedication \\"for the lovers, the dreamers and you\\".

They compete in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball, playing the majority of their home games at the Sapporo Dome. The Fighters also host a select number of regional home games in cities across Hokkaid≈ç, including Hakodate, Asahikawa, Kushiro, and Obihiro. The team's name comes from its parent organization, Nippon Ham, a major Japanese food-processing company. Founded in 1946, the Fighters called Tokyo home for 58 years, as co-tenants of the Tokyo Dome with the Central League's Yomiuri Giants near the end of their tenure in the capital city. The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016. Team history =Senators and Tokyo eras= In 1946, Saburo Yokozawa, manager of the Tokyo Senators in 1936‚Äì1937 (and later a prominent umpire), looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators. He assembled a team of ready and able players like Hiroshi Oshita, Shigeya Iijima and Giichiro Shiraki, but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway's pre-war team (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji, grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji, became the team's owner, and Noboru Oride, borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team's sponsor. Eventually, trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team's manager. For a time, the team was even mockingly nicknamed \\"Seito\\" (Bluestockings) after a Japanese feminist magazine of the same name. As the Yomiuri Giants' pet name was \\"Kyojin\\", baseball personality Soutaro Suzuki thought that other teams should also have pet names like the Giants, and names such as the Osaka Tigers' alias \\"Mouko\\" (fierce tiger), the Senators' \\"Seito\\" and the Pacific's \\"Taihei\\" (tranquility) began to be used by the press. However, the other teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were not fully adopted. On January 7, 1947, the team was sold to the Tokyu Corporation. The Tokyu baseball club was inaugurated into the league, and the team's name became the Tokyu Flyers. At that time Tokyu dominated the Japanese transportation sector, owning several other railway companies, although it was faced with troubles and the possibility of a breakup. Tokyu purchased the team to act as a banner of solidarity for the swelling company, and managing director Hiroshi Okawa assumed ownership of the club. The newly born Flyers, with Hiroshi Oshita becoming one of the most popular players in the league, began to attract many fans, but the team's administration still went into a deficit. With the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club, which had played a few exhibition games against the Otsuka Athletics, joined with Tokyu to create the Kyuei Flyers (\\"Kyuei\\" being a portmanteau of the two companies' names). However, Daiei decided to purchase a separate team, the Kinsei Stars, and after only one year the Flyers reverted to their former name. During the off-season of 1949, the Flyers joined the Pacific League after the former league split. In September 1953, the team completed a new ballpark‚ÄîKomazawa Stadium‚Äîalong one of Tokyu's train lines in Setagaya, Tokyo, moving from Bunkyo ward's Korakuen Stadium. The Flyers' wild play on the field eventually earned them the nickname, \\"Komazawa's hooligans.\\" =Toei and Nittaku eras= On February 1, 1954, Tokyu entrusted the management of the Flyers to the Toei Company, of which Okawa had newly become president. Toei transferred control of the club to a subsidiary company, Toei Kogyo (industrial enterprise). The team's name was changed to the Toei Flyers, and its legal name consequently became the Toei Flyers Baseball Club. This name stuck for nineteen years. In 1961, when Yomiuri Giants manager Shigeru Mizuhara resigned from his position, Okawa attempted to woo him to join his team, bringing him to a bar in Kyoto and calling famous movie producer Koji Shundo to meet with them. Shundo, an old drinking buddy of Mizuhara's, convinced the four-time Japan Series champion manager to join the Flyers, and he solidified a strong relationship with Okawa and Toei Studios. Komazawa Stadium was to be torn down to make way for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, so in 1962 the Flyers moved their base of operations to Meiji Jingu Stadium in Shinjuku. (At that time, college baseball teams had priority at Meiji Jingu, so during weekends or other times when school games were being played the Flyers had to use Korakuen or another field for their games.) In the same year, two star aces, Masayuki Dobashi and Yukio Ozaki, blossomed under Mizuhara's coaching and the Flyers captured their first league championship. They would go on to defy odds in the Japan Series and defeat the Hanshin Tigers for their first Japan Series title. This championship would be their only one in the Toei era. The Kokutetsu Swallows jointly occupied Meiji Jingu with the Flyers the following season, and in 1964 the Flyers went back to their old home, Korakuen, also home of the Yomiuri Giants; both the Fighters and Giants would share a home for the next 39 years. The Flyers assembled a group of powerful sluggers over the next few years‚Äîamong them: Isao Harimoto, Katsuo Osugi, Inchon Bek, and Shoichi Busujima‚Äîbut on top of a declining movie industry and the \\"Black Mist\\" match-fixing scandal that rocked the professional baseball world in 1970 (after which Flyers ace Toshiaki Moriyasu was banned from the game for life), in 1971 Flyers owner Okawa died suddenly. Shigeru Okada, who did not view Okawa favorably, took over Toei after his death. Together with Noboru Goto, company president of Tokyu and loyal friend of Okada (and one who also thought unfavorably of Okawa), Okada let go of the unprofitable team. The team was sold to Akitaka Nishimura of the Nittaku Home real estate enterprise, a common acquaintance of Okada and Goto, on February 7, 1973. The team's name became the Nittaku Home Flyers. Nishimura, in an attempt to inject life back into the unpopular Pacific League, developed seven different uniforms for his team and experimented in every aspect of the team's operation, but the effort failed to produce results. Believing that the Pacific League's chances of survival were grim, Nishimura was on the verge of partnering with the Lotte Orions, who were eyeing a league reunification. When the deal fell through, Nishimura, tired of the baseball establishment, resigned from his leadership position and abandoned the Flyers. =Nippon-Ham era= On November 19, 1973, meatpacking company Nippon Ham purchased the team. The club's name changed to the Nippon-Ham Fighters, its official name became the Nippon-Ham Baseball Corporation, Osamu Mihara became the team president and Futoshi Nakanishi its manager. After 27 years, the \\"Flyers\\" nickname was abandoned. The \\"Fighters\\" nickname was born from a public appeal by the team's management. A female high school student from Okayama prefecture submitted the winning name, giving the reasoning that \\"(former Fighters player) Katsuo Osugi has guts, so he's a fighter.\\" Ironically, Osugi would be traded to the Yakult Swallows soon after the Fighters were rechristened. Over the four seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Fighters dwelled at the bottom of the Pacific League, but after improving to finishing in third place for three straight years between 1978 and 1980, manager Keiji Osawa finally led the Fighters to their second Pacific League pennant in 1981. With saves leader Yutaka Enatsu and starter Shigekuni Mashiba (who went 15‚Äì0 over the season) forming the heart of the pitching staff, the Fighters shined with offensive sluggers Tony Solaita, Junichi Kashiwabara, and Tommy Cruz. The team that year also featured various important players of smaller stature, like Makoto Shimada and Nobuhiro Takashiro. They would go on to play the Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series, where the Fighters lost in six games. At the time, the franchise shared Korakuen Stadium with the Giants, so scheduling games throughout the season for both teams posed a problem. League schedulers tried to avoid putting the Fighters and the Giants at Korakuen on the same day, but when they both had home games scheduled, league officials made the implicit decision that the Giants would play during the day and the Fighters during the night. One novel aspect of the Fighters was that they attracted armies of grade-school boys to sit in the outfield stands on weekend games under a \\"Young Boys‚Äô Fan Club\\" promotion, starting the first organized fan club in Japanese professional baseball. During the 1980s the Fighters hosted many of the Pacific League's leading pitchers, including Isamu Kida (led the P.L. with 22 wins in his rookie year in 1980; won MVP, Rookie of the Year the same year), Mikio Kud≈ç (20 wins in 1982), Hiroshi Tsuno (recorded double-digit win totals in several years throughout the mid-eighties) and Yasumitsu Shibata (three-time All Star; recorded no-hitter in 1990). Yukihiro Nishizaki particularly stood out, recording 15 wins and an ERA under three in each of his first two years (though the Rookie of the Year title eluded him), racking up seven double-digit win seasons over the course of his eleven-year stay with the Fighters and gaining a considerable following from female fans due to his easy-going demeanor. In 1986 shortstop Yukio Tanaka joined the club; he remained with the team for 22 seasons, becoming known as \\"Mr. Fighters.\\" Tokyo Dome, former ballpark of the Fighters From 1988 until the move to Hokkaid≈ç, the Fighters played their home games in Tokyo Dome, the stadium that replaced their longtime home Korakuen. After the Dome was finished, the pitching dominance of Yukihiro Nishizaki and Yasumitsu Shibata began to emerge. Keiji Osawa came out of retirement to manage the team for a third time in 1993, only to see his team sink to the bottom of the standings; he gained notoriety for kneeling to the fans at the end of that season, begging for their forgiveness. With the Fighters experiencing more managerial troubles in 1996, then-manager Toshiharu Ueda suddenly took a personal leave during a pennant race with the Orix BlueWave, eventually causing the Fighters to fade over the last month of the season. However, new life was born in Tokyo Dome in 1998. Hitters such as Nigel Wilson, Jerry Brooks, Yukio Tanaka, Atsushi Kataoka, Katsuhiro Nishiura and a young Michihiro Ogasawara formed what became known as the Big Bang lineup and subsequently shattered various batting records. They ran away with first place for the first half of the season, but a pitching collapse in the second half caused a fall of historical proportions. The Fighters would ultimately finish in second place to the Seibu Lions. =Hokkaido Nippon-Ham era= Sapporo dome, the current ballpark of the Fighters Sapporo dome Prior to the 2002 season, the idea of moving the Fighters to Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaid≈ç and Japan's fifth largest city, emerged. The Seibu Lions also had preliminary plans to move to the northern metropolis. Tokyo's Fighters fans voiced their opposition to the proposed relocation (though the franchise never drew as many fans as their co-habitual counterparts, the Giants, while playing in the capital), but it was eventually announced that the team would indeed call the Sapporo Dome its new home beginning in 2004. Aiming to build a grassroots relationship with its future fans, the team decided to change its name to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. At first, with the unhappy Seibu Lions suddenly changing their approval vote, Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe and Seibu owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi voiced their concerns over the move. They believed that Nippon Ham's choice to move the team would spur a decentralization in Japanese professional baseball, and they threatened that a decrease in the number of teams in the Kant≈ç and Kansai regions should merit a one-league system instead of two. As a matter of fact, the question of reorganizing baseball's league structure eventually became a bigger issue than the sale and renaming of the Kintetsu Buffaloes. The issue eventually settled down, though, and the Fighter's relocation was eventually approved by the league. The response from the people of Hokkaid≈ç was weak, but NPB fans welcomed the move, noting that the Fighters could now be free from the Tokyo Dome's high rent and perpetual second-billing to the Giants. Out of respect for the Tokyo-based Fighters fans, the team decided to schedule a few \\"home\\" games per season at the Tokyo Dome. After the move finally was complete in 2004, the Fighters signed former-Tigers superstar Tsuyoshi Shinjo and a revitalized Fernando Seguignol. American manager Trey Hillman led the team to success in his second year on the job, and at the end of the season, the Fighters were in a fierce race with the Chiba Lotte Marines for the final spot in the new P.L. playoff system. With a vital win over the Orix BlueWave on September 24, the newly moved Fighters earned a trip to the postseason, advancing to play Seibu in a three-game series. Though they put up a strong effort against Seibu ace Daisuke Matsuzaka, the Fighters lost the first game of the series 6‚Äì5. They took Game 2 by a score of 5‚Äì4. In the decisive third game, the Fighters fought back in the ninth inning after trailing for the whole game but ultimately fell to a Kazuhiro Wada walk-off home run, losing 6‚Äì5. The Fighters would have to wait for another chance for the P.L. pennant.2004 Pacific League During the pennant race, the Fighters began selling tickets for infield reserved seats at a low 1,500 yen price point, in an attempt to draw fans to the park. At and after 7:30 pm, usually well after the first pitch, the team began selling special child-fare tickets called \\"730 Tickets\\" (they started the same promotion at the Tokyo Dome in 2005). In addition to these, in 2005 they added extra-low priced tickets, discount parking passes and beer coupons to attract more fans. As a result of these promotions, and partially due to the rising popularity of young pitcher Yu Darvish, drafted the year before, the left field stands became constantly sold out for exhibition games, regular season games and playoff games, filled with loud and raucous ≈åendan. Even the right field stands, usually occupied by the visiting team's fans, began to fill with Fighters supporters. In 2005, the Fighters drew over 1,000,000 fans for the first time since 1993, ranking second in the P.L. after the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. Also in 2005, a previously unknown manager, Shigeru Takada, became the club's first general manager. On April 27, owner Yoshinori Okoso died. The Fighters retired the number 100 in his honor, a first in club history (also the first retired number for owners in NPB). Yukio Tanaka reached a career 1,000 RBI total, and Makoto Kaneko joined the 1,000 hit club in the same year. On September 20 the Lions smashed the Fighters at home, crushing the Fighters‚Äô hopes of making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the offseason, the Fighters acquired Major League veteran Jos√© Mac√≠as, and as former number one starter Yusaku Iriki tried his luck in America the club attempted to sign Kazuhisa Ishii, but failed. In the draft, the team selected pitchers Tomoya Yagi and Masaru Takeda. And, before the 2006 season Shigeyuki Furuki and Kazunari Sanematsu were traded to the Giants for pitcher Hideki Okajima. The 2006 season would turn out to be a monumental one for the Fighters. After defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows on the final day of interleague play, the Fighters went on an eleven-game winning streak, the best such streak for the franchise in over 45 years and tying the team record. After achieving the feat, the team had a six- and a seven-game winning streak, demonstrating to the rest of the P.L. that they were a dangerous club. A fierce struggle for first place developed between the Fighters, Lions and Hawks. On September 27, the Fighters emerged in first place, earning the title \\"Regular Season Champions.\\" They also boasted the best team ERA (3.05) and the best team home run total (135) in the NPB. Yu Darvish had an especially impressive year, winning 12 games and posting an ERA of 2.89, establishing himself as the ace of the Fighters‚Äô staff. The Fighters swept the Hawks in the second stage of the P.L. playoffs to earn their third pennant. In the Japan Series, the team won their first Japanese championship in 44 years, defeating the Chunichi Dragons in five games. Fittingly, Darvish pitched for the win in the final game of the series. The series' MVP honors went to Fighters' outfielder Atsunori Inaba, who hit for a .357 batting average during the series with one home run and six RBIs. The championship win was especially fitting for OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, who was a longtime veteran of the Hanshin Tigers (who were perennial losers), and also had played for a brief time in the United States' Major League Baseball. It was Shinjo's ultimate desire to win a championship, and he did in the final year of his illustrious career in Japan with Nippon-Ham. This victory gave the Fighters a berth in the four-team Asia Series, in which the team went undefeated in the round-robin and won the final 1‚Äì0 over the La New Bears. The 2006 offseason saw the departure of two of Nippon-Ham's best players, both via free agency. First baseman Michihiro Ogasawara was signed to a blockbuster contract with the Yomiuri Giants, and left-handed reliever Hideki Okajima departed to the Boston Red Sox. At the start of the 2007 season, Nippon-Ham had a lot of trouble scoring runs, relying far too much on their pitching, despite the continuing maturation of Yu Darvish, who had back-to-back complete game, 14-strikeout performances early in the season. At one point, Nippon Ham was second-to-last in the Pacific League, but recently has been able to turn it around. With the start of Interleague play, Nippon Ham began a 14-game winning streak, which ended on June 9 with a 3‚Äì2 extra inning loss to the Yakult Swallows, with the bullpen wasting another great performance by Darvish. The Fighters went on to win the Pacific League championship and went through the Climax Series to earn a second consecutive trip to the Japan Series to once again face the Chunichi Dragons. But in a reversal of roles from last year, the Fighters took Game 1, but the Dragons took the next four games to defeat the Fighters; the last of which being a combined perfect game by Dragons pitchers Daisuke Yamai and Hitoki Iwase. In 2007, Yukio Tanaka's final season, he recorded his 2000th career hit, during a May 15 game against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. In 2012, the Fighters drafted Shohei Ohtani, who made his debut in 2013. Ohtani, with his ability to both pitch and hit, quickly became a star for the team. He was selected as an NPB all-star five times and was named Pacific League MVP in 2016. Behind Ohtani, the Fighters returned to the Japan Series in 2016. After dropping the first two games on the road, the Fighters rallied to win the next four games en route to their first championship since 2006. In 2017, Ohtani left the Fighters to sign with the Los Angeles Angels.

He was a war poet of the First World War and was taken up by Siegfried Sassoon, but after a period of being lionised socially he led a mainly unsatisfactory life, suffering from bad health. He was born near Mount Forest, Ontario, and brought up on a farm near Kenilworth, Ontario. In 1915 he left his studies at the University of Toronto and enlisted as a private in the Canadian Army. Later he was offered and accepted a commission in the British Army, serving in the Royal Field Artillery. He served in France, but was invalided out in 1917 after being injured twice, once having to claw his way out of the earth after being buried alive. While he was recovering from shell shock in a psychiatric hospital in 1918 he began pretending to be an Iroquois called Toronto. This was accepted at the time, but was later questioned, and ultimately disproved by DNA analysis, which found no genetic connection to Iroquois. The claim has been attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder. At Lennel Auxiliary Hospital, a sister hospital to Craiglockhart War Hospital, he met Sassoon, who later wrote a brief portrait of him in his autobiography, Siegfried's Journey.Siegfried Sassoon, Siegfried's Journey (1946; rpt London: White Lion Publishers, 1972, pp. 75-6..

Prewett later maintained a regular correspondence with Lady Ottoline (Darroch 215) and when he returned to England he was offered a job at Garsington, but \\"he fell under suspicion of keeping back farm earnings\\" (Darroch, 233) and was asked to leave. Prewett had an academic job at an agricultural research institute from the mid-1920s to 1934. He married, but the marriage failed. On Sassoon's evidence, he suffered from clinical depression. His poems were recognised by the inclusion of some of them in the final Georgian Poetry anthology and in Oxford Poetry, and by publication by the Hogarth Press; followed by a collection The Rural Scene in 1922. In the 1930s he was a BBC broadcaster and did editorial work. A historical novel set in Berkshire in the times of Captain Swing, The Chazzey Tragedy (1933), made little impact. He was married again, to Dorothy Pollard, who was a colleague on the editorial staff of The Countryman, the magazine where he was working. During the Second World War he served in the RAF, and he stayed on in the Air Ministry until 1954. Retiring because of poor health, he farmed near Abingdon until his death in Inverness. Robert Graves, a friend from Oxford days, edited his Collected Poems,Frank Prewett, Collected Poems (London:Cassell, 1964). published in 1964. Graves's introduction provides the longest printed account of Prewett's life available. A volume of Selected Poems was published in 1987.

History The Marines franchise began in 1950 as the Mainichi Orions, an inaugural member of the Pacific League. The Marines won the inaugural Japan Series in 1950. In 1958, the team was merged with the Daiei Unions and renamed the Daimai Orions. In 1964 they became the Tokyo Orions, and the Lotte Orions in 1969. The franchise was slow to replicate its initial success: the Orions made the Japan Series in 1960 and 1970, only to lose both years. The team played in central Tokyo until 1972. From 1973 to 1977 the Lotte Orions played in the northern Japanese city of Sendai. In 1974, they beat the Chunichi Dragons, becoming the first Pacific League team to win the Series in ten years as the Yomiuri Giants had claimed the prior nine titles behind the Oh‚ÄìNagashima attack. In 1978 the team returned to the Tokyo area, settling in Kawasaki's Kawasaki Stadium, at one time home to the Taiyo Whales (today's Yokohama DeNA Baystars). In 1992, the team moved to Chiba City's Chiba Marine Stadium on the eastern shore of Tokyo Bay and were renamed the Chiba Lotte Marines. The team failed to reach the Japan Series again until 2005. The Marines started the 2005 season in first place behind American manager Bobby Valentine, but fell behind the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks as the year progressed. Under the playoff format of the time, the preliminary five-game playoff round, prior to the Japan Series, saw the teams with the best first and second half records face off. The Marines defeated the Hawks three games to two in the Pacific League championship, winning the rubber match despite entering the eighth inning trailing, 2‚Äì1. The Marines thus qualified for the Japan Series, the first time they had reached the tournament since 1974, a 31-year drought. In a one-sided series, the Marines swept the Hanshin Tigers in four games, scoring ten runs in each of the first three games. The apparent ease with which the Marines defeated the Tigers added fuel to the ongoing debate concerning the need for a playoff system in the Central League, which was finally added in 2007 (see Climax Series). The Marines went on to defeat South Korea's Samsung Lions in the final round of the Konami Cup Championships. In 2010, the Marines clinched third place on the last day of the season to earn a berth into the Climax Series. They went on to become the first third place team to ever win the Climax Series, and faced off with the Chunichi Dragons in the 2010 Japan Series. The Marines defeated the Dragons in seven games, composed of four wins, two losses, and one tie, winning their second Japan Series in under ten years.

His works often celebrated cultural diversity, and many were published in both English and Spanish.Leo Politi 2008 Centennial Events, Leo Politi 2008 Centennial, Childhood Politi was the younger of two children, born in Fresno, on November 21, 1908, to Italian- American parents Lodovico Politi and Mary Cazzola. Politi's sister, Marie Therese, was two years older. Politi was transported to Italy at the age of seven ‚Äî in an \\"Indian Chief suit,\\" via transcontinental railroad and ocean liner ‚Äî and grew up, constantly drawing, in his mother's native village of Broni near Milan. Lodovico left the family to take a job as a cobbler in Piacenza. Marie went to live with a poor aunt who operated a roadside inn. Politi was placed in a boarding home with an elderly woman and her daughter. Politi loved Broni, a deep affection that remained for the rest of his life. In Broni, he began to develop his artistic sense, drawing sketches of village life. By 1920, the Politis reunited and moved to London where Politi was exposed to the culture and cosmopolitan lifestyle that Broni could never offer. On weekends, Leo and Marie packed a lunch basket and along with hundreds of other poor children lined up at a London theater to watch live shows and Charlie Chaplin films. Politi devoured everything that London had to offer a boy. He wandered through the city's museums to view the works of Vincent van Gogh and other masters. After one year, the Politi family returned to Broni where Leo began studying art on a six-year scholarship at the Superior Institute of Fine Arts‚Äîalso known as the National Art Institute‚Äîat the Royal Palace at Monza near Milan. Early career In 1931, Politi, at the age of 22, left Italy for California. Passing through the Panama Canal he discovered the exotic beauty of Central America. He sketched the things that he saw and small stories began to bubble up within him. He was attracted to the Mayan culture of the region and developed a palette that served as his core of colors throughout the 1930s and '40s. Politi later wrote of his technique: \\"(I) developed an ochre yellow, burnt sienna and a number of brown tints symbolic of the warmth and earthy qualities of the life and vegetation of the tropical Central American jungle. I also used a lively blue-green symbolic of the water, sky and in small spots for precious stones used then in their ornaments as jade ‚Äì all elements inherent to the Maya civilization.\\" Artist Buckley Mac-Gurrin, an art critic for the literary film magazine Script published by writer and artist Rob Wagner, wrote in a cover story of Politi in 1940 that \\"Leo became proficient in the use of many media ‚Äì oil, watercolor, wood-carving, wood engraving, lithography, book illustration; he had a very fine artistic education. His training was modern as opposed to academic; it tended to develop originality rather than subservient to the art forms of bygone eras. His own artistic philosophy drew him toward the genuine and the earthy; toward people whose contact with the soil was still fresh, intimate, satisfying.\\" Politi arrived in Los Angeles, California, in October 1931 and two years later he married Helen Fontes. Olvera Street Politi began sketching and painting from a regular spot on Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles, where he sketched tourists and sold drawings alongside potters, weavers and other artisans-in-residence. Politi's affection for Mexican- Americans and their folkways was genuine; an affinity. Most especially, as a devout Catholic, at home with Italian saints, he responded to Mexican ritual. Children ‚Äî natural, spontaneous children ‚Äî he loved without reserve or distinction. Drawing Mexican children, for magazines and books, gave him an American career and a professional identity. He painted a mural on Olvera Street \\"The Blessing of the Animals\\", where he depicted a tradition of Catholicism in remembrance of St. Francis of Assisi's love for all creatures. In the mural, men, women and children are walking their animals to get blessed. During the 1930s he worked in oils, watercolors and wood sculptures. His best work was probably gouache on paper with variations of the theme of mother and child. He also focused on Mexican pueblo scenes, religious ceremonies and customs, dancers and mischievous children. His palette was generally the same: ochre yellow, burnt sienna and brown tints that to him defined the Mayan civilization. His exhibits included the watercolor \\"Peons Asleep\\" and his sculpture \\"Mother and Child\\" at the Awards for the Ninth annual Exhibition of Southern California Art in 1937 in San Diego, California. In oil, Politi exhibited \\"Two Women and a Child.\\" During the same year at the 18th annual Exhibition of Paintings and Sculptures at the Los Angeles Museum in Exposition Park, Politi's wood sculpture \\"Pedro and Pepa\\" and watercolor \\"Market Scene\\" were exhibited. A year later \\"Pedro and Pepa\\" was displayed again at the 10th annual Southern California Art Exhibition at the Fine Arts Gallery in San Diego. A one-man show at Alma Reed‚Äôs Delphic Studios in New York City in 1937 ultimately helped lead him into a career as a children's author and illustrator on Latin themes. His first book was Little Pancho, the illustrated story of a defiant, if not naughty, little Mexican boy on an adventure. Published in 1938, Little Pancho forever steered him onto the path as a children‚Äôs author. It also attracted the attention of the left-leaning Script magazine, in which Politi became the magazine‚Äôs art editor, and a smaller pacifist publication, Freedom, published by Prynce Hopkins. As war approached, Politi turned to political themes and often used his characters‚ÄîPancho, Lupita and Rosa‚Äîon the pages of Script and Freedom to convey pacifism in the face of war. His artwork reflected a multiculturalism that was rarely seen in the era. Early books He also illustrated The Least One by Ruth Sawyer in 1941, Aqui se Habla Espanol by Margarita Lopez and Esther Brown in 1942 and Angelo, the Naughty One by Helen Garrett in 1944. In 1944, he illustrated Stories from the Americas. It marked a distinct departure from Politi's early impressionist, cubist and art deco styles to a softer and less dark, gritty execution that typified his later work. The softer tones and themes continued in all of his future books. Multiculturalism continued to be an overriding theme, but was not overtly political as seen in his magazine work. Recognition The Catholic Library Association each year presents the Regina Medal of excellence to one living exemplar of the words of the English poet, Walter de la Mare \\"only the rarest kind of best in anything can be good enough for the young,\\" for continued, distinguished contribution to children's literature without regard to the nature of the contribution. In 1966 Leo Politi was the recipient of this distinguished award. In 1980, a branch of the Fresno Public Library was named for him, and in 1991, the Leo Politi Elementary School was dedicated to him in Koreatown, a neighborhood in the Mid-Wilshire district of the City of Los Angeles. There is also a Leo Politi Square in Echo Park, where he lived for many years.

Early life  He was born in the city of Erzurum as the son of an Ottoman Army officer, Abidin Bey,Frank Cecil Roberts, Obituaries from the Times, 1961-1970: including an index to all obituaries and tributes appearing in the Times during the years 1961-1970, Newspaper Archive Developments Ltd., 1975 p. 328. and the grandson of Ibrahim (1820‚Äì1895) and the great-grandson of Haci Ahmad (1790‚Äì1860). After the elementary school in Ordu and the military middle school in Erzincan, he graduated from the Kuleli military high school in Istanbul. He was a popular figure and was therefore nicknamed \\"Cemal Aƒüa\\" (big brother Cemal) since his childhood school years and onwards all his life. G√ºrsel served in the Army for 45 years. During World War I, he participated in the Battle of √áanakkale in Dardanelles, Gallipoli as a lieutenant with the First Battery of the 12th Artillery Regiment in 1915 and received the War Medal. He later fought at the Palestine and Syria fronts in 1917 and became a prisoner of war by the British while suffering malaria during his command of the 5th Battery of the 41st Regiment on 19 September 1918. G√ºrsel was kept as a prisoner of war in Egypt until 6 October 1920. During his presidency much later, when interviewed by the foreign press as to why he had not learned English during his captivity, he somewhat regretfully recalled that he was so frustrated to be a captive, he protested and studied French in the British camp instead. After his release, Cemal G√ºrsel returned to Anatolia to re-join Mustafa Kemal subsequent to Erzurum Congress and took part in all the western front campaigns in the Turkish War of Independence between 1920‚Äì1923. He was promoted for gallantry in the First Division excelling in the battles of Second In√∂n√º, Eski≈üehir and Sakarya, and was later awarded the Medal of Independence by the first Parliament for his combat service in the Final Offensive. G√ºrsel was married, in 1927, to Melahat, the daughter of the chief engineer on the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye. From this marriage, a son √ñzdemir was born. The couple adopted a daughter T√ºrkan.  Military career  Cemal G√ºrsel attended the Turkish Military College and graduated in 1929 as a staff officer. He was promoted colonel in 1940. He was made a brigadier general in 1946 and made commander of the 65th Division. He was later the commander of the 12th Division, the 18th Corps commander, and commander of the 2nd Interior Tasks District. Made Lieutenant general in 1953, was general in 1957, being appointed Commander of 3rd Army. Service included chief of intelligence, and he was appointed as the Commander of Land Forces in 1958 when he was commanding an army. G√ºrsel, as an easy-going and fatherly figure with a fine sense of humor, was well liked both nationally and in NATO circles, and had earned the respect and confidence of both the nation and the armed forces with his professional knowledge and demeanor. A patriotic memorandum he sent on 3 May 1960 to the Minister of Defense in an effort to establish checks and balances on ongoing affairs, reflecting his personal views in continuation of the chat they had the night before, expressing his support to the prime minister Adnan Menderes and belief that the Prime Minister should replace the President with immediate effect to bolster a much needed national unity, resulted in his suspension from his post, forcing early retirement instead of becoming the next Chief of the Turkish General Staff. A farewell letter by him, advocating and urging the army to stay out of politics, was forwarded to all units of the armed forces at the time of his departure on leave. Cemal G√ºrsel's statement read: 'Always hold high the honor of the army and the uniform you wear. Protect yourselves from the current ambitious and harmful political atmosphere in the country. Stay away from the politics at all cost. This is of utmost importance to your honor, the army's might and the future of the country.' He went to ƒ∞zmir where he became the president of the Anti- Communism Association of Turkey.  Head of state  A coup d'√©tat organised and conducted by army officers at the rank of colonels and below took place without the participation or leadership of Cemal G√ºrsel on 27 May 1960 after continuing civilian and academia unrests throughout the country. It is rumored that four-star general Ragƒ±p G√ºm√º≈üpala, the Commander of the Third Army based in Eastern Anatolia, gave an ultimatum to the rebelling officers that if they did not have a general appointed as their head, the Third Army would attack to take over the capital and the administration of the country, thereby forcing the rebel group to find a senior officer over them. Because of his immense popularity among the public and military ranks, G√ºrsel was subsequently chosen by the revolutionaries overnight and brought into the chairmanship of the military coup and became, , the only leader in the world put into power by a military takeover who had previously had no role in its planning or execution. He, while still in his pajamas, was escorted to Ankara in the military C-47 transport plane by a captain who was the youngest officer of the radical coup team who that by that time had already sent President Celal Bayar, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, List of Chief of General Staff R√º≈üt√º Erdelhun and some other members of the ruling Democratic Party to a military court on Yassƒ±ada in the Sea of Marmara, accusing them of violation of the constitution. The day after the coup, four-star general Cemal G√ºrsel was declared the commander in chief, Head of state, Prime minister and Minister of Defense of the 24th government on 30 May 1960, in theory giving him more absolute powers than even Kemal Atat√ºrk had ever had. G√ºrsel freed 200 students and nine newsmen, and licensed 14 banned newspapers to start publishing again (Time, 6 June 1960). He fetched ten law professors, namely Sƒ±ddƒ±k Sami Onar, Hƒ±fzƒ± Veldet Velidedeoƒülu, Ragƒ±p Sarƒ±ca, Naci ≈ûensoy, H√ºseyin Nail Kubalƒ±, Tarƒ±k Zafer Tunaya, ƒ∞smet Giritli, ƒ∞lhan Arsel, Bahri Savcƒ± and Muammer Aksoy, accompanied by Erdoƒüan Tezi√ß, a law postgraduate student as their assistant (currently Professor and the former Chairman of the Turkish Council of Higher Education), from Istanbul and Ankara Universities to help draft a new constitution on 27 May, right after he arrived in Ankara. During their first meeting with General Cemal G√ºrsel on the same day, Prof. Onar declared on behalf of the group of law academicians that 'the circumstances of the day should not be interpreted as an ordinary and political coup d'√©tat, implying the revolution being brought by the change process starting in the republic that day. President Cemal G√ºrsel also formed a scientific council to guide the Ministry of Defence, later forming the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey to advise the government more broadly. He appointed General Ragƒ±p G√ºm√º≈üpala, the commander of the Third Army, as the new Chief of the General Staff who, upon his retirement in two months, was succeeded by General Cevdet Sunay, and G√ºm√º≈üpala was further directed by G√ºrsel to form the new Justice Party to bring together the former members of the Democratic Party. A simple and conservative sort, G√ºrsel became Turkey's most popular figure, forbade display of his picture alongside Atat√ºrk's in government offices, rode about in an open Jeep touring rural communities, talking to the peasants almost as if they were his children (Time, 6 January 1961). He was successful with his personal interventions in reducing the number of execution verdicts from the Yassƒ±ada tribunals from 15 down to three. G√ºrsel's plea for forgiveness and attempts along with several other world leaders for the reversal of the execution sentences and for the release of Adnan Menderes and two other ministers were rejected by the Junta. A member of the National Unity Committee writes in his memoirs that, upon Cemal G√ºrsel's intervention on the prevention of Menderes' execution, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Altay √ñmer Egesel, said: ‚ÄòLet us hurry! They will save him (Menderes)!‚Äô, also arranging a contingency plan for conducting the execution in a Navy Destroyer in the event of a forgiveness operation in Imrali Island to save Menderes while, at the same time, placing a press release questioning the legal ability of G√ºrsel for an intervention. Senator Mehmet Feyyat, District Attorney of Istanbul at the time, recently declared: ‚ÄòThey cut off our phone lines. Adnan Menderes was hanged against the regulations. I was supposed to oversee the execution. The revolution tribunal's chief prosecutor Egesel conducted the execution despite not being authorized. ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º and Cemal G√ºrsel were already phoning for him (Menderes) not to be executed but the telecommunications' office cut off the lines and Egesel made use of the (communication) gap to conduct the execution.‚ÄôCemal G√ºrsel resisted pressure to continue military rule, was wounded as a result of a military assassination attempt on his life (forgave the colonel who shot him), thwarted subsequent multiple military coup attempts, appointed the organizers of the coup to overseas posts and played an important role in the preparation of a new constitution and return to the democratic order of the Kemalist vision.  Statesman  G√ºrsel Hosting HM Queen Elizabeth II. Cemal G√ºrsel rescheduled and attended the previously cancelled Turkish and Scottish national football teams' game in Ankara on 8 June 1960 (Turkey 4, Scotland 2) which was followed by a National Football Tournament, the Cemal G√ºrsel Cup, that helped boost the national morale in the post-coup weeks with finals in Istanbul on 3 July (Fenerbah√ße 1, Galatasaray 0). He took an active role in extensive modernization of Turkish Armed Forces and the staunch defense of the free world and Europe during the cold war, in particular during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The declaration of independence of Cyprus according to the prior agreements and the deployment of a Turkish military unit to Cyprus took place in August 1960. He hosted the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ankara in early 1961 and the visit of the vice president Lyndon Johnson in 1962. G√ºrsel obtained, with the coordinated work of Sir Bernard Burrows, and granted permission of the ruling military National Unity Committee (NUC) for British military combat aircraft to overfly Turkish airspace on their way to support Kuwait, which was under threat of invasion by Iraq in July 1961. When questioned by a German journalist regarding his intentions on becoming the next president upon proposal of the interim parliament, Cemal G√ºrsel responded that he was ready to serve only if asked by the nation, not by the interim house. He neither put his own candidacy forward for the presidency nor lobbied for his election or against any other candidate in any way. He offered his endorsement of candidacy of several high rank academicians in Medicine and Sciences in Ankara for both the interim prime minister and future president positions. G√ºrsel placed a special emphasis on participatory democracy with the promotion of the full interests of the nation's minorities, appointing Turkish Citizen ethnic leaders Hermine Kalustyan of Armenian, Kaludi Laskari of Greek and Erol Dilek of Jewish origin as his \\"Deputy Representatives of Head of State\\" and the full members of the interim House of Representatives. The editor of Shalom, Avram Leyon, accompanied him on his travels and foreign state functions. He re-established the freedom of speech that was overwhelmingly taken away from the media organs and from the press by the previous cabinet. The constitution, which brought for the first time a full text of civil and political rights under constitutional protection along with an improved system of checks and balances in Turkish history, was approved by a referendum held on 10 October 1961. With the establishment of the first Constitutional Court that created a new paradigm shift by scrutinizing the parliamentary rulings as the \\"checks\\" organ in 1961 and the addition of a Senate to the parliament, the Turkish Grand National Assembly was re-opened after the general elections, nominated and voted him as the fourth president of Turkey. Journalist Parliamentarian Cihat Baban claims in his book, The Gallery of Politics (Politika Galerisi) that Cemal G√ºrsel told him \\"We may solve all troubles if S√ºleyman Demirel becomes the head of the Justice Party (Adalet Partisi). I am working very hard for him become the party leader. If I succeed in this, I will be happy..\\" Demirel was elected Chairman at the second grand party convention on 28 November 1964. The President of the Republic of Turkey Cemal G√ºrsel assigned the mandate to form and serve as the Prime Minister of the new government to ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º in November 1961, June 1962 and December 1963, to Senator Suat Hayri √úrg√ºpl√º on February 1965 and, following the general elections, to Suleyman Demirel of Justice Party in October 1965. With the reduction of tensions between the West and the Soviet bloc, G√ºrsel sought improved relations for his country's population of 27.8 million with the Soviet Union, such as the initiation of a telephone line agreement, as with the other members of the Western alliance while initiating new credit agreements with the US and the UK as well as bilateral technical and investment relations with Germany in 1960s. The atomic reactor in Istanbul became operational in 1962 along with his establishment of the first Research and State Library of the government in two years after his administration started. He promoted the grant of the freedom of and the legal rights to form unions and to go on strike in the country. Turkish Universities gained autonomous independence by law for the first time upon the legislation he passed. Cemal G√ºrsel granted a presidential pardon for the life sentences of the previous president Celal Bayar and the former chief of general staff Rustu Erdelhun whose prior execution sentence was also revoked by the National Unity Committee upon G√ºrsel's appeals. He initiated the new era of planned economy in Turkey, formed a State Institute of Statistics, launched the State Planning Organization (DPT) that implemented \\"The First 5-Years Development Plan\\", arranged re-entry of the Turkish Republic in the United Nations Security Council in 1961 and moved Turkey, through his close and personal diplomatic dialogues with Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, into the direction of European Union membership with the Ankara Agreement, signed with France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg in 1963, resulting in associate membership the following year and a large Turkish workforce migration to Germany and Western Europe to assist their postwar industrial development. When a Cypriot leader who was exiled out of the UK previously in 1956 on the basis of his struggle for Cypriot independence from the British rule, wanted in November 1963 to amend the basic articles of the 1960 constitution, communal violence ensued and Turkey, Great Britain and Greece, the guarantors of the agreements which had led to Cyprus' independence, wanted to send a NATO force to the island under the command of General Young. Due to the continued ethnic violence between the Cypriot Turks and Cypriot Greeks, President G√ºrsel ordered warning flights and subsequent continuous air assaults by the Turkish Air Force against the island which continued between 7 and 10 August 1964, ending with the fulfilment of the military objectives of Turkey, and the invitation to calm by Nikita Khrushchev of USSR. Cemal G√ºrsel reformed the \\"Teskilat-i Mahsusa\\", the \\"Special Organization\\" of clandestine security services to a modern National Intelligence Agency in response to and preparation against escalating international terrorism trends in 1963. He paved the way to Middle Eastern countries and Pakistan to concentrate on economic and cultural matters of mutual interest and Ankara recognized Syria following the breakup of the short-lived United Arab Republic in 1961, further reestablishing diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1965. In July 1964, Pakistani President Ayub Khan, Turkish President Cemal G√ºrsel, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran announced in Istanbul the establishment of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) organization to promote transportation and joint economic projects also envisioning Afghanistan and possibly Indonesia joining at some time in the future. He granted asylum to the political dissidents Ayatollah Khoumeini of Iran and Molla Barzani of Iraq. G√ºrsel, 40 years after the foundation of the Republic, launched the first radio broadcasting station of Eastern Anatolia within the centrally located province of Erzurum, where Ankara and Istanbul radios‚Äô transmissions were not received. He brought the Microwave Telecommunications Network into operation increasing telephone and teletype capacity along with a High- Frequency Radio Link connecting London and Ankara with Rawalpindi, Karachi, Tehran and Istanbul. He laid the foundations of the new agricultural and structural development plans for the south-eastern Anatolian regions in early 1960s for the first time. With his directive, The Holy Relics from the Prophets Abraham, Moses, Joseph, David and Muhammad, including the oldest Qur'an in existence from the 7th Century were put on display from their storage rooms within the Topkapi Palace for public viewing for the first time on 31 August 1962. G√ºrsel added the first Ministry of Culture and Tourism to the cabinet. In a parallel effort of promoting the country's touristic popularity in the West, Topkapi), the movie version of the book by Eric Ambler that had been commissioned for the same purpose, was shot in Paris and Istanbul and was introduced with success. Similarly, one of the favorite books of John F. Kennedy, Ian Fleming's From Russia with Love was shot in Istanbul as the second James Bond movie, to promote the touristic popularity of Turkey, with his keen interest. The Directorate of Religious Affairs network of the country was founded with his directive and became operational on 22 June 1965. He started the new procedure of returning the law proposals presented for the President's approval back to the Parliamentary re-discussions in 1963. Cemal G√ºrsel founded The National Security Council (MGK) as well as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) in 1963, appointing Professor Cahit Arf as its first director, officially charging TUBITAK primarily with governmental advisory duty by legislation. In addition to the foundation of the Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) organization as a government agency in 1964 that brought television broadcasting to Turkey for the first time under his administration, the opening of The School of Press and Broadcasting at the College of Political Sciences in Ankara followed in November 1965. The country's new initiative of Planning of Population Growth Control was put in effect in 1965. The production of the first domestic Turkish automobile, the Devrim (Revolution), took place with Cemal G√ºrsel's directive which sparked the initiation of an automotive industry in the republic in the following few years. The first use of a computer in the country, iron and steel mass production growth, the thermic power plant and a petrol pipeline structuring took place during his presidency. Cemal G√ºrsel refused remuneration for his Head of State and subsequent Presidential positions and made his and his family's living with his retired general's salary, meeting their own expenses during their life in the Presidential Palace in √áankaya, Ankara.  Illness  Because of a paralysis that started in early 1961 and progressed quickly in 1966, on 2 February Cemal G√ºrsel was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. on the private airplane \\"BlueBird\\" sent by US President Lyndon B. Johnson. One week later, he fell into a coma there after suffering a series of new paralytic strokes. The government decided he return to Turkey on 24 March. President Johnson travelled by helicopter from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to pay his respects to President Cemal G√ºrsel on his departure to home, In addition to issuing the following statement 'Our distinguished friend, President Cemal Gursel of Turkey, came to the United States on 2 February for medical treatment. There was hope that new therapeutic procedures only recently developed in this country would be useful in treating his illness of several years. We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only to be shocked by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow. Our best talent, coupled with the skill of the eminent Turkish doctors who accompanied the President, was exerted to the utmost in the hope that the President might return to his home in fully restored health. We are saddened that this hope was not to be realized. We have been deeply honored to have President G√ºrsel come to our country to seek medical treatment. As he returns to his homeland, our prayers go with him'. With a report of a medical committee by G√ºlhane Military Hospital in Ankara, the parliament ruled on 28 March 1966 that his presidency be terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution. He died of apoplexy at 6:45 pm on 14 September 1966 in Ankara. He left behind no directives or last will. He was laid to rest at the \\"Freedom Martyrs Memorial\\" section in the yard of the mausoleum of Atat√ºrk. His body was transferred on 27 August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery.  Legacy  Among all of his achievements and great modesty in his down-to-earth plain demeanor, he tried to place the most emphasis on the need for a well-educated youth and a hard-working population with high standards of ethics for a westernized democratic progress in Atat√ºrk's tradition (commentary by Imran Oktem, Chief Supreme Court Justice ‚Äì Yargitay, 1966). His portrait as a statesman and soldier remained next to Atat√ºrk's in most homes in Turkey for a long time. Erzurum Cemal G√ºrsel Stadium, some schools and streets were named after him. The developments during his term were described as the \\"Turkish Revolution\\" which was celebrated annually on 27 May as the Constitution Day until 1981. In 2002, a commemorative coin was released for the same. In 2008, the movie The Cars of Revolution was released in his memory.  Quotes from him  * \\"I took over the administration of the state to stop the tragic course of events.\\" (Cemal G√ºrsel, radio address on the evening of 27 May 1960) * \\"The network was ready. I personally did not want the army to intervene and had been stopping the attempts (of takeover) of my younger friends. Things reached to such a state that despite my belief that the army should not interfere I let them free in their duties. Now my only goal is to reinstate an administration built on the principles of justice and ethics.\\" (Cemal G√ºrsel, An interview. Cumhuriyet, 16 July 1960) * \\"Those who follow Atat√ºrk will not be left behind.\\" (Cemal G√ºrsel, from the address on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Atat√ºrk's death, 10 November 1963)  Quotes about him  * \\"General Gursel may be described as the father of the second Turkish Republic similar to Atat√ºrk being the father of modern Turkey. At a time of deep division, Gursel earned and maintained the respect of the Turkish Nation that regarded him as the symbol of national unity. When he passed away, he had the identity of the trusted father of the nation.\\" (Prof. Bernard Lewis, 15 September 1966) * \\"A few days before the coup, it was known that the coup was imminent but General Cemal Gursel was dismissed as a non- political general.

He was invited to become the head due to the circumstances and he willingly accepted.\\" (Burhan Felek, Milliyet, Page 2, 18 September 1971) * \\"General G√ºrsel was brought into the NUC chairmanship by the revolution team when he was in retirement preparation. In actuality he was in the position of a chairman found in last minute with a hurried search. He never was the responsible leader for a true leader is not to be appointed but is self-appointed.\\" (By a leading member of the NUC) * \\"One of the core players of the coup, Orhan Erkanli told that they revolted on 27 May without knowing what to do on 28 May. No one, including Cemal G√ºrsel knew who and how many would be forming the NUC. In actuality, even Cemal G√ºrsel was brought in later.\\" (Years of Ismet Pasha of our Democracy, 1960‚Äì61 by Metin Toker, page 25. Bilgi. 1998) * \\"It is now known that the coup was the result of years of planning on the part of conspirators, a number of radical colonels and ranks below in their early forties. He (Cemal G√ºrsel) was not involved in the details of the organization of the coup d'√©tat. When the coup had succeeded, he was brought to Ankara.\\" (Turkey, A modern History by Erik Zurcher. pages 253,254. I.B. Tauris, 2003) * \\"We just see that a few very important lines in his letter (to the Minister of Defence) had been censored. That means we are going without learning the true history, without knowing who knows what facts and what true pictures of turning points.\\" (√áetin Altan, Author, Journalist, September 2006) * \\"An extremely important document that sheds light on the past has been revealed. Testimony from eyewitnesses at the time helped make known that the letter had been modified after 27 May, but the location of the original letter was unknown. This important document adds a new dimension to the 27 May revolution. We have come face to face with a new document that changes our written history. It was my greatest wish to obtain just such a document; not for my own satisfaction, but for my father, to prove this reality and obtain genuine evidence. I was thrilled when I heard about this.\\" (Mr Aydƒ±n Menderes, Author, the Son of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, September 2006) * \\"They cut off our phone lines. Adnan Menderes was hung against the regulations. I was supposed to oversee the execution. The revolution tribunal's chief prosecutor Altay Egesel conducted the execution despite not being authorized. ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º and Cemal G√ºrsel were already phoning for him (Adnan Menderes) not to be executed but the telecommunications' office cut off the lines and Egesel made use of the (communication) gap to conduct the execution.\\" (Mehmet Feyyat, District Attorney General, Istanbul Province Prosecutor General 1961, The Administrator of the Imrali Prison, The Lawyer of the Year, Senator.

Estimations vary as to the abruptness of the reversal. A 2004 paper estimated that it took over several thousand years; a 2010 paper estimated that it occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime; a 2019 paper estimated that the reversal lasted 22,000 years. The apparent duration at any particular location can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude and local effects of non-dipole components of the Earth's field during the transition. The Brunhes‚ÄìMatuyama reversal is a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), selected by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a marker for the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, also known as the Ionian Stage. It is useful in dating ocean sediment cores and subaerially erupted volcanics. There is a highly speculative theory that connects this event to the large Australasian strewnfield (c. 790,000 years ago),Glass, B. P., Swincki, M. B., & Zwart, P. A. (1979). \\"Australasian, Ivory Coast and North American tektite strewnfields ‚Äì Size, mass and correlation with geomagnetic reversals and other earth events\\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, 10th, Houston, Tex., March 19‚Äì23, 1979, pp. 2535‚Äì2545. although the causes of the two are almost certainly unconnected and only coincidentally happened at the same time.

Differing from more technology-oriented IT management approaches like network management and IT systems management, IT service management is characterized by adopting a process approach towards management, focusing on customer needs and IT services for customers rather than IT systems, and stressing continual improvement. The CIO WaterCoolers' annual ITSM report states that business uses ITSM \\"mostly in support of customer experience (35%) and service quality (48%).\\" Context Relationships between ITSM frameworks and other management standards As a discipline, ITSM has ties and common interests with other IT and general management approaches, information security management and software engineering. Consequently, IT service management frameworks have been influenced by other standards and adopted concepts from them, e.g. CMMI, ISO 9000, or ISO/IEC 27000. Professional organizations There are international, chapter-based professional associations, such as the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF), and HDI. The main goal of these organizations is to foster the exchange of experiences and ideas between users of ITSM frameworks. To this end, national and local itSMF and HDI chapters (LIGs or local interest groups for itSMF) organize conferences and workshops. Some of them also contribute to the translations of ITSM framework documents into their respective languages or publish own ITSM guides. There are several certifications for service management like ITIL 2011 foundation. Information Technology Infrastructure Library IT service management is often equated with the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), even though there are a variety of standards and frameworks contributing to the overall ITSM discipline. ITIL originated as an official publication of United Kingdom government agencies (first CCTA, later OGC, then the Cabinet Office). In January 2014, ownership of ITIL was transferred to Axelos, a joint venture of the UK government and Capita, an international business process outsourcing and professional services company. The ITIL 4 Foundation Book was released on February 18, 2019[2]. In its former version (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of five core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage. Other frameworks Other frameworks for ITSM and overlapping disciplines include * Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a process framework for telecommunications service providers. * COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is an IT Governance framework that specifies control objectives, metrics and maturity models. Recent versions have aligned the naming of select control objectives to established ITSM process names. * FitSM is a standard for lightweight service management. It contains several parts, including e.g. auditable requirements and document templates, which are published under Creative Common licenses. Its basic process framework is in large parts aligned to that of ISO/IEC 20000. * ISO/IEC 20000 is an international standard for managing and delivering IT services. Its process model bears many similarities to that of ITIL version 2, since BS 15000 (precursor of ISO/IEC 20000) and ITIL were mutually aligned up to version 2 of ITIL. ISO/IEC 20000 defines minimum requirements for an effective \\"service management system\\" (SMS). Conformance of the SMS to ISO/IEC can be audited and organizations can achieve an ISO/IEC 20000 certification of their SMS for a defined scope. * MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework) includes, in addition to a general framework of service management functions, guidance on managing services based on Microsoft technologies.  Tools  Execution of ITSM processes in an organization, especially those processes that are more workflow-driven ones, can benefit significantly from being supported with specialized software tools.. ITSM tools are often marketed as ITSM suites, which support a whole set of ITSM processes. At their core is usually a workflow management system for handling incidents, service requests, problems and changes. They usually also include a tool for a configuration management database. The ability of these suites to enable easy linking between incident, service request, problem and change records with each other and with records of configuration items from the CMDB, can be a great advantage. ITSM tools are also commonly referred to as ITIL tools. More than 100 tools are self-proclaimed ITSM or ITIL tools.. Software vendors such as Axios Systems, OTRS and Marval (software), whose ITSM tools fulfill defined functional requirements to support a set of ITIL processes, can obtain official approval, allowing them to use Axelos trademarks and an \\"ITIL process compliant\\" logo, under Axelos' ITIL Software Endorsement scheme. = Service Desk = A Service Desk is a primary IT function within the discipline of IT service management (ITSM) as defined by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). It is intended to provide a Single Point of Contact (\\"SPOC\\") to meet the communication needs of both users and IT staff, and also to satisfy both Customer and IT Provider objectives. \\"User\\" refers to the actual user of the service, while \\"Customer\\" refers to the entity that is paying for service. The ITIL approach considers the service desk to be the central point of contact between service providers and users/customers on a day-to-day basis. It is also a focal point for reporting incidents (disruptions or potential disruptions in service availability or quality) and for users making service requests (routine requests for services). ITIL regards a call centre, contact centre or a help desk as limited kinds of service desk which provide only a portion of what a service desk can offer. A service desk has a more broad and user-centered approach which is designed to provide the user with an informed single point of contact for all IT requirements. A service desk seeks to facilitate the integration of business processes into the service management infrastructure. In addition to actively monitoring and owning Incidents and user questions, and providing the communications channel for other service management disciplines with the user community, a service desk also provides an interface for other activities such as customer change requests, third parties (e.g. maintenance contracts), and software licensing.

Bayar, as the Turkish President, was decorated with the Legion of Merit by the President of the United States, as a result of Turkey's participation in the Korean War. He is considered to be the longest-lived former head of state and was the longest-lived state leader until 8 December 2008 (when he was surpassed by Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum). Celal Bayar died on 22 August 1986 at the age of 103 after a brief illness. Early years Bayar was born on 16 May 1883 at Umurbey, a village of Gemlik, Bursa as the son of a religious leader and teacher who migrated from Lom, Ottoman Bulgaria. After school, he worked as a clerk, first in the court in Gemlik and in Ziraat Bankasƒ±. Then, in 1906, he was employed in the Deutsche Orientbank in Bursa. Political career In 1908, Bayar joined the volunteer‚Äôs troop of the Committee of Union and Progress, a political organization of Young Turks. He served as the secretary- general of the newly founded Bursa branch and later of the ƒ∞zmir branch of the party. In 1919, Bayar was elected to the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul as deputy of Saruhan (today Manisa). As he disagreed with the new constitution determined by the Sultan, in 1920 he went to Ankara to join Mustafa Kemal and the Turkish Independence Movement. He became an active member of the \\"M√ºdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti\\" (Association for Defence of Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia), another political organization formed after World War I.

The coca plant is the source of the potentially addictive stimulant cocaine, a prescription drug and one of the most widely consumed illegal drugs in the world and the source of large amounts of money to various criminal organizations. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial coca eradication campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as Plan Colombia.  Herbicide resistance  The herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a ‚Äúpeer-to-peer‚Äù network of coca farmers used selective breeding to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was genetically modified in a laboratory. In 1996, a patented Roundup Ready or glyphosate-resistant soybean was marketed by Monsanto Company, suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying Boliviana Negra with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non- resistant weeds surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in Wired, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the Roundup Ready soybean, suggesting Bolivana Negra was not created in a laboratory but by selective breeding in the fields. A fungal plant pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum, has been suggested as a possible successor to glyphosate, both similarly are hazards to humans and other plant species.

Fort Duquesne, established in 1755 at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at what is now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was named for him. It was abandoned by French forces in 1758 with the arrival of the much more powerful British Forbes Expedition, who erected Fort Pitt in its place. He was very aggressive in enforcing French claims in North America, by some accounts even clearing out British settlers out of disputed areas. He built a line of defensive fortifications to strengthen the French presence. He later returned to France. Battle of Cartagena In 1758 he led a French squadron out of Toulon, intended to relieve another French squadron which had been sailing to Louisbourg to provide relief to the defenders there, but had been forced into Cartagena in neutral Spain. However, Du Quesne was attacked by a British force led by Henry Osborne and two of his ships were captured, including his own flagship. The ultimate result of this action was to deny Louisbourg any chance of relief, and it surrendered later in the year. He died in 1778 in Antony, Hauts-de- Seine.

It first aired on December 16, 1987, on the ABC television network in the United States. Shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, its teleplay was conceived by longtime Muppet writer Jerry Juhl, and directed by Peter Harris and Eric Till (the latter of whom was uncredited). The special features various Muppets from The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and Muppet Babies. It also stars Gerard Parkes as Doc from the North American wraparound segments of Fraggle Rock, and Henson as himself in a cameo appearance. In the special, the Muppets surprise Fozzie Bear's mother Emily with a Christmas visit to her farm, not knowing that she had already rented out the place to Doc for the holidays so she could spend a winter vacation in Malibu. Due to licensing issues with the songs featured in A Muppet Family Christmas, some scenes have been cut from subsequent North American VHS and DVD releases. Plot Fozzie Bear is driving many of the Muppets to his mother Emily's farm for Christmas while they all sing Christmas Carols. Unbeknownst to Fozzie, Emily Bear is preparing to go to Malibu for the holiday and rent her farmhouse to Doc and Sprocket, who want to spend a nice quiet Christmas in the country. Doc and Sprocket have arrived when Fozzie and the other Muppets enter, disrupting Emily and Doc's plans for the holidays. Just then, Miss Piggy calls the telephone to tell Kermit the Frog that she is at a photo session and will be late, making Kermit very worried. More Muppets arrive, and they begin to prepare for Christmas. Meanwhile, outside, Fozzie builds a snowman, and the snowman comes to life singing along with Fozzie and putting on a comedy act with him. After the performance, Fozzie goes into the house where he tells Kermit about his new act. This is interrupted by Miss Piggy calling on the phone again, where she tells Kermit that she is doing a little Christmas shopping before she goes to the farm house. Sometime later, the gang watches home movies of themselves as babies during their first Christmas together. A group of carolers then arrive, proving to be Big Bird and the rest of the Sesame Street Muppets. All of the Muppets continue to prepare for Christmas as the news comes on TV that the worst blizzard in 50 years is approaching the area. Kermit realizes that Miss Piggy is out in the storm and gets more worried about her. Fozzie and Emily go over where everyone is going to sleep, and then the Sesame Street Muppets perform a pageant of 'Twas the Night Before Christmas. Kermit then gets a third call from Miss Piggy stating that her limo got stuck in the snow and that she is calling for a taxi. Fozzie approaches Kermit stating that now is a good time to show him his new comedy act with the Snowman, but their act is cut short no thanks to Statler and Waldorf. Feeling some sympathy for Kermit, Doc offers to go out looking for Miss Piggy. Kermit is called to the basement, where he and his nephew Robin find a Fraggle Hole and the Fraggles. Finally, after Miss Piggy gets to the house, all the Muppets sing a medley of carols and swap presents (except Oscar the Grouch, who just sits in his trash can, sighing very miserably due to his hatred for Christmas). Doc then comes in dressed as Santa giving presents to the Muppets. The last part shows Jim Henson himself making a cameo appearance preparing to do the washing up with Sprockett.

Construction  The 1992 Stock was built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) (under ABB, later Adtranz and now Bombardier Transportation) for the Central line following extensive testing of the three 1986 tube stock prototype trains. Even so, the introduction of this stock was far from trouble-free and there were many technical teething problems that had to be ironed out. Eighty-five 8-car trains were ordered from BREL, each formed of four two-car units (two units had driving cabs, the others were fitted with shunting controls). Upon entering service in April 1993, the new trains gradually replaced the previous 1962 tube stock, which was completely withdrawn two years later. The trains were manufactured at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The propulsion for the trains was manufactured by a consortium of ABB and Brush Traction, and was one of the first examples of microprocessor- controlled traction featuring a fibre-optic network to connect the different control units. The DC traction motors of LT130 type have separately-excited fields and are controlled via GTO (Gate turn-off) thyristors. A Wheel Slide Protection (WSP) system had to be retrofitted due to the fleet suffering an epidemic problem of wheel flats. This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases. The 1992 stock's design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The new 2009 stock trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the Victoria line, are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the 1995/1996 stock. = Waterloo & City line sets = Waterloo & City line train at Bank After the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for British Rail for the Waterloo & City line, which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as Class 482 until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to London Underground and the trains were simply referred to as 1992 Stock. The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP. Transport for London and Metronet closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the Network SouthEast colours used since the stock's introduction.  Operation  The 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a master switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual. In Automatic mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press a pair of \\"Start\\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded. In Coded Manual mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The speedometer on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops. In Restricted Manual mode, the train cannot exceed and the motors automatically cut out at . The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.  Announcer system  The 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until 2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'. The original format of the announcements were as follows: *, going eastbound to via : *:\\"This is Bank. Change for Northern, District and Circle lines, Docklands Light Railway and Network SouthEast services. ‚Ä¶ This train terminates at Hainault via Newbury Park.\\" (The Waterloo & City line was part of Network SouthEast at the time of the stock's introduction and the original recordings were never revised to reflect the takeover of the line by London Underground in 1994.) Since 2003, voice artist Emma Clarke has provided recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA. The new announcer system also includes next station announcements, which the original announcer system did not include. Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the Daily Mail was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \\"hated the tube,\\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons. The present format of the announcements is as follows: *, going eastbound to via : *:\\"This is Bank. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. Change here for the Circle, District, Northern and Waterloo & City lines, and the DLR. ‚Ä¶ This is a Central line train to Hainault via Newbury Park.\\" *Approaching : *:\\"The next station is Notting Hill Gate. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. Change here for the Circle and District lines.\\" In January 2018, the announcements were again revised for certain stations, to include new lines and connections (such as London Overground, TfL Rail and the construction of station) that did not exist in 2003. Chancery Lane derailment On 25 January 2003 a 1992 Stock train with approximately 500 people on board train derailed as it entered Chancery Lane station on the westbound line. The collision resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries. The cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost traction motor on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure. The traction motor was then struck by the remainder of the train as it passed over it, causing the following bogies to derail. The entire 1992 Stock fleet was withdrawn from service the same afternoon, and the Central and Waterloo & City lines were closed for several weeks until modifications were made. This included fitting new traction-motor bolts and secondary brackets in to prevent a loose motor from striking the track and causing further damage. The lines re-opened in stages from 14 March 2003.  Refurbishment  = Central line units = From 2011‚Äì2012, the Central line 1992 Stock units underwent a refresh of both the interior and exterior. Some of the noticeable changes included the addition of the new \\"Barman\\" seat moquette, new brighter interior lighting and the installation of new window frames. The front of the driving cabs were also refreshed. This included repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work and cleaning up the appearance of the front end. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the new red panelling installed on most units instead of the original grey. The refresh came after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line. TfL are planning a major refurbishment on the Central line units as part of a new 40-day programme. This includes a complete overhaul of the interior and adding new features such as new wheelchair spaces, PIS (Passenger Information Screens) and CCTV installed throughout the train. The London Underground corporate livery will also be repainted on these units as well as the replacement of the current traction motors. The programme will commence in summer 2020. = Waterloo & City line units = alt= In 2006, the Waterloo & City line was closed for several months to allow for track and signalling upgrade works. During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from Waterloo depot and taken by road to Wabtec Rail in Doncaster for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground's corporate livery. Internally, the handrails were repainted from Central line red to Waterloo & City line turquoise, new seat moquette was fitted and CCTV cameras were installed. Later, the units received the new \\"Barman\\" moquette fitted to the Central line units, but not the new lighting, window frames or front end.  Future replacement  In October 2014, it was confirmed that the 1992 stock will be replaced by new semi-articulated trains currently known as the 'New Tube for London'. The stock will be used on the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Central and Waterloo & City lines.

A stockade is an enclosure of palisades and tall walls, made of logs placed side by side vertically, with the tops sharpened as a defensive wall. As a frontier outpost As a security fence Stockade fortifications were simple forms of defence of military camps or settlements, used since ancient Roman times and earlier. The troops or settlers would build a stockade by clearing a space of woodland and using the trees whole or chopped in half, with one end sharpened on each. They would dig a narrow trench around the area, and stand the sharpened logs side-by-side inside it, encircling the perimeter. Sometimes they would add additional defence by placing sharpened sticks in a shallow secondary trench outside the stockade. In colder climates sometimes the stockade received a coating of clay or mud that would make the crude wall wind-proof. Builders could also place stones or thick mud layers at the foot of the stockade, improving the resistance of the wall. From that the defenders could, if they had the materials, raise a stone or brick wall inside the stockade, creating a more permanent defence while working protected. As a military prison The word stockade also refers to a military prison in an army camp. In some cases, the term was applied to a crude prison camp or a slave camp. In these cases, the stockade keeps people inside, rather than out. As decoration Nowadays, stockade walls are often used as garden fencing, made of finished planks more useful for privacy fencing and more decoration than security.

The three-day event is the largest military air show in the United States, with total annual attendance estimated at 700,000. The show is held in October each year. The 2011 show was the 56th edition of the event, and celebrated the 100th anniversary of naval aviation. In 2007, the Miramar Air Show was voted the \\"World's Best Military Air Show\\" by the International Council of Air Shows, the first time the award was given to a Marine Corps air station since 1994. The show includes a large selection of \\"static\\" (non-flying) displays representing aircraft from the United States Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as civilian and historic military aircraft. Numerous commercial vendors, recruiting displays representing all of the United States armed forces, area law enforcement recruiters, civilian flight organizations and a business and franchise fair are also on site. The show's daily performance schedule includes military and civilian aircraft, usually highlighted by the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, and is largely the same for all three days, with an extra \\"twilight show\\" on Saturday night only. Mornings are largely taken up by civilian performers, with military and more civilian performers in the afternoon. The Saturday \\"twilight\\" show includes military and civilian performers, a fireworks display and the detonation of the \\"Great Wall of Fire\\" pyrotechnic display. The air show for October 4‚Äì5, 2013 was canceled. Officials with the Marines confirmed the show was canceled as a result of the government shutdown.  Static Displays  AH-1Z Cobra helicopter gunship on static display.The show features more than 100 military and civilian aircraft on static display. The particular aircraft on hand changes each year depending on availability. Most aircraft can be toured by visitors, with active-duty service personnel on hand to answer questions. The displays are informally grouped into areas representing: * Air Force transport planes and bombers such as the C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster, KC-135 Stratotanker and C-130 Hercules, and B-52 Stratofortress, as well as fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Falcon, F-15 Eagle and F-22 Raptor, and other support and training aircraft; * \\"Squadron Row,\\" an area of booths staffed by units based at Miramar and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, as well as other Marine Corps bases, to meet the public and sell merchandise to support squadron activities, and to display squadron aircraft including fixed-wing (F/A-18 Hornet and AV-8B Harriers) and rotor-wing (AH-1 Cobra, MV-22 Osprey, and CH-53 Sea Stallion) vehicles; * The MAGTF area with rotor-wing and tilt-rotor aircraft representing units based at Miramar and nearby Camp Pendleton, and infantry units from Pendleton and other installations demonstrating M1 Abrams tanks, LAV-25 Light Armored Vehicles, support vehicles, artillery systems and infantry weapons; * a \\"War Birds\\" area representing WWII-era aircraft, aircraft from the Korean War and Vietnam War era, and aircraft from foreign countries; * Recruiting and informational displays by most branches of the U.S. armed forces, area law enforcement agencies, the Border Patrol, the Civil Air Patrol, and other civilian organizations.  Aerial Performers  The U.S. Navy Blue Angels perform at the Miramar Air ShowMost years the performance schedule is highlighted by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, who perform each day of the show. In 2007, the United States Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds, performed at the show (the two teams never perform together ). These performances mark the end of each day's aerial performance schedule, except for the Saturday twilight show. Separately, the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet and USMC AV-8B Harrier usually fly individual demonstrations. The MV-22 Osprey has also been featured since the 2011 show. In 2014, the Marine Corps F-35B Lightning flew for the first time at the show. Though focused on Marine Corps and Navy assets, the show also regularly includes U.S. Air Force aircraft, including the F-22 Raptor and other fighter aircraft when available. The U.S. Army Golden Knights Parachute Team frequently performs, and often jumps during the twilight show. Since 1999, the show has often featured a Navy Legacy Flight, where modern jets fly in formation with aircraft from previous eras in celebration of military veterans and naval aviation history. The show also attracts a number of civilian performers from the U.S. air show circuit, flying prop planes, jet aircraft and gliders. Frequent performers include Sean Tucker's Oracle Challenger, the Red Bull Helicopter (a modified Messerschmitt- B√∂lkow Blohm BO-105 capable of aerobatic maneuvers), and the \\"Shockwave\\" Jet Truck, which also perform during the twilight show. There is also a selection of radio-controlled planes.  MAGTF Demo  CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters land during the MAGTF demo at the MCAS Miramar Air Show A major element of each year's show is the MAGTF Demo, a simulated assault by numerous Marine Corps units that demonstrates the air, ground and logistical elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force. The demonstration is performed each day of the show and features an array of fixed-wing, helicopter and tilt-rotor aircraft‚ÄîF/A-18 Hornet and AV-8B Harrier jets, CH-53E Super Stallion, AH-1 Cobra and UH-1Y Venom helicopters, the MV-22 Osprey, and KC-130 Hercules tankers‚Äîall in the air simultaneously. The Hornet and Harrier jets take turns flying simulated attack runs and demonstrate mid-air refueling with the KC-130. The MV-22 Ospreys also demonstrate refueling, then deliver Marine Corps ground troops to the airfield, while the Cobra gunships simulate attack and air cover roles. (The MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft joined the MAGTF demo in 2010 and replaced the CH-46 Sea Knight entirely in 2014 as the aircraft was phased out of the Marine Corps inventory.) The UH-1 delivers a team of Marine infantry via a fast-rope insertion, where they simulate calling in a naval artillery barrage, then retrieves them in a Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction maneuver. On the ground, Marine infantry simulate an advance on an enemy position, joined by M-1 Abrams tanks, Light Armored Vehicles and Humvees. Throughout the demonstration the attacks are punctuated by controlled pyrotechnic explosions, culminating in a \\"wall of fire\\" detonation. An air and ground review concludes each performance.  History  Prior to 1998, the Miramar installation was operated by the Navy as Naval Air Station Miramar, and the Navy produced the Miramar Air Show. The Marine Corps aircraft squadrons based in the region at that time, and since shortly after WWII, were located at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin and Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Orange County, where the Marines had produced their own annual air show since 1950. In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced that MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin would be closed and the Miramar facility transferred to the Marine Corps. The final Marine Corps air show at El Toro was held in 1997, drawing two million visitors; the final Navy- produced Miramar Air Show was held later the same year. In 1998, the Marine Corps took over production of the show at Miramar. The 2013 edition of the show was cancelled the day before it was scheduled to begin as a result of federal budget battles. The full three-day show resumed in 2014.

The Chilean Navarino Island is seen in the top-right while the Argentine part of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego is seen at the bottom-left. Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Beagle Channel () is a strait in Tierra del Fuego Archipelago on the extreme southern tip of South America between Chile and Argentina.Sergio Zagier, 2006 The channel separates the larger main island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands including the islands of Picton, Lennox and Nueva; Navarino; Hoste; Londonderry; and Stewart. The channel's eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile. The Beagle Channel, the Straits of Magellan to the north, and the open-ocean Drake Passage to the south are the three navigable passages around South America between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. However, most commercial shipping uses the open-ocean Drake Passage. The Beagle Channel is about long and is about wide at its narrowest point. It extends from Nueva Island in the east to Darwin Sound and Cook Bay of the Pacific Ocean in the west. Some from its western end it divides into two branches, north and south of Gordon Island. The southwest branch between Hoste Island and Gordon Island enters Cook Bay. The northwest branch between Gordon Island and Isla Grande enters Darwin Sound connecting to the Pacific Ocean by the O'Brien Channel and the Ballenero Channel. The biggest settlement on the channel is Ushuaia in Argentina followed by Puerto Williams in Chile. These are two of the southernmost settlements of the world. Navigation Although it is navigable by large ships, there are safer waters to the south (Drake Passage) and to the north (Strait of Magellan). Under the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina, ships of other nations navigate with a Chilean pilot between the Strait of Magellan and Ushuaia through the Magdalena Channel and the Cockburn Channel to the Pacific Ocean, then by the Ballenero Channel, the O'Brien Channel and the northwest branch of the Beagle Channel.Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1984 Islands The Beagle Channel is between islands covering a much larger area; to the north lies Argentine-Chilean Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, to the south Hoste, Navarino, and Picton and Nueva, which were claimed by Argentina until 1984. The latter two lie at the bi-national eastern entrance to the channel while the western entrance is wholly inside Chile. The western entrance of Beagle Channel is divided by Gordon Island into two channels. Some minor islands exist inside the channel among them Snipe Islet and Gable Island. Except for eastern Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and Gable Island all islands mentioned here belong to Chile. History HMS Beagle at Ponsonby Sound in the Beagle Channel, by Conrad Martens. The Yaghan peoples settled the islands along the Murray Channel approximately 10,000 years before present. There are notable archaeological sites indicating such early Yaghan settlement at locations such as Bahia Wulaia on Isla Navarino, site of the Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 =Naming and Darwin visit= The channel was named after the ship HMS Beagle during its first hydrographic survey of the coasts of the southern part of South America which lasted from 1826 to 1830. During that expedition, under the overall command of Commander Phillip Parker King, the Beagle captain Pringle Stokes committed suicide and was replaced by captain Robert FitzRoy. The ship continued the survey in the second voyage of Beagle under the command of captain FitzRoy, who took Charles Darwin along as a self-funding supernumerary, giving him opportunities as an amateur naturalist. Darwin had his first sight of glaciers when they reached the channel on 29 January 1833, and wrote in his field notebook \\"It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as contrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow.\\"Charles Darwin, Voyage of the Beagle (New York: Collier, 1909), chapter 10, p. 240. =Beagle conflict= Several small islands (Picton, Lennox and Nueva) up to the Cape Horn were the subject of the long-running Beagle conflict between Chile and Argentina; by the terms of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina they are now part of Chile. From the 1950s to 1970s several incidents involving the Chilean and Argentine navies occurred in the waters of the Beagle Channel, for example the 1958 Snipe incident, the 1967 Cruz del Sur incident and the shelling of Quidora the same year.

The program airs several times daily TSN feeds, and on weekends on CTV.  History  The program was launched under its original title SportsDesk the same day as TSN itself debuted, on September 1, 1984. It retained that title until September 5, 2001, when the program was relaunched under a similar look and format to American cable network ESPN's flagship sportscast SportsCenter, with the title rendered in Canadian spelling. It also uses the current ESPN SportsCenter theme. The change in name occurred after majority ownership in TSN had been turned over to CTV the previous year when it acquired 80% of the network; the transaction required the approval of existing minority shareholder ESPN, which did so on the condition that TSN align its branding and programming more closely with ESPN's, and with it, also introducing a new logo that was akin to that of ESPN's. Since relaunching as SportsCentre, the program has normally originated from the CTV (now Bell Media) Agincourt studios at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Toronto. On September 25, 2006, SportsCentre began broadcasting in high definition. At that time, TSN expressed hopes to have all reports from its bureaus in HD in the near future.TSN - Canada's Sports Leader In the early 2010s, the program drew significant attention, including from media in the United States, for its 1 a.m. ET/morning-loop anchor team of Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole, which had taken the program in a much more irreverent and comedic direction. The Wall Street Journal published a feature story on the pair titled \\"Why Can't We Have Canada's 'SportsCentre'?\\", which compared the Onrait-O'Toole pairing to the likes of 1990s ESPN SportsCenter anchors Keith Olbermann and Craig Kilborn. The attention eventually led to Onrait, O'Toole, and their longtime producer Tim Moriarty all being hired by Fox Sports in the U.S. to help launch its new national cable channel Fox Sports 1 in 2013. Onrait and O'Toole served as hosts of Fox Sports Live, which was initially a competitor to the U.S. version of SportsCenter on ESPN (and later relaunched as a sports-oriented talk show), until February 2017 when Fox cancelled the show and allowed their contracts to expire. Jay and Dan were later rehired by TSN becoming the anchors of a new rebranded midnight ET edition of SportsCentre, SC with Jay and Dan. = Kraft Celebration Tour = From 2009 to 2014, for ten days in late August and/or early September of each year, SportsCentre travelled to ten communities across Canada under the banner of the \\"Kraft Celebration Tour\\". Two teams of anchors, one starting in the East and the other in the West, broadcast on alternating days during the tour. Each of the ten host communities received a minimum C$25,000 grant from Kraft Foods to support a community project related to sports or active living. Host communities were nominated by local residents and submissions are reviewed by a TSN/Kraft judging panel. From 2009 to 2013, the panel named the top 20 finalists each year (10 pairs of two) which were reduced to the ten hosts via online voting. In 2014, the judging panel named all ten hosts directly, with the public instead voting on the winner of a new $100,000 grand prize, and the nine other communities winning $25,000 as before. While the main judging criteria were related to the value of the proposed project and overall submission quality, production logistics and \\"the need to create a viable cross-Canada tour\\" were also considerations. The majority of provinces were represented each year, though some provinces sometimes had multiple hosts per year, meaning that smaller provinces (most frequently one or more in Atlantic Canada) were skipped in some years. No community in the territories was selected prior to 2013, when Fort Smith, Northwest Territories was selected in online voting over Whitehorse, Yukon. In 2015, the Kraft Celebration Tour was replaced with a new initiative, Kraft Project Play, which involves increased funding for community projects, but no longer includes live on-location broadcasts of SportsCentre. =2020 coronavirus pandemic reaction= On March 11, 2020, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely following the conclusion of that night's games as a result of Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19 before a game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder in Oklahoma City, which caused the game to be initially postponed. The following day, all of the other major sports leagues followed suit in suspending their seasons for an indefinite period in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and other sporting events were also canceled after plans to hold them without an audience fell through. After the cancellations were announced, TSN aired special editions of the program chronicling the effects of the pandemic and its impact on sporting events and the athletes' reactions to the pandemic via social media. Following a hiatus of original broadcasts, production of SportsCentre and SC with Jay and Dan resumed on April 6, 2020, with anchors and editorial staff working from their homes.https://www.bellmedia.ca/the-lede/press/tsn-resumes- production-of-sportscentre-and-sc-with-jay-and-dan-presented-by-mcdonalds- beginning-today/ Studio production of SportsCentre resumed in mid-June 2020. Airings of ESPN's SportsCenter and Get Up! were also added to the TSN schedule to provide supplemental news content.  Scheduling  TSN generally produces three editions of SportsCentre each day, all of which are usually at least one hour in length: early evening (6:00 p.m. ET), late evening in the East (typically 10:00 p.m. ET), and late evening in the West (1:00 a.m. ET). The latter broadcast is repeated on an hourly loop throughout the overnight and morning hours, typically running until 1:00 p.m. ET. Since the launch of TSN2 in 2008, some editions (and repeats) have occasionally aired on that channel in the event of programming conflicts on TSN. TSN has gradually increased the length and, in some cases, repetition of SportsCentre broadcasts such that the program is now sometimes carried for up to 16.5 hours out of the day (including \\"morning loop\\" repeats) on either TSN or TSN2 (this is similar to the expansion of SportsCenter broadcasts on ESPN since 2008, although with fewer live telecasts). For a time, TSN2 also carried an abbreviated highlights-only broadcast called SportsCentre Morning Rush, which aired on a 15-minute loop during the morning hours. This program has since been replaced with TSN Radio simulcasts and repeats of other TSN-produced programs such as That's Hockey 2Nite. Beginning with the 2007 NFL season, extra editions have been produced for sister network CTV as its post-game program for early-window Sunday afternoon NFL games. On weekends, CTV also airs repeats of the previous night's late edition of SportsCentre at noon local time. On September 4, 2017, a new midnight ET edition, SC with Jay and Dan was introduced, which is hosted by Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole as a distinct version of their previous tenure as late-night anchors of the program prior to their move to Fox Sports 1.  Format  For a 60-minute broadcast, the first half-hour typically contains highlights for the day's biggest events, sometimes with a weekly feature (such as \\"Plays of the Week\\" or \\"Ultimate SC\\") towards the end of that half-hour. The first segment of the second half-hour typically returns to the top two or three stories with packaged reports and/or panel analysis, which is followed by additional highlights and other features. Some highlights segments are given individual names at their conclusion (for example, \\"NHL Wrap-Up\\" or \\"Golf Report\\") for the apparent sole purpose of providing sponsorship opportunities related to those sports and are otherwise indistinguishable from the rest of the show. The second-to-last segment traditionally contains two daily features: the \\"Honour Roll\\", which is a collection of the best plays of the day in no particular order, and (on weeknights) the \\"SportsCentre Top 10\\", a countdown of past sports highlights with some theme, typically related to a recent sports event (typical topics might include: \\"Game 6 Performances Forcing a Game 7\\", \\"Odd Celebrity Moments\\", or \\"Objects Thrown by Spectators\\"; the Friday night/Saturday morning topic is almost always \\"Top 10 Must-See Moments\\" of the past week). This differs from ESPN's SportsCenter Top 10, which is usually just the top 10 plays of the day. The final segment includes the \\"Worst Play of the Day\\" and the \\"Highlight of the Night\\", the latter chosen from the Honour Roll highlights. In 2014, an online-poll feature titled \\"1v1\\", sponsored by Ram Trucks, was added to the closing segment of SportsCentre five nights per week (Sunday night/Monday morning through Thursday/Friday). Each day's poll pairs a reigning \\"champion\\" highlight (with a ten-day maximum) with a \\"challenger\\" (usually that edition's Highlight of the Night). This caused the Highlight of the Night announcement to be moved to the second-last segment right after the Top 10, and later the Honour Roll to be moved to the third-last segment. The traditional format is still used Friday and Saturday nights (Saturday and Sunday mornings). The early-evening (6:00 p.m. ET) edition varies from the above format slightly as it mostly previews the night's games and covers other off-field sports news, along with any daytime highlights. The second half-hour is largely a repeat of the first, with the exception of some features such as the extra segment of Pardon the Interruption produced for ESPN's SportsCenter in the first half, and the \\"Honour Roll Encore\\" (a repeat of the previous night's set of top highlights) at the end of the broadcast.

Born and raised in Sukhumi, Nadareishvili attended Sukhumi University, graduated in the early 1980s, and settled down to life as an academic writer. During the break-up of the Soviet Union, Nadareishvili became involved in Georgian National Liberation movement. After the war in Abkhazia, Georgia, Nadareishvili was elected by fellow Georgian refugees as the head of an exile government. In the 1990s he served at times in the Georgian parliament, continuing to draw support from refugees, to whom he helped distribute government aid. As head of the Council, Nadareishvili loudly supported military action to retake Abkhazia. Allegations were made claiming him being involved in paramilitary operations on the Abkhaz/Georgia administrative border. The Forest Brothers under Dato Shengelia and the White Legion under Zurab Samushia were both allegedly associated with the Supreme Council. Nadareishvili remained neutral during the Rose Revolution that ousted Eduard Shevardnadze in favor of Mikhail Saakashvili. However, Nadareishvili soon faced a revolt of his own, and resigned in January 2004 after a vote of no confidence by the Supreme Council.

The Passetto di Borgo, or simply Passetto, is an elevated passage that links the Vatican City with the Castel Sant'Angelo. It is an approximately long corridor, located in the rione of Borgo. It was erected in 1277 by Pope Nicholas III, but parts of the wall were built by Totila during the Gothic War. On at least two occasions it served as an escape route for Popes in danger. Pope Alexander VI crossed it in 1494, when Charles VIII invaded the city and the pope's life was in peril. Clement VII escaped to safety through this passage during the Sack of Rome in 1527, when troops of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, massacred almost the entire Swiss Guard on the steps of St Peter's Basilica. In popular culture The Passetto played a key role in the Dan Brown novel Angels & Demons, through which the antagonist (an illuminatus) transported four abducted cardinals to the Castel Sant'Angelo. The protagonists Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra later used the Passetto as a shortcut to Vatican City. The Passetto also appears in the videogame Assassin's Creed II, whose protagonist Ezio Auditore Da Firenze fights his way along it on the way from the Castle to the Sistine Chapel.

A fifth album, originally planned for release in 2006, was released independently in 2018. Formed in 1995 in Adelaide, they have achieved international acclaim during their career, receiving praise from such magazines as Orkus, Metal Hammer, Legacy and The Village Voice.Seward, Scott. Dirging Down Under. The Village Voice. 24‚Äì30 September 2003. retrieved on 2008-01-07 Having changed their line-up several times, Virgin Black currently consists of the founding members and main songwriters: Sesca Scaarba (formerly Samantha Escarbe) (guitar) and Rowan London (keyboard, vocals), with Grayh (bass) and Luke Faz (drums) joining in 2007. The group explains the meaning of its name as \\"the juxtaposition of purity and humanity's darkness\\". History =Early days= Virgin Black was originally formed in Adelaide by guitarist Samantha Escarbe, and vocalist and keyboards-player Rowan London. In 1995, Virgin Black recorded a four-track self-titled demo in a doom/death style. Due to the rarity and demand for this recording, the band has speculated that it may be re-released at some point. Their Trance EP was released in 1998, and the group began gaining international recognition with that recording. This EP was later included as part of a special limited edition (U.S. only) with the band's debut album, Sombre Romantic. =Record deal= Sesca Scaarba The group began recording their first full-length album Sombre Romantic in 1999. The album displays an expansively cinematic, symphonic style with London contributing a diverse vocal style from shrieks and growls to soaring melodies and choral chants. On the strength of this self-released debut, Virgin Black signed to Germany's Massacre Records for Europe and also to the U.S. label The End. Both labels then released Sombre Romantic in their territories. After completing their second album during 2002, Virgin Black played at Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in 2003 and did a tour through the US west coast with Agalloch and Antimatter before returning to Australia and conducting a national tour. Elegant... and Dying featured Escarbe contributing cello and guest musician Sonia Wilkie playing flute. It was released in November and a month later the band appeared at the Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra. Early the following year, Virgin Black toured alongside Opeth in Australia, and later did a tour of the Australian east coast capitals with Sydney black metal band Nazxul before making a start on their next recordings. =Requiem trilogy= Virgin Black's next project began with London and Escarbe composing a series of scores for what was to become the three-volume Requiem set. On 10 March 2006, The End Records issued a press release explaining the upcoming releases. The first part of the trilogy, Requiem - Pianissimo, is a strictly classically oriented album featuring the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, choral singing, and solo singers. Requiem - Mezzo Forte features music similar to the band's previous releases with the last part Requiem - Fortissimo primarily having a death/doom metal sound. The albums were recorded primarily as the duo of London and Escarbe over the course of almost two years, during which Rowan London suffered the death of his father. Originally designed to be released simultaneously in 2006, on 23 July, The Labels announced that the albums would instead be released during 2007 in a staggered time scale. The second part of the trilogy, Requiem - Mezzo Forte was issued first, on 3 April 2007. With a new line-up of Escarbe, London, Grayh on bass and drummer Luke Faz. Virgin Black played some Australian shows with Arcturus in March and headlined the Elements of Rock Festival in Switzerland in April. Virgin Black announced a US tour for June and July 2007, and played shows on the east and west coast of the U.S. with To/Die/For and headlined shows in Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The third part and the second installment in the Requiem trilogy, Requiem - Fortissimo was released on 19 February 2008 by The End Records. The Massacre Records release date remains unknown. Virgin Black played with Amorphis and Samael for a North American tour in fall 2008. Readers of the website Metal Storm voted Requiem Fortissimo for \\"the best doom metal album of 2008\\".The Best of Doom Metal. Metal Storm On 2 November 2012 it was announced on the band's official Facebook page that \\"...Virgin Black is still on an extended hiatus but preparing themselves for a return at some stage, and the release of Pianissimo when that happens\\", and went on to say that \\"...it might not be for some time yet, but thank you for your patience and continued enthusiasm for the band regardless\\". On 4 September 2018, after 10 years of silence, the band posted the first two songs from their long-awaited Pianissimo release. The songs are titled Requiem Aeternum and Dies Irae, with a total duration of 13:12. On 27 September 2018, the band speculated the date for the release of the complete album, scheduled for 30 November of that year, said in its official website that Virgin Black has broken ties with former record companies. In December 2018 the album appeared on YouTube. Style and influence Virgin Black's sound combines elements of doom metal and classical music. A critic described their style as having influences of \\"dark wave with gothic atmosphere\\" and \\"symphonic gothic-doom\\". Virgin Black states that their influences include the British group My Dying Bride, the American gothic metal band Saviour Machine and 19th century classical music. Their sound is typically sorrowful, representing mostly down-tempo arrangements. Rowan London employs various vocal styles including operatic, shrieking, death growls and melodramatic tenor and baritone singing, and the music often features choirs. Occasionally the lead guitarist Samantha Escarbe plays faster tremolo riffs typical of extreme metal, such as on \\"Drink the Midnight Hymn\\" from the debut album. Sometimes there are longer, mellow and emotional guitar solos such as on \\"Weep for Me\\". A great deal of variety can be found in their music. For instance, \\"Walk without Limbs\\" combines ominous cello with programmed drums for a softer darkwave style, the Requiem - Pianissimo album is entirely classical, whereas Requiem - Fortissimo's sound is firmly rooted in death/doom metal.

The symbol of Tierrasanta is an encircled Conquistador cross, similar to one atop Montserrat (mountain) near Barcelona, Spain, though it no longer holds any religious meaning. The community is referred to as \\"The Island in the Hills\\" by locals and on welcome signs, as there are only four roads that lead to Tierrasanta, all which end within the community. History Tierrasanta was originally part of the Mission San Diego de Alcal√° ranch, which was active during the late 18th and 19th centuries. The U.S. military purchased the land in 1941 as Camp Elliott, a Marine Corps training facility. The Marines moved out in 1944 and the land was transferred to the Navy. It was deactivated in 1946. In 1961, the U.S. Government sold the area that is now Tierrasanta and a portion of neighboring Mission Trails Regional Park to the City of San Diego. In the following year, the Elliott Community Plan was issued to serve as a roadmap for development going forward, and in 1971 Tierrasanta was founded. The current Tierrasanta community plan was first issued in 1982,Current Community Plan and included both the currently developed area and much of what is now Mission Trails Regional Park. By 1982 approximately one-half of the private residential area had been developed, with the area called Tierrasanta Norte, in the northeastern part of town, being one of the locations still to be developed. Tierrasanta has been almost fully built out since the early 1990s, and in 2010 had a population of 30,443 (ZIP code 92124).Census Bureau Fact Sheet Zip Code 92124 Some 2,300 homes grouped in the southwest portion of town are part of the Murphy Canyon military housing complex. Tierrasanta was one of the first master planned communities in San Diego. Because of the area's history as a military training base, some military debris including unexploded ordnance remained in the area when it was developed, in spite of multiple cleanup efforts by different branches of the services. In 1983 two 8-year-old Tierrasanta boys were killed after discovering unexploded ordnance in a canyon near their home.Channel 10 news, April 24, 2008 The military has performed clearance operations as recently as 1994 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to investigate the area every five years under its FUDS Formerly Used Defense Sites program. In October 2003, Tierrasanta, among other communities in San Diego, was affected by what was known as \\"Firestorm 2003.\\" This was a conglomeration of the Cedar Fire and numerous other wildfires that converged on Southern California. The residents of Tierrasanta were forced to evacuate. Nearly a dozen homes were lost to the blaze. Shortly after, in 2004, the Tierrasanta Community Emergency Response Team (T-CERT) was created for rapid local response to natural disasters. A similar scare swept through Tierrasanta in the fall of 2007, though residents were not required to evacuate. Geography The developed part of Tierrasanta, which rises from west to east and includes numerous canyons, is situated like an island, not directly bordered by any other community. It is bounded on the north by the Mount Soledad (52) Freeway and the sprawling southern fields of MCAS Miramar; on the east by the Mission Trails Regional Park, which has numerous hiking and mountain biking trails; on the west by slopes overlooking the wide Interstate 15 corridor running from Friars Road to Route 52, and on the south by slopes overlooking the Admiral Baker Golf Course and the San Diego River. Community activities focus on the Tierrasanta Recreation Center, which includes lighted sports fields, a large swimming pool, tennis courts, a gymnasium, and meeting rooms.Tierrasanta Recreation Center Numerous green belts with walking paths run through the canyons, and are kept in good condition with the help of the Friends of the Tierrasanta Canyons.Friends of Tierrasanta Canyons There are a number of entrances to Mission Trails Regional Park, including a heavily used entrance with parking at the eastern end of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard. The community has tree-lined streets and a secluded \\"small town\\" atmosphere, though it is centrally located within a 20-minute drive to downtown San Diego. Like most of the coastal areas in Southern California, the natural habitat in the canyons and other undeveloped areas within Tierrasanta, as well as in much of MCAS Miramar and Mission Trails Regional Park, is coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Tierrasanta is a community of single family homes, condominiums, apartments, three shopping centers, a branch of the San Diego Public Library, and a research park. Also located in the community are several top-ranked elementary and middle schools, part of the San Diego Unified School District, including Jun√≠pero Serra High School. Government and culture The elected Tierrasanta Community Council (TCC), which includes members from each of eight areas, has responsibility for community planning and for advising the City of San Diego and other government agencies on local issues. The TCC supports numerous events in the community such as the Concert in the park series, the Patriots Day Parade honoring Armed Forces Day on the third Saturday in May, Oktoberfest and other events. The TCC represents the citizens as their voice to the city government on land use and planning issues. The TCC also acts as the community's Town Council and takes positions on things that affect the Tierrasanta Community and the City of San Diego. Dedicated open space areas and landscaped medians are maintained by the Tierrasanta Maintenance Assessment District, which was established in 1972 and most recently approved by voters in 1997. The 818 acres of Tierrasanta Open Space qualifies this urban park as one of the 150 largest in the United States. The Friends of Tierrasanta Canyons is a Tierrasanta-based volunteer group that maintains the open spaces of the neighborhood's canyons. They meet the second Saturday of every month in various Tierrasanta open space locations. San Diego City Councilman Scott Sherman represents Tierrasanta and the entire District 7 in the city of San Diego. Cultural amenities The community has a branch library, jogging/biking trails, and several baseball and soccer teams. Music falling under the categories of jazz and instrumental concert band is quite prominent in addition to the numerous physical sports teams. The Tierra Times, a community service newspaper, has been published since 1971, and is delivered to all residents 13 times per year. An Armed Services YMCA is located in the Murphy Canyon area.

Available bioherbicides  While 13 different products have been launched, currently only 9 bioherbicides are available for sale/purchase in market globally. Below is the list of available bioherbicides: # Devine (1981) # Collego (1982) # BioMal (1992) # Woad Warrior (2002) # Chontrol (2005) # Smoulder (2005) # Sarritor (2007) # Organo-Sol (2010) # Beloukha (2015)  Marketing  With increasing awareness of the effects of the chemical herbicides and pesticides, bioherbicides can be adopted as an alternative especially for integrated weed management. The market share of bioherbicides is merely 10% of all biopesticides. On the other hand, the research spanning over two decades since 1980s has also falsified the principle that there is a coevolved natural enemy of a host weed which can manage weed through varied formulation and thus advocated for more research to culturally and genetically intensify the bioherbicidal organisms. Efficiency and efficacy of bioherbicides is impeded by changing weather and temperature and this can further obstruct the application and integration of bioherbicides. A study shows that by covering with jute turf, which retains moistures and allows one third of the sunlight to pass through, can increase the efficiency of bioherbicides and also remove some of the hindrances from the commercialization and marketing of bioherbicides.  Production  The production of bioherbicides is a process of biosynthesis where different mediums ranging from soybean bran to corn steep liquor are fermented to obtain desirable results. In addition to the solid-state fermentation, bioherbicides can also be produced by submerged fermentation in stirred tanks or in other environments. Despite the ‚Äòeco-friendliness‚Äô, there are several obstructions that make it less practical to use bioherbicides in fields because the lab results may not be the same as the real results.  Future  While it is true that after their 'discovery' the bioherbicides are not readily available on the market for various reasons, advocates of bioherbicides argue that bioherbicides-researchers should collaborate with other researchers and seek more funding for public sector so that the bioherbicides can become more marketable and attain more market share. Simultaneously, research from Canada reinforces that legislative and policy dynamics have great power to accelerate the innovation and integration of bioherbicides other microbial pest-control products.

Biography =Early life and career= He was born in Thomaston, Maine to Ebenezer Thatcher and Lucy Flucker Knox, the daughter of Major General Henry Knox. Appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1822, Thatcher was absent on sick leave for most of the first year and resigned in April 1823. He then received an appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on 4 March 1823. Thatcher spent most of the next four years on board the frigate in the Pacific. He became a passed midshipman on 4 March 1829, and in 1830-1831 served in the schooner and sloop of war in the West Indies. He was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1833 and served aboard the schooner in Chesapeake Bay. He then served on the frigate in the Mediterranean Squadron in 1834-35; had special duty in 1837; and returned to the Mediterranean in the frigate in 1840. He served aboard the receiving ship at Boston in 1843-46, then in the sloop-of-war , part of the Africa Squadron in 1847-50. After duty at Boston Navy Yard in 1851, he commanded the storeship in 1852. Promoted to commander on 14 September 1855, while serving as Executive Officer of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, Thatcher then commanded the small sloop of war in the Pacific in 1857-59. He was Executive Officer of the Boston Navy Yard from November 1859 to November 1861, and thus played a role in the vast expansion of the Navy that began with the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861. =Civil War= He was promoted to captain in 1861, and while commanding the large sloop of war in the Mediterranean, attained the rank of commodore on 3 July 1862. He commanded the screw frigate in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1864-65, and a division of Admiral Porter's Squadron at the two battles of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865. Thatcher was then appointed to command of the Western Gulf Squadron, immediately commencing operations in cooperation with General Canby, commander of the Army of West Mississippi, in the capture of Mobile, Alabama. After a brief and vigorous bombardment, Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley were captured by the Union Army on 9 April 1865. With the key defences of the city lost, the Confederate troops evacuated Mobile on April 12. A formal surrender was demanded by General Granger and Acting-Rear Admiral Thatcher, and possession taken of the city. On 10 May, the Confederate naval forces in the Gulf surrendered to Thatcher. Sabine Pass and Galveston, the only remaining rebel-held fortified points on the Gulf Coast, capitulated on 25 May and 2 June 1865. =Post-war career= Thatcher remained in command in the Gulf of Mexico until May 1866, receiving promotion to rear admiral on 25 July 1866, and commanded the North Pacific Squadron in 1867-68. There he was presented with a medal and made a Knight of the Order of Kamehameha I by King Kamehameha V of the Hawaiian Islands, an honor that he was permitted to accept by virtue of a special Act of Congress. Though put on the retired list on 26 May 1868 when he reached the age of 62, Thatcher served as Port Admiral at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1869-70. By right of his descent from his grandfather, Major General Henry Knox, Thatcher was a member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He became president of the Massachusetts Society in 1871. Thatcher and his family settled in Winchester, Massachusetts, where he spent the remaining nine years of his life. Rear Admiral Thatcher died at his home on 5 April 1880.

Henderson for the Boston Consulting Group in 1970 to help corporations to analyze their business units, that is, their product lines. This helps the company allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis. Some analysis of market performance by firms using its principles has called its usefulness into question.  Overview  To use the chart, analysts plot a scatter graph to rank the business units (or products) on the basis of their relative market shares and growth rates. *Cash cows is where a company has high market share in a slow-growing industry. These units typically generate cash in excess of the amount of cash needed to maintain the business. They are regarded as staid and boring, in a \\"mature\\" market, yet corporations value owning them due to their cash-generating qualities. They are to be \\"milked\\" continuously with as little investment as possible, since such investment would be wasted in an industry with low growth. Cash \\"milked\\" is used to fund stars and question marks, that are expected to become cash cows some time in the future. *Dogs, more charitably called pets, are units with low market share in a mature, slow-growing industry. These units typically \\"break even\\", generating barely enough cash to maintain the business's market share. Though owning a break-even unit provides the social benefit of providing jobs and possible synergies that assist other business units, from an accounting point of view such a unit is worthless, not generating cash for the company. They depress a profitable company's return on assets ratio, used by many investors to judge how well a company is being managed. Dogs, it is thought, should be sold off once short-time harvesting has been maximized. *Question marks (also known as adopted children or Wild dogs) are businesses operating with a low market share in a high-growth market. They are a starting point for most businesses. Question marks have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If question marks do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. When shift from question mark to star is unlikely, the BCG matrix suggests divesting the question mark and repositioning its resources more effectively in the remainder of the corporate portfolio. Question marks must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share. *Stars are units with a high market share in a fast- growing industry. They are graduated question marks with a market- or niche- leading trajectory, for example: amongst market share front-runners in a high- growth sector, and/or having a monopolistic or increasingly dominant unique selling proposition with burgeoning/fortuitous proposition drive(s) from: novelty, fashion/promotion (e.g. newly prestigious celebrity-branded fragrances), customer loyalty (e.g. greenfield or military/gang enforcement backed, and/or innovative, grey-market/illicit retail of addictive drugs, for instance the British East India Company's, late-1700s opium-based Qianlong Emperor embargo-busting, Canton System), goodwill (e.g. monopsonies) and/or gearing (e.g. oligopolies, for instance Portland cement producers near boomtowns), etc. The hope is that stars become next cash cows. :Stars require high funding to fight competitors and maintain their growth rate. When industry growth slows, if they remain a niche leader or are amongst the market leaders, stars become cash cows; otherwise, they become dogs due to low relative market share. As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually, the market stops growing; thus, the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle, the cash cow turns into a dog. As BCG stated in 1970: > Only a diversified company with a balanced portfolio can use its strengths > to truly capitalize on its growth opportunities. The balanced portfolio has: > *stars whose high share and high growth assure the future; *cash cows that > supply funds for that future growth; and *question marks to be converted > into stars with the added funds. Practical use \\"To be successful, a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares. The portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows. High growth products require cash inputs to grow. Low growth products should generate excess cash. Both kinds are needed simultaneously.\\"‚ÄîBruce Henderson. For each product or service, the 'area' of the circle represents the value of its sales. The growth‚Äìshare matrix thus offers a \\"map\\" of the organization's product (or service) strengths and weaknesses, at least in terms of current profitability, as well as the likely cashflows. The need which prompted this idea was, indeed, that of managing cash-flow. It was reasoned that one of the main indicators of cash generation was relative market share, and one which pointed to cash usage was that of market growth rate. =Relative market share= This indicates likely cash generation, because the higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of 'economies of scale' (a basic assumption of the BCG Matrix), it is assumed that these earnings will grow faster the higher the share. The exact measure is the brand's share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization's brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows. If this technique is used in practice, this scale is logarithmic, not linear. On the other hand, exactly what is a high relative share is a matter of some debate. The best evidence is that the most stable position (at least in fast-moving consumer goods markets) is for the brand leader to have a share double that of the second brand, and triple that of the third. Brand leaders in this position tend to be very stable‚Äîand profitable; the Rule of 123. The selection of the relative market share metric was based upon its relationship to the experience curve. The market leader would have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.Fripp, Geoff.\\"BCG Matrix and the Experience Curve\\" Guide to the BCG Matrix Another reason for choosing relative market share, rather than just profits, is that it carries more information than just cash flow. It shows where the brand is positioned against its main competitors, and indicates where it might be likely to go in the future. It can also show what type of marketing activities might be expected to be effective. =Market growth rate= Rapidly growing in rapidly growing markets, are what organizations strive for; but, as we have seen, the penalty is that they are usually net cash users ‚Äì they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being 'bought' by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum.Fripp, Geoff.\\"BCG Matrix: Where to Draw the Line?\\" Guide to the BCG Matrix Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth‚Äìshare matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from fast-moving consumer goods markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in BCG Matrix work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets. Where it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market's strength, of its future potential (of its 'maturity' in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis. =Critical evaluation= While theoretically useful, and widely used, several academic studies have called into question whether using the growth‚Äìshare matrix actually helps businesses succeed, and the model has since been removed from some major marketing textbooks.Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share http://cogprints.org/5196/1/myth_of_market_share.pdf See discussion on page 14. One study (Slater and Zwirlein, 1992) which looked at 129 firms found that those who follow portfolio planning models like the BCG matrix had lower shareholder returns. There are further criticisms to the BCG Matrix. The Matrix defines dogs as having low market share and relatively low market growth rate. This can be challenged as there are several dogs on the market which are very profitable and retain part of a significant market without dominating it. BIC razor blades are a modern-day example. BIC Razor Blades cost the firm an average of ¬£0.05 to produce and have a retail selling price of ¬£2.43. This demonstrates how the BCG Matrix contradicts itself as a dog with little cash usage can produces a substantial income. =Misuse= As originally practiced by the Boston Consulting Group,the Rule of 123 the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a portfolio composition as a function of the balance between cash flows. If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages. In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else‚Äîand is often what most students, and practitioners, remember. This is unfortunate, since such simplistic use contains at least two major problems: *'Minority applicability'. The cashflow techniques are only applicable to a very limited number of markets (where growth is relatively high, and a definite pattern of product life-cycles can be observed, such as that of ethical pharmaceuticals). In the majority of markets, use may give misleading results. *'Milking cash cows'. Perhaps the worst implication of the later developments is that the (brand leader) cash cows should be milked to fund new brands. This is not what research into the fast-moving consumer goods markets has shown to be the case. The brand leader's position is the one, above all, to be defended, not least since brands in this position will probably outperform any number of newly launched brands. Such brand leaders will, of course, generate large cash flows; but they should not be 'milked' to such an extent that their position is jeopardized. In any case, the chance of the new brands achieving similar brand leadership may be slim‚Äîcertainly far less than the popular perception of the Boston Matrix would imply. Perhaps the most important danger is, however, that the apparent implication of its four-quadrant form is that there should be balance of products or services across all four quadrants; and that is, indeed, the main message that it is intended to convey. Thus, money must be diverted from 'cash cows' to fund the 'stars' of the future, since 'cash cows' will inevitably decline to become 'dogs'. There is an almost mesmeric inevitability about the whole process. It focuses attention, and funding, on to the 'stars'. It presumes, and almost demands, that 'cash cows' will turn into 'dogs'. The reality is that it is only the 'cash cows' that are really important‚Äîall the other elements are supporting actors. It is a foolish vendor who diverts funds from a 'cash cow' when these are needed to extend the life of that 'product'. Although it is necessary to recognize a 'dog' when it appears (at least before it bites you) it would be foolish in the extreme to create one in order to balance up the picture. The vendor, who has most of his (or her) products in the 'cash cow' quadrant, should consider himself (or herself) fortunate indeed, and an excellent marketer, although he or she might also consider creating a few stars as an insurance policy against unexpected future developments and, perhaps, to add some extra growth. There is also a common misconception that 'dogs' are a waste of resources. In many markets 'dogs' can be considered loss-leaders that while not themselves profitable will lead to increased sales in other profitable areas. =Alternatives= As with most marketing techniques, there are a number of alternative offerings vying with the growth‚Äìshare matrix although this appears to be the most widely used. The next most widely reported technique is that developed by McKinsey and General Electric, which is a three-cell by three-cell matrix‚Äîusing the dimensions of 'industry attractiveness' and 'business strengths'. This approaches some of the same issues as the growth‚Äìshare matrix but from a different direction and in a more complex way (which may be why it is used less, or is at least less widely taught). Both growth-share matrix and Industry Attractiveness-Business Strength matrix developed by McKinsey and General Electric, are criticized for being static as they portray businesses as they exist at one point in time. Business environment is subject to constant changes, hence, businesses evolve over time. The Life Cycle- Competitive Strength Matrix was introduced to overcome these deficiences and better identify \\"developing winners\\" or potential \\"loosers\\". A more practical approach is that of the Boston Consulting Group's Advantage Matrix, which the consultancy reportedly used itself though it is little known amongst the wider population. Other uses The initial intent of the growth‚Äìshare matrix was to evaluate business units, but the same evaluation can be made for product lines or any other cash-generating entities. This should only be attempted for real lines that have a sufficient history to allow some prediction; if the corporation has made only a few products and called them a product line, the sample variance will be too high for this sort of analysis to be meaningful.

History Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010 AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (KHD), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis- Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier. The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO- Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO- Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America. In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost. Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company. In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea, gaining New Idea hay equipment, manure spreaders, White planters, from a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio. Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008 Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors, manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased. 1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group, which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil. This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina. Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada. Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson. Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009 1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company. Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines. In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies. Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and \\"Wrangler\\" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001. For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture. In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business. Ag- Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color. 2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation, giving the firm a well- known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. The firm further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment. 2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU Diesel engines. A Finland based diesel engine manufacturer with production in Brazil as well. Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008 2006 saw a re- focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor. In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands. In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology. Late in 2009, the firm announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011. In late 2010, the firm announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.AGCO ‚Äì Laverda In 2011, the firm plans to transfer its high- horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by . In 2011, the firm said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013. In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group. In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. It also purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.

The significance of this lion pair was their unusual behavior of killing men and the manner of their attacks. History As part of the construction of a railway linking Uganda with the Indian Ocean at Kilindini Harbour, in March 1898 the British started building a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. The building site consisted of several camps spread over an 8 mile area, accommodating the several thousand mostly Indian laborers. The project was led by Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, who arrived just days before the disappearances and killings began. During the next nine months of construction, two maneless male Tsavo lions stalked the campsite, dragging workers from their tents at night and devouring them. There was an interval of several months when the attacks ceased, but word trickled in from other nearby settlements of similar lion attacks. When the lions returned the attacks intensified, with almost daily killings. Crews tried to scare off the lions and built campfires and bomas, or thorn fences made of whistling thorn trees around their camp for protection to keep the man-eaters out, all to no avail; the lions leaped over or crawled through the thorn fences. Patterson noted that early in their killing spree, only one lion at a time would enter the inhabited areas and seize victims, but later they became more brazen, entering together and each seizing a victim. As the attacks mounted, hundreds of workers fled from Tsavo, halting construction on the bridge. At this point, colonial officials began to intervene. According to Patterson, even the District Officer, Mr. Whitehead, narrowly escaped being killed by one of the lions after arriving at the Tsavo train depot in the evening. His assistant, Abdullah, was killed while Whitehead escaped with four claw lacerations running down his back. Eventually other officials arrived, with a reinforcement of around 20 armed Sepoys to assist in the hunt. Patterson set traps and tried several times to ambush the lions at night from a tree. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he shot the first lion on 9 December 1898. Twenty days later, the second lion was found and killed. The first lion killed measured from nose to tip of tail. It took eight men to carry the carcass back to camp. Patterson wrote in his account that he wounded the first lion with one bullet from a high-calibre rifle. This shot struck the lion in its hind leg, but it escaped. Later, it returned at night and began stalking Patterson as he tried to hunt it. He shot it through the shoulder, penetrating its heart with a more powerful rifle and found it lying dead the next morning not far from his platform. The second lion was shot at up to nine times, five with the same rifle, three with a second, and once with a third rifle ‚Äî six finding their mark. The first shot was fired from atop a scaffolding that Patterson had built near a goat killed by the lion. Two shots from a second rifle hit the lion 11 days later as it was stalking Patterson and trying to flee. When they found the lion the next day, Patterson shot it three more times with the same rifle, severely crippling it, and he shot it three times with a third rifle, twice in the chest, and once in the head, which killed it. He claimed it died gnawing on a fallen tree branch, still trying to reach him. The construction crew returned and finished the bridge in February 1899. The exact number of people killed by the lions is unclear. Patterson gave several figures, overall claiming that there were 135 victims. At the end of the crisis, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Lord Salisbury, addressed the House of Lords on the subject of the Tsavo man- eaters: Museum display After 25 years as Patterson's floor rugs, the lions' skins were sold to the Field Museum of Natural History in 1924 for a sum of $5,000. The skins arrived at the museum in very poor condition. The lions were reconstructed and are now on permanent display along with their skulls. Modern research Tsavo Lion skulls on display at the Field Museum in Chicago In 2001, a review about causes for man-eating behaviour among lions revealed that the proposed human toll of 100 or more was most likely an exaggeration and that the more likely death toll was 28‚Äì31 victims. This reduced total was based on their review of Colonel Patterson's original journal, courtesy of Alan Patterson. The two lion specimens in Chicago's Field Museum are known as FMNH 23970, the 'standing' mount, killed on 9 December 1898, and FMNH 23969, the 'crouching' mount, killed on 29 December 1898. Recent studies on the isotopic signature analysis of Œî13C and Nitrogen-15 in their bone collagen and hair keratin were published in 2009. Using realistic assumptions on the consumable tissue per victim, lion energetic needs, and their assimilation efficiencies, researchers compared the man-eaters' Œî13C signatures to various reference standards: Tsavo lions with normal (wildlife) diets, grazers and browsers from Tsavo East and Tsavo West, and the skeletal remains of Taita people from the early 20th century. Interpolation of their estimates across the 9 months of recorded man-eating behavior suggested that FMNH 23969 ate the equivalent of 10.5 humans and that FMNH 23970 ate 24.2 humans. The scientific analysis does not differentiate between entire human corpses consumed, compared to parts of individual prey, since the attacks often raised alarm forcing the lions to slink back into the surrounding area. Many workers over the long construction period went missing, died in accidents, or simply left out of fear; so it is likely almost all of the builders, who stayed on, knew someone missing or supposedly eaten. It appears that Colonel Patterson may have exaggerated his claims as have subsequent investigators (e.g. \\"135 armed men\\", Neiburger and Patterson, 2000) though none of these modern studies have taken into account the people who were killed but not eaten by the animals. The diet of the victims would also affect their isotopic signature. A low meat diet would produce a signature more typical of herbivores in the victims, affecting the outcome of the test. That fact is important to note since many of the workers at Tsavo were Hindus and may have had a vegetarian diet. This research also excludes, but does not disprove, the claims that the lions were not eating the victims they killed but merely killing just to kill. Similar claims have been made of other wildlife predators. Possible causes of \\"man-eating\\" behaviour Theories for the man-eating behaviour of lions have been reviewed by Peterhans and Gnoske, as well as Bruce D. Patterson (2004). Their discussions include the following: *An outbreak of rinderpest (cattle plague) in 1898 devastated the lions' usual prey, forcing them to find alternative food sources. *The Tsavo lions may have been accustomed to finding dead humans at the Tsavo River crossing. Slave caravans to the center of the Arab slave trade, Zanzibar, routinely crossed the river there. *\\"Ritual invitation\\", or abbreviated cremation of Hindu railroad workers, invited scavenging by the lions. An alternative argument indicates that the first lion had a severely damaged tooth that would have compromised its ability to kill natural prey. This theory has been generally disregarded by the general public and Colonel Patterson, who killed the lions, personally disclaimed it, saying that he damaged that tooth with his rifle while the lion charged him one night, prompting it to flee. Studies indicate the lions ate humans as a supplement to other food, not as a last resort. Eating humans was probably an alternative to hunting or scavenging caused by dental disease and/or a limited number of prey. In a 2017 study carried out by the team of Dr. Bruce Patterson found that one of the lions had an infection at the root of his canine tooth, which made it hard for the lion to hunt. Lions normally use their jaws to grab prey like zebras and wildebeests and suffocate them. Popular culture =In film= Patterson's book was the basis for several movies: * Men Against the Sun (1952) * Bwana Devil (1952) * Killers of Kilimanjaro (1956) * The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) - a film in which Val Kilmer plays John Henry Patterson * Prey (2007) *Prooi (2016) =In games= * The lions appear as a difficulty to be overcome in the \\"Cape to Cairo\\" scenario of the video game Railroad Tycoon II. * Tsavo'ka (translation: Ghost in the Darkness) is a rare tiger that can be found on the Timeless Isle in World of Warcraft. * In Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011 the lions were mentioned by the character Mbeki to the main character Cole as he was telling him about mysterious animals that have been terrorizing local villages.

Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, it proved to be structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building. Built as a toll bridge, by Geoffrey Marks, it was commercially unsuccessful. Ownership was incorrectly contested by David Jacobs. The Times of London called Mr Jacobs' ownership claim \\"false, ludicrous and demonstrably untrue\\". Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted. The tollbooths remained in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London. Nicknamed \\"The Trembling Lady\\" because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it, the bridge has signs at its entrances that warn troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge. Incorporating a roadway only wide, and with serious structural weaknesses, the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with the advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs. It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced (the other is Tower Bridge). The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life. As a result, it is the second-least busy Thames road bridge in London; only Southwark Bridge carries less traffic. In 1992, Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000 LEDs adding to its status as a landmark. History Chelsea and Battersea in 1891, showing (left to right) Old Battersea Bridge, Albert Bridge, Victoria (now Chelsea) Bridge and Grosvenor Railway Bridge. Battersea and Albert bridges are less than apart. The historic industrial town of Chelsea on the north bank of the River Thames about west of Westminster, and the rich farming village of Battersea, facing Chelsea on the south bank, were linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge in 1771. In 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the construction of an embankment at Chelsea to free land for development, and proposed a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge, and the replacement of the latter by a more modern structure. Work on the Victoria Bridge (later renamed Chelsea Bridge), a short distance downstream of Battersea Bridge, began in 1851 and was completed in 1858, with work on the Chelsea Embankment beginning in 1862. Meanwhile, the proposal to demolish Battersea Bridge was abandoned. The wooden Battersea Bridge had become dilapidated by the mid-19th century. It had grown unpopular and was considered unsafe. The newer Victoria Bridge, meanwhile, suffered severe congestion. In 1860, Prince Albert suggested that a new tollbridge built between the two existing bridges would be profitable, and in the early 1860s, the Albert Bridge Company was formed with the aim of building this new crossing. A proposal put forward in 1863 was blocked by strong opposition from the operators of Battersea Bridge, which was less than from the proposed site of the new bridge and whose owners were consequently concerned over potential loss of custom. A compromise was reached, and in 1864 a new Act of Parliament was passed, authorising the new bridge on condition that it was completed within five years. The Act compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge once the new bridge opened, and to compensate its owners by paying them ¬£3,000 per annum (about ¬£ in ) in the interim. The 1868 Franz Joseph Bridge in Prague was built to the proposed design of the future Albert Bridge. Rowland Mason Ordish was appointed to design the new bridge. Ordish was a leading architectural engineer who had worked on the Royal Albert Hall, St Pancras railway station, the Crystal Palace and Holborn Viaduct. The bridge was built using the Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre system, an early form of cable-stayed bridge design which Ordish had patented in 1858. Ordish's design resembled a conventional suspension bridge in employing a parabolic cable to support the centre of the bridge, but differed in its use of 32 inclined stays to support the remainder of the load. Each stay consisted of a flat wrought iron bar attached to the bridge deck, and a wire rope composed of 1,000 diameter wires joining the wrought iron bar to one of the four octagonal support columns. Construction Although authorised in 1864, work on the bridge was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north bank of the river had been agreed. While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge. Chelsea Embankment and Albert Bridge under construction, 1873 In 1869, the time allowed by the 1864 Act to build the bridge expired. Delays caused by the Chelsea Embankment project meant that work on the bridge had not even begun, and a new Act of Parliament was required to extend the time limit. Construction finally got underway in 1870, and it was anticipated that the bridge would be completed in about a year, at a cost of ¬£70,000 (about ¬£ in ). In the event, the project ran for over three years, and the final bill came to ¬£200,000 (about ¬£ in ). It was intended to open the bridge and the Chelsea Embankment in a joint ceremony in 1874, but the Albert Bridge Company was keen to start recouping the substantially higher than expected costs, and the bridge opened without any formal ceremony on 23 August 1873, almost ten years after its authorisation. As the law demanded, the Albert Bridge Company then bought Battersea Bridge. Ordish's bridge was wide and long, with a central span. The deck was supported by 32 rigid steel rods suspended from four octagonal cast iron towers, with the towers resting on cast iron piers. The four piers were cast at Battersea and floated down the river into position, at which time they were filled with concrete; at the time they were the largest castings ever made. Unlike most other suspension bridges of the time, the towers were positioned outside the bridge to avoid causing any obstruction to the roadway. At each entrance was a pair of tollbooths with a bar between them, to prevent people entering the bridge without paying. Warning to troops The bridge acquired the nickname of \\"The Trembling Lady\\" because of its tendency to vibrate, particularly when used by troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks. Concerns about the risks of mechanical resonance effects on suspension bridges, following the 1831 collapse of the Broughton Suspension Bridge and the 1850 collapse of Angers Bridge, led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step (i.e. not to march in rhythm) when crossing the bridge; Although the barracks closed in 2008, the warning signs are still in place. Transfer to public ownership The octagonal tollbooths are London's last surviving bridge tollbooths. Albert Bridge was catastrophically unsuccessful financially. By the time the new bridge opened, the Albert Bridge Company had been paying compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company for nine years, and on completion of the new bridge became liable for the costs of repairing the by then dilapidated and dangerous structure. The cost of subsidising Battersea Bridge drained funds intended for the building of wide approach roads, making the bridge difficult to reach. It was located slightly further from central London than neighbouring Victoria (Chelsea) Bridge, and demand for the new bridge was less than expected. In the first nine months of its operation ¬£2,085 (about ¬£ in ) were taken in tolls. In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed, which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo bridges and free them from tolls. In 1879, Albert Bridge, which had cost ¬£200,000 to build, was bought by the Board of Works along with Battersea Bridge for a combined price of ¬£170,000 (about ¬£ in ). The tolls were removed from both bridges on 24 May 1879, but the octagonal tollbooths were left in place, and today are the only surviving bridge tollbooths in London. Structural weaknesses In 1884 the Board of Works' Chief Engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette conducted an inspection of the bridge and found that the iron rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion. Over the next three years the staying rods were augmented with steel chains, giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge, and a new timber deck was laid, at a total cost of ¬£25,000 (about ¬£ in ). Despite these improvements, Bazalgette was still concerned about its structural integrity and a weight limit of five tons was imposed on vehicles using the bridge. With a roadway only wide and subject to weight restrictions from early on, Albert Bridge was ill-suited to the advent of motorised transport in the 20th century. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic recommended demolition and rebuilding of the bridge to carry four lanes of traffic, but the plan was not carried out because of a shortage of funds in the Great Depression. It continued to deteriorate, and in 1935 the weight limit was reduced to two tons. Because of its ongoing structural weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed replacing Albert Bridge with a more conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in the withdrawal of the proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.Albert Bridge Commercial Motor 24 March 1972 =Pedestrianised park proposal= Concrete central piers were added in 1973, making the bridge an unusual hybrid of a cable-stayed bridge, suspension bridge and beam bridge. The GLC's solution entailed adding two concrete piers in the middle of the river to support the central span and thus transform the bridge's central section into a beam bridge. The bridge's main girder was also strengthened, and a lightweight replacement deck was laid. The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure to extend the bridge's life by five years while a replacement was being considered; in the GLC's estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30 years, but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then. In early 1973, the Architectural Review submitted a proposal to convert Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000 signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention to proceed with the Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with. The Royal Automobile Club campaigned vigorously against the pedestrianisation proposal. A publicity campaign fronted by actress Diana Dors in favour of reopening the bridge was launched, whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet Robert Graves campaigned in support of the GLC's plan. Graves's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation, who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as \\"sending a lot of students around to council flats [where] most people will sign anything without knowing what it is all about\\". A public inquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place. Present day The unusual colour scheme is intended to increase visibility to shipping in poor lighting conditions. In 1990, the tidal flow system was abandoned and Albert Bridge was converted back to two-way traffic. A traffic island was installed on the south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it. In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large four-wheel drive cars (so-called Chelsea tractors), many of which were over the two-ton weight limit; it was estimated that one third of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit. In July 2006 the wide roadway was narrowed to a single lane in each direction to reduce the load. Red and white plastic barriers have been erected along the roadway in an effort to protect the structure from damage by cars. Between 1905 and 1981, Albert Bridge was painted uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. This has added to its status as a London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to increase visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminated the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. 4,000 bulbs illuminate Albert Bridge at night Except for Tower Bridge, built in 1894, Albert Bridge is the only Thames road bridge in central London never to have been replaced. Intended as a temporary measure to be removed in 1978, the concrete central piers remain in place, and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years, the bridge is still standing and operational. The Albert Bridge was protected as a Grade II* listed structure in 1975, granting it protection against significant alteration without consultation. It continues to deteriorate. Although proposals have been drawn up by Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to repair and rescue it, by March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable. As well as structural damage caused by traffic, the timbers underpinning the deck were being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing to and from nearby Battersea Park. With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong the life of the bridge, in 2009 it carried approximately 19,000 vehicles per day, the lowest usage of any Thames road bridge in London other than the little-used Southwark Bridge. =Refurbishment of 2010‚Äì2011= The bridge was closed to motor vehicles on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after the condition of the bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost ¬£7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London. It re- opened on 2 December 2011, when two dogs named Prince and Albert, from nearby Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, walked across the bridge to open it officially. All of the Grade II features were retained. In popular culture Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby. It is also at the centre of a song by The Pogues, \\"Misty Morning, Albert Bridge\\" from their Peace and Love album (1989).

The two venom molecules, melittin and secapin, that are over-expressed in honey bees infected with various pathogens, possibly indicate a role for melittin in the immune response of bees to infectious diseases.  Structure  Melittin is a small peptide with no disulfide bridge; the N-terminal part of the molecule is predominantly hydrophobic and the C-terminal part is hydrophilic and strongly basic. In water, it forms a tetramer but it also can spontaneously integrate itself into cell membranes.  Mechanism of action  Injection of melittin into animals and humans causes pain sensation. It has strong surface effects on cell membranes causing pore- formation in epithelial cells and the destruction of red blood cells. Melittin also activates nociceptor (pain receptor) cells through a variety of mechanisms. Melittin can open thermal nociceptor TRPV1 channels via cyclooxygenase metabolites resulting in depolarization of nociceptor cells. The pore forming effects in cells causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also activates G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated opening of transient receptor potential channels. Finally melittin up-regulates the expression of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 sodium channels in nociceptor cell causing long term action potential firing and pain sensation. Melittin inhibits protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and Na+/K+-ATPase (synaptosomal membrane). Mellitin blocks transport pumps such as the Na+-K+-ATPase and the H+-K+-ATPase. Toxicity of a bee sting Melittin is the main compound in bee venom, accounting for the potential lethality of a bee sting, which causes an anaphylactic reaction in some people. At the sites of multiple stings, localized pain, swelling, and skin redness occur, and if bees are swallowed, life-threatening swelling of the throat and respiratory passages may develop. Use  Bee venom therapy has been used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, although its non-specific toxicity has limited scientific research on its potential effects.

The album was recorded in one day, July 5, 1996, with indie rock producer Kramer, and mixed on July 6. The album was recorded while Doughty was still the frontman for the indie rock band Soul Coughing, several days before the release of the Soul Coughing album Irresistible Bliss. Some of the songs on the album had been intended as Soul Coughing songs but were rejected by the other band members. Though Kramer built up some songs in Doughty's absence, with strings and organ, the disc is mostly a stark affair. Doughty's riffs‚Äîoften using a guitar rhythm Doughty calls the \\"gangadank\\"‚Äîpunctuate emotional lyrics on songs such as \\"The Only Answer\\" and \\"The Pink Life\\". It was extremely different from Soul Coughing, and confused by the sonic departure, his label, Warner Bros., rejected it. Though the album was not officially released, versions of the songs, often featuring extra instruments as experimental mixes, ended up on Napster as The Skittish Sessions. When Doughty quit Soul Coughing in 2000 and began touring as a one-man act, he was surprised to find audiences singing along to the songs. He quickly printed up white label versions of the CD and sold them himself at the gigs, selling 20,000, mostly by hand at the front of the stage after the shows. Skittish finally got an official release in 2004 as part of the double album Skittish / Rockity Roll, which also includes Doughty's electro EP Rockity Roll.

It is a public, tuition-free school of choice for students across Oakland County. Students are required to earn both high school and International Baccalaureate (IB) diplomas. In 2014, according to IA, 96% of the graduates earned IB diplomas, compared to the world average of 78%. In 2015, IA ranked No. 8 in the United States and No. 1 in Michigan among public high schools according to Newsweek magazine.

Newsweek's standings were based on the number of IB (International Baccalaureate) or AP (Advanced Placement) tests that the school averaged per graduating senior. The IA's high rankings are due to the full diploma program being required of all students, meaning they each sit for at least 6 IB exams in May of their senior year. Each senior therefore takes at least six IB tests (in addition to the Theory of Knowledge course; Creativity, Action, & Service hours; and Extended Essay requirements), giving the school a high average number of IB tests.

International Academy has an extended school year (205 days) and an extended school day. At the end of the school day at 2:35, many students go home, but many opt to stay to participate in after- school clubs, extra classes (jazz band or full orchestra), or meet with teachers and friends. Students may also participate in activities at their home schools. Students typically only participate in activities at their home high schools that the International Academy does not offer, including sports teams and marching bands. =Internationalism= The IA often classifies itself as an international school, and has a number of international students - about 10 to 15 percent of the student body attended a school overseas before coming to the IA. However, their families must move to one of the sending districts before coming to the IA.International Academy Student Profile The IA does not have boarding students. The IA gives preference to international students (classified as students who have lived in the US for less than one year), as well as students coming from other IB schools (in the United States or elsewhere). The Central and East campuses have particularly large Asian- American populations (mainly from China, Korea, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East). =Athletics= The International Academy has no school- sponsored sports. When the IA was founded in 1996, it agreed not to sponsor sports teams when sending districts voiced concern that they would lose athletes to the IA. Students who wish to participate in sports or marching band must do so through their sending district. About one-third of the students participate in competitive sports or other activities through their home high schools. The IA is allowed to have athletic teams which compete against other schools so long as they are completely student-run, with no funding from the school. In the past, students have started their own competitive teams, including a series of soccer teams, an Ultimate Frisbee club, and a competitive boys' basketball team.International Academy Co-Curricular Clubs list There are also school-funded intramural tournaments, such as a Paintball tournament and the annual IA Olympics, which consists of various competitive events, including athletic events, between the different grades at each campus. Currently, the primary student-led sports are run by The Table Tennis Association, The International Academy Cricket Association, and The Ultimate Frisbee Club.

The Farmington and Oxford districts have recently chosen to leave the IA consortium in order to start their own IB programs.Oxford Schools: Oxford Schools - Candidates for the IB World Schools Farmington Public Schools  International Baccalaureate (IB) Information =West Campus= The West campus was the first satellite campus of the International Academy. A satellite campus had been considered as early as 2003. This school first held classes in August 2006, and its first graduating class was the Class of 2010. The IA West campus is located inside Lakeland High School of Huron Valley Schools. The sending districts include Huron Valley and South Lyon. Their experience is similar to that of students on the Central Campus, with the exception of fewer options in foreign language (Spanish and French only). Like at the Central Campus, students play sports through their sending districts. Huron Valley Schools has opened up 10 spots for students in districts outside the International Academy consortium, including students living outside of Oakland County, for the Class of 2011 onward. Though initially successful, the West campus has seen its number of consortium districts dwindle as a result of district budget cuts and more districts (such as Fenton) opting to start their own IB programs rather than send students to the IA. =East Campus= IA has set up an Eastern campus in Troy, in the former Baker Middle School building. Classes were first held in the 2008-2009 school year. Like the other two campuses, the school began with one freshman class and has added another each year. The first graduating class graduated in 2012. This campus includes students from the Troy School District as well as school-of-choice students from other districts. Troy students through the Class of 2011 attended the Central campus. The Eastern campus's student body is about the same size as the Central campus, and students have access to the same classes as students at the Central campus, save for German, which was not added to the curriculum as the first incoming freshman class did not have a sufficient number of people who were interested in the course. The Eastern campus offers the same fine arts options as the Central campus. The Troy School District has also started Primary Years and Middle Years programs in some of its elementary and middle schools. Currently, the IA East building is undergoing renovations to upgrade office area and science laboratories.

Portes-coch√®res are still found on such structures as major public buildings and hotels, providing covered access for visitors and guests arriving by motorized transport. Portes-coch√®res, which are for vehicle passage, are often confused with porticos, columned porches or entries for human traffic.  History  The porte-coch√®re was a feature of many late 18th- and 19th-century mansions and public buildings. A well-known example is at Buckingham Palace in London. A portico at the White House in Washington, D.C. is often confused with a porte-coch√®re, where a raised vehicle ramp gives an architectural portico the functionality of the latter. Today portes-coch√®res are found at both elaborate private homes and such public buildings as churches, hotels, health facilities, and schools. Portes- coch√®re differ from carports in that the vehicles pass through for passengers to board or exit rather than being parked beneath the covered area.

It owns a fleet that includes dry cargo ships (bulk carriers), container ships, liquefied natural gas carriers, Ro-Ro ships, tankers and container terminals. It is the fourteenth largest container transportation and shipping company in the world.  History  =1919-1944= K-line container ship steaming into San Francisco Bay, June 2007 K Line traces its origin to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd, which itself was born in 1878, when founder and entrepreneur Kawasaki Sh≈çz≈ç (Â∑ùÂ¥é Ê≠£Ëîµ) established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan, which, eighteen years later, in 1896, was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. The shipping activities were developed when Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. (predecessor of Kawasaki Heavy Industries)'s President Kojiro Matsukata, decided to develop shipping services so as to provide business to Kawasaki Dockyard and to serve Japan's national industrial and trade interests. To do so, he placed Kawasaki Kisen, Kawasaki Zosen and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. In 1921, the joint name 'K Line' was adopted, based on the initial of the three companies. K Line founder, Kojiro Matsukata, was also known as an art collector. The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo's Ueno Park was established around the core of Matsukata's private collection. In addition, the Tokyo National Museum houses his extensive collection of Ukiyo-eprints. In 1926, according to Lloyds, the newly established \\"K\\" Line reached the rank of 13th in the world, behind compatriots NYK (9th) but ahead of O.S.K. (14th). By the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived. Prior to World War II, the holding company Kawasaki Heavy Industries was part of the Kobe Kawasaki zaibatsu, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the war, KHI became part of the DKB Group (keiretsu). =1945-1961= During that vital recovery period, \\"K\\" Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy of the company. =1962-1967= After the merger with Iino Kisen, \\"K\\" Line was newly capitalized at ¬•9 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by \\"K\\" Line. The merger gave \\"K\\" Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world's largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization. =1971= K Line opens International Transportation Service, a container terminal company in the Port of Long Beach. The Car Carrier transport division was inaugurated with the launch of the new Roll-on/roll-off vessel Toyota Maru No. 10. K-Line would thereafter enlarge the fleet up to 70 Car carriers vessels. All owned RORO vessels started to include in the first part of their names the word ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù (opposite to its container fleet‚Äôs vessels that include the word ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù into their names), to symbolize a link in between Japan and the rest of the world served by sea. =2003= KESS - K Line Europe Short Sea is inaugurated in July 2003 in Germany, as a dedicated feeder operator in Europe specialized in brand new cars shipping in between European, Scandinavian, Baltic and Mediterranean ports.

ONE would merge all container shipping services of the three companies, as well as their port terminal operating subsidiaries in various countries, except in Japan, while keeping their other shipping services separate. ONE began operations on April 1, 2018. Its holding company office is based in Tokyo, with global headquarters in Singapore and regional headquarters in: London, United Kingdom; Richmond, Virginia; and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. =2018= On 23 July, KESS car carrier Makassar Highway ran hard aground at full speed in the Tjust archipelago near Loftahammar, Sweden, causing an oil spill. By his own account, the captain had ordered a course close to land, far from established shipping lanes, in order to gain mobile phone reception. The ship's satellite communication system and black box were inoperable when departing Cuxhaven for S√∂dert√§lje, and alarm systems had been disabled. The Swedish Coast Guard recovered approximately of oil by 30 July, but thousands of litres of oil nevertheless washed up on the coast. An estimated of oil were spilled. The ship was towed to Oskarshamn, where its cargo of 1,325 vehicles were offloaded. The chief mate was taken into custody and accepted a fine for intoxication and recklessness in maritime traffic. His blood alcohol content by mass at the time of the accident was estimated at 1.15 permille, based on samples taken after the accident. The oil spill is also being investigated as an environmental crime.

The book was published in 1995, four years after the release of the last Star Trek motion picture starring the entire original cast, and covers the majority of Nimoy's time with Star Trek in general and Mr. Spock in particular. The book's title was a reference to the first volume of his autobiography, I Am Not Spock, which had been published in 1975. At that time Nimoy had sought to distance his own personality from that of the character of Spock, although he nonetheless remained proud of his time on the show. Negative fan reaction to the title gave Nimoy the idea for the title of the second volume. Synopsis In his second autobiography, Nimoy explains that the title of the first book had been his idea, over the objections of his publishers. He had not anticipated the problem of people reading the title without reading the book. In reality, his feelings toward Spock had not changed at all in the intervening years. On the contrary, Nimoy explains in this book that Spock has always been a part of him. This duality is explored and taken to extremes throughout the book. Indeed, the book's foreword is written by Mr. Spock himself, in the form of a letter the Vulcan writes to Leonard Nimoy, to express confusion over the highly illogical title. Throughout the book, Nimoy frequently has conversations with his other half, as he explores the choices and decisions he has made throughout his life, and how those choices have been affected by a certain calm logical voice in the back of his mind. While the focus of the book is on Nimoy's Star Trek career, he also takes time to explore his other works, including directing and theatre acting. Memorable stories include his being forced to tell an actress she needed to redo a highly emotional scene because of a crew member's mistake, and how directing Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home led to Hollywood giving him a shot at directing Three Men and a Baby (1987), which went on to be the highest-grossing film in the United States of that year.Box Office Mojo: 1987 Yearly Box Office Results He also mentions his work producing and directing the UPN television series Deadly Games. On the topic of Spock's future, Nimoy notes that the Star Trek franchise shows no sign of dying, and that as far as he is concerned, Spock is still alive and well working on Romulus (as seen in the two-part episode \\"Unification\\" of Star Trek: The Next Generation). Nimoy played Spock again (alongside a younger Spock played by Zachary Quinto) in the 2009 film Star Trek and the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness, both directed by J. J. Abrams.

The ship's logs reveal that the Exeters crew has died from an infectious disease brought from the planet, and that Enterprises landing party must beam down to the planet if they are to survive. Kirk's party beams to the last coordinates in the Exeters computer and discovers Exeter Captain Ron Tracey (Morgan Woodward) in what resembles a Tibetan village. Tracey explains that he was stranded when the disease ravaged his ship, and has discovered that remaining on the planet confers immunity. Tracey then reveals that the villagers, known as \\"Kohms\\", are at war with savages called \\"Yangs\\". After a Yang attack, Spock investigates the field of battle and finds evidence that Tracey has been helping the Kohms in violation of the Prime Directive. Kirk tries to contact the Enterprise, but is prevented by Tracey. To justify his actions, Tracey reveals that not only have the natives become immune to the mysterious disease, but they have developed lifespans of over 1000 years. Tracey orders McCoy to investigate the secrets of their longevity and has Kirk and Spock locked up in a crude jail with two Yang prisoners, one male and one female. Kirk has the Yang male loosen the bars of the cell window, but the Yang knocks Kirk out and escapes with the woman. When Kirk recovers, he and Spock make their own escape. Reunited with McCoy, Spock modifies some medical equipment into a makeshift communicator, which is destroyed by Tracey. McCoy and Kirk try to explain that the natives' longevity has nothing to do with their immunity to the disease, but Tracey's mind snaps, and he attempts to force Kirk to order more weapons to be sent down from Enterprise. During a struggle between the two, Yang warriors arrive and carry everyone back to their village. Their leader is Kirk's cellmate, known as Cloud William. During a ceremony to celebrate the Yang victory, Kirk and Spock, discussing the Yang culture, connect the names Yang and Kohm with \\"Yankee\\" and \\"Communist\\". Spock surmises that the history of Omega IV closely paralleled that of Earth, until the former was devastated by a biological war which Earth had avoided. This hypothesis is confirmed when William produces a very old American Flag, along with ancient documents from which he recites the Pledge of Allegiance in a garbled accent. The Yangs are shocked when Kirk completes the Pledge. Tracey, in an attempt to save his own life, denounces Kirk and Spock, claiming that they were cast out of Heaven, and points to Spock's similar appearance to the devil as proof. William asks Kirk to prove himself by completing the \\"sacred words\\" from another document. Because of the accent, Kirk doesn't understand the words and instead suggests trial by combat between himself and Tracey. As they fight, Spock sends a mental suggestion to William's female companion to activate the communicator lying near her. Sulu and a security detail beam down to investigate, and Tracey is taken into custody. Cloud William now kneels before Kirk as if he were a deity, but Kirk orders him to stand. The second document proves to be a version of the American Constitution. Kirk rebukes the Yangs for forgetting its meaning, and declares that the words were meant not just for the Yangs, but \\"must apply to everyone or they mean nothing.\\" William does not fully understand, but swears to Kirk that the words will be obeyed. Analysis According to author Daniel Leonard Bernardi in his book, Star Trek and History: Race-ing Toward a White Future: \\"Like the Federation, the Comms [sic] have full command of the English language (although they speak with a homogenized 'Asian' accent). The beginning of the episode thus shows that those with white skin can be uncivilized savages and those with yellow skin can be civilized and rational [...] This would be counter to the hegemonic representation of Asians in the United States media; that diverse collective of peoples are consistently constructed in film and television as a menacing 'yellow horde.'\\" Bernardi goes on to say: Allan W. Austin, Professor of History at Misericordia University, writes that this episode Like Bernardi, Austin discusses racial stereotypes in the episode; citing Bernardi, he argues that, instead of considering \\"the Yangs as noble savages, the Yangs can now be seen as an example of the result of mindless nationalism run amok, albeit still salvageable in Roddenberry's ever-optimistic view of the future.\\"Austin, Allan W. \\"The Limits of Star Trek's Final Frontier: \\"The Omega Glory\\" and 1960s American Liberalism,\\" in Space and Time: Essays on Visions of History in Science Fiction and Fantasy Television. David C. Wright, Jr., and Allan W. Austin, editors. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2010, p. 74. He adds, \\"Many of the qualities ascribed to the Yangs mirrored terms used to describe the 'yellow peril' at an earlier time in U.S. history. For example, Tracy, after noting directly that the Yangs are white, describes them as vicious and deceptive enemies who cannot communicate intelligently.\\" In \\"The Omega Glory\\", a 2006 essay reminiscing on stories about the future, Michael Chabon says, \\"Eed plebnista, intoned the devolved Yankees, in the Star Trek episode 'The Omega Glory', who had somehow managed to hold on to and venerate as sacred gobbledygook the Preamble to the Constitution, norkon forden perfectunun. All they needed was a Captain Kirk to come and add a little interpretive water to the freeze-dried document, and the American way of life would flourish again.\\" Production This story was originally offered by Roddenberry as an option for the second pilot titled \\"The Omega Story\\". The original script, while not significantly different in tone and message, did have some significant differences in characterization and background information. As the character of Dr. Leonard McCoy had not been created yet, the ship's surgeon is named Milton Perry, and in one version of the script it is Perry who attempts to use a \\"Medi-Scanner\\" to signal the Enterprise for rescue, only to be killed when Captain Tracey destroys the scanner with his phaser. Dr. Carter of the Exeter was also to be shown dissolving onscreen. William Ware Theiss (costume designer) made a production error and mistakenly gave the crew of the USS Exeter a unique uniform insignia, different from the iconic delta. The mistake was caught before the episode aired, but it was too late to correct it. A memo was immediately sent out stating that Gene Roddenberry was consulted and every starship crew uniform should have the delta insignia, as is seen being worn by the Enterprise crew.  Reception  In 2015, Entertainment Weekly highlighted the scene where Kirk reads the United States Constitution, as one of the most important moments in that character's life. WhatCulture ranked this episode the 15th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise. In 2016, SyFy included this episode in a group of Star Trek franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked but \\"deserved a second chance\\". In 2017, this episode was rated the 8th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise up to that time, by ScreenRant. In 2018, CBR included this episode on a ranking of episodes they stated were \\"So Bad They Must Be Seen\\". CBS News listed \\"The Omega Glory\\" as one of the worst episodes of the original series.

It is widely considered one of Australia's \\"first growth\\" and its most collectable wine. The term \\"Hermitage\\", the name of a French wine appellation, was commonly used in Australia as another synonym for Shiraz or Syrah. Penfolds is owned by Treasury Wine Estates. 1950s-1960s The first vintage of Penfolds Grange was made on an experimental basis in 1951 by Penfolds winemaker Max Schubert and were largely given away at the time. Having toured Europe in 1950, Schubert implemented wine-making techniques observed in Bordeaux upon his return, aiming to create a red wine able to rival the finest Bordeaux wines both in terms of quality and ageing potential.winepros.com.au. Individual bottles of the 1951 vintage are still held by collectors; one sold at auction in 2004 for just over $50,000 AUD. The first vintage to be commercially released was the 1952. Penfolds Grange was styled as a powerful still wine in an age when fortified wines were in fashion. Negative reviews by wine critics and poor commercial prospects for the wine led Penfolds management in 1957 to forbid Schubert from producing Penfolds Grange, but Schubert persisted in secret through 1959. As the initial vintages aged, however, their true value came to be appreciated, and in 1960 the management instructed Schubert to restart production, oblivious to the fact that Schubert had never stopped production and had not missed a vintage. The great 1955 vintage was submitted to competitions beginning in 1962, and over the years has won more than 50 gold medals. The vintage of 1971 won first prize in Shiraz at the Wine Olympics in Paris. The 1990 vintage was named 'Wine of the Year' by the Wine Spectator magazine in 1995, which later rated the 1998 vintage 99 points out of a possible 100. Penfolds Grange also carries a \\"Bin\\" designation, referring to its storage location in Penfolds cellars while aging. 1951 was Bin 1, 1952 was Bin 4, and later vintages carried various designations. By 1964 the designation was standardised as \\"Bin 95\\". 1970s-1980s The 1971 vintage received the top score against other renowned international wines of the 1970s in a blind tasting with an international panel of judges in 2015. Originally released for around AUD $10 in 1976 the 1971 sells at auction between AUD $700 and AUD $1,100. Schubert retired in 1975, passing the custodianship of Grange to Don Ditter. Ditter had been working at Penfolds since 1950 after graduating from Roseworthy Agricultural College. Ditter retired as Penfolds' Chief Winemaker in 1986. During his time as Chief Winemaker several highly regarded Grange vintages were released, including 1976 and 1986. 1976 was awarded 100 points by American critic Robert Parker Jr. 1986, Ditter's last vintage, has been labeled as the 'defining vintage of the 1980s' as well as an 'important and very successful vintage'. John Duval assumed the mantle of Penfolds Chief Winemaker from Ditter in 1986 until resigning in 2002. He was named International Winemaker of the Year in 1989 by the UK's International Wine & Spirit Competition. 1990s The 1990 vintage of Grange attracted a great amount of interest after Wine Spectator Magazine named it their 'Wine of the Year' in 1995. The name \\"Hermitage\\" was dropped from the label with the 1990 vintage, following objections by the European Union authorities to the use of a French place-name; no third-country wine entering EU may carry a geographical name recognized by European wine officials.winepros.com.au. In 1991 and in 2000, Duval was named Red Winemaker of the Year at the International Wine Challenge in London. Each of these awards were conferred during Duval's period as custodian of Grange. Duval also oversaw the 'White Grange' project at Penfolds. This project was intended to produce a white wine that would equal the quality and reputation of Grange. The resultant wine, Penfolds Yattarna, was first released with the 1995 vintage. 2000s In 2002, Peter Gago assumed custodianship of Penfolds Grange as the replacement Chief Winemaker for the outgoing John Duval. During the ensuing years Gago has overseen a number of highly acclaimed Grange vintages, including 2008. The 2008 vintage of Grange was awarded 'perfect' 100 point ratings from two influential American wine reviewers, \\"Wine Spectator\\". and \\"Wine Advocate\\". With these accolades this vintage became the first 'New World' wine to receive 100 points from both reviewers. Collectability By the end of the 1980s the wine came to be regarded as a collectors' item. The first vintage, 1951, is now considered highly collectable with one sold at auction in 2004 for just over $50,000 AUD. Collections of Grange have been sold at auction in Australia for AUD $294,000. Listed in the 4th edition of Langton‚Äôs Classification of Australian Wine at the \\"Exceptional\\" level,Langton‚Äôs Classification of Australian WineLangton's Classification of Australian Wine IV, Jancis Robinson Grange has been in the top Langton classification since 1991. Penfolds Grange is the only wine to be heritage listed by the South Australian National Trust. Production style Unlike most expensive cult wines from the Old World which are from single vineyards or even small plots (called blocks) within vineyards, Grange is made from grapes harvested over a wide area. This means that the precise composition of the wine changes from year to year; it is the expertise of the winemakers which purchasers value, rather than the qualities of the specific places where the grapes are grown, or the particular vines. The quantity of Penfolds Grange produced varies from year to year, with 1,800 bottles of the original 1951 vintage produced. Gago states that 7000 to 9000 cases are made each vintage as of 2013. Despite the vagaries of grape sourcing and vintage variation due to growing conditions, some believe that there is a consistent and recognisable \\"Penfolds Grange\\" style. Ownership In the 1980s, Tooth & Co. (who were then part of the Adelaide Steamship Group) purchased a number of wineries, including Penfolds. AdSteam sold its wineries to SA Brewing Holdings in 1990, who then amalgamated all of its wine holdings into \\"The Penfolds Wines Group\\". In 1994 SA Brewing Holdings split into three companies: brewing into SA Brewing Company, wine in Southcorp Wines, and other activities into Southcorp. Upon its acquisition of Southcorp Wines in May 2005, ownership of the Penfolds brand, along with its museum collection of Penfolds Grange, passed to the Foster's Group. In May 2011 Penfolds, along with the rest of Foster's wine brands, were spun off into Treasury Wine Estates, a separate company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Demerger, www.fostersgroup.com See also *Globalization of wine *South Australian food and drink References =Notes= =Bibliography=  External links *Penfolds official site * Max Schubert's, The Story of Grange Link1 Link 2 Category:Australian wine Category:Foster's Group Category:Treasury Wine Estates ","title":"Penfolds Grange"},{"id":"1132444","text":"Vitral was a magazine founded in Pinar del R√≠o Province of Cuba.

He has been head of the Imperial House of Ethiopia since 17 February 1997 as recognized by the Crown Council of Ethiopia. He was designated as \\"acting crown prince\\" and heir presumptive in 1974 by the Emperor Haile Selassie I close to the end of his reign. Biography Zera Yacob attended Eton College and graduated from Exeter College, Oxford and Sandhurst. He was named Acting Crown Prince and heir presumptive to the Imperial throne of Ethiopia in 1974 by his grandfather, Emperor Haile Selassie, following his father's stroke a year earlier. After the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy, Zera Yacob completed his studies at Oxford in the 1970s and worked briefly as a banker in the United States. He then moved to London and was married to Princess Nunu (n√©e Getaneh), and subsequently divorced. The marriage produced a daughter, Princess Lideta. In 1992 he accompanied his father Amha Selassie to Virginia, United States, where his father had a medical check-up. However, his father suffered a stroke and Zera Yacob stayed for two years. He then applied for a visa following his father's death in 1997 this was used as the reason to deny it him. He had returned to London, England, where he had settled in a modest dwelling on the Isle of Dogs. He had previously been named heir apparent by his father, who assumed the title of Emperor-in-Exile at that time in April 1989 in London. Crown Prince Zera Yacob is regarded as head of the Imperial Family of Ethiopia and currently lives in Addis Ababa.

The attraction of the tactic is that it prevents employers from replacing them with strikebreakers or removing equipment to transfer production to other locations. Neal Ascherson has commented that an additional attraction is that it emphasizes the role of workers in providing for the people and allows workers to in effect hold valuable machinery hostage as a bargaining chip. Workers have used the technique since the beginning of the 20th century in countries such as United States, Italy, Poland, Croatia, and France. The United Auto Workers staged successful sit-down strikes in the 1930s, most famously in the Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936‚Äì1937. In Flint, Michigan, strikers occupied several General Motors plants for more than forty days, and repelled the efforts of the police and National Guard to retake them. A wave of sit-down strikes followed but diminished by the end of the decade as the courts and the National Labor Relations Board held that sit-down strikes were illegal and sit-down strikers could be fired (see the 1939 Supreme Court ruling in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.). While some sit-down strikes still occur in the United States, they tend to be spontaneous and short-lived. French workers engaged in a number of factory occupations in the wake of the French student revolt in May 1968. At one point more than twenty-five percent of French workers were on strike, many of them occupying their factories. In 1973, the workers at the Triumph Motorcycles factory at Meriden, West Midlands, locked the new owners, NVT, out following the announcement of their plan to close Meriden. The sit-in lasted over a year until the British government intervened, the result of which was the formation of the Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative which produced Triumphs until their closure in 1983. The sit-down strike was the inspiration for the sit-in, where an organized group of protesters would occupy an area in which they are not wanted by sitting and refuse to leave until their demands are met.

A boat or ship engaged in the tramp trade is one which does not have a fixed schedule or published ports of call. As opposed to freight liners, tramp ships trade on the spot market with no fixed schedule or itinerary/ports-of-call(s). A steamship engaged in the tramp trade is sometimes called a tramp steamer; the similar terms tramp freighter and tramper are also used. Chartering is done chiefly on London, New York, and Singapore shipbroking exchanges. The Baltic Exchange serves as a type of stock market index for the trade. The term tramper is derived from the British meaning of \\"tramp\\" as itinerant beggar or vagrant; in this context it is first documented in the 1880s, along with \\"ocean tramp\\" (at the time many sailing vessels engaged in irregular trade as well). History The tramp trade first took off in Britain around the mid-19th century. The dependability and timeliness of steam ships was found to be more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships' boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coalBuckley, J. (2008.) The Business of Shipping. Centreville, MD: Cornell Maritime Press. to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years tramp ships became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities to the rest of the world. The size of tramp ships remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship; a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of tramp ships exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During this time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. The bulk carrier was designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave it more flexibility and could service more ports than some of its ancestors, which only carried a single commodity. The SS Felixstowe, which was built in 1918, served as a tramp steamer until the 1940s. Today the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined like the oil, bulk, ore carriers to accommodate many different markets depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. Tramp ships often carry with them their own gear (booms, cranes, derricks) in case the next port lacks the proper equipment for loading or discharging cargo.Schiels, K. (1994) Ship Agency: A guide to tramp ship agency. Surrey, UK. Fair Play Publications. Tramp charters The tramp ship is a contract carrier. Unlike a liner, often called a common carrier, which has a fixed schedule and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand. To generate business, a contract to lease the vessel known as a charterparty is drawn up between the ship owner and the charterer. There are three types of charters, voyage, time and demise. = Voyage charter = Voyage charter: The voyage charter is the most common charter in tramp shipping. The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a seaworthy ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. This type of charter is the most lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a voyage charter a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of voyage charter ‚Äì net form and gross form. Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the voyage charter if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days. = Time charter = Time charter: In a time charter the owner provides a vessel that is fully manned and equipped. The owner provides the crew, but the crew takes orders from the charterer. The owner is also responsible for insuring the vessel, repairs the vessel may need, engine parts and food for the ship's personnel. The charterer is responsible for everything else. The main advantage of the time charter is that it diverts the costs of running a ship to the charterer. = Demise charter = Demise charter: The demise charter is the least used in the tramp trade because it heavily favors the owner. The ship owner only provides a ship devoid of any crew, stores, or fuel. It is the Charterer's responsibility to provide everything the ship will need. The ship owner must provide a seaworthy vessel, but once the charterer accepts the vessel, the responsibility of seaworthiness is the charterer's. The charterer crews the vessel, but the owner can make recommendations. There are no standardized forms in a demise charter, contracts can vary greatly, and are written up to meet the needs of the charterer. Brokerage Tramp ship owners and tramp ship charterers rely on brokers to find cargoes for their ships to carry. A broker understands international trade conditions, the movements of goods, market prices and the availability of the owner's ships. The Baltic Exchange, in London, is the physical headquarters for tramp ship brokerage. The Baltic Exchange works like an organised market and provides a meeting place for ship owners, brokers and charterers. It also provides easy access to information on market fluctuations and commodity prices to all the parties involved. Brokers can use it to quickly match a cargo to a ship or ship to a cargo depending on whom they are working for. A committee of owners, brokers and charterers are elected to manage the exchange to ensure everyone's interests are represented. With the speed of today's communications the floor of the Baltic Exchange is not nearly as populated as it once was, but the information and networking the exchange provides is still an asset to the tramp trade. 2000s Due to the explosion of liner services, and in large part, due to containerisation since the 1960s, the tramp trade has decreased, but is by no means ended. A contemporary trend in the shipping business has resulted in renewed interest in tramp shipping.Plomaritou, E. (2008). A proposed application of the marketing mix concept to tramp & liner shipping companies. Journal of Contemporary Management Issues, 13(1) 59‚Äì71. To increase profits, liner companies are looking at investing into tramp ships to create a buffer when the market is down. For example, Mitsui OSK Lines possesses a large fleet with tramp ships and liners. With both types of shipping covered they are able to service a world economy even in a down market. The advantage of tramp ships is they are relied upon at a moment's notice to service any type of market. Even in a down economy there will be a market for some type of commodity somewhere and the company with the ships able to exploit that market will do better than the company relying on liner services alone. Companies * United Maritime Group * Seabulk * D/S Norden * TORM In fiction Tramp steamers and freighters are associated with off-the-beaten track, romanticized adventure and intrigue in pulp stories, children's books, novels, films, and other fictional works. When characters such as spies or resistance fighters are on the run, or lovers are fleeing from an affair gone wrong, tramp steamers are used to slip in or out of a country. The crew of a tramp steamer is often a picaresque mix of societal outcasts and rogues with colourful (or even illegal-activity-filled) pasts who cannot or who do not want to work elsewhere. Steamers are often depicted as operating in a grey area of legality, both in terms of their lax observance of steamship safety regulations and their plying of black market trades and smuggling of goods and passengers. Fiction writers depicted tramp steamers as a way that penniless adventurers can explore exotic ports by being taken on as a crew member. =Examples= * In the film The Lost Continent (1968), a dilapidated tramp steamer Corita is smuggling a dangerous explosive cargo. The Captain ignores a customs launch wanting to inspect his ship as he is smuggling white phosphorus. Some passengers are trying to escape their past indiscretions or eluding capture (one with stolen bearer bonds). * In the film The Long Voyage Home (1940), a British tramp steamer SS Glencairn goes from the West Indies to Baltimore and then finally to England. The crew is a motley, fun-loving, hard- drinking lot who are smuggling rum. The crew thinks one aloof crew member might be a German spy because he is so secretive and he has a locked box under his bed. * In the film The African Queen (1951), a tramp steamer, the African Queen, is converted into a torpedo boat to sink a German gunboat. * In the 1937 musical comedy film Something to Sing About, hoofer Terry Rooney (James Cagney) takes his bride, singer Rita Wyatt (Evelyn Daw) on a tramp steamer for their honeymoon. They are the only passengers. Rooney is turning his back on Hollywood, disgusted by his experience working on one picture. The film is a hit, but no one can find him. When the ship returns at last to San Francisco, he discovers that he is Hollywood's newest star. There is a long scene aboard ship where the crew joins in a talent show. * Much of the action in Across the Pacific, a 1942 spy film set in the three weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, takes place aboard the Genoa Maru, a fictional Japanese cargo ship. The passengers include: former Captain Rick Leland (Humphrey Bogart), a disgraced United States Army Coast Artillery Corps, working as a secret U.S. agent; Canadian Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor) who claims to be from Medicine Hat; and Dr. Lorenz (Sydney Greenstreet) a great admirer of the Japanese. Characters spar over the dinner table and lurk in corridors. *In Lurulu, a 2004 sci-fi adventure, a crew of pilgrims and adventure seekers voyage to exotic planets on a tramp space freighter.

John Bastwick (1593‚Äì1654) was an English Puritan physician and controversial writer. He was born at Writtle, Essex. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 19 May 1614, but remained there only a very short time, and left the university without a degree. He travelled and served for a time as a soldier, probably in the Dutch army. He then studied medicine abroad, and took the degree of M.D. at Padua. Back in England in 1623, he settled at Colchester, where he practised as a physician.:s:Bastwick, John (DNB00) He was a Latin stylist, and began a career as controversial with Latin works. In 1634 he published in the Netherlands two anti-Catholic Latin treatises: Elenchus Religionis Papisticae, an answer to a Catholic called Richard Short; and Flagellum Pontificis, an argument in favour of Presbyterianism. The latter came under the notice of William Laud. He had Bastwick brought before the Court of High Commission, where he was convicted of a \\"scandalous libel\\", was condemned to pay a fine of ¬£1,000 and costs, and was imprisoned in the Gatehouse Prison until he should recant. In 1636 Bastwick published Œ†œÅŒ¨ŒæŒµŒπœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄœâŒΩ, sive Apologeticus ad Praesules Anglicanos, written in the Gatehouse against the high commission court. In 1637 he produced in English the four parts of his Letanie of Dr. John Bastwicke, in which bishops were denounced as the enemies of God and the tail of The Beast. For this publication he was summoned before the Star Chamber. The request for a work in English came from the publisher John Wharton. The Letanie was printed by a Dutch press for John Lilburne, who had been brought to the Gatehouse in 1636 by the clothier Thomas Hewson and minister Edmund Rosier. Lilburne was just finishing an apprenticeship with Hewson, and smuggled the text abroad, but was betrayed by his assistant in importing the Letanie, John Chilliburne who worked for Wharton. At the time Bastwick was comfortable enough in prison, living with his wife and family and complaining that he ate roast meat only once a week.Pauline Gregg, Free-born John: The Biography of John Lilburne (1961), pp. 47-50. Similar proceedings were taken against William Prynne for his Histrio-Mastix, and Henry Burton for \\"seditious\\" sermons. Bastwick's voluminous defence, which was also published, aggravated his case. He was found guilty, and along with the other sentenced to lose his ears in the pillory, to pay a fine of ¬£5,000, and to be imprisoned for life. Bastwick was afterwards moved to Star Castle, Isles of Scilly. From there in November 1640 he was released by order of the Long Parliament, and in December entered London in triumph. Reparation to the amount of the fines imposed was ordered to be made to him (2 March 1641). In 1642, as the First English Civil War broke out, Bastwick was a captain of the Leicester trained bands, and on 22 July he was taken prisoner by the royalists at Leicester, and sent prisoner to York. Soon at liberty again, he published in 1643 a Declaration demonstrating ... that all malignants, whether they be prelates, &c.;, are enemies to God and the church. The Parliamentary success in the war brought by 1645 a new relationship into being between the Presbyterians and other Protestant groups, classified as Independents, such as the emerging Quakers and Congregationalists. Bastwick with Prynne was a hard-liner on the Presbyterian side; Burton wanted a less harsh approach, and by then Lilburne was a very popular Independent, beginning to found the Levellers.Gregg, p. 112, p. 125. Bastwick with Colonel Edward King arranged for Lilburne to be arrested on 19 July 1645 for words he had said against the Speaker of the House of Commons; he was in custody until October.Gregg, pp. 120-3. In 1648 Bastwick published two bitter tracts against the Independents, and in defence of himself against Lilburne. Bastwick died in 1654. Richard Smith, in his 'Obituary,' gives 6 October 1654 as the date of his burial.

It is the fifth-largest sogo shosha and has leading market shares in cereal and paper pulp trading as well as a strong electrical and industrial plant business. Marubeni is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu. History Marubeni was established in 1918 as Itochu Shoten, Ltd. in a spin-off of certain sales divisions of C. Itoh & Co. (Itochu) into a separate entity. Itochu Shoten merged with Itoh Chobei Shoten in 1921 to form Marubeni Shoten, Ltd. under the leadership of Chobei Itoh IX. Marubeni started out as a textile trading firm and expanded to trade in other consumer and industrial goods during the 1920s. Marubeni was re-combined with Itochu during World War II to form Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd. (1941‚Äì44) and Daiken Company, Ltd. (1944‚Äì48). This conglomerate was dismantled in the wake of the war and Marubeni again emerged as a separate trading company in 1949. Post-war Marubeni was predominantly a textile trading firm at its outset, but diversified into machinery, metals and chemicals, with textiles barely forming a majority of its business by the end of the decade. Marubeni merged with Takashimaya-Iida, a trading company that owned the Takashimaya department store chain, in 1955, changing its name to Marubeni-Iida from 1955 to 1972. The merger was orchestrated by Fuji Bank in order to create a stronger trading company partner for the bank's corporate customers. Marubeni and Fuji Bank developed a network of corporate clients which was formalized as the Fuyo Group keiretsu in the 1960s, paralleling the development of the DKB Group and Sanwa Group. The Fuyo Group included Hitachi, Nissan, Canon, Showa Denko, Kubota and Nippon Steel. Marubeni was rocked by a series of scandals in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s Marubeni was accused of hoarding rice on the black market for profiteering purposes. In 1976, numerous Marubeni and All Nippon Airways executives were arrested in connection with the bribery of Japanese government officials to support the sales of Lockheed aircraft in Japan; the scandal also led to several suicides and the arrest of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In 1986, Marubeni was found to have bribed Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos and several of his friends and associates in connection with Japanese ODA work in the Philippines. Marubeni, like other sogo shosha, was hit hard by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s and recorded its first annual net loss in 1998. The company again booked massive losses as part of a restructuring in 2001, with its stock price plummeting to 58 yen per share in December 2001. Marubeni acquired a large minority stake in the Daiei supermarket chain in 2006, which it sold to √Üon Group in 2013. In January 2012, Marubeni Corporation agreed to pay a US$54.6 million criminal penalty to settle multiple US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges relating to its work as an agent for the TSKJ joint venture. The TSKJ joint venture comprising Technip, Snamprogetti Netherlands, Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) and JGC Corporation hired Marubeni to bribe lower-level Nigerian government officials to help it obtain and retain contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities on Bonny Island in Nigeria. TSKJ paid Marubeni US$51 million which was intended, in part, to be used to bribe Nigerian government officials. Two years later, and just months after its final settlement in the Nigerian case, Marubeni was charged under the FCPA for bribing Indonesian officials in order to secure a $118 million power project contract for a joint venture between Marubeni and Alstom; it agreed to pay an $88 million fine in connection with this case. The Tokyo Stock Exchange recognized Marubeni as the best Japanese company at increasing enterprise value in 2013, citing management's efforts to maximize return on equity. In September 2018, The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Marubeni Corporation and Russia's AEON Corporation agreed to develop an industrial facility in Volgograd. The total investment is estimated at over $800 million with construction due to start in 2020. In September 2018, Marubeni announced to shift from coal to renewable energy resources. Berkshire Hathaway acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020.

Tuuru village In some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives to stay with. Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel, or inn is the lack of a full-time staff. Bed and breakfasts and guest houses in England are family owned and the family live on the premises though family members are not normally available during the evening. However most family members work a 10- to 12-hour day from 6am as they may employ part-time service staff. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff presence. Because of limited staff presence, check in at a guest house is often by appointment. An inn also usually has a restaurant attached.

Likewise, early tabletop role-playing games are descended from skirmish wargames like Chainmail, which were primarily concerned with combat. Game design This subgenre of role-playing video games principally refers to games which incorporate elements from strategy video games as an alternative to traditional role-playing game (RPG) systems. Like standard RPGs, the player typically controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies. And like other RPGs, death is usually temporary. But this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. Unlike traditional RPGs which are traditionally single-player, some tactical RPGs feature multiplayer play, such as Final Fantasy Tactics . A distinct difference between tactical RPGs and traditional RPGs is the lack of exploration; for instance, Final Fantasy Tactics does away with the third- person exploration of towns and dungeons that is typical in a Final Fantasy game. In Final Fantasy Tactics, instead of exploration, there is an emphasis on battle strategy. Players are able to build and train characters to use in battle, utilizing different classes, including warriors and magic users, depending on the game. Characters normally gain experience points from battle and grow stronger, and are awarded secondary experience points which can be used to advance in specific character classes. Battles have specific winning conditions, such as defeating all enemies or surviving a certain number of turns, that the player must accomplish before the next map will become available. In between battles, players can access their characters to equip them, change classes, train them, depending on the game. History A number of early role-playing video games used a tactical form of combat, such as Tunnels of Doom (1982) and Ultima III: Exodus (1983), as well as The Dragon and Princess (1982) and Bokosuka Wars (1983), which introduced party-based, tiled combat to America and Japan, respectively. Further, tactical RPGs are descendants of tabletop role-playing games and wargames, such as Dungeons & Dragons and Chainmail, which were mainly tactical in their original form. Nevertheless, much of the development of tactical RPGs has diverged on each side of the Pacific, and the term \\"tactical RPG\\" is sometimes reserved only for those titles that were created in Japan. =8-bit origins in the East (1982‚Äì1990)= Tile-based, overhead gameplay of Langrisser II. Buildings, scenery and opposing units can form bottlenecks or \\"choke points\\" that players are forced to consider. One of the earliest Japanese RPGs, Koei's The Dragon and Princess, released NEC's PC-8001 home computer platform in 1982. (Translation) This game can also be considered a precursor to the tactical RPG genre. It used a combat system where, following a random encounter, the game transitioned to a separate, graphical, overhead battle screen, and tactical turn-based combat ensued. That same year, in 1982, Tunnels of Doom used a similar combat system; as did Ultima III: Exodus released in 1983. During the 8-bit era, Bokosuka Wars, a computer game developed by Koji Sumii for the Sharp X1 in 1983Bokosuka Wars, GameSpot and ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by ASCII in 1985, was responsible for laying the foundations for the tactical RPG genre, or \\"simulation RPG\\" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of role-playing and strategy game elements. The game revolves around a king who must recruit soldiers and lead his army against overwhelming enemy forces, while each unit gains experience and levels up along the way. It is also considered to be an early prototype real-time strategy game. Another notable early example of the genre was Kure Software Koubou's 1988 PC-8801 strategy RPG, Silver Ghost, which was cited by Camelot Software Planning's Hiroyuki Takahashi as inspiration for the Shining series of tactical RPGs. According to Takahashi, Silver Ghost was \\"a simulation action type of game where you had to direct, oversee and command multiple characters.\\"Behind The Scenes ‚Äì Shining Force, GamesTM Unlike later tactical RPGs, however, Silver Ghost was not turn-based, but instead used real-time strategy and action role-playing game elements. It also featured a point-and- click interface, to control the characters using a cursor. A similar game released by Kure Software Koubo that same year was First Queen, a unique hybrid between a real-time strategy, action RPG, and strategy RPG. Like an RPG, the player can explore the world, purchase items, and level up, and like a strategy video game, it focuses on recruiting soldiers and fighting against large armies rather than small parties. The game's \\"Gochyakyara\\" (\\"Multiple Characters\\") system let the player control one character at a time while the others are controlled by computer AI that follow the leader, and where battles are large-scale with characters sometimes filling an entire screen. (Translation) Master of Monsters, developed by SystemSoft and released in 1989 for the MSX2, added fantasy characters and magic attacks to the gameplay of the wartime combat Daisenryaku series, which had instead opted for tanks, planes, and other vehicles of real-world modern combat. Master of Monsters also added experience bars for the character units, a concept which would be adapted and popularized by later console-based series like Fire Emblem. Unlike many other early titles in the genre, Master of Monsters made its way to the west via a port to the Sega Genesis in 1991, albeit only in North America. However, the genre did not become prolific until Nintendo published the game that set the template for tactical wargame RPGs, Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ry≈´ to Hikari no Tsurugi. Developed by Intelligent Systems and released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom in 1990, Fire Emblem would become an archetype for the whole genre, establishing gameplay elements that are still used in tactical RPGs today, though many of these elements were influenced by earlier RPGs and strategy games. Combining the basic concepts from games like Dragon Quest and simple turn-based strategy elements that the development team gained experience with in their 1988 release Famicom Wars, Intelligent Systems created a hit, which spawned many sequels and imitators. It introduced unique features such as how the characters were not interchangeable pawns but each of them were unique, in terms of both class and stats, and how a character who runs out of hit points would usually remain dead forever. The latter mechanic was used to introduce a non-linear storyline to the genre, where different multiple endings are possible depending on which characters are alive or dead, a concept still used in recent games such as Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor, and Final Promise Story. However, it was not until the release of Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken for the Game Boy Advance, many years later, that the series was introduced to Western gamers, who until then were more familiar with localized precursors like Nobunaga's Ambition, as well as later tactical RPGs partially influenced by Fire Emblem, including the Shining and Ogre series and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Nippon Ichi games like Disgaea.Game Design Essentials: Fire Emblem, Gamasutra =Eastern console history (1991‚Äìpresent)= 16-bit consoles During the 16-bit generation, among the first imitators was Langrisser by NCS/Masaya, first released for the Mega Drive / Genesis in 1991. It was translated for North American release and retitled Warsong. The Langrisser series differed from Fire Emblem in that it used a general-soldier structure instead of controlling main characters. Langrisser, too, spawned many sequels, none of which were brought to North America. Langrisser set itself apart from other tactical RPGs in its time with larger-scale battles, where the player could control over thirty units at one time and fight against scores of enemies.Kurt Kalata, Langrisser, Hardcore Gaming 101 Since Der Langrisser in 1994, the series offered non-linear branching paths and multiple endings. The player's choices and actions affected which of four different paths they followed, either aligning themselves with one of three different factions or fighting against all of them. Each of the four paths leads to a different ending and there are over 75 possible scenarios. Langrisser III introduced a relationship system similar to dating sims. Depending on the player's choices and actions, the feelings of the female allies will change towards the player character, who will end up with the female ally he is closest with.Kurt Kalata, Langrisser (Page 2), Hardcore Gaming 101 Master of Monsters was a unique title by SystemSoft. Where Langrisser and Fire Emblem used a square-based grid, Master of Monsters used a hexagonal grid. Players could choose one of four different Lords to defend their Towers and areas on the grid by building an army of creatures to destroy the opposing armies. This game had a sequel for the PlayStation called Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia, which had limited success and was criticized for its slow gameplay. Both Warsong and Master of Monsters were cited as the inspirations behind the 2005 turn-based strategy computer RPG, The Battle for Wesnoth.The Battle for Wesnoth (Translation), MeriStation The first game in the long-running Super Robot Wars series is another early example of the genre, initially released for the Game Boy in 1991. Another influential early tactical RPG was Sega's Shining Force for the Sega Genesis, which was released in 1992. Shining Force used even more console RPG elements than earlier games, allowing the player to walk around towns and talk to people and buy weapons. It spawned sequels, Shining Force II for Sega Genesis and Shining Force CD for Sega CD, besides the Shining Force Gaiden 1, 2 and 3 for Sega Game Gear and Shining Force III for Sega Saturn. The game's creator, Camelot Software Planning's Hiroyuki Takahashi, cited Kure Software Koubou's 1988 tactical RPG, Silver Ghost, as his inspiration. One game released solely in Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Bahamut Lagoon, began Square's (now Square Enix) famous line of tactical RPGs. Four games from the Ogre Battle series have been released in North America. The first was Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen was released for the SNES in 1993 and was more of a real-time strategy RPG in which the player forms character parties that are moved around a map in real-time. When two parties meet, the combat plays out with minimal user interaction. The game is notable for introducing a moral alignment system that not only affects the gameplay but where tactical and strategic decisions influence the outcome of a non-linear branching storyline, which is affected by factors such as the moral alignments of the troops used to liberate a city, whether to keep certain liberated cities guarded, making popular or unpopular decisions, concentrating power among just a few units, making deals with thieves, and a general sense of justice. These factors lead to one of 13 possible endings, alongside other factors such as how many and which units are used, how battles are fought, the army's reputation, player character's alignment and charisma, and secrets discovered.Ogre Battle, RPG Fan The sequel, Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, was originally a 1995 SNES game that was not released outside Japan. It was later ported to the PlayStation, along with Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen. Both of the PlayStation re-releases were marketed in North America by Atlus, as was Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber for the Nintendo 64. Tactics Ogre's gameplay is more similar to the genre of tactical RPGs that Final Fantasy Tactics belongs to (which was developed by former members of Quest and created/written/directed by Yasumi Matsuno), complete with battles taking place on isometric grids. It was also the first to bear the name \\"Tactics\\" in the title, a term gamers would come to associate with the genre. Not only are characters moved individually on a grid, but the view is isometric, and the order of combat is calculated for each character individually. The game also expanded the non-linear alignment system of its predecessor, with three types of alignments for each unit: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaos, neither of which are portrayed as necessarily good or bad. The game gives players the freedom to choose their own destiny, with difficult moral decisions, such as whether to follow a Lawful path by upholding the oath of loyalty and slaughter civilian non-player characters on the leader's command, or follow the chaotic path by following a personal sense of justice and rebelling, or instead follow a more neutral path.Tactics Ogre, RPG Fan Such factors affect the game's ending, which is also affected by decisions such as whether to obtain the most powerful class, which can only be acquired by making a tragic sacrifice. Another feature was \\"Warren's Report\\", a type of database on the land, people, encounters and races of Valeria (similar to, but much more expansive than, the troves of knowledge in Mass Effect). Although this game defined the genre in many ways, it was not widely recognized by American gamers because it was released to American audiences several years later. Final Fantasy Tactics shared some staff members with Tactics Ogre and shares many of its gameplay elements. A prequel to the original Tactics Ogre, Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis, was later released for the Game Boy Advance. A remake of Let Us Cling Together was later released for the PSP in 2011. In 1996, the tactical role- playing game Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu also featured a non-linear branching storyline, but instead of using an alignment system, it used a relationship system resembling dating sims that gave players the ability to affect the relationship points between different units/characters. This in turn affected both the gameplay and storyline, with the different possible relationships in the first generation of the game's plot leading to different units/characters appearing during the second generation, ultimately leading to different possible outcomes to the storyline. 32-bit consoles Isometric graphics of Front Mission. The character's movement range is indicated in blue. Some terrain objects such as trees block movement. The terrain also shows a noticeable variation in height at different places. The 32-bit era saw many influential tactical RPGs, such as Konami's 1996 Vandal Hearts series, which feature branching storylines that can be altered by the player's dialogue choices that lead to different endings, as well as Sega's 1997 Shining Force 3, SCEI's Arc the Lad Collection (1996‚Äì1999), and Square's 1997 Final Fantasy Tactics and 1999 Front Mission 3. Konami's Vandal Hearts was an early PlayStation title that helped popularize tactical RPGs in the US. It was released by Konami and featured a 3D isometric map that could be rotated by the player. A sequel was subsequently released, also for the PlayStation, and Konami has announced a third title in development for the Nintendo DS. One of the first 32-bit tactical RPGs, Guardian War, was developed by Micro Cabin and released in 1993 on the Panasonic 3DO. While the game lacked in story, it included many game mechanics that are seen throughout many of the 32-bit tactical RPGs; like isometric camera rotation, interchangeable and hybridization of \\"jobs\\" or \\"classes\\" for each character, the combination of moves between characters, and the capture of NPCs and having them play on your side. Sega's Sakura Wars, released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, combined tactical RPG combat with dating sim and visual novel elements, introducing a real-time branching choice system where, during an event or conversation, the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit, or not to respond at all within that time. The player's choice, or lack thereof, affects the player character's relationship with other characters and in turn the characters' performance in battle, the direction of the storyline, and the ending. Later games in the series added several variations, including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation, and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation. The success of Sakura Wars led to a wave of games that combine the RPG and dating sim genres, including Thousand Arms in 1998, Riviera: The Promised Land in 2002, and Luminous Arc in 2007. Final Fantasy Tactics was arguably the most responsible for bringing tactical RPGs to North America. Developed by former employees of Quest, the developer responsible for the Ogre Battle series, it combined many elements of the Final Fantasy series with Tactics Ogre-style gameplay. It also expanded on the isometric grid combat of Tactics Ogre by allowing players to freely rotate the camera around the battlefield rather than keeping the camera in a fixed position. The storyline of Final Fantasy Tactics was also more linear than its predecessor, in order to provide a deeper epic narrative. Thanks to Hiroyuki Ito, lead designer on the game, it also successfully implemented a modified job system, previously used in Final Fantasy V, which allowed the player to change a unit's character class at any time during the game and learn new abilities from job points earned with each class.Review - Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions (PSP) , GamesAreFun.com The game was acclaimed for both its highly tactical gameplay and its well-written storyline that touches on issues such as class, privilege, religion, and politics. The game's reputation led to other developers adding the word \\"Tactics\\" to their titles to indicate the tactical RPG genre. It was later ported to the PSP as Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions and is still regarded as one of the greatest tactical RPGs of all time.Chart Toppers: Square Enix Strategizes a Hit with Final Fantasy Tactics, GameDaily Sixth generation On sixth-generation consoles, a loyal American fan-base has been established by Nippon Ichi, makers of the PlayStation 2 games La Pucelle: Tactics, Phantom Brave, and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness.'Time Extend,' Edge, March 2008, p105 Of these games, Disgaea has been the most successful to date, and was the second Nippon Ichi game released in North America, the first being Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure (published by Atlus). Throughout this generation, companies have recognized the large audience and popularity of these types of games, particularly Atlus and Nintendo. La Pucelle: Tactics and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, which Atlus re- released due to high demand, have become cult hits for the PlayStation 2. In 2001, Sakura Wars 3 for the Dreamcast introduced a new combat system that incorporates action elements, and abandons the use of grids in favour of allowing each character to move around freely across the battlefield but with a limited number of moves each turn illustrated using a bar at the bottom of the screen. This type of combat system would later be the basis for the combat system in Valkyria Chronicles, developed by much of the same team in 2008. The Sakura Wars series would not be released in the West until the fifth game, Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love (2005). The Front Mission series also continued on to the PlayStation 2, with Front Mission 4 and Front Mission 5, the latter of which never saw a Western release, but a fan translation. The Game Boy Advance would also see the release of Rebelstar: Tactical Command (2005) by X-COM creators, Nick and Julian Gollop. The game would be highly praised for adapting the combat mechanics of the highly detailed and acclaimed PC strategy series; but would also receive criticism for sub-par presentation, a lackluster storyline, and lack of link-mode support. The game ended up receiving an average score of 77.83% at GameRankings. In early 2006, Idea Factory's Blazing Souls featured nonlinear gameplay that allows the player to progress through the game and the story in whatever order they wish. In addition, instead of having separate screens or maps for exploration and battle, the game features a seamless transition between exploration and battle.Ichi Nen Kan, JAPANDEMONIUM , RPGamer, November 8, 2005 This time period also saw the Western debut of Fire Emblem in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (simply titled Fire Emblem outside Japan.). Seventh generation On seventh-generation consoles, Sega's Valkyria Chronicles (2008) for the PlayStation 3 utilizes the seventh-generation console processing power by using a distinctive anime/watercolor art style, as well as incorporating third-person tactical shooter elements. After selecting a character in the overhead map view, the player manually controls him/her from a third-person view. This mechanic allows for, among others: free movement to a certain range, manual aiming with extra damage for headshots, a limited cover system, and real-time hazards, such as interception fire and landmines. The game has been described as \\"the missing link between Final Fantasy Tactics and Full Spectrum Warrior.\\" In 2004, Konami released Metal Gear Acid, which combined the stealth game elements of the Metal Gear series with turn-based tactical RPG gameplay of games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Disgaea, along with the random-draw, forethought and resource management appeal of card battles like in Konami's own Yu-Gi-Oh! games (1999 onwards).Metal Gear Acid (PSP) , 1UP, 03/23/2005 Developer Kuju Entertainment released Dungeons & Dragons Tactics for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. The game intended to adapt the rules and mechanics of the popular table-top role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, but suffered from a poor interface and awkward camera controls. The Atlus title Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor (2009)Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor, GameDaily blended together both traditional and tactical RPG gameplay along with non-linear adventure game elements.Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor - NDS - Review , GameZone It also featured an innovative demon auction system and a death clock system where each character has a specified time of death, with the player's actions and choices having consequences on who lives and dies.Devil Survivor And The Countdown Clock To Death, Siliconera, May 27, 2009 Infinite Space (2009) by PlatinumGames, for the Nintendo DS, is a hybrid of tactical role-playing, real-time strategy and space simulator elements, and features a non-linear branching narrative with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences, and an epic scale spanning hundreds of planets. Radiant Historia, released by Atlus for the Nintendo DS in 2010, combined the gameplay of traditional RPG titles with a highly tactical grid combat system, with several unique features such as a queue allowing party members to switch turns and perform combo attacks when near each other on the queue, and the manipulation of enemy positions by knocking a target onto another grid space and attack multiple targets when enemies fall onto the same grid space.Radiant Historia Gives Off a Distinct Chrono Trigger Vibe , 1UP The game is most notable for its unique take on the concept of non-linear branching storylines, which it combines with the concepts of time travel and parallel universes, expanding on the Chrono series. Radiant Historia takes it much further by giving players the freedom to travel backwards and forwards through a timeline to alter the course of history, with each of their choices and actions having a major effect on the timeline. The player can return to certain points in history and live through certain events again to make different choices and see different possible outcomes on the timeline. The player can also travel back and forth between two parallel timelines,Radiant Historia's Full Official Site Opens , Andriasang and can obtain many possible parallel endings.Radiant Historia Has \\"Many\\" Endings, Siliconera Square Enix's PSP version of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, released around the same time, featured a similar \\"World\\" system that allows players to revisit key plot points and make different choices to see how the story unfolds differently.Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, GamesRadar, February 15, 2011 Atlus title Growlanser IV: Wayfarer of the Time (2012)Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time, Siliconera features a unique battle system that blends turn-based and real-time strategy. The player controls each character in turn, but the actions play out in real-time. Imageepoch's upcoming Saigo no Yakusoku no Monogatari (Final Promise Story) for the PlayStation Portable has a strategic command-based battle system where enemies learn from previous skirmishes. The characters can also die permanently during gameplay which in turn affects the game's storyline.Tom Goldman (24 Nov 2010), Imageepoch Unveils New Wave of JRPGs, The Escapist =Western personal computers= Many Western PC games have utilized this genre for years, as well. Western games tend to have stronger military themes, without many of the fantasy elements often found in their console (and mainly Japanese) counterparts; as well as greater freedom of movement when interacting with the surrounding environment. Notable examples include the Jagged Alliance series (1994-2018) and the Silent Storm series (2003-2005), with many titles owing considerably to the X-COM series (1994-2016) of strategy games. In fact, Western PC games in the genre were largely defined by X-COM in much the same way as Eastern console games were by Fire Emblem. 1990s Incubation: Time Is Running Out (1997), part of the Battle Isle series, was one of the first strategy titles to use fully 3D graphics and support hardware acceleration on the 3dfx Voodoo. Other titles in the series are mainly tactical wargames featuring vehicle combat and base capturing. The game was generally well received by critics. Gorky 17 (1999, a.k.a. Odium) is a tactical RPG by Polish developer Metropolis Software featuring elements of survival horror. It is also the first title in a series featuring the main character, Cole Sullivan. Later titles in the series were third-person shooters. The game's reception was mixed. Vantage Master is a series of tactical RPGs similar to Master of Monsters developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows, beginning in 1997. The first game in the series was never released outside Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The latest game, Vantage Master Portable, was announced for the PSP on December 20, 2007, and released on April 24, 2008. Jagged Alliance is tactical turn-based RPG series developed by Sir-Tech Canada. First game was released in 1995, second in 1999. 2000s Silent Storm presents the player with two sets of equipped weapons, numerous stances, and several different firing modes. Terrain elevation is also completely fluid, with smooth ramps, sloping embankments, flights of stairs and ladders (not pictured). Shadow Watch (2000) is a video game adaptation of the Tom Clancy's Power Plays novel of the same name developed by Red Storm Entertainment. It has also been compared to X-COM, though it features a different action point system and is missing the latter game's upgradable units. The game's reception was mixed. Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (2001) is a spin-off of the Fallout series of CRPGs by Interplay Entertainment developed by Australian company Micro Fort√©. Unusual for the genre is the option to choose between real-time and turn-based play, or between \\"Continuous Turn-Based Mode\\" (CTB), \\"Individual Turn-Based Mode\\" (ITB), and \\"Squad Turn-Based Mode\\" (STB) modes as the developers put it. The game even allows the player to switch modes in the middle of play. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, though was not as well- received as the series' more traditional RPG titles. Soldiers of Anarchy (2002) is a squad-based real-time tactics computer game by German developer Silver Style Entertainment. Gameplay involves squad tactics, vehicles and a wide variety of weapons and ammunition. The game received mixed reviews from critics. Freedom Force (2002) and its sequel, Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich (2005) - both by Irrational Games - are two examples of comic book superhero tactical RPGs that are played in real-time instead of turns. Both games received favorable reviews from critics. Paradise Cracked (2003), COPS 2170: The Power of Law (2005), Metalheart: Replicants Rampage (2004) and Shadow Vault (2004) are poorly received tactical RPGs by MiST Land South, Akella and Mayhem Studios of Russia and Slovakia, respectively. Paradise Cracked was inspired by cyberpunk works such as The Matrix, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and Philip K. Dick novels; and Metalheart: Replicants Rampage is a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk tactical RPG inspired by Jagged Alliance, Syndicate, and Fallout. COPS 2170: The Power of Law is set in the same \\"Reality 4.13\\" universe that first appeared in Paradise Cracked. Hammer & Sickle (2005) is a tactical RPG co-developed by Russian companies Novik & Co and Nival Interactive, and published by CDV. It is set in the Silent Storm universe and follows the events in the main series. After this came Night Watch (2006) and its sequel, Day Watch (2007), also by Nival Interactive, but instead based on the Russian novels and films of the same name. All three games received mediocre-to-poor review scores despite utilizing the highly regarded Silent Storm engine. Other titles inspired by Jagged Alliance include Brigade E5: New Jagged Union (2006) and its sequel, simply titled 7.62 (2007), by Russian developer Apeiron; Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge (2007) by GFI Russia; and Jagged Alliance: Back in Action by bitComposer Games. The Brigade E5 series incorporates an innovative hybrid real-time system the company calls \\"Smart Pause Mode\\" in an attempt to heighten realism; Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge began its life as Jagged Alliance 3D before Strategy First withdrew the rights to the series name; and Jagged Alliance: Back in Action is a 3D, real- time remake of Jagged Alliance 2. Lastly, Jagged Alliance: Flashback was released in 2014 following a successful Kickstarter. The developer Full Control gained notoriety, however, for feuding with its backers, and the company stopped making games shortly thereafter. Additional titles inspired by X-COM include UFO: Aftermath (2003), UFO: Aftershock (2005), UFO: Afterlight (2007) and UFO: Extraterrestrials (2007) by Czech developers ALTAR Interactive and Chaos Concept; as well as Xenonauts (2014) by Goldhawk Interactive. ALTAR's UFO series features real-time play; Chaos Concept's UFO: Extraterrestrials received only mixed reviews; and Xenonauts currently has a \\"Very Positive\\" rating on Steam. The open source, cross-platform X-COM-clone UFO: Alien Invasion is also under development. The Battle for Wesnoth (2005) is another Master of Monsters and Warsong clone, released under an open source license for multiple platforms. It also is continually updated. 2010s The tactical isometric cyberpunk/fantasy RPG, Shadowrun Returns (2013), was funded via a successful crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign that raised a total of $1.9 million for development. The game is based on the popular Shadowrun pen-and-paper setting by Jordan Weisman, and features tactical combat in a world filled with cybernetics, magic and fantasy creatures. Two sequels, Shadowrun: Dragonfall (2014) and Shadowrun: Hong Kong (2015) quickly followed. An online tactical game not directly related to the previous three games, Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown, was released to less-than-positive reviews in 2015. In 2014 the tactical RPG Blackguards based on the German The Dark Eye pen-and-paper setting was released to mixed or average reviews. A sequel, Blackguards 2, was released in 2015. 2015 saw the release of Invisible, Inc. for OS X, Windows and Linux. It has been described as a \\"tactical RPG that mixes stealth with procedural generation\\", since it introduces elements of espionage and roguelike gameplay. It received generally favorable scores from reviewers. A version for the PlayStation 4 is in development. In March 2017 the German indie developer Overhype Studios released its tactical RPG Battle Brothers out of Early Access to generally favorable reviews. This mercenary company simulation was described as a \\"cleverly constructed, carefully balanced board game\\". =Genre blurring= Other games combine similar mechanics, but typically belong in other genres. Tactical wargames such as the Steel Panthers series (1995‚Äì2006) sometimes combine tactical military combat with RPG-derived unit advancement. Avalon Hill's Squad Leader (2000), a man-to-man wargame utilizing the Soldiers at War engine, has also been compared (unfavorably) to X-COM and Jagged Alliance. Rebelstar (1984) and Laser Squad (1988) were precursors to X-COM created by the same developer, Julian Gollop. They did not, however, feature the statistical character development and strategic map of the later series. Bokosuka Wars (1983), a game regarded as the progenitor of the strategy/simulation RPG genre, is also difficult to clearly define. While often referred to as a strategy/simulation RPG, it is also sometimes referred to as a prototype real-time strategy, an early reverse tower defense game,Gems In The Rough: Yesterday's Concepts Mined For Today, Gamasutra and an early action role-playing game. Nobunaga's Ambition (1983) and later Koei titles as well as Capcom's Destiny of an Emperor (1989) have blurred the line between a role-playing game, turn-based grand strategy wargame, and simulation video game. Similarly, Kure Software Koubou's Silver Ghost (1988) combined elements of both tactical RPGs and action RPGs, while Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen (1993) blurred the line between a tactical RPG and a real-time strategy. Metal Gear Acid (2004) blurs the line between a stealth game, a genre the Metal Gear series is normally known for, along with tactical role-playing inspired by the likes of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics, infused with card gameplay found in games like Konami's own Yu-Gi-Oh! series. In addition to a turn-based tactical combat layer, the X-COM series also possesses a real- time 3D strategic layer, complete with global defensive map as well as a technology tree that the player must research in order to unlock new weapons and armor. Jagged Alliance 2 features a country sector map with fortified towns and roving bands of enemies that must be defeated before entering the capital city of Meduna. Knights in the Nightmare (2009) combines elements of traditional tactical RPGs with bullet hell‚Äìstyle shoot 'em up gameplay. Sega's Valkyria Chronicles (2008) blurs the line even further by incorporating tactical RPG gameplay with both real-time strategy and third-person tactical shooter elements, including over-the-shoulder manual aiming and a cover system. This has led to the game being described by one source as \\"the missing link between Final Fantasy Tactics and Full Spectrum Warrior.\\" In an interview with Eurogamer, X-COM developer Julian Gollop mentioned how surprised he was how close Valkyria Chronicles was in design to his cancelled game Dreamland Chronicles. Infinite Space (2009) by PlatinumGames is a hybrid of tactical RPG, real-time strategy, and space simulator. The 3rd Birthday (2010), the third game in the Parasite Eve series, features a unique blend of action role- playing game, real-time tactical RPG, survival horror and third-person tactical shooter elements. Dead State (2014) is a turn-based RPG developed by DoubleBear Productions and Iron Tower Studios set in a zombie apocalypse scenario. Players are tasked with leading a group of survivors living in a shelter in the fictional town of Splendid, Texas. Dead State mixes tactical combat and RPG character development with survival horror and base management elements. An \\"enhanced edition\\" was released in 2015 under the name, Dead State: Reanimated. Full-fledged CRPGs A number of \\"full-fledged\\" computer role-playing games could also be described as having \\"tactical combat\\". Examples from the classic era of CRPGs include parts of the aforementioned Ultima series beginning with Ultima III: Exodus (1983); SSI's Wizard's Crown (1985) and The Eternal Dagger (1987); the Realms of Arkania (1992-1996) series based on the German The Dark Eye pen-and-paper system; and the Gold Box games of the late '80s and early '90s--many of which were later ported to Japanese video game systems. Other examples include Troika Games' The Temple of Elemental Evil (2003), which features a highly accurate implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition ruleset; Knights of the Chalice (2009), which implements the d20 Open Game License; and Pyrrhic Tales: Prelude to Darkness (2002), an open world RPG featuring one continuous game world. More recent examples include Wasteland 2 (2014), Divinity: Original Sin (2014) and The Age of Decadence (2015). Partly due to the success of Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, Blackguards and Dead State, 2014 has been labeled \\"the first year of the CRPG renaissance\\". Tir-nan-√≥g (beginning in 1984) is a series of role-playing video games that premiered in Japan on the PC98 and later released for Windows. The latest title in the series is also being released for the PlayStation 2 and PSP. Heroes of Jin Yong (1996), a Chinese role-playing game based on the popular historical Wuxia novels by Jin Yong, features a number of melee and ranged kung fu skills to train and develop, as well as a grid-based battle system. A remake of the game under the title of Tale of Wuxia was released in Chinese in 2015, and later on Steam in both Chinese and English in 2016. Massively multiplayer online gaming Several massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) have combined multiplayer online gaming with tactical turn-based combat. Examples include, Dofus (2005), The Continuum (2008), as well as the Russian game Total Influence Online (2009?). Tactica Online was a planned MMORPG that would have featured tactical combat, had development not been cancelled in 2006. Gunrox (2008), Poxnora (2006) and Wakfu (2012) are some other recent examples. Popularity Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time-consuming and extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player. Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed the same degree of success in North America and elsewhere. However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially in the West since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden Tactics, Vanguard Bandits and Disgaea enjoying a surprising measure of popularity outside Japan. Further, older Japanese tactical RPGs are also being re-released via software emulation--such as on the Wii's Virtual Console--as well as on handheld systems, giving these games a new lease on life. However, in the 2000s, some developers complained it was becoming increasingly difficult to develop games of this type (though several had been developed in Eastern Europe with limited success); and even some developers were beginning to complain about a supposed bias against turn-based systems. Reasons cited include publishers' focus on developing real-time, action-oriented games; as well as a perception that games with turn-based mechanics were \\"too niche\\" to become successful. But things may have turned around in the 2010s, at least in the West. A few high- profile titles, such as 2K Games' strategy video games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2--as well as a number of Kickstarter-funded RPGs, such as Larian's Divinity: Original Sin, inXile's Wasteland 2 and Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun Returns--were successfully developed and published in recent years, in part due to new means of funding and distributing them. According to Dan Tudge of n-Space, \\"The resurgence of tactical-isometric RPGs has a lot to do with accessibility. ... Changes in the ecosystem like Steam and digital distribution have made it easier than ever for developers to connect with players.\\" See also * History of role-playing video games * Role-playing battle systems Notes References Category:Video game genres Category:Video game terminology ","title":"Tactical role-playing game"},{"id":"1132612","text":"Landsberg Prison is a penal facility in the town of Landsberg am Lech in the southwest of the German state of Bavaria, about west-southwest of Munich and south of Augsburg. It is best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held in 1924, after the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, and where he dictated his memoirs Mein Kampf to Rudolf Hess. The prison was used by the Allied powers during the Occupation of Germany for holding Nazi War Criminals. In 1946 General Joseph T. McNarney, commander in chief, U.S. Forces of Occupation in Germany renamed Landsberg: War Criminal Prison Nr. 1. The Americans closed the war crimes facility in 1958. Control of the prison was then handed over to the Federal Republic of Germany. Landsberg is now maintained by the Prison Service of the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Early years Landsberg prison, which is in the town's western outskirts, was completed in 1910. The facility was designed with an Art Nouveau frontage by Hugo H√∂fl. Within its walls, the four brick-built cell blocks were constructed in a cross-shape orientation. This allowed guards to watch all wings simultaneously from a central location (based on the Panopticon style). Landsberg, which was used for holding convicted criminals and those awaiting sentencing, was also designated a Festungshaft (meaning fortress confinement) prison. ' facilities were similar to a modern protective custody unit. Prisoners were excluded from forced labor and had reasonably comfortable cells. They were also allowed to receive visitors. Anton Graf von Arco-Valley who shot Bavarian prime minister Kurt Eisner was given a Festungshaft sentence in February 1919. In 1924 Adolf Hitler spent 264 days incarcerated in Landsberg after being convicted of treason following the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich the previous year. During his imprisonment, Hitler dictated and then wrote his book Mein Kampf with assistance from his deputy, Rudolf Hess. Numerous foreign political prisoners of the Nazis were deported to Germany and imprisoned in Landsberg. Between early 1944 and the end of the war, at least 210 prisoners died in Landsberg as a result of mistreatment or execution.Landsberg Prison / Frank Falla Archive United States Army American soldiers liberating Landsberg am Lech on 30 April 1945.

War criminal Franz Strasser shortly before being hanged at Landsberg prison. German Catholic priest is praying for him. During the occupation of Germany by the Allies after World War II, the US Army designated the prison as War Criminal Prison No. 1 to hold convicted Nazi war criminals.The Landsberg Prison for War Criminals . It was run and guarded by personnel from the United States Army's Military Police (MPs). The first condemned prisoners arrived at Landsberg prison in December 1945. These war criminals had been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity at the Dachau Trials which had begun a month earlier. Between 1945 and 1946, the prison housed a total of 110 prisoners convicted at the Nuremberg trials, a further 1416 war criminals from the Dachau trials and 18 prisoners convicted in the . (These were military tribunals conducted by the American forces in Japan between August 1946 and January 1947 to prosecute 23 German officials who had continued to assist the Japanese military in Shanghai after the surrender of Nazi Germany.) In five and half years, Landsberg prison was the place of execution of nearly 300 condemned war criminals. 259 death sentences were conducted by hanging and 29 by firing squad. Executions were carried out expeditiously. In May 1946 twenty eight former SS guards from Dachau were hanged within a four-day period. Bodies that were not claimed were buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery next to the Sp√∂ttingen chapel. Prisoners Notable former members of the Third Reich who were sent to the US Army's prison at Landsberg included: * Sepp Dietrich * Hellmuth Felmy * Otto Hofmann * Karl-Adolf Hollidt * Hermann Hoth * Waldemar Klingelh√∂fer * Gustav Knittel * Alfried Krupp * Hans Heinrich Lammers * Wilhelm List * Erhard Milch * Joachim Peiper * Martin Sandberger * Gustav Adolf Steengracht von Moyland * Otto Steinbrinck * Walter Warlimont * Martin Gottfried Weiss * Karl Brandt * Oswald Pohl Closure Convicted Nazi war criminal Wladislaw Dopierla before execution at Landsberg prison, 1948 By 1948 the Bavarian Ministry of Justice's Association for the Welfare of Prisoners (Vereinigung f√ºr die Wohlfahrt von Gefangenen des Bayerischen Staatsministeriums der Justiz) managed the needs of the prisoners held by the American military. With the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 and its abolition of the death penalty, calls from politicians, the churches, industrialists, and artists resulted in numerous petitions being made to close down War Criminal Prison No. 1. as part of a general effort to bring freedom for all Germans convicted of war crimes. In the last half of 1950 and the first half of 1951, thousands of Germans took part in demonstrations outside Landsberg prison to demand pardons for all the war criminals while the German media coverage was overwhelmingly on the side of the condemned, who were depicted as the innocent victims of American \\"lynch law\\". Though the protestors at Landsberg claimed to be motivated only by opposition to the death penalty and not to have any pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic feelings, their actions belied their words. When a group of Jewish protestors arrived at Landsberg demanding the execution of the 102 war criminals on 7 January 1951, the German protestors demanding amnesty began to chant the Nazi-era slogan \\"Juden raus! Juden raus!\\" (\\"Jews out! Jews out!\\") and then proceed to beat up the Jewish protestors. The German historian Norbert Frei observed that most of the politicians who demanded freedom for condemned prisoners at Landsberg at various protest rallies outside the prison, such as Richard Jaeger of the CSU, later on became prominent advocates of restoring the death penalty, which strongly suggested that what people like Jaeger objected to was not so much the death penalty, but rather the use of the death penalty against Nazi war criminals. Another politician who spoke at the protest rallies outside Landsberg prison was Gebhard Seelos of the Bavaria Party, who called the prisoners of Landsberg together with Heligoland‚Äîwhich was being used as target practice by the RAF‚Äîto be \\"beacons of the German Volk in their struggle for justice, peace and the reconciliation of nations\\". Seelos went on to compare the suffering of the condemned prisoners at Landsberg with that of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and argued that to execute the prisoners on death row at Landsberg would be an act every bit as \\"inhumane\\" as the Holocaust. Seelos's speech drew loud applause from the crowd. Frei called Seelos's speech, with its claim that the war criminals facing execution at Landsberg were just as much victims as the Jews that they killed in the Holocaust, a \\"breathtaking\\" exercise in moral equivalence. In early 1951 the Bavarian parliament passed a resolution declaring that all military prisoners at Landsberg, Werl, and Wittlich should be recognized as POWs, making them the financial responsibility of the Federal German government. On 2 January 1951, the West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, met the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, John J. McCloy, to argue that the status of the Landsberg prisoners was not so much a legal question as a political one, and that to execute the Landsberg prisoners would ruin forever any effort at having the Federal Republic play its role in the Cold War. On 31 January 1951 McCloy, under very strong pressure from German public opinion, agreed to review the sentences from the Nuremberg and Dachau trials. Out of 28 prisoners condemned to death, seven death sentences were confirmed. Some, like the industrialist Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, were pardoned by McCloy. The other sentences were reduced to terms of imprisonment. The seven death sentences confirmed by McCloy were the so-called \\"worst of the worst\\" at Landsberg, namely Oswald Pohl, Paul Blobel, Otto Ohlendorf, Werner Braune, Eric Naumann, (an SS sergeant at M√ºhldorf, a Dachau sub-camp), and (adjutant of Buchenwald). Neither Adenauer nor German public opinion was satisfied by McCloy's decision, and as a result, throughout the first half of 1951 the Federal Republic continued to lobby McCloy to pardon the seven condemned men while the huge demonstrations for amnesty continued at Landsberg, demanding freedom for the \\"Landsberg Seven\\". The final executions were conducted on 7 June 1951. By the middle of the fifties, these inmates began to be seen not as war criminals but as political prisoners or prisoners of war. For instance, in 1955, the Landsberg city council asked their mayor \\"to work for the overdue release of the political prisoners\\" in the Landsberg prison. Moreover, the FRG government in Bonn decided the convictions of war criminals by military courts were to be regarded as foreign convictions and therefore did not become part of an individual's criminal record. In May 1958, the United States Army relinquished control of Landsberg Prison when the last four prisoners were released from custody. These were all former SS high-ranking officers who had been convicted during the Einsatzgruppen Trials between 1947 and 1948. Management of the facility was transferred to the civilian Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Modern day The prison is now run as a progressive correctional facility that provides training, skills and medical help for prisoners. There are 36 courses in the central training centre which provide training for occupations such as bakers, electricians, painters, butchers, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, heating & ventilation workers and bricklayers.

Nicknamed El Gato (Spanish for \\"the cat\\") because of his agility, reflexes, physical qualities, and shot-stopping ability, Hartman has more saves than any other goalkeeper in MLS history, and was the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 1999. Considered to be one of the greatest and most successful goalkeepers in MLS history, he was also known for his longevity. Career =Youth and college= Hartman attended Radford High School in Radford, Virginia, where he made the school's varsity team and served as backup goalkeeper in 1989. As a sophomore, he started for a young Radford High Team that went 1‚Äì12, where Hartman once gave up six goals in a half. That Radford High team won the Region IV Title in 1992 over Blacksburg High School and lost in the state semi-finals. RHS would have likely contended for the state title in 1992; however, between his sophomore and junior year at Radford High School, Hartman moved with his family to the Palos Verdes in California, where he enrolled in Palos Verdes High School, playing on the junior varsity squad for the 1990‚Äì1991 season. Before his senior year, Palos Verdes High School merged with Rolling Hills High School and Miraleste High School to form Palos Verdes Peninsula High School. As a senior, Hartman played on the Peninsula High School varsity squad, though he only started a few of the games early in the season. Hartman also played on a club team known as the San Pedro FC Santos, headed by Pat Nave of San Pedro, California. Known as having a strong work ethic, Hartman often woke up early in the morning to practice in the nearby city of Long Beach. After graduating from high school in the Spring of 1992, Hartman went on to play college soccer at California State University, Dominguez Hills and UCLA. He began his college career at Dominguez Hills, playing there in 1992 and 1993, before transferring to UCLA, where he played in 1995 and 1996, redshirting in 1994. =Professional= Hartman was drafted 29th overall in the 1997 MLS College Draft by Los Angeles Galaxy. He played very little his rookie year, as he was stuck behind renowned Mexican keeper Jorge Campos. After the season, Hartman, or \\"El Gato\\" (dubbed by La Opinion reporter Ramiro Gonzalez),was selected third overall by Chicago Fire in the expansion draft; the Galaxy quickly reacquired him, however, trading Campos and Chris Armas to the Fire in exchange for Hartman and Danny Pena. With Campos in Chicago, Hartman seized the starting job, starting 28 games for the team kept it until his departure from the team, except for a brief period in 2001 when Matt Reis briefly took his job. He was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 1999 following an especially good season. Hartman helped the Galaxy win the CONCACAF Champions' Cup in 2000, the U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and 2005, and the MLS Cup in 2002 and 2005.

Poe was the first Republican to represent the 2nd district. In November 2017, Poe announced that he would retire from Congress, and not seek re-election in 2018. Early life Poe was born in Temple in Bell County, Texas, but attended Spring Woods High School in Houston. Poe resides in Humble, Texas. He graduated in 1970, with a degree in political science from Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas; he was his class president. In 1973, he graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Houston Law Center. He participated in the school's honor society. From 1970 to 1976, he served in the United States Air Force Reserve's C-130 Unit at Houston's Ellington Air Force Base. Judicial career After serving as a chief felony prosecutor in Harris County (Houston) for eight years, Poe was appointed a felony court judge in Harris County in 1981, becoming one of the youngest judges in the state. In this position, he gained national prominence for his unusual criminal sentences that included ordering thieves to carry signs in front of stores from which they stole. However, in at least one case, Poe amended the sentence afterwards without notifying the victim's family. Elections to United States Congress In November 2004, Poe ran for the U.S. House in the 2nd District. The district had previously been the 9th, represented by four-term Democrat Nick Lampson. However, as the result of a controversial mid-decade redistricting, the new 2nd was considerably more Republican than the old 9th. It lost Galveston and the area around the Johnson Space Center, while picking up several heavily Republican areas north of Houston, including Poe's home in Humble. Poe won 55% of the vote to Lampson's 43%. While Lampson trounced Poe in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Poe swamped Lampson in the Harris County portion of the district. Poe made border security a centerpiece of his re-election strategy, calling for \\"more [National] Guardsmen on the border front\\". In November 2006, Poe won a second term with 65.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat Gary Binderim, who took 32.7%.Spencer Gaffney, Texas delegation in depth: Ted Poe, Houston Chronicle (July 2010). In November 2008 and 2010, Poe did not face a Democratic challenger in the general election. In 2008, he defeated Libertarian Craig Wolfe, taking 88.9% of the vote to Wolfe's 11.1%. In 2010, he defeated Libertarian David Smith with 88.6 percent of the vote to Smith's 11.4 percent. Poe's district was made significantly more compact in the 2010s round of redistricting. It was cut back to an exclusively Harris County-based district, wheeling from Humble through northern and western Houston to just outside downtown. This district was slightly less Republican than its predecessor, and Poe was elected three more times from this district with over 60 percent of the vote. Poe announced on November 7, 2017 that he would not seek re-election in 2018.

Since 2012, he has been the head of the Congressional Serbian Caucus. He is also a member of the Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, the Tea Party Caucus, the House Baltic Caucus and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus. Political positions Tea Party in Texas in 2009 =Taxes= Poe is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. =Abortion= Poe received a 0 rating from the abortion rights group NARAL in 2007 and a rating of 100 from the National Right to Life Committee in 2007‚Äì2008. He also voted for the Prohibiting Federal Funding of Abortion Services amendment on November 7, 2009. =Fiscal policy= In 2008, the National Taxpayers Union, an organization that supports \\"lower taxes and smaller government\\", gave Poe the grade B+, and in 2007 received a rating of 90 from the group Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that advocates \\"taxes [that] are simpler, [and] flatter\\". Poe voted against the 2009 Economic Stimulus Package (HR 1) and the 2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 13). The Club for Growth PAC gave him a power ranking of 85.85%. =Healthcare= Poe favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Poe does not support what he calls \\"government-run health care\\". Poe voted \\"Nay\\" on the Health Care and Insurance Law Amendments bill on November 7, 2009. In 2008, Poe voted for the Medicare Bill (HR 6331). Poe supports healthcare reform that would \\"Allow insurance to be purchased across state lines, provide for a safety net for catastrophic injury or illness‚Ä¶and allow for a health savings account\\". Poe resigned from the Freedom Caucus in March 2017, after the Caucus's opposition to the American Health Care Act of 2017 contributed to Speaker Ryan's decision to pull the bill. Poe supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act before its collapse. On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act. =Immigration = Poe is an advocate of stronger action against illegal immigration and increased security on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. He voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and against the DREAM Act when it was introduced in 2010. He opposed the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, calling it \\"an imperial decree\\" that violated immigration law. Poe co-sponsored, along with fellow Republican Representative Steve King, the \\"Deport Foreign Convicted Criminals Act of 2011\\" (), which would require the U.S. government to deny certain visas to citizens of nations that refuse to accept convicted foreign nationals that the U.S. is seeking to deport. If passed, the law would mandate visa denials to nationals of 153 nations worldwide. Poe's bill was opposed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which noted that the bill would block visas issued to citizens of American allies, including Israel, Britain, and Canada. The bill was also criticized by Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who called it \\"the most stupid bill I've ever seen\\" and stated it would wipe out the U.S. tourism industry.Reid Pillifant, Jerry Nadler on the stupidest bill he's ever seen, Politico (November 23, 2011). =Human trafficking= Poe introduced the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, a bill to combat human trafficking.Jesse Bynes, Obama signs anti-trafficking bill into law, The Hill (May 29, 2015). The 2015 bill passed the House in a 420-3 vote and, following a delay, passed the Senate in a 99-0 vote. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in May 2015. Controversies In 1998, Judge Poe was known for sentences that involved a measure of humiliation, including ordering offenders to shovel manure, a practice which led to the nickname \\"The King of Shame.\\" Poe explained, \\"The people I see have too good a self-esteem. I want them to feel guilty about what they've done. I don't want 'em to leave the courthouse having warm fuzzies inside.\\" Poe's \\"public notice\\" sentences included ordering a drunk driver to stand outside a bar, wearing a sign that said \\"I killed two people while driving drunk.\\" As a state judge, in November 2002, Poe ruled that he would permit the PBS documentary show Frontline to videotape jury deliberations of a capital murder case.\\"Inviting TV Into Jury Room in a Capital Case\\", Adam Liptak, November 26, 2002, The New York Times There was considerable concern that this would affect the result of the trial, possibly by skewing the composition of the jury, and the decision was appealed by Harris County prosecutors.\\"The 13th Juror\\" (editorial), November 27, 2002, The New York Times\\"Texas Court to Rule on Videotaping of Jury\\", Adam Liptak, January 16, 2003, The New York Times The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal appellate court, ruled against Poe's decision and prohibited the videotaping.\\"Bid to Tape Deliberations By Texas Jury Is Rejected\\", Adam Liptak, February 13, 2003, The New York Times Poe speaking in 2009 On June 7, 2009, Poe signed on as a co- sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen. On July 23, 2009, he appeared on CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight in which he claimed that Certifications of Live Birth issued by Hawaii State Department of Health cannot be used to obtain a U.S. passport, which is untrue. His support of H.R. 1503 and public advocacy for it earned him a negative editorial in the Houston Chronicle. In August 2011, AlterNet reported that Poe, along with John Culberson and Michael McCaul, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers' families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral. The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals. The VA, however, asserted that this claim was \\"blatantly false\\" and that VA respects a family's \\"rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries\\". In 2017, his bill to have Congress monitor religious reform and interpretation in Saudi Arabia aroused international concerns that the United States was behind societal upheavals in that country. Poe was elected to his seventh term in the House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 168,692 votes (60.6 percent), he defeated the Democrat Pat Bryan, who received 100,231 ballots (36 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 3.35 percent of the votes cast. Personal life Poe and his wife, Carol, have four children (Kim, Kara, Kurt, and Kellee). Poe announced on July 13, 2016, that he had recently been diagnosed with leukemia and would be seeking treatment at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. In popular culture Poe was interviewed about his controversial public humiliation practices while still a Texas district judge by Jon Ronson for Ronson's 2015 book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed. In 2011, Poe gave a speech on the house floor concerning excessive spending by the Justice Department on refreshments served at conferences at the Capitol Hilton. He expressed significant disapproval that muffins apparently costing $16 each were served at the conferences. The speech was made notable by his humorous opening line, \\"Madame Speaker, do you know the muffin man?\\" The speech was further popularized by his inclusion in a Songify the News video by the Gregory Brothers in which he is autotuned, appearing to sing a song about the muffin man.

Barang () is a Khmer word meaning French. It is often mispronounced like ba-r√©ng. The correct pronunciation is b√¢-r√¢ng, but p√¢-r√¢ng is also acceptable. It is thought to be corruption of the word France but this may be a misconception. The term is related to the Thai term farang which has a similar meaning. In the Malay language, barang means \\"thing\\". The origin of this word is debatable as there are several possibilities. One is that it came from Arabic (faranj) via Malay traders. Another is that it came straight from the French. Since Khmer does not have a letter that represents the Latin F, it is pronounced with a B sound. As with many Khmer words of foreign origin, n's often change to an ng sound. Such as Aleurm√¢ng () (German) which comes from the French word Allemand. In the Khmer language, the term barang has also come to mean a foreigner, particularly one of European ancestry. It is not a demeaning word, but some Khmer speakers might use it in a bad context. The term is becoming more popular now among travelers. It is even used by some expatriates living in Cambodia themselves. Khmer is the official language of Cambodia which was once a French protectorate called Cambodge in French. The French had many influences on the Khmer language, such as the pronunciation of Mercedes. Many technical terms used today in Khmer are of French origin. Barang is also used as a suffix in some Khmer words such as m√¥n barang () which is transliterally French chicken, but refers to a turkey. Another word is kh'teum barang () which is transliterally French allium and means an onion. \\"Barangsaes\\" () is another Khmer term that shows its relation with the word Fran√ßais, but it is rarely used.

It is named after Mark Denny. If capillary waves are assumed to generate the momentum transfer to the water, the animal's legs must move faster than the phase speed c_m of the waves, given by :c_m=\\\\left(\\\\frac{4g\\\\sigma}{\\\\rho}\\\\right)^{1/4}, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, \\\\sigma is the strength of surface tension, and \\\\rho the density of water.

First, water striders' motion was assumed to rely on the generation of capillary waves, since the propulsive force was thought to be that associated with wave drag on the driving leg. Second, in order to generate capillary waves, it was assumed that the strider leg speed must exceed the minimum wave speed, c_m=\\\\left(4g\\\\sigma/\\\\rho\\\\right)^{1/4}\\\\simeq 0.23\\\\mathrm{m/s}.

After his death, his wife, Florence Maybrick, was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The \\"Aigburth Poisoning\\" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a century after his death Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper, owing to his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book They All Love Jack, writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer. A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed during 1884 and 1885 upon the city of Austin, Texas, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders. Life Maybrick was born in Liverpool, Merseyside (at the time in Lancashire), the son of William Maybrick, an engraver, and his wife, Susanna. He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter's Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks' third of seven sons. Mrs Florence Maybrick was convicted of James' death Maybrick's cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the United States and in 1871 he settled in Norfolk, Virginia, to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted malaria, which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life. In 1880, Maybrick returned to the company's offices in Britain. Sailing from New York City on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from Mobile, Alabama, and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages ‚Äì he was 42, and she 18 ‚Äì they began to plan their wedding immediately. The wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James' Church, Piccadilly, London. The couple returned to Liverpool to live at Maybrick's home, \\"Battlecrease House\\" in Aigburth, a suburb in the south of the city. They had two children: a son, James Chandler (\\"Bobo\\"), born in 1882, and a daughter, Gladys Evelyn, born in 1886. Maybrick continued to divide his time between the American and the British offices of his company and this may have caused difficulties within his marriage. He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband's infidelity. In Maybrick's case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather's will as \\"Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James\\". Death Maybrick's health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in Aigburth. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown. Suspicion immediately fell on Florence, and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at St George's Hall, Liverpool, and after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The way in which the judge conducted her trial was questioned, and this may have been the reason her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, some of which she served in a prison in Woking, Surrey, and then at the \\"House of Detention\\" at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. A re-examination of her case resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations until her death on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never saw her children again. An episode of the BBC TV programme Murder, Mystery and My Family, broadcast on 27 July 2020, investigated whether Florence Maybrick's conviction held credibility when investigated by modern- day means. The investigation was undertaken by Jeremy Dein QC (defence) and Sasha Wass QC (prosecution) and their findings were put before Crown Court Judge David Radford. From their investigations it appeared that Mrs Maybrick was subjected to the Victorian morality code by the judge and the jury. The judge in the Maybrick murder trial delivered his summing-up to the jury for two days. Modern experts, assisting the QCs, stated that Victorian society used arsenic as a beauty aid, and for someone like Mrs Maybrick to extract a small amount of the poison from flypaper would have been commonplace. In addition, the arsenic found in James Maybrick's liver was 20 milligrams and a fatal dose would be more likely 100 milligrams. It was also discovered that Mr Maybrick had been self-prescribing medicines; he was taking a large amount of drugs, and only two of these drugs did not contain poison. As James Maybrick grew sicker, his brothers insisted that Florence be forbidden access to James, however, he grew yet sicker, and died. A modern-day expert on Victorian society was consulted by the QCs, and was asked whether the admission by way of a letter of a love affair between Mrs Maybrick and an associate of Mr Maybrick could in any way be reflected in the judge's summing-up, thus prejudicing the jury. After the two QCs had informed the modern-day judge David Radford of their findings and with their expert advice, the Judge David Radford was left to consider the new evidence. Judge David Radford, having considered all the evidence put forward by the QCs, said that the trial judge had presented a case against Mrs Maybrick based on Victorian attitudes to sexual scandal, and in his two-day summing up had blindsided the jury into giving a guilty verdict of murder by undermining her character. Therefore, in Radford's opinion the verdict was unsafe. Family After their mother's conviction and imprisonment, Maybrick's children James and Gladys Evelyn were taken in by a Dr. Charles Chinner Fuller and his wife Gertrude, and the younger James changed his name to Fuller. James Fuller became a mining engineer in British Columbia. In 1911, at the age of 29, while working at the Le Roi Gold Mine in Canada, he died after drinking cyanide, apparently thinking it was just a glass of water. His sister Gladys went to live in Ryde, Isle of Wight, with her uncle and aunt Michael and Laura (n√©e Withers) Maybrick before marrying Frederick James Corbyn in Hampstead, London, in 1912. She died in South Wales in 1971, where the couple lived in their later years.was he Jack The Ripper?. James Maybrick. Retrieved on 2011-08-27. James Maybrick's brother, Michael Maybrick, was a composer who published many pieces and songs under the name Stephen Adams. \\"Good Company\\" is one such example, but by far his best known work was the hymn \\"The Holy City\\". Jack the Ripper diary In 1992, a document presented as James Maybrick's diary surfaced, which claimed that he was Jack the Ripper. The diary's author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick's established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified. The diary was first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a pub. When this was queried, the story changed. Barrett's wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as The Diary of Jack the Ripper in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the \\"saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous.\\"Jack the Ripper ‚Äì The Ripper Diary: The Inside Story.

In Rendell's analysis, he was struck that the handwriting style seemed more 20th century than Victorian. He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies.

Forging History: The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents In January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate affidavits that he was \\"the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary.\\" Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett's solicitor's subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett's withdrawal of the repudiation. Some people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book's publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials \\"F.

Early bicycles of this style were known as safety bicycles because they were noted for, and marketed as, being safer than the high wheelers they were replacing. Even though modern bicycles use a similar design, the term is rarely used today and is considered obsolete. Definition The term 'safety bicycle' was used in the 1880s for any alternative to the penny-farthing. The front and rear wheel were not necessarily the same size. Later historians began to use the term in a more restricted way, for the design that was a direct ancestor to most modern bicycles. \\"Diamond frame\\" is also sometimes used as a term for safety bicycles, even though this technically only refers to a certain type of safety bicycle. The retronym \\"upright bicycle\\" is used to distinguish the style from recumbent bicycles. History Rover safety bicycle (right) The first bicycle to be called a \\"safety\\" was designed by the English engineer Harry John Lawson (Henry Lawson) in 1876, although other bicycles which fit the description had been developed earlier, such as by Thomas Humber in 1868. Unlike with penny-farthings, the rider's feet were within reach of the ground, making it easier to stop. The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider's feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson's safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing. One other variation that appeared at about the same time is the dwarf, exemplified by the Kangaroo, and with a chain-driven front wheel. By 1885, the safety bicycles cataloged in Henry Sturmey's Indispensable Handbook to the Safety Bicycle included seven with lever front-drives, 44 with geared front-drives, and only nine with chain rear-drives. In that same year, John Kemp Starley (J. K. Starley) came out with the first commercially successful safety bicycle he named the Rover. The first modern bicycle, it was heavier and more expensive than penny-farthings, but lighter and cheaper than tricycles of the day. In its original form it used indirect steering; later, direct steering was adopted and the bicycle proved to be a hit. Overman Victor bicycle of 1893 The Overman Wheel Company, founded 1882, was the first manufacturer of safety bicycles in the United States, in their factory complex in Chicopee, Massachusetts. Following their creation in England, Overman rushed a safety bicycle to production before the end of 1887.Herlihy, David (2004). Bicycle: The History (1st ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. pp. 214‚Äì245. Overman was known for making all-steel bicycles with no cast metal parts. The Overman Victor bicycle was said to be of higher quality and lower weight than other bicycles of its time. By 1893, the Overman factory made the complete bicycle, including tyres, saddles, rims, etc. The safety bicycle was a big improvement on the previous penny-farthing design which it replaced. The chain drive, coupling a large front sprocket (the chainring) to a small rear sprocket (the sprocket) to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, allowed for much smaller wheels, and replaced the need for the large, directly pedaled front wheel of the penny-farthing. The smaller wheel gave a harsher ride; once pneumatic tyres were developed and replaced the previously used solid ones, this disadvantage was no longer an issue. With the centre of mass low and between the wheels, rather than high and over the front hub, the safety bicycle greatly diminished the danger of \\"taking a header\\" or long fall over the handlebars. This made braking more effective and cycling, previously the reserve of spry, daring young men, safer, and therefore much more popular, especially for women. Compared with the tricycles of the time, popular with riders less willing to take risks, the safety bicycles were lighter, mechanically more simple, and less expensive. Its popularity soon grew to be more than the penny-farthings and tricycles combined, and caused the bike boom of the 1890s. Characteristics Safeties are now characterized by having two wheels of identicalor nearly identicalsize, and a chain-driven rear wheel. The most popular form of the safety bicycle frame, consisting of two triangles, is known as a diamond frame. A similar but different frame used in safety bicycles is the step-through frame. Despite the enormous variety of modern bicycles, recumbent bicycles are the only major variety of bicycle which do not use this same basic design.

British Museum: Animal style art is an approach to decoration found from China to Northern Europe in the early Iron Age, and the barbarian art of the Migration Period, characterized by its emphasis on animal motifs. The zoomorphic style of decoration was used to decorate small objects by warrior-herdsmen, whose economy was based on breeding and herding animals, supplemented by trade and plunder.Emma C.Bunker, Animal Style Art from East to West, Asia Society. p. 13 Animal art is a more general term for all art depicting animals. Eastern styles Fibula in the Form of a Recumbent Stag (below), about 400 AD, Northeastern Europe, and Stag Plaque (above), 400‚Äì500 BC, Scythian, western Asia, gold Scythian art makes great use of animal motifs, one component of the \\"Scythian triad\\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild animal art. The cultures referred to as Scythian-style included the Cimmerian and Sarmatian cultures in European Sarmatia and stretched across the Eurasian steppe north of the Near East to the Ordos culture of China. These cultures were extremely influential in spreading many local versions of the style. Steppe jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles bunched tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The \\"looped\\" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the reindeer, which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period. The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing. The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan totem. The most notable of these figures include the examples from: *the burial site of Kostromskaya in the Kuban dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage) *T√°pi√≥szentm√°rton in Hungary dating from the 5th century BC, now National Museum of Hungary, Budapest *Kul Oba in the Crimea dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).Loehr, Max, \\"The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East\\", Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America, Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, JSTOR Another characteristic form is the openwork plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.Farkas, Ann, \\"Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West\\", Artibus Asiae, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, , JSTOR Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts & personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins & belts, helped to act as armour. Bronze idol of a bear found in the Perm Krai, 6th or 7th century. The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess and powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes. A distinct Permian style of bronze or copper alloy objects from around the 5th‚Äì10th centuries AD are found near the Ural mountains and the Volga and Kama rivers in Russia.Ivanova, Vera, \\"Perm Animal Style\\", Russia.ic.com (23 June 2006), retrieved 23 March 2018 Germanic animal style The study of Germanic zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by Bernhard SalinBiography on swedish Wikipedia in a work published in 1904.Die altgermanische Thierornamentik, Stockholm 1904, The Open Library online text, written in German and heavily illustrated. Salin classified animal art from roughly 400 to 900 AD into three phases. The origins of these different phases remain the subject of debate; developing trends in late-Roman popular provincial art was an element, as were earlier traditions of the nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples. Styles I and II are found widely across Europe in the art of the \\"barbarian\\" peoples during the Migration Period. Style I. First appearing in northwest Europe, first expressed with the introduction of the chip carving technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.[https://blog.britishmuseum.org/decoding-anglo-saxon-art/ \\"Decoding Anglo-Saxon art\\", Rosie Weetch and Illustrator Craig Williams, British Museum blog, 28 May 2014 Style II. After about 560‚Äì570 Style I, declining, began to be supplanted. The animals of Style II are whole beasts, their bodies elongated into \\"ribbons\\" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretense of naturalism‚Äîrarely with legs‚Äîtending to be described as serpents, though heads often have characteristics of other animals. The animals become subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically interlace. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid (picture) from Sutton Hoo (c. 625). Eventually about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style.Rituals of power: from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages, By Frans Theuws, Janet L. Nelson, p. 45 Salin Style III is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called Viking art. Interlace, where it occurs, becomes less regular and more complex, and if not three- dimensional animals are usually seen in profile but twisted, exaggerated, surreal, with fragmented body parts filling every available space, creating an intense detailed energetic feel. Animals' bodies become hard for the unpractised viewer to read, and there is a very common motif of the \\"gripping beast\\" where an animal's mouth grips onto another element of the composition to connect two parts. Animal style was one component, along with Celtic art and late classical elements, in the formation of style of Insular art and Anglo-Saxon art in the British Isles, and through these routes and others on the Continent, left a considerable legacy in later Medieval art. Other names are sometimes used: in Anglo-Saxon art Kendrick preferred \\"Helmet\\" and \\"Ribbon\\" for Styles I and II.Hills Image:Bactria-Margiana, late 3rd - early 2nd BC figure.jpgShaft-hole Axe Head with Bird-Headed Demon, a Boar, and a Dragon figurine.

He was misunderstood, and 'cribbed, cabined, and confined' to such an extent as to largely prejudice him against the country which gave him birth\\".The Musical Times, vol. 45, no. 741, 1 November 1904, pp. 697‚Äì700 D'Albert was brought up in Glasgow and taught music by his father until he won a scholarship to the new National Training School for Music (forerunner of the Royal College of Music) in London, which he entered in 1876 at the age of 12. D'Albert studied at the National Training School with Ernst Pauer, Ebenezer Prout, John Stainer and Arthur Sullivan. By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from The Times as \\"a bravura player of no mean order\\" in a concert in October 1878. He played Schumann's Piano Concerto at the Crystal Palace in 1880, receiving more encouragement from The Times: \\"A finer rendering of the work has seldom been heard.\\"The Times 17 October 1878, p. 4The Times, 8 February 1881, p. 8 Also in 1880, d'Albert arranged the piano reduction for the vocal score of Sullivan's sacred music drama The Martyr of Antioch, to accompany the chorus in rehearsal.Information about The Martyr of Antioch He is also credited with writing, under Sullivan's direction, the overture to Gilbert and Sullivan's 1881 opera, Patience.Biographer Michael Ainger wrote that on the evening of 21 April 1881, \\"Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene d'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student ... and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year\\" (Ainger, p. 195). David Russell Hulme studied the handwriting in the manuscript score of Patience and confirmed that it is that of Eugene, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by biographer Arthur Jacobs), both of whose script Hulme sampled. (Hulme, David Russell, Doctoral Thesis The Operettas of Sir Arthur Sullivan: a study of available autograph full scores, 1985, University of Wales, pp. 242‚Äì43. The Thesis is available from academic libraries including The British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby W. Yorks, Ref # DX171353, and Northern Illinois University, Call# :ML410.S95 H841986B) For many years, d'Albert dismissed his training and work during this period as worthless.Mitchell, Mark and Allan Evans Extensive notes on d'Albert , Arbiter of Cultural Traditions website (2004) The Times wrote that he \\"was born and educated in England, and won his earliest successes in England, although, in a freak of boyish impetuosity, he repudiated some years ago all connexion with this country, where, according to his own account, he was born by mere accident and where he learnt nothing.\\"The Times, 25 May 1886, p. 10 In later years, however, he modified his views: \\"The former prejudice which I had against England, which several incidents aroused, has completely vanished since many years.\\" =Career= In 1881, Hans Richter invited d'Albert to play his first piano concerto, which was \\"received with enthusiasm\\". This seems to have been d'Albert's lost concerto in A major, not the work published three years later as his Piano Concerto No. 1 in B minor, Op. 2.Eastick, Martin. \\"Eugen d'Albert (1864‚Äì1932): Piano Concertos\\", Hyperion Records, sleeve notes to recording of d'Albert's piano concertos, 1994, accessed 25 July 2013 In the same year d'Albert won the Mendelssohn Scholarship, enabling him to study in Vienna, where he met Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt and other important musicians who influenced his style.Kennedy, Michael (ed.) \\" Albert, Eugen d'\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed., Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 October 2008 D'Albert, retaining his early enthusiasm for German culture and music (\\"hearing Tristan und Isolde had a greater influence on him than the education he received from his father or ... at the National Training School for Music\\") changed his first name from Eug√®ne to Eugen and emigrated to Germany, where he became a pupil of the elderly Liszt in Weimar.Macdonald, Hugh. \\"D'Albert, Eugen Francis Charles (1864‚Äì1932)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 11 October 2008 d'Albert and Hermine Finck in 1902 In Germany and Austria, d'Albert built a career as a pianist. Liszt called him \\"the second Tausig\\", and d'Albert can be heard in an early recording of Liszt works. He played his own piano concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1882, the youngest pianist who had appeared with the orchestra. D'Albert toured extensively, including in the United States from 1904 to 1905. His virtuoso technique was compared to that of Busoni.The Musical Times, vol. 102, no. 1422 (August 1961), pp. 489‚Äì90: Artur Schnabel said that if Busoni and d'Albert had been combined in one, the result would have been one of the greatest musicians of all times, \\"for d'Albert had all the raw material and Busoni all the refinement.\\" He was praised for his playing of J. S. Bach's preludes and fugues and of Beethoven's sonatas. \\"As an exponent of Beethoven, Eugen d'Albert has few, if any, equals.\\" Gradually, d'Albert's work as a composer occupied his time more and more, and he reduced his concert playing. He was the recipient of a number of dedications, most notably of Richard Strauss's Burleske in D minor, which he premiered in 1890. D'Albert was a prolific composer. His output includes a large volume of successful piano and chamber music and lieder. He also composed twenty-one operas, in a wide variety of styles, which premiered mostly in Germany. His first, Der Rubin (1893) was an oriental fantasy; Die Abreise (1898), which established him as an opera composer in Germany, was a one-act domestic comedy; Kain (1900) was a setting of the biblical story; and one of his last operas, Der Golem, was on a traditional Jewish theme.The Times obituary, 4 March 1932, p. 19 His most successful opera was his seventh, Tiefland, which premiered in Prague in 1903. When Thomas Beecham introduced the opera to London, The Times observed, \\"the scoring owes more than a little to the discipline of Sullivan; there is also a curiously English fragrance\\".The Times, 1 October 1910, p. 13 Tiefland played in opera houses throughout the world and has retained a place in the standard German and Austrian repertoire, with a production at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, in November 2007. According to biographer Hugh Macdonald, it \\"provides a link between Italian verismo and German expressionist opera, although the orchestral textures recall a more Wagnerian language.\\" Another stage success was a comic opera called Flauto solo in 1905. D'Albert's most successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. \\"Though not a composer of profound originality ... he had an unfailing sense of dramatic appropriateness and all the resources of a symphonic technique to give it expression and was thus able to achieve success in so many styles\\". D'Albert edited critical editions of the scores of Beethoven and Bach, transcribed Bach's organ works for the piano and wrote cadenzas for Beethoven's piano concertos. In 1907, he succeeded Joseph Joachim as director of the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin, in which capacity he had a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of Kapellmeister to the Court of Weimar. =Personal life and death= Grave of d'Albert at the cemetery of Morcote D'Albert's friends included Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Engelbert Humperdinck, Ignatz Waghalter and Gerhart Hauptmann, the dramatist. He was married six times and had eight children. The first wife was Louise Salingr√©. The second, from 1892 to 1895, was the Venezuelan pianist, singer and composer Teresa Carre√±o, herself much married and considerably older than d'Albert. D'Albert and Carre√±o were the subject of a famous joke: \\"Come quick! Your children and my children are quarrelling again with our children!\\"see, e.g., The line, however, has also been attributed to others. His later wives were soprano Hermine Finck, who originated the role of the witch in Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel; actress Ida Fulda; Friederike (\\"Fritzi\\") Jauner; and Hilde Fels. His last companion was a mistress, Virginia Zanetti. In 1914, d'Albert moved to Zurich and became a Swiss citizen. He died in 1932 at the age of 67 in Riga, Latvia, where he had travelled for a divorce from his sixth wife. In the weeks preceding his death, d'Albert was the subject of attacks by the press in Riga concerning his personal life.Waghalter, Ignatz. Aus dem Ghetto in der Freiheit (Marienbad, Czechoslovakia, 1936) D'Albert was buried in the cemetery overlooking Lake Lugano in Morcote, Switzerland.

A simpler amendment (one letter instead of two) would lead to *Duronovaria, making this place one of up to 18 ancient British names that contain Duro- and mostly occur at river crossings, while -novaria has two possible ancient parallels in Britain associated with river junctions. That analysis would perfectly fit the geographical situation of Dorchester. Romans at Maiden Castle Maiden Castle in October 1937. Photograph by Major George Allen (1891‚Äì1940). The pre-Roman population centre in the area appears to have been at the hill fort of Maiden Castle, southwest of the town centre. The inhabitants appear to have resisted the Roman invasion and their war cemetery was excavated in the 1930s by Mortimer Wheeler. It later became the site of a 4th-century Romano-British temple. Roman Dorchester The site of present-day Dorchester may have originally been a small garrison fort for the Legio II Augusta established shortly after the Roman conquest. When the military moved away, around AD 70, Durnovaria became a civilian settlement, apparently\\"The fact is nowhere attested\\", C. E. Stevens noted in 1937, adding that Ptolemy, perhaps using a lost pre-occupation source, gives Durium (Geography ii.3.13) as the one town of the Durotriges,; see Stevens, \\"Gildas and the Civitates of Britain\\" The English Historical Review 52 No. 206 (April 1937:193-203) pp 202-03, note 3. the civitas Durotrigum of the tribal confederacy of the Durotriges. Shafts were dug to deposit ritual foundation items.Sampled shafts in Greyhound Yard, Dorchester, in advance of rebuilding, published by Woodward et al., 1993, were reidentified as on-going ritual deposits, notably of sacrificed puppies and black carrion birds‚Äî crows, ravens and jackdaws‚Äî summarised by Peter Woodward and Ann Woodward, \\"Dedicating the Town: Urban Foundation Deposits in Roman Britain\\" World Archaeology 36.1 (March 2004:68-86) and compared with other Romano-British sites. An organised street plan was laid out, ignoring earlier boundaries, the streets lined with timber-slot structures; public buildings including thermae were erected and an artificial water supply established.Details are in R.J.C. Smith, Excavations at County Hall, Dorchester, Dorset, 1988, in the North-West Quarter of Durnovaria, (Wessex Archaeology Report 4) Salisbury 1993. The town seems to have become one of twin capitals for the local Durotriges tribe. It was an important local market centre, particularly for Purbeck marble, shale and the pottery industries from Poole Harbour and the New Forest. The town remained small, around the central and southern areas of the present settlement, until expansion to the north- west, around Colliton Park, in the 2nd century. By the middle of this century, the town defences were added and Maumbury Rings, a neolithic henge monument, was converted for use as an amphitheatre. The third century saw the first replacement of timber buildings with stone ones, an unexpectedly late development in an area with several good sources of building stone.Remarked upon by J. H. Williams, \\"Roman Building-Materials in South-East England\\" Britannia 2 (1971:166-195) p. 170; he noted the quarries of Purbeck Limestone, Lias limestone and Hamstone from Ham Hill. There were many fine homes for rich families and their excavated mosaic floors suggest a mosaic school of art had a workshop in the town, members of which seem to have travelled in the area to execute mosaic floors in villas away from Durnovaria itself.D. J. Smith, \\"The mosaic pavements\\", in A.L.F. Rivet, ed., The Roman Villa in Britain (1969:71-125). A large late-Roman and Christian cemetery has been excavated at Poundbury just to the west of the town, but little is known of Durnovaria's decline after the departure of the Roman administration. The name, however, survived to become the Anglo-Saxon Dornwaraceaster and modern 'Dorchester'. Extant remains Roman town house ruins The town still has some Roman features, including part of the town walls and the foundations of a Roman town house, which are freely accessible near County Hall. There are many Roman finds in the County Museum. The Romans built an aqueduct to supply the town with water, traces remain at nearby Whitfield Farm and approaching Poundbury tunnel on the Dorchester - Yeovil railway. Near the town centre is Maumbury Rings, an ancient British earthwork converted by the Romans for use as an amphitheatre, and to the north west is Poundbury Hill, another pre-Roman fortification. There is little evidence to show whether or not Durnovaria survived into the post-Roman era: Gildas' record of a tradition, given in De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae iii, of twenty-eight cities and sundry castles of former happy times was not provided with any names. Surviving northern boundaries of the administrative region, or civitas that included Dorset, reached as far as Selwood, and mark the county division between Somerset and Wiltshire to this day.Bruce Eagles, \\"Britons and Saxons on the Eastern Boundary of the Civitas Durotrigum\\" Britannia 35' (2004:234-240) passim traces clues of identifiable former tribal arrangements reflected in the eastern Roman and post-Roman boundary. In the sub-Roman period, as urban centres were progressively abandoned, the centres of administration and justice, such as they were, generally removed to fortified strongholds. The city's site is attested as Dornwaraceaster in the ninth century, elided to produce Dornaceaster, first recorded in 937.Anton F√§gersten, Place-Names in Dorset (Uppsala) 1933:1-2, noted by F. M.

Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders), rolling (some beetles and spiders) or riding other animals (phoresis). Animals move for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a suitable microhabitat, or to escape predators. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the Arctic tern) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non- migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion. The anatomical structures that animals use for movement, including cilia, legs, wings, arms, fins, or tails are sometimes referred to as locomotory organs or locomotory structures. Etymology The term \\"locomotion\\" is formed in English from Latin loco \\"from a place\\" (ablative of locus \\"place\\") + motio \\"motion, a moving\\". Locomotion in different media Animals move through, or on, four types of environment: aquatic (in or on water), terrestrial (on ground or other surface, including arboreal, or tree-dwelling), fossorial (underground), and aerial (in the air). Many animals‚Äîfor example semi-aquatic animals, and diving birds‚Äîregularly move through more than one type of medium. In some cases, the surface they move on facilitates their method of locomotion. Aquatic =Swimming= Dolphins surfing In water, staying afloat is possible using buoyancy. If an animal's body is less dense than water, it can stay afloat. This requires little energy to maintain a vertical position, but requires more energy for locomotion in the horizontal plane compared to less buoyant animals. The drag encountered in water is much greater than in air. Morphology is therefore important for efficient locomotion, which is in most cases essential for basic functions such as catching prey. A fusiform, torpedo-like body form is seen in many aquatic animals, though the mechanisms they use for locomotion are diverse. The primary means by which fish generate thrust is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large tail fin. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from pectoral fins (or front limbs in marine mammals). Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) and batiform fish (electric rays, sawfishes, guitarfishes, skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed labriform swimming. Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction. Other animals, e.g. penguins, diving ducks, move underwater in a manner which has been termed \\"aquatic flying\\". Some fish propel themselves without a wave motion of the body, as in the slow-moving seahorses and Gymnotus. Other animals, such as cephalopods, use jet propulsion to travel fast, taking in water then squirting it back out in an explosive burst. Other swimming animals may rely predominantly on their limbs, much as humans do when swimming. Though life on land originated from the seas, terrestrial animals have returned to an aquatic lifestyle on several occasions, such as the fully aquatic cetaceans, now very distinct from their terrestrial ancestors. Dolphins sometimes ride on the bow waves created by boats or surf on naturally breaking waves. =Benthic= Scallop in jumping motion; these bivalves can also swim. Benthic locomotion is movement by animals that live on, in, or near the bottom of aquatic environments. In the sea, many animals walk over the seabed. Echinoderms primarily use their tube feet to move about. The tube feet typically have a tip shaped like a suction pad that can create a vacuum through contraction of muscles. This, along with some stickiness from the secretion of mucus, provides adhesion. Waves of tube feet contractions and relaxations move along the adherent surface and the animal moves slowly along. Some sea urchins also use their spines for benthic locomotion. Crabs typically walk sideways (a behaviour that gives us the word crabwise). This is because of the articulation of the legs, which makes a sidelong gait more efficient. However, some crabs walk forwards or backwards, including raninids, Libinia emarginata and Mictyris platycheles. Some crabs, notably the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming, the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles. A stomatopod, Nannosquilla decemspinosa, can escape by rolling itself into a self-propelled wheel and somersault backwards at a speed of 72 rpm. They can travel more than 2 m using this unusual method of locomotion. Aquatic surface Velella moves by sailing. Velella, the by-the- wind sailor, is a cnidarian with no means of propulsion other than sailing. A small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. Velella sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind. While larger animals such as ducks can move on water by floating, some small animals move across it without breaking through the surface. This surface locomotion takes advantage of the surface tension of water. Animals that move in such a way include the water strider. Water striders have legs that are hydrophobic, preventing them from interfering with the structure of water. Another form of locomotion (in which the surface layer is broken) is used by the basilisk lizard. Aerial =Active flight= brimstone butterflies in flight. The female, above, is in fast forward flight with a small angle of attack; the male, below, is twisting his wings sharply upward to gain lift and fly up towards the female. Gravity is the primary obstacle to flight. Because it is impossible for any organism to have a density as low as that of air, flying animals must generate enough lift to ascend and remain airborne. One way to achieve this is with wings, which when moved through the air generate an upward lift force on the animal's body. Flying animals must be very light to achieve flight, the largest living flying animals being birds of around 20 kilograms. Other structural adaptations of flying animals include reduced and redistributed body weight, fusiform shape and powerful flight muscles; there may also be physiological adaptations. Active flight has independently evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Insects were the first taxon to evolve flight, approximately 400 million years ago (mya), followed by pterosaurs approximately 220 mya,https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12007/1/zitteliana_2008_b28_05.pdf birds approximately 160 mya, then bats about 60 mya. =Gliding= Rather than active flight, some (semi-) arboreal animals reduce their rate of falling by gliding. Gliding is heavier-than-air flight without the use of thrust; the term \\"volplaning\\" also refers to this mode of flight in animals.volplane. The Free Dictionary. This mode of flight involves flying a greater distance horizontally than vertically and therefore can be distinguished from a simple descent like a parachute. Gliding has evolved on more occasions than active flight. There are examples of gliding animals in several major taxonomic classes such as the invertebrates (e.g., gliding ants), reptiles (e.g., banded flying snake), amphibians (e.g., flying frog), mammals (e.g., sugar glider, squirrel glider). Flying fish taking off Some aquatic animals also regularly use gliding, for example, flying fish, octopus and squid. The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 meters (160 ft),Ross Piper (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to .Flying Fish, Exocoetidae National Geographic. Retrieved 10 August 2014. To glide upward out of the water, a flying fish moves its tail up to 70 times per second. Several oceanic squid, such as the Pacific flying squid, leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of flying fish. Smaller squids fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as 50 m. Small fins towards the back of the mantle help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet-propelled aerial locomotion. The neon flying squid has been observed to glide for distances over 30 m, at speeds of up to 11.2 m/s. =Soaring= Soaring birds can maintain flight without wing flapping, using rising air currents. Many gliding birds are able to \\"lock\\" their extended wings by means of a specialized tendon. Soaring birds may alternate glides with periods of soaring in rising air. Five principal types of lift are used: thermals, ridge lift, lee waves, convergences and dynamic soaring. Examples of soaring flight by birds are the use of: *Thermals and convergences by raptors such as vultures *Ridge lift by gulls near cliffs *Wave lift by migrating birds[Report of use of wave lift by birds by Netherlands Institute for Ecology] *Dynamic effects near the surface of the sea by albatrosses =Ballooning= Ballooning is a method of locomotion used by spiders. Certain silk-producing arthropods, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight gossamer silk for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude.Heinrichs, Ann R. (2004) \\"Spiders\\". Compass Point Books, Primary School : Nature's Friends series; Minneapolis, Minn. . She observes that the so-called ballooning is like a kite Terrestrial Pacific leaping blenny Alticus arnoldorum hopping Pacific leaping blenny climbing up a vertical piece of Plexiglas Forms of locomotion on land include walking, running, hopping or jumping, dragging and crawling or slithering. Here friction and buoyancy are no longer an issue, but a strong skeletal and muscular framework are required in most terrestrial animals for structural support. Each step also requires much energy to overcome inertia, and animals can store elastic potential energy in their tendons to help overcome this. Balance is also required for movement on land. Human infants learn to crawl first before they are able to stand on two feet, which requires good coordination as well as physical development. Humans are bipedal animals, standing on two feet and keeping one on the ground at all times while walking. When running, only one foot is on the ground at any one time at most, and both leave the ground briefly. At higher speeds momentum helps keep the body upright, so more energy can be used in movement. =Jumping= Gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in mid-leap Jumping (saltation) can be distinguished from running, galloping, and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. Many terrestrial animals use jumping (including hopping or leaping) to escape predators or catch prey‚Äîhowever, relatively few animals use this as a primary mode of locomotion. Those that do include the kangaroo and other macropods, rabbit, hare, jerboa, hopping mouse, and kangaroo rat. Kangaroo rats often leap 2 m and reportedly up to 2.75 m at speeds up to almost . They can quickly change their direction between jumps. The rapid locomotion of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat may minimize energy cost and predation risk. Its use of a \\"move-freeze\\" mode may also make it less conspicuous to nocturnal predators. Frogs are, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates. The Australian rocket frog, Litoria nasuta, can leap over , more than fifty times its body length. Leech moving by looping using its front and back suckers =Peristalsis and looping= Other animals move in terrestrial habitats without the aid of legs. Earthworms crawl by a peristalsis, the same rhythmic contractions that propel food through the digestive tract. Leech moving on a flat surface Leeches and geometer moth caterpillars move by looping or inching (measuring off a length with each movement), using their paired circular and longitudinal muscles (as for peristalsis) along with the ability to attach to a surface at both anterior and posterior ends. One end is attached and the other end is projected forward peristaltically until it touches down, as far as it can reach; then the first end is released, pulled forward, and reattached; and the cycle repeats. In the case of leeches, attachment is by a sucker at each end of the body. =Sliding= Due to its low coefficient of friction, ice provides the opportunity for other modes of locomotion. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called tobogganing, which conserves energy while moving quickly. Some pinnipeds perform a similar behaviour called sledding. =Climbing= Some animals are specialized for moving on non-horizontal surfaces. One common habitat for such climbing animals is in trees; for example, the gibbon is specialized for arboreal movement, travelling rapidly by brachiation (see below). Others living on rock faces such as in mountains move on steep or even near-vertical surfaces by careful balancing and leaping. Perhaps the most exceptional are the various types of mountain-dwelling caprids (e.g., Barbary sheep, yak, ibex, rocky mountain goat, etc.), whose adaptations can include a soft rubbery pad between their hooves for grip, hooves with sharp keratin rims for lodging in small footholds, and prominent dew claws. Another case is the snow leopard, which being a predator of such caprids also has spectacular balance and leaping abilities, such as ability to leap up to 17m (50ft). Some light animals are able to climb up smooth sheer surfaces or hang upside down by adhesion using suckers. Many insects can do this, though much larger animals such as geckos can also perform similar feats. =Walking and running= Species have different numbers of legs resulting in large differences in locomotion. Modern birds, though classified as tetrapods, usually have only two functional legs, which some (e.g., ostrich, emu, kiwi) use as their primary, Bipedal, mode of locomotion. A few modern mammalian species are habitual bipeds, i.e., whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. These include the macropods, kangaroo rats and mice, springhare, hopping mice, pangolins and homininan apes. Bipedalism is rarely found outside terrestrial animals‚Äîthough at least two types of octopus walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, so they can use the remaining arms to camouflage themselves as a mat of algae or floating coconut. There are no three-legged animals‚Äîthough some macropods, such as kangaroos, that alternate between resting their weight on their muscular tails and their two hind legs could be looked at as an example of tripedal locomotion in animals. Animation of a Devonian tetrapod Many familiar animals are quadrupedal, walking or running on four legs. A few birds use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances. For example, the shoebill sometimes uses its wings to right itself after lunging at prey. The newly hatched hoatzin bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings are strong enough for sustained flight. These claws are gone by the time the bird reaches adulthood. A relatively few animals use five limbs for locomotion. Prehensile quadrupeds may use their tail to assist in locomotion and when grazing, the kangaroos and other macropods use their tail to propel themselves forward with the four legs used to maintain balance. Insects generally walk with six legs‚Äîthough some insects such as nymphalid butterflies do not use the front legs for walking. Arachnids have eight legs. Most arachnids lack extensor muscles in the distal joints of their appendages. Spiders and whipscorpions extend their limbs hydraulically using the pressure of their hemolymph. Solifuges and some harvestmen extend their knees by the use of highly elastic thickenings in the joint cuticle. Scorpions, pseudoscorpions and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once. The scorpion Hadrurus arizonensis walks by using two groups of legs (left 1, right 2, Left 3, Right 4 and Right 1, Left 2, Right 3, Left 4) in a reciprocating fashion. This alternating tetrapod coordination is used over all walking speeds. Centipedes and millipedes have many sets of legs that move in metachronal rhythm. Some echinoderms locomote using the many tube feet on the underside of their arms. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction. Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some multi- armed, fast-moving starfish such as the sunflower seastar (Pycnopodia helianthoides) pull themselves along with some of their arms while letting others trail behind. Other starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving, which exposes the sensory tube feet and eyespot to external stimuli. Most starfish cannot move quickly, a typical speed being that of the leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), which can manage just in a minute. Some burrowing species from the genera Astropecten and Luidia have points rather than suckers on their long tube feet and are capable of much more rapid motion, \\"gliding\\" across the ocean floor. The sand star (Luidia foliolata) can travel at a speed of per minute. Sunflower starfish are quick, efficient hunters, moving at a speed of using 15,000 tube feet. Many animals temporarily change the number of legs they use for locomotion in different circumstances. For example, many quadrupedal animals switch to bipedalism to reach low-level browse on trees. The genus of Basiliscus are arboreal lizards that usually use quadrupedalism in the trees. When frightened, they can drop to water below and run across the surface on their hind limbs at about 1.5 m/s for a distance of approximately before they sink to all fours and swim. They can also sustain themselves on all fours while \\"water-walking\\" to increase the distance travelled above the surface by about 1.3 m. When cockroaches run rapidly, they rear up on their two hind legs like bipedal humans; this allows them to run at speeds up to 50 body lengths per second, equivalent to a \\"couple hundred miles per hour, if you scale up to the size of humans.\\" When grazing, kangaroos use a form of pentapedalism (four legs plus the tail) but switch to hopping (bipedalism) when they wish to move at a greater speed.

This behaviour is different than other huntsman spiders, such as Carparachne aureoflava from the Namib Desert, which uses passive cartwheeling as a form of locomotion. The flic-flac spider can reach speeds of up to 2 m/s using forward or back flips to evade threats. Subterranean Some animals move through solids such as soil by burrowing using peristalsis, as in earthworms, or other methods. In loose solids such as sand some animals, such as the golden mole, marsupial mole, and the pink fairy armadillo, are able to move more rapidly, \\"swimming\\" through the loose substrate. Burrowing animals include moles, ground squirrels, naked mole-rats, tilefish, and mole crickets. Arboreal locomotion A brachiating gibbon Arboreal locomotion is the locomotion of animals in trees. Some animals may only scale trees occasionally, while others are exclusively arboreal. These habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them, leading to a variety of anatomical, behavioural and ecological consequences as well as variations throughout different species. Furthermore, many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or mountains. The earliest known tetrapod with specializations that adapted it for climbing trees was Suminia, a synapsid of the late Permian, about 260 million years ago. Some invertebrate animals are exclusively arboreal in habitat, for example, the tree snail. Brachiation (from brachium, Latin for \\"arm\\") is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Some New World monkeys such as spider monkeys and muriquis are \\"semibrachiators\\" and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand. Energetics Animal locomotion requires energy to overcome various forces including friction, drag, inertia and gravity, although the influence of these depends on the circumstances. In terrestrial environments, gravity must be overcome whereas the drag of air has little influence. In aqueous environments, friction (or drag) becomes the major energetic challenge with gravity being less of an influence. Remaining in the aqueous environment, animals with natural buoyancy expend little energy to maintain a vertical position in a water column. Others naturally sink, and must spend energy to remain afloat. Drag is also an energetic influence in flight, and the aerodynamically efficient body shapes of flying birds indicate how they have evolved to cope with this. Limbless organisms moving on land must energetically overcome surface friction, however, they do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity. Newton's third law of motion is widely used in the study of animal locomotion: if at rest, to move forwards an animal must push something backwards. Terrestrial animals must push the solid ground, swimming and flying animals must push against a fluid (either water or air). The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement. The energetics of locomotion involves the energy expenditure by animals in moving. Energy consumed in locomotion is not available for other efforts, so animals typically have evolved to use the minimum energy possible during movement. However, in the case of certain behaviors, such as locomotion to escape a predator, performance (such as speed or maneuverability) is more crucial, and such movements may be energetically expensive. Furthermore, animals may use energetically expensive methods of locomotion when environmental conditions (such as being within a burrow) preclude other modes. The most common metric of energy use during locomotion is the net (also termed \\"incremental\\") cost of transport, defined as the amount of energy (e.g., Joules) needed above baseline metabolic rate to move a given distance. For aerobic locomotion, most animals have a nearly constant cost of transport‚Äîmoving a given distance requires the same caloric expenditure, regardless of speed. This constancy is usually accomplished by changes in gait. The net cost of transport of swimming is lowest, followed by flight, with terrestrial limbed locomotion being the most expensive per unit distance. However, because of the speeds involved, flight requires the most energy per unit time. This does not mean that an animal that normally moves by running would be a more efficient swimmer; however, these comparisons assume an animal is specialized for that form of motion. Another consideration here is body mass--heavier animals, though using more total energy, require less energy per unit mass to move. Physiologists generally measure energy use by the amount of oxygen consumed, or the amount of carbon dioxide produced, in an animal's respiration. In terrestrial animals, the cost of transport is typically measured while they walk or run on a motorized treadmill, either wearing a mask to capture gas exchange or with the entire treadmill enclosed in a metabolic chamber. For small rodents, such as deer mice, the cost of transport has also been measured during voluntary wheel running. Energetics is important for explaining the evolution of foraging economic decisions in organisms; for example, a study of the African honey bee, A. m. scutellata, has shown that honey bees may trade the high sucrose content of viscous nectar off for the energetic benefits of warmer, less concentrated nectar, which also reduces their consumption and flight time. Passive locomotion Passive locomotion in animals is a type of mobility in which the animal depends on their environment for transportation; such animals are vagile but not motile. =Hydrozoans= Physalia physalis The Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis) lives at the surface of the ocean. The gas-filled bladder, or pneumatophore (sometimes called a \\"sail\\"), remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. Because the Portuguese man o' war has no means of propulsion, it is moved by a combination of winds, currents, and tides. The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge. =Arachnids= The wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) is a huntsman spider approximately 20 mm in size and native to the Namib Desert of Southern Africa. The spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second. If the spider is on a sloped dune, its rolling speed may be 1 metre per second. A spider (usually limited to individuals of a small species), or spiderling after hatching, climbs as high as it can, stands on raised legs with its abdomen pointed upwards (\\"tiptoeing\\"), and then releases several silk threads from its spinnerets into the air. These form a triangle-shaped parachute that carries the spider on updrafts of winds, where even the slightest breeze transports it. The Earth's static electric field may also provide lift in windless conditions. =Insects= The larva of Cicindela dorsalis, the eastern beach tiger beetle, is notable for its ability to leap into the air, loop its body into a rotating wheel and roll along the sand at a high speed using wind to propel itself. If the wind is strong enough, the larva can cover up to in this manner. This remarkable ability may have evolved to help the larva escape predators such as the thynnid wasp Methocha. Members of the largest subfamily of cuckoo wasps, Chrysidinae, are generally kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva while it is still young. Chrysidines are distinguished from the members of other subfamilies in that most have flattened or concave lower abdomens and can curl into a defensive ball when attacked by a potential host, a process known as conglobation. Protected by hard chitin in this position, they are expelled from the nest without injury and can search for a less hostile host. Fleas can jump vertically up to 18 cm and horizontally up to 33 cm; however, although this form of locomotion is initiated by the flea, it has little control of the jump‚Äîthey always jump in the same direction, with very little variation in the trajectory between individual jumps. =Crustaceans= Although stomatopods typically display the standard locomotion types as seen in true shrimp and lobsters, one species, Nannosquilla decemspinosa, has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, N. decemspinosa is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for locomotion when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. N. decemspinosa has been observed to roll repeatedly for , but they typically travel less than . Again, the animal initiates the movement but has little control during its locomotion. =Animal transport= Some animals change location because they are attached to, or reside on, another animal or moving structure. This is arguably more accurately termed \\"animal transport\\". Remoras Some remoras, such as this Echeneis naucrates, may attach themselves to scuba divers. Remoras are a family (Echeneidae) of ray-finned fish. They grow to long, and their distinctive first dorsal fins take the form of a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals. By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion. When the remora reaches about , the disc is fully formed and the remora can then attach to other animals. The remora's lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and the animal lacks a swim bladder. Some remoras associate primarily with specific host species. They are commonly found attached to sharks, manta rays, whales, turtles, and dugongs. Smaller remoras also fasten onto fish such as tuna and swordfish, and some small remoras travel in the mouths or gills of large manta rays, ocean sunfish, swordfish, and sailfish. The remora benefits by using the host as transport and protection, and also feeds on materials dropped by the host. Angler fish In some species of anglerfish, when a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule. Parasites Many parasites are transported by their hosts. For example, endoparasites such as tapeworms live in the alimentary tracts of other animals, and depend on the host's ability to move to distribute their eggs. Ectoparasites such as fleas can move around on the body of their host, but are transported much longer distances by the host's locomotion. Some ectoparasites such as lice can opportunistically hitch a ride on a fly (phoresis) and attempt to find a new host. Changes between media Some animals locomote between different media, e.g., from aquatic to aerial. This often requires different modes of locomotion in the different media and may require a distinct transitional locomotor behaviour. There are a large number of semi- aquatic animals (animals that spend part of their life cycle in water, or generally have part of their anatomy underwater). These represent the major taxa of mammals (e.g., beaver, otter, polar bear), birds (e.g., penguins, ducks), reptiles (e.g., anaconda, bog turtle, marine iguana) and amphibians (e.g., salamanders, frogs, newts). =Fish= Some fish use multiple modes of locomotion. Walking fish may swim freely or at other times \\"walk\\" along the ocean or river floor, but not on land (e.g., the flying gurnard‚Äîwhich does not actually fly‚Äîand batfishes of the family Ogcocephalidae). Amphibious fish, are fish that are able to leave water for extended periods of time. These fish use a range of terrestrial locomotory modes, such as lateral undulation, tripod- like walking (using paired fins and tail), and jumping. Many of these locomotory modes incorporate multiple combinations of pectoral, pelvic and tail fin movement. Examples include eels, mudskippers and the walking catfish. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defence mechanism to evade predators. The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 m, though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to . They can travel at speeds of more than . Maximum altitude is above the surface of the sea. Some accounts have them landing on ships' decks. =Marine mammals= Pacific white-sided dolphins porpoising When swimming, several marine mammals such as dolphins, porpoises and pinnipeds, frequently leap above the water surface whilst maintaining horizontal locomotion. This is done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save dolphins and porpoises energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as \\"porpoising\\". Other reasons for dolphins and porpoises performing porpoising include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites. In pinnipeds, two types of porpoising have been identified. \\"High porpoising\\" is most often near (within 100 m) the shore and is often followed by minor course changes; this may help seals get their bearings on beaching or rafting sites. \\"Low porpoising\\" is typically observed relatively far (more than 100 m) from shore and often aborted in favour of anti-predator movements; this may be a way for seals to maximize sub-surface vigilance and thereby reduce their vulnerability to sharks Some whales raise their (entire) body vertically out of the water in a behaviour known as \\"breaching\\". =Birds= Some semi-aquatic birds use terrestrial locomotion, surface swimming, underwater swimming and flying (e.g., ducks, swans). Diving birds also use diving locomotion (e.g., dippers, auks). Some birds (e.g., ratites) have lost the primary locomotion of flight. The largest of these, ostriches, when being pursued by a predator, have been known to reach speeds over , and can maintain a steady speed of , which makes the ostrich the world's fastest two-legged animal: Ostriches can also locomote by swimming. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called tobogganing, which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain. To get onto land, penguins sometimes propel themselves upwards at a great speed to leap out the water. Changes during the life-cycle An animal's mode of locomotion may change considerably during its life-cycle. Barnacles are exclusively marine and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters. They have two nektonic (active swimming) larval stages, but as adults, they are sessile (non-motile) suspension feeders. Frequently, adults are found attached to moving objects such as whales and ships, and are thereby transported (passive locomotion) around the oceans. Function Paddlefish ram suspension-feeding zooplankton in aquarium Animals locomote for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a suitable microhabitat, or to escape predators. =Food procurement= Animals use locomotion in a wide variety of ways to procure food. Terrestrial methods include ambush predation, social predation and grazing. Aquatic methods include filterfeeding, grazing, ram feeding, suction feeding, protrusion and pivot feeding. Other methods include parasitism and parasitoidism.  Quantifying body and limb movement  The study of animal locomotion is a branch of biology that investigates and quantifies how animals move. It is an application of kinematics, used to understand how the movements of animal limbs relate to the motion of the whole animal, for instance when walking or flying.

The chandeliers in the hall can clearly be seen. The Symphony No. 96 in D major, Hoboken I/96, was completed by Joseph Haydn in 1791 as part of the set of symphonies composed on his first trip to London. It was first performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 11 March 1791. Although it is the fourth of the twelve London symphonies (numbers 93‚Äì104) by number, it was actually the first one written and performed.A. Peter Brown, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2) (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 2002) (), pp. 243‚Äì45 (2002). It is popularly known as the Miracle Symphony.  Nickname (The Miracle)  Symphony No. 96 has been called the Miracle symphony due to the story that, during its premiere, a chandelier fell from the ceiling of the concert hall in which it was performed. The audience managed to dodge the chandelier successfully as they had all crowded to the front for the post-performance applause, and the symphony got its nickname from this. More careful and recent research suggests that this event actually took place during the premiere of his Symphony No. 102.Michael Steinberg, The Symphony: A Listeners Guide (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). pp. 239‚Äì41.  Movements  The work is in standard four movement form and scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. #Adagio, ‚Äì Allegro, #Andante, in G major #Menuetto: Allegretto, #Finale: Vivace, The first movement is in sonata form. Following a slow introduction, the first theme of the exposition is actually two overlapping themes, a short‚Äìshort‚Äìshort‚Äìlong repeated-note theme in the first violins over a falling motif in the middle strings and bassoons. Following a brief transitional section, the first theme returns giving the opening section a ternary structure.A. Peter Brown, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2) (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 2002) (), pp. 245‚Äì50 (2002). The first theme group closes with fanfares featuring repeated notes. What follows is a more extended transition featuring three repeated eighth-notes as in the opening of the Allegro. There is no true second theme group making this a three-key exposition (P-T-K exposition). The expositional coda also features motifs containing three eighth notes. The development can be divided into three sections. The first section develops the exposition's first theme and the second develops themes from the expositional coda. Both of these sections touch on the relative minor, B minor. Following a two-measure grand pause, the third section opens with a false recapitulation of the exposition in the wrong key of G major which quickly collapses into more development of the first theme. When the recapitulation arrives, it proceeds quickly. Following another transition, the fanfares from the first theme group return building up to an unexpected stormy climax in D minor leaving just seven measures of D major to bring the movement to a close. The slow movement in G major is in ternary form (ABA) featuring a lightly scored, lilting theme with three upbeats.Daniel Heartz, Mozart, Haydn and Early Beethoven 1781‚Äì1802 (New York: W. W. Norton, 2009), pp. 444‚Äì447. . The central \\"B\\" section of the movement is for full tutti in G minor and is highly contrapuntal. The second \\"A\\" section finishes suspended on a cadential six- four chord. The following coda is indeed an orchestral cadenza featuring solos from the two principal violinists (including Salomon) and solos from the principal winds as well. The trio of the minuet features an extended oboe solo. The finale is a five-part rondo form (ABACA), although it does include some elements of sonata form, implying that it could be a hybrid of both forms. The principal A section is primarily for the strings but are joined by the woodwinds in other areas. The B section revolves around D minor, while the C section features a short modulation to A major, thus showing a similarity to sonata form as mentioned above. Rhythmic patterns from both sections are referenced in the movement's coda.

Meaning 'a consideration of death', the word is derived from the Greek 'thanatos' (death) and 'opsis' (view, sight). Background A painting of William Cullen Bryant from 1878 William Cullen Bryant was born in 1794 in Cummington, Massachusetts. Bryant grew up in a Puritan home with his father, Peter Bryant, a prominent doctor. William Cullen Bryant's early education came from his father. In his early life Bryant would spend a great deal of time in the woods surrounding his family's New England home, and read of the extensive personal library his father had. Bryant's first published poem was \\"The Embargo; or, Sketches of the Times\\", a satirical work concerning Thomas Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807. It was released in a Boston newspaper in 1808. In 1810 Bryant was forced to leave Williams College for lack of money. Instead of a formal education, he started studying law, and began learning an eclectic mix of poetry, such as the works of Isaac Watts and Henry Kirke White, and verses like William Cowper's \\"The Task\\" and Edmund Spenser's \\"The Faerie Queene\\". When and where Bryant wrote \\"Thanatopsis\\" is unclear, and Bryant himself could not remember when he wrote the verse. According to Parke Godwin, Bryant's friend, Bryant wrote the poem when he was seventeen years old in mid-1811, just after he had left Williams College. In History of American Literature, two dates are stated for the authoring of \\"Thanatopsis\\", 1811 and 1816. Bryant's inspiration for \\"Thanatopsis\\" came after reading William Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads, as well as Robert Blair's \\"The Grave\\", Beilby Porteus's \\"Death\\" and Kirke White's \\"Time\\". After Bryant had left Cummington to begin his law studies, his father discovered a manuscript in Bryant's desk drawer, that contained \\"Thanatopsis\\" and a fragment of a poem, which would be published under the title \\"The Fragment\\",\\"The Fragment\\" in North American Review, September 1817 and later titled \\"An Inscription upon the Entrance to a Wood\\". He sent the two poems without his son's knowledge to the editors at the North American Review, where they were published in September 1817.\\"Thanatopsis\\" in North American Review, September 1817 The editors added an introduction to Thanatopsis in a completely different style. The part written by the author begins with \\"Yet a few days,\\". The author republished the poem in 1821 in a collection of works called Poems. He replaced the introductory section, made a few minor changes to the text and added more material after the original end of the poem, which was \\"and make their bed with thee!\\". Below is the revised version of 1821 which was retained in all later publications of the poem: Thanatopsis To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And healing sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;‚Äî Go forth, under the open sky, and list To Nature‚Äôs teachings, while from all around Earth and her waters, and the depths of air‚Äî Comes a still voice‚ÄîYet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again, And, lost each human trace, surrendering up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix for ever with the elements, To be a brother to the insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world‚Äîwith kings, The powerful of the earth‚Äîthe wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills Rock- ribbed and ancient as the sun,‚Äîthe vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods‚Äîrivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and, poured round all, Old Ocean‚Äôs gray and melancholy waste,‚Äî Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.‚ÄîTake the wings Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound, Save his own dashings‚Äîyet the dead are there: And millions in those solitudes, since first The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep‚Äîthe dead reign there alone. So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw In silence from the living, and no friend Take note of thy departure? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life‚Äôs green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron and maid, The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man‚Äî Shall one by one be gathered to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, which moves To that mysterious realm, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. Critical reception Due to the unusual quality of the verse and Bryant's age, Richard Henry Dana, Sr., then associate editor at the North American Review, initially doubted its authenticity, saying to another editor, \\"No one, on this side of the Atlantic, is capable of writing such verses.\\" \\"Thanatopsis\\" remains a milestone in American literary history. Poems was considered by many to be the first major book of American poetry. Nevertheless, over five years, it earned Bryant only $14.92.Gioia, Dana. \\"Longfellow in the Aftermath of Modernism\\".

The experimental band Thanatopsis (featuring Buckethead and Travis Dickerson) was named after this poem. The band's first album, Thanatopsis, was also named after this poem. The electronic artist Daedelus named the last song on the album Exquisite Corpse after the poem. The Avant Garde film-maker Ed Emshwiller's 1962 short film Thanatopsis was inspired by the poem. In the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode \\"Terminal\\", a portion of the poem is set to folk music and sung by writer/producer Dave Willis. In the 1942 film Grand Central Murder, the private railway car where the showgirl is murdered is named Thanatopsis. The seminal conservationist Aldo Leopold quoted several passages from Thanatopsis in his posthumously published essay \\"Some Fundamentals of Conservation in the Southwest.\\" In T.C. Boyle's 1990 novel East Is East, the writer's colony on the fictitious Georgia sea island of Tupelo (near Darien) is called Thanatopsis House. Each of the artists in the colony have their own private studio cabin to work in during the day. Each studio cabin is named after a famous suicide (example: Hart Crane). In August Wilson's 2003 play Gem of the Ocean, Solly offers the final nine lines of the poem (\\"So live . . . pleasant dreams\\") as a toast to send off Citizen Barlow to the city of bones. Eli joins Solly in the recitation, offering his own interpretation of the lines: \\"You die by how you live.\\" The Acacia fraternity adopted the last stanza as their code. American progressive rock band Kansas' 2000 studio album Somewhere to Elsewhere features a song called The Coming Dawn (Thanatopsis). The lyrics are a reflection on a life at its end. The Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s had its own poker club: the tongue-in- cheek-named Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club. Cindy Williams reads from Thanatopsis in Andy Kaufman's ABC TV Special aired in 1979. In the 2020 film Driveways, Jerry Adler quotes the poem as a sudden memory from his childhood; a sign he has dementia.

The mountaintop is the site of the Mount Soledad Cross, the subject of a 25-year controversy over the involvement of religion in government which concluded in 2016.  Geography  The tall hill lies between Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is mostly within the community of La Jolla where the northern and eastern slopes form a sharp escarpment along the Rose Canyon fault. The community of Pacific Beach is on the gentler southern slope. There are several radio and television transmitters located on the summit including KFMB-TV and KGTV, the CBS and ABC affiliates respectively. Commercial aircraft approaching San Diego from the direction of Los Angeles often use Mount Soledad as their point to start the downwind leg of their approach to San Diego International Airport.  Land events  On October 3, 2007, one home on Soledad Mountain Road and one of the main roads up the mountain was destroyed by a major landslide. Five houses were damaged, and over 20 others were evacuated. The city of San Diego had noticed water and gas main leaks since July, and cracks in the pavement since August 2007.  Legend of Munchkin land  There is an urban legend that in the 1930s, a group of little people who appeared in Hollywood films such as The Wizard of Oz, came to San Diego, where they built miniature houses on Mount Soledad. The legend gained traction due to the fact several houses were built on steep slopes overlooking the Pacific. As passing observers looked down, the perspective made doors and other features appear smaller than normal. Most of the supposed \\"Munchkin Houses\\" have been remodeled and the effect is no longer present.  Last home of Dr. Seuss  Mount Soledad is the location of the last home lived in by Dr. Seuss.

He served as the main antagonist of the 1985 DC Comics miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths and later appears as an enemy to the Green Lantern Corps and the Justice League. In 2009, Anti-Monitor was ranked as IGN's 49th-greatest comic book villain of all time.Anti-Monitor is number 49 , IGN. LaMonica Garrett portrayed the character as the main antagonist in the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Publication history The Anti-Monitor first appeared in Crisis on Infinite Earths #2 (although he remained in shadow until Crisis on Infinite Earths #5) and was created by Marv Wolfman, George P√©rez, and Jerry Ordway. He was believed to have been destroyed in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12 only to return after a long absence in Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 (Aug. 2007). Fictional character biography =Origins= During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, it was revealed how the existence of all parallel universes in the Multiverse came to be, including the positive matter multiverse and also the anti-matter universe, and how the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor came into existence; when the menace posed by the Anti-Monitor became apparent, several villains were sent back in time to stop him, but were defeated by Krona and the other Oans. In a final revision, it was established that it increased entropy in the universe, shortening its existence by a billion years (see heat death).Green Lantern version 4. DC Comics In any event, two beings were created, one on the moon of Oa and the other on the moon of Qward. On the moon of Oa, the being known as the Monitor was instantly aware of his counterpart, the Anti-Monitor (although his official name is the Monitor in his own universe, and he is often addressed as such, the name Anti-Monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart). By this time the Anti-Monitor had quickly conquered Qward, as well as the rest of the anti-matter universe. In searching for other places to conquer, he also became aware of his counterpart. These two beings battled for a million years, unleashing great powers against each other, but to no avail. At the end of their stalemate, they simultaneously attacked one another, rendering both inert for nine billion years. In Final Crisis, it was revealed that, in the wake of the birth of the original Multiverse, an unfathomable being of limitless imagination, the original Monitor, or Overmonitor, became aware of the life germinating in the budding Multiverse, occupying the void space in which he resided and which he encompassed. Curious about it and wanting to interact with and know better the lesser life-forms birthed by the Multiverse, he fashioned a probe, a smaller Monitor. Unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time, the probe-Monitor was instantly split into two symmetrical, opposite beings upon coming into contact with the Multiverse itself: the Monitor, embodying the positive matter and goodness, and the Anti-Monitor, embodying anti-matter and evil.Final Crisis: Superman Beyond #2. DC Comics The Anti-Monitor, who appears monstrous, barely resembles the Monitor, who bears a physically near-human appearance. The Anti-Monitor has empty, sometimes luminous eye sockets, and a wide, wrinkled mouth, often mistaken for a mass of teeth. When his armor is destroyed by Supergirl, his form appears not dissimilar to that of the Monitor, but unstable, and surrounded by a coruscating aura of radiant energy‚Äîhis life force, leaking out like water from a failing vessel, explaining the need for the armor. The Anti-Monitor himself refers to the armor as his \\"Life Shell\\".Crisis on Infinite Earths #7. DC Comics When the Manhunters re-build his armor, it is revealed his body is little more than a churning mass of energy.Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime #1 (Dec. 2007) Much later, when his helmet is disintegrated by Firestorm, the Anti-Monitor's head is revealed to be featureless except for his eyes and mouth.Brightest Day #22 (2011). DC Comics =Crisis on Infinite Earths= The Anti-Monitor at war with the multiverse's heroes on Crisis on Infinite Earths #12 (March 1986). Art by George P√©rez In more modern times, the being known as Pariah performed an experiment similar to the one Krona attempted long ago on a parallel Earth (this was changed later to an alternate world in the Post-Crisis single universe). This experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor and the destruction of Pariah's Earth and his universe. The Anti-Monitor rebuilt his army, taking over Qward and using the Thunderers as his own private army, as well as creating the Shadow Demons from the elite of the Thunderers. The Anti-Monitor then released a massive anti-matter wave, absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes and growing stronger even as his counterpart grew weaker, and employed the second Psycho-Pirate, using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy. The Monitor, along with his aide Harbinger, gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the Anti-Monitor.Crisis on Infinite Earths #1. DC Comics One of Harbinger's duplicates was taken control of by the Anti-Monitor and apparently killed the Monitor, but the Monitor was able to use his death to create a pocket universe to contain the remaining realities from the Anti- Monitor's attack. After defeats by various heroes, including the Flash (Barry Allen) and Supergirl sacrificing themselves to destroy an anti-matter cannonCrisis on Infinite Earths #8. DC Comics and to save Superman, respectively, the Anti-Monitor absorbed the entirety of the anti-matter universe and traveled to the beginning of time, intending to stop the formation of the positive matter Multiverse and to create a Multiverse where anti-matter prevailed. When the heroes followed him there, he began to drain the power from most of them. However, the actions of the Spectre, empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving Earths, brought the Anti-Monitor to a stalemate. The villains of said Earths, sent to stop Krona from viewing the origins of the universe, failed due to squabbling, allowing Krona to see the hands of the Anti-Monitor and the Spectre struggling for domination, which collapsed the current Multiverse. From the ashes rose a new, singular universe. While various persons adjusted to the newly singular Earth (including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the Multiverse), the Anti-Monitor, enraged, drew this new Earth into the anti-matter universe, intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all.Crisis on Infinite Earths #11. DC Comics What followed was the Shadow Demon War, wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the Anti-Monitor's forces. Finally, the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains (most notably Doctor Light; the heroic Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three; Darkseid; Superboy of Earth Prime; and Kal-L, the Superman of Earth-Two) were able to weaken the Anti-Monitor enough for Kal-L to deliver the final blow, destroying the Anti-Monitor by punching him into a star. The star went nova and caused anti-matter waves to erupt, threatening to destroy the entire anti-matter universe. Kal-L and Superboy-Prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates, when Alexander Luthor, using his power to open dimensions, revealed that he had created a \\"paradise dimension\\", and he used it to prevent the Lois Lane Kent of Earth-Two from being erased from existence when the Post-Crisis universe was formed, as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow Superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss. Using his own body as a portal, Alexander Luthor, Kal-L, and Superboy-Prime went into the \\"paradise dimension\\" alongside Lois.Crisis on Infinite Earths #12. DC Comics Among the other beings who died because of his actions were the entire Crime Syndicate of America, Kid Psycho, Nighthawk, the Losers, Flower of Easy Company, Starman, the Immortal Man, the Dove, Kole, Clayface II, the Bug-Eyed Bandit, the Angle Man, Prince Ra-Man, Sunburst, Lori Lemaris, Aquagirl, Earth-2's Green Arrow, Huntress, Robin, and Alexander Luthor Sr. of Earth-Three, just to name a few. =Infinite Crisis= The Anti- Monitor's corpse turned into a tower. Panel from thumb The Superman (and Lois Lane) of Earth-Two, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and Alexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three were revealed to be observing the events of the newly-formed universe, as well as the actions of its heroes, from their home in the hidden pocket universe. Upon observing the events leading up to Infinite Crisis, the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore Earth-Two's existence, at the expense of Earth-One.Infinite Crisis #2. DC Comics The Anti- Monitor's remains were then used by Alexander Luthor as part of a tuning fork, similar to the ones used during the first Crisis. This construct then created the vibrational frequency that Earth-Two was on prior to its non-existence, which in turn recreated Earth-Two with no visible effect on Earth-One, save the movement of characters who originated on Earth-Two to the recreated Earth- Two.Infinite Crisis #4. DC Comics Alexander Luthor then recreated the other Earths with his tuning fork, with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said Earths. Superboy-Prime (followed soon by Bart Allen) then returned from the Speed Force wearing what appeared to be select elements of the Anti- Monitor's armor, using it as a yellow sunlight collector.Infinite Crisis #5. DC Comics Ultimately, the tower was destroyed when Kon-El, the modern Superboy, and Superboy-Prime crashed into it while fighting each other, forcing all of the Earths to merge into a new Earth once again. Kon-El died in the arms of Wonder Girl as Superboy-Prime fled.Infinite Crisis #6. DC Comics =Post-Crisis Impact= Despite his extremely limited exposure (he only appeared in the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, a single issue of Wonder Woman,Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #329 (February 1986) and Flash (vol. 2) #149‚Äì150), the Anti-Monitor was responsible for one of the most profound changes in the entire history of DC Comics, the DC Universe, and all of its parallel universes. The anti-matter universe still existed, now with both Qward (said to be the counterpart of Oa) and an alternate Earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains (each taking the opposite role) among its planets.JLA: Earth 2 Graphic Novel (2000), by Grant Morrison. DC Comics Perhaps the most notable impact the Anti-Monitor had on the Post-Crisis universe was the elimination of the Multiverse aspect of the DC Universe. Previously, there existed an infinite number of Earths, each one with a unique history, that could be accessed through various means, the most common being vibrational attunement. During Post-Crisis, with the restart of the universe as one thanks to the machinations of the Anti-Monitor, a simpler, more streamlined DC Universe seemed imminent, with characters acquired from Charlton Comics, Fawcett Comics, and Quality Comics all becoming incorporated into the new DC Universe. =Post-Infinite Crisis= The Anti-Monitor resemblance seen in the background in Brave New World #1. Art by Ariel Olivetti At the end of DC Comics' 2006 special Brave New World, it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves \\"the Monitors\\" watching over the new post-Infinite Crisis Earth. Four of the figures resemble the original Monitor from Crisis on Infinite Earths and the fifth figure resembles the Anti-Monitor.DCU: Brave New World #1 (Aug. 2006). DC Comics In the pages of Countdown, it has been revealed that there are fifty-two Monitors, with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new Multiverse, each with a slightly different appearance. A Monitor was shown in Supergirl recalling Dark Angel, one of his agents. This Monitor was dressed like the Anti-Monitor, but appeared to have no other connection.Supergirl (vol. 5) #18 (Aug. 2007). DC Comics =Sinestro Corps= Prominent members of the Sinestro Corps with a Manhunter at far left, including (clockwise from top left): Hank Henshaw, Superboy-Prime, the Anti- Monitor, Parallax (inhabiting Kyle Rayner), and Sinestro. Art by Ethan Van Sciver It was revealed that the Anti-Monitor was reborn following the recreation of the Multiverse and that he had been fueling Sinestro's ideology since the return of Hal Jordan, acting as the Sinestro Corps' \\"Guardian of Fear\\".\\"The Second Rebirth\\" Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 (Aug. 2007) DC Comics His body was rebuilt by the Manhunters, and in addition, he recruited Superboy-Prime, the Cyborg Superman, and Parallax, who was using Kyle Rayner as its host, along with Sinestro as his heralds. \\"The Greatest Once, the Greatest Again\\" Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 DC Comics (Aug 2007) During the war between the Sinestro Corps and the Green Lantern Corps, the Anti-Monitor contacted Cyborg Superman to inquire about the status of New Warworld. The cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon Qward and that he would kill Henshaw for his services, allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the Cyborg.Green Lantern vol 1, #22 DC Comics (October 2007) When the Lost Lanterns made their way to the anti-matter universe to save Hal Jordan and the Ion power, they inadvertently stumbled upon the Anti- Monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on Qward. He was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the Ion entity previously inhabiting Kyle Rayner. He proceeded to kill Ke'Haan before the other Lanterns forced him back, taking the Ion entity from the planet and the anti-matter universe. The Anti-Monitor pursued the Lanterns for a short while, long enough for Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and the other Lanterns to learn of his return. Having this vital information, they then leave Qward. Shortly after, the Sinestro Corps launched its attack on Earth. The Anti-Monitor traveled to the planet aboard New Warworld, and landed shortly thereafter, along with Sinestro. He was attacked by Sodam Yat and other members of the Green Lantern Corps, but the tyrant killed the two unnamed Lanterns and severely injured the Daxamite Lantern. The Anti-Monitor began to siphon the positive matter of New York City to create his anti-matter waves. However, he was attacked by the Guardians of the Universe, angry at being impotent during his first war. The Anti-Monitor was able to counter the vicious attack, permanently disfiguring the face of Scar. John Stewart and Guy Gardner brought down New Warworld and the Yellow Central Power Battery, which were detonated next to the Anti- Monitor, and contained by a shield created by hundreds of Green Lanterns to contain the explosion; even this was not enough to kill him. Superboy-Prime, seeing an opportunity to defeat the now-weakened Anti-Monitor, flew through the Anti-Monitor's chest and hurled his shattered body into space. The Anti- Monitor's corpse crash landed on desert planet where a voice (later revealed to be Nekron) acknowledged him and told him to rise. Before he could escape, the Anti-Monitor found himself imprisoned inside a large Black Power Battery.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25 (January 2008). DC Comics Soon afterwards, the Guardian Scar, corrupted by the Anti-Monitor's energies, dispatched the Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek to locate and recover the Anti-Monitor's body. =Blackest Night= Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek find the Black Central Power Battery on the dead planet Ryut in Sector 666, and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet, killing them.

DC Comics It is eventually revealed that Mobius became what he is after attempting to peer into the origins of the anti-matter universe on Qward, similar to how Krona sought the origins of his positive-matter universe. While the White Light of the Life Equation was the origin of the positive universe, it is the Anti-Life Equation that serves as the foundation of the anti-matter universe, and Mobius released it from within the world of Qward, transforming him into the Anti-Monitor. With the Anti-Life Equation in his body, Anti- Monitor has the ability to enslave any living thing to his will. He uses this power to bind the Black Racer to the Flash, enslaving the New God and using him to kill Darkseid.Justice League vol. 2 #44.

Now basically a living weapon under Grail's control, Trevor releases a tremendous blast of power against Mobius, reducing him to a smoldering skeleton.Justice League vol. 2 #49. DC Comics =DC Rebirth= In the DC Rebirth relaunch, Anti- Monitor's history is revealed where he and his brothers Monitor/Mar Novu and World Forger were created by a Super Celestial named Perpetua in the Sixth Dimension where she tasked them to monitor their assigned realms.

If Anti-Monitor, his brothers, or Perpetua would be destroyed, they would regenerate in the Sixth Dimension.Justice League Vol. 4 #19‚Äì22. DC Comics The Anti-Monitor lies in wait at the end of the universe, where the former Source Wall was located.

The Anti-Monitor cries out for his mother's help, which he receives in the form of the fiery remains of Earth-44 which Perpetua flung towards his location.Justice League Vol. 4 #31‚Äì37 (2019) Powers and abilities Anti-Monitor is one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the DC Universe. He is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known DC supervillain, having destroyed thousands of universes.While the actual number of universes the Anti-Monitor destroyed was not literally infinite, the Monitor did state that \\"more than three thousand\\" universes had been lost. He was powerful enough to kill Supergirl when she became distracted. He consumed thousands of positive-matter universes to increase his power and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse's strongest heroes simultaneously. During the Blackest Night, the Anti-Monitor was reanimated as a Black Lantern. However, Nekron was unable to fully control him and thus was only able to subdue the Anti-Monitor to be used as a power source for the Black Lantern Corps' Central Battery, much in the same way the entity Parallax is the power source for the Yellow Lanterns' battery. The Anti- Monitor was also responsible for the death of Barry Allen, the hero better known as the Flash. After capturing Barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable, the Anti-Monitor created an anti-matter cannon that would destroy the then-five remaining Earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed. The cannon was destroyed by the Flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon's power source into itself, causing it to explode and Barry to disintegrate. In addition to possessing vast size (varying from about nine feet to hundreds of meters tall), vastly superhuman strength, extraordinary durability (by the end of the Crisis series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from Superman and even surviving a blue star going supernova), the ability to project destructive bolts of energy, and greatly augmenting another being's powers (as he did with Psycho-Pirate, whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle), the Anti-Monitor also possessed reality-warping abilities, which he displayed by removing Psycho-Pirate's face. The Anti-Monitor also commanded an army of Qwardians and shadow demons and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting, merging, or destroying entire universes. By far, his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself; once he fused with his anti-matter universe, he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes. In addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes, he also absorbed the energy of \\"over one million worlds\\" in his own anti-matter universe in order to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe. When Earth's heroes followed him to the beginning of time, he then absorbed all of their power and energy; this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the Spectre. During his final battle in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12, the Anti- Monitor maintained his power by \\"feeding on\\" a nearby star; and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near-death, he absorbed his own anti-matter demons to rejuvenate himself. The Anti-Monitor is not immortal, but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti-matter universe exists; having been destroyed with an immense effort at the end of the Crisis, he was recreated by his universe, just as he had been formed originally. It's been revealed that if the Anti-Monitor or any other member of his family were to be destroyed, they would regenerate in the Sixth Dimension. Other versions * In the \\"Chain Lightning\\" arc of the Flash comics,Flash (vol. 3) #145‚Äì150 (February‚ÄìJuly 1999) history is altered when Barry Allen is killed before the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths. This forces Wally West into a timeline where the Anti-Monitor was never defeated and only the anti-matter universe remains. * A parody of the Anti-Monitor, called the \\"Aunty Monitor\\", appeared in Marvel Comics' What The--?! satire comic.What The--?! #2 (September 1988). DC Comics Marvel's Mighty Mouse comic featured another parody, the \\"Anti-Minotaur\\".Mighty Mouse #4‚Äì5 (Jan‚ÄìFeb. 1991). DC Comics * The Anti-Monitor makes a cameo appearance in Justice League Unlimited #32 (June 2007). He is described by Darkseid to be a \\"celestial being composed of negative energy\\" which Darkseid sought to gain to fuel the Anti-Life Equation. * The Monitor and Anti-Monitor both appear in Tiny Titans #12 (March 2009), with the Monitor telling Robin that he needs a hall pass, and the Anti-Monitor contradicting him because he is the \\"Anti\\" Monitor, until the two start having a \\"do not, do too\\" argument, and the Monitor says that everyone likes the Anti-Monitor better. * The Anti-Monitor plays a part in the third Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover. Seeking to merge the Turtles' and Batman's universes together and create a reality he could control at will, Krang murdered the Anti-Monitor and repurposed his corpse into an exo-suit, using the technology within to achieve his goal.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #2. DC Comics In other media =Television= Arrowverse * The Anti-Monitor makes his live-action debut in the Arrowverse crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths, portrayed by LaMonica Garrett. At some point in between Elseworlds and Crisis, the Anti-Monitor found the Flash of Earth-90 and used him to power an anti-matter cannon to destroy the multiverse. Minutes before the Crisis began, the Anti-Monitor tricked multiversal explorer Nash Wells into unlocking his prison under Earth-1 Central City. Once he grows strong enough, he then possesses Harbinger, kills the Monitor, and succeeds in destroying the multiverse. However, he failed to kill the Paragons, seven heroes capable of stopping him, as they were teleported to a point outside of space and time so they could regroup and restore existence. With Oliver Queen / Spectre's help, they defeat him and successfully reboot the multiverse. Despite this, the Anti-Monitor survived and attempted to get his revenge, only to be defeated once and for all when the newly-created Earth-Prime's heroes used a bomb capable of shrinking him for eternity on him. A flashback in \\"Part Four\\" of the crossover showed that he learned of the multiverse's existence when a young Mar Novu accidentally entered his anti-matter universe while attempting to time travel to the past to witness the birth of the universe. Animation * The Anti-Monitor makes his animated debut as the main antagonist of the second story arc of Green Lantern: The Animated Series, voiced by Tom Kenny. The animated version of the Anti-Monitor features a more machine-like face, with glowing blue eyes and a flat surface where the mouth is. This version of the Anti-Monitor was created by the renegade guardian Krona as the \\"ultimate being\\", one capable of anything, even time travel. When it was activated, the Anti-Monitor recognized its superiority and turned against Krona, forcing him to banish Anti-Monitor to another universe. He is first shown in the series in \\"The New Guy\\", entering the show's universe by splitting open the fabric of space and heading down to a nearby junkyard planet, destroying one of many automated security ships which tells him otherwise before declaring to several defunct Manhunters that he is their new master before unleashing a signal that reactivates all Manhunters across space for his own motives. The heroes engage him in the second episode of the arc, where he is shown as a giant, stating he consumed the planets of his universe and hungers for more. He shrugged off the most powerful attacks of both the Lanterns and their starship. The episode ends with him hitting Hal Jordan with an energy attack that ends up blasting him through a dimensional rift. The next episode reveals he was blasted into Anti- Monitor's prison universe, completely empty except for a single sun and an alternate version of Earth, the latter of which was spared in return for helping Anti-Monitor to escape his prison universe. After returning to his original universe, Hal joins with his Green Lantern comrades to fight Anti- Monitor and his Manhunter army. In the episode \\"Cold Fury\\", however, a super- charged and seemingly emotionless Aya sends the Anti-Monitor's head flying while she connects herself to his headless body for her own agenda. However, as revealed in \\"Ranx\\", this did not kill the Anti-Monitor, and as a head ended up at the planet Ranx where he intended to regain his power. Unfortunately, Aya and her modified Manhunters attack Ranx to obtain the device built in the Anti-Monitor's head to arrive to the moment before the Big Bang. Though the Anti-Monitor attempts to recruit Hal, Kilowog, and Razer for protection, Aya breaks through Ranx's defenses and subdues the lanterns. Though Anti-Monitor suggests her to let him accompany her to see the beginning of existence, Aya rips open the Anti-Monitor's head and obtains her prize. =Web series= * The Anti-Monitor appears as a Hall Monitor parody in the episode \\"Anti-Hall Monitor\\" from DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by John DiMaggio. =Video games= * The Anti-Monitor appears as a boss in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. * The Anti-Monitor appears as a boss in DC Universe Online. * The Anti-Monitor appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains.

John was himself a future King of England, the son of Henry II of England and had been declared Lord of Ireland by his father at the Council of Oxford in 1177. Despite his own ambitions for the Kingdom of Jerusalem, John Lackland was sent west to Ireland by his father and landed at Waterford in April 1185. The inexperienced young prince managed to offend the customs of the Irish Gaels who had met him diplomatically. John (who struggled to pay his own men) attempted to promise knights who traveled with him with Gaelic lands, which further irritated the natives. Aside from these concerns, he grew an intense dislike of the powerful Viceroy of Ireland, Hugh de Lacy, who held the Lordship of Meath, following his conquest of the Gaelic Kingdom of Meath. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Plantagenets were repeatedly concerned with Norman barons, nominally loyal to them, becoming too powerful in Ireland and this was the case with the successful (militarily and diplomatically) de Lacys. John returned to England in December 1185 and complained bitterly to his father about the influence of de Lacy in Ireland. Much to the relief of the Plantaganets, the following year, de Lacy himself was assassinated at Durrow by an Irishman, Giolla Gan Mathiar √ì Maidhaigh. Plans were made for John to return to Ireland and the new Pope Urban III was more favourable than his predecessors to granting him the title King of Ireland. However, this was cancelled due to the death of John's brother Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. John would later return to Ireland for a second time in 1210 while King of England, as part of a campaign to crush a rebellion by a section of Norman lords; this time he was far more successful. Preparation The subject of John going to Ireland first came into question under the reign of his father, Henry II, specifically with the Council of Oxford in 1177. This council dismissed William FitzAldelm as Lord of Ireland agreed to have John made King of Ireland. This would appear to have been a strategy of his father's to divide his Angevin possessions between his four sons. The approval of Pope Alexander III was sought to have John crowned King of Ireland. Disagreements with first Alexander III and then his successor Pope Lucius III caused this to be delayed and instead John went as only Lord of Ireland. In 1184 arrangements were made for John's departure with the sending of John Cumin and Philip of Worcester to prepare the ground for John's arrival. John arrived in Ireland in April 1185, landing at Waterford with around 300 knights and numerous foot soldiers and archers. Progress Plaque in Waterford on the site of the castle John stayed at. Upon his arrival in Ireland, John and his retinue were greeted by numerous unnamed Gaelic Irish leaders. It is said that upon seeing these strange long bearded Kings, John and his retinue laughed and pulled them about by their beards. Gerald of Wales said that the Irish then complained to their overlords ‚Äî men such as Domhnall M√≥r √ì Briain ‚Äî of how John was \\"an ill-mannered child‚Ä¶ from whom no good could be hoped\\". Aside from upsetting these rulers, John also at this time engaged in a vigorous program of extending land grants to trusted royal administrators such as Theobald Walter, William de Burgh, Gilbert Pipard and Bertram de Verdun as well as other minor land grants to lesser figures. Their Hiberno- Norman descendants, such as Walter's Butler dynasty, would long remain influential. During his stay in Ireland, John largely followed the route his father Henry II had taken in 1171‚Äì72, landing in Waterford and ending up in Dublin. John's expedition founded several castles along the way, especially in Western Waterford and Southern Tipperary, and also established the foundations of administration and law which he later expanded upon in his second expedition in 1210. Departure John left Ireland in December 1185 and returned to England. Scholars have largely agreed that this was most likely to do with the presence of Hugh de Lacy but it is also likely that John ran out of money. It has been suggested that his departure was a setback in much broader plan to set up administrative structures in Ireland in order to control the unruly Barons via loyal, royalist forces such as Walter, De Burgh and De Verdon and that when De Lacy began to threaten his position, he escaped back to the safety of England. What is generally perceived, both contemporarily and in modern scholarship as a feckless attitude has given him a bad reputation and caused his first expedition to be viewed unfairly. Upon his departure, his father Henry granted the office of justiciar to the Baron John de Courcy, who had massive influence in Ulster. In 1186 Hugh De Lacy was assassinated by an Irishman and plans were made to send John back to Ireland. However, the death of his brother, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, in France cancelled these plans and John did not return to Ireland until his second expedition in 1210. Historiography The expedition has attracted much historical debate due to the lack of government records available and the subsequent reliance on sources such as the Irish Annals and the writings of Gerald.

Ancient Rus, Chapter VIII According to another theory is related with Turkic forms tyvar and tavar (\\"cattle\\", \\"property\\", \\"riches\\", \\"goods\\"), which is seemingly related with the Slavic *stado (\\"cluster (group) of cattle\\"), which supposedly stands in the name of Stadici described by Bavarian Geographer as \\"countless people\\" who had 516 settlements, while the neighbour Unlizi (Ulichs) as \\"populus multus\\", thus relating the Tivertsi with Stadici se Turkic-Slavic ethnonym tracing (some also related the White Croats with Stadici), or they could have been mentioned as Attorozi. History The original information about the tribe is scarce. Tivertsi and Ulichs are briefly mentioned in early Ruthenian manuscripts, 863 being the earliest reference, 944 being the latest. The Primary Chronicle from the Laurentian Codex (the oldest copy) mentions that they lived by the Dniester and Danube down to the sea (evidently, the Black Sea). The Hypatian Codex (later re-copy) replaces the Dniester with the Dnieper. The Tver Chronicle mentions them in the year 883, mentioning their fight against Askold and Dir. A number of manuscripts mention in the year 885 that they fought with Oleg of Novgorod. They are mentioned as taking part in Oleg's expeditions in 907 and in Igor's expeditions in 944, the latter year being the last reference to Tivertsi in early East Slavic manuscripts., article \\"Tivertsy\\" At the beginning of the 10th century, the tribe became part of the Kievan Rus. Starting in the mid-10th century, the Tivertsi frequently fought against the neighbouring Pechenegs and Cumans. In 12th and 13th centuries, some lands of the Tivertsi were part of the Kingdom of Galicia and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On the lands populated by Wallachians, from Transylvania, some Tivertsi were gradually assimilated by them. There also is a hypothesis that they are the ancestors of Moldavians. Settlements Several settlements of Tivertsi are now archaeological sites in Ukraine and Moldova (Alcedar, EchimƒÉu≈£i, Rudi and others). According to Romanian and Moldovan researchers, Tivertsi were a population dwelling along the Dniester river, being ancestors of RomaniansGheorghe PosticƒÉ, Civiliza»õia medievalƒÉ timpurie din spa»õiul pruto-nistrean (secolele V-XIII), Editura Academiei Romane, Chi»ôinƒÉu, 2007, p. 75Victor Spinei, The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-Thirteenth Century, BRILL, 2009, p.84-87 Some scholars agree that the name of the town of Tyvriv (on the right bank of Southern Buh river) in Ukraine¬¥s Vinnytsia oblast stems from the tribe of Tivertsi, who lived in that very area. Likewise, the name of west Ukraine's town of Kivertsi is also associated with this tribe. It is also presumed that Kamyanets-Podilsky on the Dniester was the tribal center of Tyvertsi.

Considered one of Iraq's most competent military commanders, he was appointed to the position in 1995. During his thirty-year military career, Sultan commanded two brigades, three divisions, and two corps of regular army corps before assuming responsibilities as Minister of Defense. Career Ahmad at Persian Gulf War ceasefire talks in Safwan, Iraq, on March 3, 1991 with American interpreter Rick Francona =Persian Gulf War= Ahmad served in the Iraqi Army during the 1980‚Äì1988 Iran‚ÄìIraq War and later in the Persian Gulf War, signing the ceasefire that ended it. He survived several purges and became the highest-ranking general in the Iraqi Army. He was regarded largely as a figurehead in the Iraqi military without any amount of real control. =Iraq War= As the invasion of Iraq loomed, it was reported in The Guardian in February 2003 that Ahmad had been placed under house arrest by Saddam Hussein, in a move that was apparently designed to prevent a coup. Nevertheless, he continued to appear on Iraqi state-run T.V., to preserve a sense of normality. Ahmad was number 27 on the United States' list of most wanted former Iraqi officials. On September 19, 2003, after nearly a week of negotiations, he gave himself up in Mosul to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). Dawood Bagistani, who arranged the surrender to Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, said Ahmad was handed over \\"with great respect\\" and was with his family at the time. Bagistani said the U.S. military had promised to remove Ahmad's name from the list of 55 most-wanted, meaning he would not face indefinite confinement and possible prosecution. \\"We trust the promise,\\" Bagistani said. Special treatment for Ahmad Al-Tai could be an effort to defuse the guerrilla-style attacks that were taking a toll on American soldiers. Many of the attackers are thought to be former soldiers in Saddam's army. Seeing their former military leader well-treated by the Americans might have encouraged them to lay down their arms. On June 24, 2007, he was sentenced to death by hanging for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. However his execution was not carried out because of public disapproval from Iraq's president Jalal Talabani. In May 2018, Iraq's Parliament speaker Salim al-Jabouri, requested a pardon for Ahmad Al-Tai alleging medical reasons. He then was transferred from the prison in Nasiriyah to a prison in Baghdad. =Death= Ahmad Al-Tai died on July 19, 2020 from a heart attack in the Nasiriyah Central Prison.

Animal locomotion on the surface layer of water is the study of animal locomotion in the case of small animals that live on the surface layer of water, relying on surface tension to stay afloat. There are two types of animal locomotion on water, determined by the ratio of the animal's weight to the water's surface tension: those whose weight is supported by the surface tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on the water's surface without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by the water's surface tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to the water's surface in order to remain above it. A creature such as the basilisk lizard, often dubbed the 'Jesus lizard', has a weight which is larger than the surface tension can support, and is widely known for running across the surface of water. Another example, the western grebe, performs a mating ritual that includes running across the surface of water. Surface living animals such as the water strider typically have hydrophobic feet covered in small hairs that prevent the feet from breaking the surface and becoming wet. Another insect known to walk on the water surface is the ant species Polyrhachis sokolova. The pygmy gecko (Coleodactylus amazonicus), due to its small size and hydrophobic skin is also able to walk on the water surface. According to biophysicist David L. Hu, there are at least 342 species of water striders. As striders increase in size, their legs become proportionately longer, with Gigantometra gigas having a length of over 20 cm requiring a surface tension force of about 40 millinewtons. Water striders generate thrust by shedding vortices in the water: a series of \\"U\\"-shaped vortex filaments is created during the power stroke. The two free ends of the \\"U\\" are attached to the water surface. These vortices transfer enough (backward) momentum to the water to propel the animal forwards (note that some momentum is transferred by capillary waves; see Denny's paradox for a more detailed discussion.)  Meniscus climbing  To pass from the water surface to land, a water-walking insect must contend with the slope of the meniscus at the water's edge. Many such insects are unable to climb this meniscus using their usual propulsion mechanism. David Hu and coworker John W. M. Bush have shown that such insects climb meniscuses by assuming a fixed body posture. This deforms the water surface and generates capillary forces that propels the insect up the slope without moving its appendages. Hu and Bush conclude that meniscus climbing is an unusual means of propulsion in that the insect propels itself in a quasi-static configuration, without moving its appendages. Biolocomotion is generally characterized by the transfer of muscular strain energy to the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the creature, and the kinetic energy of the suspending fluid. In contrast, meniscus climbing has a different energy pathway: by deforming the free surface, the insect converts muscular strain to the surface energy that powers its ascent.  Marangoni propulsion  Many insects, including some terrestrial insects, can release a surfactant and propel themselves using the Marangoni effect. Hu and Bush report that Microvelia can attain a peak speed of 17 cm/s, which is twice its peak walking speed, using Marangoni propulsion. Marangoni propulsion by a wetting arthropod is precisely analogous to a soap boat but the situation for insects such as water striders is more complex. Hu and Bush state that \\"for nonwetting arthropods, the transfer of chemical to kinetic energy is more subtle, as the Marangoni stress must be communicated across the creature‚Äôs complex surface layer\\". Sailing Velella moves by sailing. Velella, the by-the-wind sailor, is a cnidarian with no means of propulsion other than sailing. A small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. Velella sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind.

It arrived in Britain after the Norman conquest of 1066. There are two theories about its source. It is either a nickname reference to \\"bad temper/disposition\\" (Old French, Maltalent; Anglo Norman French, mautalent/Mautalen; Latin malum talentum), or it may be a locational reference to Mautalant, a place in Pontorson, France. The Brittany connection is less likely than that with Les Moitiers-d'Allonne, near Carteret in the Cotentin. Mautalents continue to live in and near Les Moitiers-d'Allonne, and the early medieval charters link the Maltalents of England and Scotland with the Morville family ‚Äì originating from Morville, near Valonges, and Roger de Mowbray, whose family came from Aubigny, also nearby. The name gradually mutated to Mautalent and then Maitland, with the latter spelling appearing around 1250 and becoming settled in the late 14th century. The earliest public record of the surname in Britain, after the Battle Abbey Roll of 1066, dates to 1138 in Northumberland when Robert Maltalent witnessed a charter of Roger de Mowbray in Yorkshire. The Clan Maitland is a lowland Scottish clan,Clan Maitland the chief of which holds the title Earl of Lauderdale.

It is situated in the northern dock system in Kirkdale. Huskisson Dock consists of a main basin nearest the river wall and two branch docks to the east. It is connected to Canada Dock to the north and Sandon Half Tide Dock to the south. History The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley and opened in 1852. It is named after a former MP and Treasurer of the Navy, William Huskisson. Initially dealing in timber, it later traded in grain and provided berthing facilities for passenger ships on North American routes. The main basin was enlarged and a branch dock created in the 1860s to accommodate larger ships. The dock was expanded again at the turn of the twentieth century when two further branch docks were added by Anthony George Lyster. =World War II= On 3 May 1941 Huskisson Branch Dock Number 2 was the site of the explosion during Liverpool's May Blitz, when 1,000 tons of explosives on board the ship were ignited during an air raid. Four people were killed and debris from the ship was strewn up to 2.5 miles away. The two ton anchor stock from the ship landed outside Bootle General Hospital, Derby Road, 1.5 miles from the scene. =Late 20th century= Largely destroyed by the Malakand explosion, Huskisson Dock was rebuilt after the War. Huskisson Branch Dock Number 2 was subsequently filled in and is now the site of a timber yard. Huskisson Dock remains in use, handling general bulk cargoes. Up to the 1960s Cunard liners would berth mainly in Huskisson Dock. Throughout the late 1970s the Nigerian 'river' ships (named after Nigerian rivers) were regular visitors to Huskisson Dock.

The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.37, which means it is readily visible to the naked eye. It is more familiar to northern hemisphere observers as one of the \\"pointer stars\\" in the Big Dipper, or the Plough (UK), which is a prominent asterism of seven stars that forms part of the larger constellation. Extending an imaginary straight line from this star through the nearby Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe) extends to Polaris, the north star. Spectral classification In 1943, Œ≤ Ursae Majoris was listed as a spectral standard for the class of A1 V. When improved instruments made it possible to identify subgiant luminosity classes for early A-class stars, Œ≤ Ursae Majoris was assigned that class A0 IV. This was later revised to A1 IV. It is considered to be a mild Am star, a type of chemically peculiar star with unusually strong lines of certain metallic elements. Properties Based upon parallax measurements, Œ≤ Ursae Majoris is located at a distance of from the Sun. It is a subgiant, a star that has exhausted the hydrogen in its core and is now cooling as it generates energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell outside the core. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is about 9,225 K, giving it a white-hued glow that is typical for A-type stars. It is larger than the Sun, with about 2.7 times the mass and 2.84 times the solar radius. If they were viewed from the same distance, Beta Ursae Majoris would appear much brighter than the Sun, as it is radiating 68 times the Sun's luminosity. Observation of the star in the infrared reveal an excess emission that suggests the presence of a circumstellar debris disk of orbiting dust, much like those discovered around Fomalhaut and Vega. The mean temperature of this disk is 120 K, indicating that it is centered at a radius of 47 AU from the host star. The dust has an estimated mass of about 0.27% the mass of the Earth. Beta Ursae Majoris is one of five stars in the Big Dipper that form a part of a loose open cluster called the Ursa Major moving group, sharing the same region of space and not just the same patch of sky from Earth's perspective. This group has an estimated age of about 500 (¬± 100) million years. As the members of this group share a common origin and motion through space, this yields an estimate for the age of Beta Ursae Majoris. Two stars are known to be located in relatively close proximity: 37 Ursae Majoris at and Gamma Ursae Majoris at ; much closer to each other than these stars are to the Earth. Nomenclature Œ≤ Ursae Majoris (Latinised to Beta Ursae Majoris) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name Merak derived from the Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÇ al-maraqq 'the loins' (of the bear). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Merak for this star. The Hindus called the star Pulaha, one of the Seven Rishis. In Chinese, (), meaning Northern Dipper, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper.

The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitry Mendeleyev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  History  In 1889, the owner of one of the St. Petersburg printing houses Ilya Efron on the initiative of Professor Semyon Vengerov signed an agreement with the German publishing house F.A. Brockhaus to make Russian translation of a large encyclopaedia Konversations- Lexikon, issued by this publishing house. To this end the Brockhaus-Efron joint stock company was established. Originally they intended to translate the German publication with a more detailed account of issues related to Russia. It was supposed to release 16-18 volumes. The first 8 half-volumes were edited by Ivan Andrievsky; the rest by Konstantin Arsenyev and Fyodor Petrushevsky. The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary contains 121,240 entries, 7800 illustrations and 235 maps. The encyclopedia came out in two versions: one had 41 main and 2 additional volumes (smaller part of the circulation); the other had 82 primary and 4 additional half-volumes. Half-volumes have double numbering: e.g., 49 and 50 (the numbers on the spine) and on the title pages are numbered XXV and XXVa. In the years 1899-1902 the Small Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (–ú–≠–°–ë–ï) (in 3 volumes) was produced; in 1907-1909 the second edition came out in four volumes. In the years 1911-1916 there appeared the New Encyclopedic Dictionary (–ù–æ–≤—ã–π —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å); 29 volumes of the planned 48 were published, up to the entry for \\"–û—Ç—Ç–æ\\".

He also served as the United States Secretary of Commerce from August 8, 1932, to March 3, 1933, during the final months of the administration of President Herbert Hoover. Early life He was born on February 23, 1880 in Lansing, Michigan, the son of Edward Cornelius Chapin and Ella Rose King. He attended the University of Michigan. Chapin married the former Inez Tiedeman in 1914. The couple had six children. One son, Roy D. Chapin Jr., would also pursue a career with Hudson Motor Company, eventually leading American Motors Corporation (AMC). Commercial interests Secretary of Commerce Roy D. Chapin applauds President Herbert Hoover at the Nine-Point Prosperity Conference (August 26, 1932) Chapin headed the consortium of businessmen and engineers that founded the Hudson Motor Car Company in 1908. The company was named for Detroit merchant Joseph L. Hudson, who provided the majority of capital for the operation's start-up. Chapin was also behind the 1918 formation of the Essex Motors Company, a subsidiary of Hudson. Essex is notable for developing the first affordable mass-produced enclosed automobile in 1922. Because of the success of the inexpensive enclosed Essex Coach line, the American automobile industry shifted away from open touring cars in order to meet consumer demand for all-weather passenger vehicles. In 1927 he replaced Clifton as the head of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce. In addition to his corporate interests, Chapin spearheaded the drive to build the Lincoln Highway, along with Henry B. Joy of Packard Motors. While Chapin viewed a system of professionally designed and built roadways as the greatest way to grow the automobile industry, he also saw the modern roadways movement as a way to secure long range strength for the United States as a nation. Political activities Chapin at his desk as Secretary of Commerce, 1932 After building Hudson into one of the most profitable independent American automobile manufacturers, Chapin left Hudson for the Hoover administration upon his appointment in 1932. During his tenure as Secretary of Commerce, Chapin was unsuccessful in persuading Henry Ford to provide financial help to avoid the collapse of the Union Guardian Trust Company of Detroit. Ford's refusal to aid the bank in averting a financial failure led to the Michigan Bank Holiday, an event that began a series of state bank holidays and ultimately to the passage of Roosevelt administration's Emergency Banking Act of 1933. Death Chapin returned to Hudson in March 1933. His final three years were spent trying to save the company from the effects of the Great Depression. He died in Detroit, Michigan on February 16, 1936. He was succeeded at Hudson by A.E. Barit. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery. Legacy Chapin House in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan Former residence of Chapin in Washington, D.C., currently the Embassy of Nicaragua In 1927, Chapin commissioned noted architect John Russell Pope to design a residence for his family at 447 Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. Pope later designed the Jefferson Memorial, National Archives Building and National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. Bryant Fleming landscaped the grounds which included 600-year-old yews imported from England. Mrs. Chapin occupied the residence until her death in 1956 when Henry Ford II and wife Anne purchased the property. Ford owned the estate until 1983 when he demolished the house and divided the land to construct condominiums. In 1954, Nash Kelvinator acquired Hudson in a friendly merger. The resulting company, American Motors Corporation (AMC), continued operation until Chrysler acquired it in 1987. Chapin's son, Roy D. Chapin Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of AMC and led the automaker to the acquisition of Kaiser Jeep Corporation in 1970. Chapin was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1972. His grandson, William R. Chapin, was named president of the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2010. References Further reading * May, George S.

The title and its subsidiaries became extinct in 1814. History George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvedere with the Countess of Belvedere and their child, 1804 The title was created for Robert Rochfort, an Anglo-Irish politician who had represented Westmeath in the Irish House of Commons. He was the son of Rt. Hon. George Rochfort, a politician and a descendant of the English settler Rochfort family. Robert Rochfort had already been created Baron Belfield in 1738 and Viscount Belfield in 1751, both also titles in the Peerage of Ireland. The first earl was succeeded his by eldest son from his second marriage, George Rochfort, who was also a politician. The titles became extinct upon his death in 1814. During his life the first Earl commissioned Belvedere House, thought to be designed by Richard Castles but James Gibbs is most likely to have been the architect. It is still an admired piece of Georgian architecture and is now run by the Westmeath County Council. Robert's achievement with Belvedere House could be considered marred by his spitefulness however, as he had a 180 ft tall 'folly' built, purely to obscure the view to the house for his brother George. =The Rochfort family without Earldom= After the Earl's death his wife remarried and bore a son whom she christened George Augustus Rochfort Boyd. He chose to live on the estate in Westmeath. A descendant of the family, George Arthur Boyd-Rochfort, was awarded the Victoria Cross for service in France during the First World War.

It was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2006, for release in Europe. Plot The story begins with a peaceful fantasy world by the name of \\"Morning Land\\", where the Chicken inhabitants live in peace and harmony. But all that is shattered as Dark Raven and his army of Crows assault Morning Land, catching the inhabitants by surprise and shrouding Morning Land in a blanket of unnatural, eternal night. Meanwhile, being late to meet with his friends due to oversleeping, the slightly mischievous Billy Hatcher races out of his house to go meet them. Upon arrival, Bantam tells Billy he is late, showing him a pocket watch in the shape of an egg. And, being some sort of tradition among the four friends, Bantam Scrambled, Chick Poacher, and Rolly Roll prepare to dish out a consequence on Billy, but they're stopped by the weak chirping of a chick. Two Crows that are looming nearby dive at the chick, as if they're finishing it off, but Billy intervenes, saving the baby chicken by fending the Crows off with a stick. The chick suddenly begins to glow, transporting Billy and his friends to Morning Land, with Billy ending up in Forest Village. Billy is informed by Menie-Funie that the Crows are trying to take over Morning Land and will soon take over the human world. He's informed that if he doesn't save Morning Land, Dark Raven will bring eternal night, darkness will overcome the hearts of everyone, and the two worlds will be ruled by evil. Billy then goes and receives the Legendary Chicken Suit to begin on a journey to free the six Chicken Elders, which have been imprisoned in golden eggs by the Crows. Uri-Uri, the Chicken Elder of Pirates Island, reveals that Dark Raven is reborn every 100 years to try and bring eternal night. Once he has freed the Elders, defeated the six Crow Bosses, and opened the Rainbow Gate, Billy travels to the Giant Palace, where Dark Raven is trying to hatch the Giant Egg to receive ultimate power. Billy battles Dark Raven, and once he defeats him, the Giant Egg hatches and grants Raven's wishes, shaping him into a crow-shaped shadow demon dubbed Ultimate Raven. A second battle then ensues. Ultimate Raven attacks Billy, destroying the Chicken Suit. Afterwards, Billy must avoid his attacks until Menie-Funie speaks to him, telling him that he must not give up. Then the Courage Emblems he has collected form into the new and enhanced Sun Suit, imbued with the power of courage. Billy must then use this power to turn Ultimate Raven's attacks against him. Billy finally defeats Ultimate Raven as his heart explodes, completely ending his existence and return. The power from the Giant Egg restores true morning to the land below. Once he and his friends return to where they entered Morning Land, they return the Chicken Suits and return to their world. It seems that when they're leaving, Billy is saddened that he has to leave Morning Land. The four friends wave goodbye and they are transported back. Upon their return to the human world, Billy is a short distance away from his friends. They get his attention by laughing at him and he runs over to them joining the laughter, thus ending the game with a chicken feather slowly falling from the sky. Gameplay Billy Hatcher has a unique style of gameplay revolving around rolling large eggs. The player controls the hero, Billy, who cannot do much by himself aside from moving and jumping. However, he becomes a powerhouse once he finds an egg. While rolling an egg, Billy moves faster and is more agile. He can also dash, throw and return the egg along the ground, slam the egg down from the air, and Billy can travel on rails and fly through rings. =Eggs= The color-coded eggs themselves are another gameplay element. As Billy runs over fruit while holding an egg, the egg gains maturity and gets larger. When the egg's maturity gauge completely fills, the egg flashes and is ready to hatch. Then Billy can hatch the eggs, which can contain helper animals, character power-ups, and extra lives. With variables such as egg size, helper animals, and personal power-ups, Billy Hatcher can be played in many ways. Different animals can come out of the same eggs, and some creatures are vital to progressing through certain challenges. Players should be wary of their handling of the eggs, as they take damage when attacked by enemies or impact certain obstacles. The egg gauge in the lower right-hand corner of the screen begins to crack, as does the egg Billy wields. When the egg takes enough damage, it is destroyed and no bonus comes from it. Eggs can also be 'lost', i.e. put into positions or situations that the player cannot retrieve them from. In such cases, the egg will disappear from its position after several seconds of inactivity and will 'respawn' in its nest of origin, but will lose any maturity the player earned for it. Some characters from other games appear in certain eggs, such as Sonic the Hedgehog or NiGHTS. These specific eggs are marked with the Sonic Team logo on them. Different eggs within the game prefer certain fruits, and gathering these fruits will make the egg's maturity gauge grow faster. The fruit of the game is divided into sets of big and small, with the bigger fruits generally being more potent than the smaller ones. Some eggs are easier to hatch than others, and require less fruit than others. Certain item eggs hatch the fastest, while the GBA Minigame Eggs take the most fruit. =Levels= Morning Land is divided into seven stages, the first one being Forest Village. Usually after the second mission, the player is able to access the next stage. Each stage is divided into a series of 'Missions' that Billy can play through to collect 'Emblems of Courage'. The goal of each Mission is to fulfill the conditions required and collect the Emblem as a reward. The player is graded on their skill in completing the mission and given a rank letter, with an S Rank being the highest. There are eight Missions per stage, and Billy can only play through the first five Missions. Upon rescuing his friends, Rolly, Chick and Bantam would each unlock their respective Missions in the stages and become playable for those Missions only. =Game Boy Advance connectivity= Billy Hatcher is one of a handful of GameCube games that supports linking between the GameCube and Game Boy Advance handheld system. Using the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable, players can load games such as Puyo Pop, ChuChu Rocket!, and Nights: Time Attack on their Game Boy Advance systems after certain objectives are completed within the game, but they must link it with a cartridge for more extended content. Development Producer Yuji Naka stated in an interview with IGN that eggs were chosen as the focus of the game to give the player joy from caring for and hatching eggs, and a feeling of anticipation \\"because you don't know what's going to come out of eggs\\". Animals were incorporated into the game to convey a mood of adventure, in contrast to the digital pet-based Chao creatures highlighted in the previous project, Sonic Adventure 2. The GameCube was chosen for development over the competing PlayStation 2 and Xbox because of its wide audience that Naka felt would appreciate such a family- friendly game. The game uses an engine that Naka called \\"an evolution of the Sonic Adventure 2 engine.\\" The game was exhibited at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003. =PC version= The PC port of the game that was released exclusively in Europe is virtually identical in style to the GameCube version, even to the point where the GameCube button icons are all preserved and are used to represent USB controller buttons or mapped keys. The only visible differences include the removal of the Game Boy Advance minigame linking feature and the absence of the words \\"Licensed By Nintendo\\" on the title screen. The PC version also has small differences in the gameplay as well, such as a slightly altered camera system, minimal load times, the lack of a dead zone while aiming a cannon and a certain enemy requiring two hits to defeat, as opposed to one in the original GameCube version. Reception Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg received mixed to positive reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. Critics praised the visuals and music, gameplay style, presentation and multiplayer mode, while citing issues with the physics, camera, and a very simple plot. It was nominated in the 1st British Academy Game Awards for Best GameCube Game. The game was a commercial bomb, only selling around 250,000 copies worldwide. Due to the game's poor sales, Sega was reluctant to consider a sequel. In spite of this, executive producer Zachary Brown stated that Billy would appear in various other Sega titles, as he did including Sega Superstars, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing.

The programme concerns the lives of a fictional neighborhood in Germany's capital city Berlin. Over the years the soap opera tends to have an overhaul of young people in their late teens and early twenties, targeting a young viewership. Based on the Australian format The Restless Years, which first was successfully adapted in the Netherlands as Goede tijden, slechte tijden, the German version took the scripts of the first 230 episodes, even though heavily rewritten, from the original. After the first year, Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten started using original material. The programme started off with low ratings and was panned by critics. However the network believed in the success of the show and by the autumn of 1993, a serial killer storyline helped to improve the ratings, making GZSZ a success. It not only won its time slot but became also one of the highest-rated programmes, normally ranking in the Top 10 ratings of the day. In 2002, the soap opera reached its peak with over seven million viewers turning in for the 2,500th episode. Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten has tackled with issues like homosexuality, incest, rape, drug addiction, various crimes, breast cancer, bulimia, underage drinking, adoption and mental illnesses. Frank-Thomas Mende and Lisa Riecken were the last original cast members when leaving the show in 2010. Wolfgang Bahro, who joined the show in February 1993, has become the longest-serving actor on the show since. He is described as having become a cult-like figure among soap opera stars, frequently noticed in public.Cult around the character of Jo Gerner Other long-serving actors are Daniel Fehlow, who joined the show in 1996 but has since taken several breaks, and Felix von Jascheroff, who's part of the programme since 2001. Ulrike Frank is currently the longest-serving female cast member, being part of the soap opera in her current role since 2002. GZSZ launched several successful careers in the music industry. The first being original cast member Andreas Elsholz. The most successful ones were Jeanette Biedermann and Yvonne Catterfeld, who both left the soap opera at the peak of their careers. Production The idea to establish a daily soap opera in Germany first came in late 1991. Production company Grundy UFA adapted the Australian format The Restless Years from Reg Watson. The programme was successfully launched in the Netherlands one year earlier. Production on the German adaption, officially now called Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten, started on 23 February 1992. The first episode aired almost three months later, on 11 May 1992. The programme was filmed in a studio in Berlin-Tempelhof for the first three years. In October 1995, production of the show moved to the Filmstudio Babelsberg. This required several set changes. In the beginning it wasn't certain where the show was set. However, in its second year it was established that Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten is set in Berlin. The city has since been used to identify with the format; using several skyline settings in an episode. Rainer Wemcken and Guido Reinhardt have the primary responsibility over the production, with Marie H√∂lker controlling the day-to-day production and overseeing the writing of the programme. The writing is controlled by a team of writers who are known to shift between the other Grundy UFA soaps Alles was z√§hlt, Verbotene Liebe and Unter uns. Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten uses a darker setting than the other three soap operas with sets appearing in modern, mostly dark, colors. Cast *Wolfgang Bahro as Dr. Hans-Joachim \\"Jo\\" Gerner *Daniel Fehlow as Leon Moreno *Felix von Jascheroff as John Bachmann *Ulrike Frank as Katrin Flemming, n√©e Gabriele \\"Gabi\\" Galuba *J√∂rn Schl√∂nvoigt as Philip H√∂fer *Thomas Drechsel as Max \\"Tuner\\" Kr√ºger *Marcel Miska as Marco Lehnert, Enrico Klose and Karl Saske Spin-off In 2000, at the peak of the programmes success, RTL wanted to launch a spin-off, called Gro√üstadttr√§ume (City Dreams), of the highest-rated soap opera. Actress Sandra Keller who vacated her popular role as Tina Zimmermann four years earlier was set to return to star in the new format. However negotiations between the network and Keller fell through. The network decided to recast the popular role. Ulrike Frank, who just starred in the canceled Mallorca ‚Äì Suche nach dem Paradies, was cast. The character of Tina shortly returned to Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten with Frank in the role. Gro√üstadttr√§ume premiered on 8 May 2000. Next to Ulrike Frank as Tina, the show saw the return of Victoria Sturm as Milla Engel. Laurent Daniels, who played Philip Kr√ºger, switched from GZSZ to its spin-off. The programme was about the launch of a lifestyle print magazine, called POOL. It targeted an older viewership well below the age of twenty. The network ordered 26 episodes. However the show wasn't a success. After the premiere the ratings dropped dramatically and Gro√üstadttr√§ume was canceled after only seven aired episodes. The programme was never aired again since then. =Parody= In the German comedy series Freitag Nacht News, they had a sketch called Schlechte Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten (Bad Times, Bad Times or SZSZ) which was a parody of the soap opera. The sketch featured four men who lived together in an apartment, and suffered from severe depression. In every sketch, they kill each other but often kill themselves. Although three of the characters were unnamed, the fourth person was named Clive, whose face was never seen. He is always shown dead in every sketch, mostly hanging himself.

The SCV was founded on July 1, 1896, at the City Auditorium (present-day Virginia Commonwealth University Cary Street Gym) in Richmond, Virginia, by R. E. Lee Camp, No. 1, Confederate Veterans. It is known for erecting and maintaining American Civil War memorials and graves, observing Confederate Memorial Day, and encouraging Southern historical study. In recent decades, governors, legislators, courts, corporations, and anti-racism activists have placed new emphasis on the increasingly controversial public display of Confederate symbolsespecially after the 2014 Ferguson unrest, the 2015 Charleston church shooting, and the 2020 killing of George Floyd. SCV has responded with its coordinated display of larger and more prominent public displays of the battle flag, some in directly defiant counter-protest.  Purpose  The proclaimed purpose of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is \\"to encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of Confederate Memorial Day, to aid and support all members, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier\\". Significant debate has occurred on whether their views represent an accurate interpretation of history or a deliberate distortion of history based on the mythology and ideology of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. A project of the group, the National Confederate Museum, has continued this debate with supporters claiming the museum \\"will be out of the reach of the long arm of political correctness\\". Detractors have stated that \\"casting the Confederacy as a honorable force standing strong against Northern aggressors is a willful misreading of the historical truth that the institution of slavery was at the core of the Civil War\\".  Eligibility  Male descendants of those who served in the Confederate armed forces, or one of the constituent states, to the end of the war, died in prison or while in actual service, were killed in battle, or were honorably retired or discharged, are eligible for membership. Membership can be obtained through either lineal or collateral family lines. Kinship to a veteran must be documented genealogically. The minimum age for full membership is 12 years, but no minimum exists for cadet membership.  History  = Founding = Maryland Division Color Guard at Arlington National Cemetery in 2014 Forty delegates from 24 camps and societies from the various Southern states were called by the R. E. Lee Camp, No. 1, Confederate Veterans (also known as United Confederate Veterans), of Richmond, Virginia, to meet on June 30 and July 1, 1896, at the City Auditorium (present-day Virginia Commonwealth University Cary Street Gym), for the purpose of forming a \\"national organization, adopting a constitution similar in every respect to that governing the United Confederate Veterans, and permanently organized under the name United Sons of Confederate Veterans\\" (USCV). The preamble to the USCV constitution reads in part: \\"To encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of Memorial Day, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier\\". Its aims, objects, and purposes are \\"not to create or foster, in any manner, any feeling against the North, but to hand down to posterity the story of the glory of the men who wore the gray\\". On July 1, the delegates elected Mr. J. E. B. Stuart, of Newport News, Virginia, son of the famous cavalry leader, Commander-in-Chief of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans. = Constitutional crisis = In the 1990s, disagreements over the purpose of the organization emerged within the Sons of Confederate Veterans. At issue was an alleged shift in the Sons of Confederate Veterans's mission from \\"maintaining gravestones, erecting monuments and studying Civil War history\\" to more issue-centric concerns. The Sons of Confederate Veterans's new concerns included \\"fight[ing] for the right to display Confederate symbols everywhere from schools to statehouses\\".Dan Gearino, \\"A Thin Gray Line\\", The News and Observer (Raleigh, NC), August 28, 2002; Tracy Rose, \\"The War Between the Sons: Members fight for control of Confederate group\\". Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC), February 5, 2003, vol 9 iss 26; Jon Elliston, \\"Between heritage and hate: The Sons of Confederate Veterans' internal battle rages on\\". Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC), August 18, 2004, vol 11 iss 3; \\"The battle over flag's meaning: Arguing over the Confederacy's essence\\", Daily Record/Sunday News, (York, PA) September 3, 2006. The more \\"activist\\" members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans gained electoral support and were increasingly elected to its leadership positions. Members of the more traditionalist camp alleged that the League of the South had influenced their organization's new direction. One ally of the activist wing claimed that thousands of Sons of Confederate Veterans members are also League of the South members. News reports state that the activists advocate \\"picketing, aggressive lobbying, issue campaigning, and lawsuits\\" in favor of what they term \\"heritage defense\\" to prevent \\"heritage violations\\". The Sons of Confederate Veterans defines those as \\"any attack upon our Confederate heritage, or the flags, monuments, and symbols which represent it\\". Memorial erected by the SCV in Baxley, Georgia In 2002, dissidents within SCV formed a new organization, Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans, composed of members and former members of SCV. According to Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans co-founder Walter Charles Hilderman, \\"about a hundred or so individuals and groups identified themselves on the Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans web site as supporting Save the SCV\\" not long after the group was founded, though the current membership numbers for the Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans are not available.The Times and Democrat, interview of Walter Charles Hilderman, October 25, 2004 Boyd Cathey reported in the Southern Mercury that most of the dissension had ended by 2003, and the majority of the members of SCV agreed with the heritage preservation activities espoused by the new SCV leadership. One of the main figures in that new SCV leadership, South Carolina politician and investment advisor Ron Wilson, served as Commander-in-Chief from 2002 to 2004. In 2012, he was sentenced to prison for running a Ponzi scheme as part of his investment business; ironically, among those he defrauded were members of the SCV. In early 2005, the SCV General Executive Council sued to expel Commander-in-Chief Dennis Sweeney from office. The court initially granted the council temporary control of the organization, but its final decision returned power to Sweeney. Thirteen of the 25 council members were expelled from the council shortly after Sweeney regained control. Nine of the council members expelled were former commanders-in-chief, a status that heretofore had come with a life membership on the council. In February, Cathey wrote in the Southern Mercury that most of the members of SCV had united against the War on Southern Culture. By the SCV's summer 2005 convention, activists firmly controlled the council. They severed much of the long-standing relationship between SCV and the more traditionalist Military Order of the Stars and Bars (MOSB). The MOSB, founded in 1938, had been closely involved with the SCV, sharing its headquarters since 1992 and co-publishing Southern Mercury. The MOSB's Commander General, Daniel Jones, citing \\"the continuing political turmoil within the SCV,\\" moved the MOSB out of the shared quarters, ended the joint magazine publishing enterprise, and separated the two organizations' finances. In 2006, for the first time, the two organizations held separate conventions.  Controversies  = License plates = Mississippi: In 2011, the Mississippi Division of SCV launched an unsuccessful campaign to honor Confederate Lieutenant General and KKK Grand Wizard Nathan B. Forrest with a specialty license plate. Texas: In 2013, the state of Texas denied a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate, a decision later upheld in state court. That state court decision was later overturned in Federal court, and the matter was ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, which held that Texas was allowed to deny the request for a specialty license plate featuring the group's logo. Virginia: The Virginia General Assembly approved a specialty license plate for the SCV in 1999, but lawmakers forbade the group from displaying the Confederate insignia. The organization sued for the right to display the Confederate battle flag on the license plate, and won a 2001 injunction from a Federal judge requiring the state to include the Confederate insignia. The injunction was upheld by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2015, following the murder by a white supremacist of nine African Americans at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced that the Commonwealth intended to phase out the state- sponsored specialty license plate. More than 1,600 Virginians had the license plates displaying the confederate flag on their vehicles, and the SCV challenged the governor's authority to recall the license plates, citing the 2001 injunction. However, in August 2015, the court dissolved the 2001 injunction, referencing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Texas case. Despite the ruling, hundreds of SCV members who had the specialty plates refused to remove them from their vehicles and exchange them for new plates even after the specialty plates ceased to be valid. Georgia: In 2014, the state of Georgia approved a battle flag specialty license plate. Louisiana: In 1999, state Legislature of Louisiana approved a SCV specialty license plate. Through May 2017, approximately 200 plates had been issued in total. = Jefferson Davis Highway markers = During the late 1990s, a granite marker stone for the Jefferson Davis Highway was removed from its prominent location in the city of Vancouver in Clark County, Washington, resulting in an outcry from the local Northwest Chapter of SCV. The marker stone was eventually placed outside of the Clark County Historical Museum. As Vancouver city officials continued to press for the removal of the stone from any public property within the city's boundaries, the chapter purchased land outside the nearby city of Ridgefield, Washington, during 2007. The chapter then placed the marker stone and a similar highway marker from the city of Blaine, Washington, on its property which faces the busy Interstate 5. The organization then surrounded the stones with large Confederate flags, thus creating a prominent display within an open space that the chapter named Jefferson Davis Park. The chapter's actions brought public outcries, but the governments of Ridgefield and Clark County could do little, as the park is located on private property. The park's prominent location and events in other parts of the nation continue to make the park a local focus of strong emotions, which the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in August 2017 has exacerbated. The vandalism of the stones on August 17, 2017, raised concern for the park, as one marker was covered in black tar or paint and the other was covered in red. In October 2017, the city of Ridgefield formally asked the Clark County Historic Preservation Commission to remove the marker from the County's Heritage Register. The Commission approved the city's request by a 6 to 0 vote. = Marshall House plaque = Marshall House plaque, within a blind arch near a corner of hotel in Alexandria before its removal (2009) In 2017, Marriott International removed a bronze plaque that had been placed years earlier by SCV within a blind arch near a corner of a prominent hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, that Marriott had recently purchased. The plaque commemorated James W. Jackson, who had flown a large Confederate flag on the roof of the Marshall House, an inn that Jackson had owned at the onset of the Civil War. The Marshall House stood at that time on the property that Marriott later acquired.(1) (2) (3) Text and October 2017 responses in When the Union Army entered Alexandria during the morning after Virginia voters ratified secession, a Union Army colonel, Elmer E. Ellsworth, took down the flag, whereupon Jackson fatally shot Ellsworth.(1) (2) A Union Army soldier, who subsequently received the Medal of Honor for his action, immediately shot and bayonetted Jackson, killing him. Shortly after their mutually fatal encounter, Jackson and Ellsworth became heroes to promoters of their respective causes, who hailed them as martyrs during recruiting campaigns. = Confederate flag installations = SCV took a more active approach after both the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, and moves by some municipalities to remove Confederate monuments and flags from public places because of their racist symbolism and historical connection to white-supremacy movements. SCV began installing large Confederate battle flags or \\"mega flags\\" on private property overlooking major highways, a project they called \\"Flags Across the Carolinas\\". In January 2018, the North Carolina chapter vowed to install one flag in every county. Antiracist activists, such as Roland Stanton, criticized the project. Stanton, president of the Durham branch of the North Carolina chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the Confederate flag: \\"is a symbol of oppression, genocide and slavery\\". Stanton described the project as \\"abominable and shameful\\", while acknowledging that the mega flag project activities were protected by the First Amendment. In June 2020, a plane with a Confederate flag banner reading \\"Defund NASCAR\\" was flown over Talladega Superspeedway during the 2020 GEICO 500, protesting NASCAR's recent decision to ban the display of the flag during its events. Sons of Confederate Veterans took credit for the flyover, arguing that NASCAR's actions were a \\"slandering of our Southern heritage\\", and \\"nothing less than trampling upon Southerners' First Amendment Right of free expression\\".  Relationship with SUVCW  SCV has a longstanding and mildly friendly relationship with the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW). The Commander-in-Chief of the SUVCW has attended the SCV annual reunions on multiple occasions, including in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2005, and 2017. The SUVCW cooperates with the SCV in preserving American Civil War graves, monuments, and markers.  Buildings and sites  The General Headquarters of SCV operates the National Confederate Museum at the Elm Springs in Columbia, Tennessee, and the Nathan Bedford Forrest Boyhood Home in Chapel Hill.

Inferior planets The two inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, which have orbits that are smaller than the Earth's, exhibit the full range of phases as does the Moon, when seen through a telescope. Their phases are \\"full\\" when they are at superior conjunction, on the far side of the Sun as seen from the Earth. It is possible to see them at these times, since their orbits are not exactly in the plane of Earth's orbit, so they usually appear to pass slightly above or below the Sun in the sky. Seeing them from the Earth's surface is difficult, because of sunlight scattered in Earth's atmosphere, but observers in space can see them easily if direct sunlight is blocked from reaching the observer's eyes. The planets' phases are \\"new\\" when they are at inferior conjunction, passing more or less between the Sun and the Earth. Sometimes they appear to cross the solar disk, which is called a transit of the planet. At intermediate points on their orbits, these planets exhibit the full range of crescent and gibbous phases. Superior planets The superior planets, orbiting outside the Earth's orbit, do not exhibit the full range of phases as they appear almost always as gibbous or full. However, Mars often appears significantly gibbous, when it is illuminated by the Sun at a very different angle than it is seen by an observer on Earth, so an observer on Mars would see the Sun and the Earth widely separated in the sky. This effect is not easily noticeable for the giant planets, from Jupiter outward, since they are so far away that the Sun and the Earth, as seen from these outer planets, would appear to be in almost the same direction.

Its main settlement is the village of East Grafton, on the A338 Burbage - Hungerford road; the parish includes the village of Wilton (not to be confused with the town of Wilton near Salisbury) and the hamlets of West Grafton, Marten and Wexcombe. The parish is within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, while Marten lies under the northwest edge of the Hampshire Downs. History Prehistoric earthworks in the parish include the long barrow known as Tow Barrow, on Wexcombe Down, south of Wexcombe. Neolithic pottery was found in 1914 when the site was partially excavated by Crawford and Hooton. Marten is one of several possible sites for the murder of Cynewulf of Wessex in 786, and one of several suggested sites for the Battle of Marton in 871, in which √Üthelred of Wessex suffered a defeat by the Viking army. A Roman road between Cirencester and Winchester passes Wilton and Marten. The area was part of the ancient parish of Great Bedwyn, formed from a large estate called Bedwyn which was recorded in 968. The 1086 Domesday Book recorded 16 households at (East) Grafton and six at Marten. Earthworks at Marten, including evidence of a moat, are listed as a deserted medieval village. The Manor Farmhouses at West Grafton and Wilton are from the 17th century; Wexcombe Manor is from the 18th. The southern half of Great Bedwyn parish (south of the railway) became a separate ecclesiastical district in 1844, when the church was built at East Grafton; the civil parish of Grafton was created in 1895. Having no large settlements, the population of the parish changed little in the 20th century. The manor of Wolfhall was transferred to Burbage parish in 1988. Canal and railways  The Kennet and Avon Canal, opened in 1809, passes north of Wilton. Wilton Water was created by damming a spring-fed valley as a reservoir for the summit pound of the canal. Seven of the nine Crofton Locks are within the parish. In 1862 the Great Western Railway built the Berks and Hants Extension Railway from Hungerford to Pewsey and Devizes, closely following the route of the canal; in Grafton parish the line is immediately north of the canal. The local stations were and . The line is still in use as part of the Reading to Taunton line, and Bedwyn station is still open. The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway was built northwards from Andover in 1882, terminating at Grafton and Burbage station which was on the south side of the main road at West Grafton; the next year the line was completed to Marlborough and Swindon. In 1905, owing to traffic for army camps on Salisbury Plain, the two lines were linked by the Grafton Curve and a bridge over the canal. This allowed trains to run between Bedwyn station and Grafton & Burbage. The line and station were closed in 1961.  Church and chapels  The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas at East Grafton was built in 1842-44, to designs by Benjamin Ferrey; before then the parish church was at Great Bedwyn. In 1986 the church was designated as Grade II* listed. East Grafton, Marten and Wilton each had a chapel of ease in the 14th and 15th centuries, and possibly earlier. Wexcombe had a chapel of ease by 1879, where services were conducted by the vicar of Tidcombe from 1899; it closed in the 1920s. In Tidcombe churchyard are 19th- century tombs of members of the Hawkins family of Wexcombe. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built at Wilton in 1811, extended with a schoolroom in 1843 and improved in the 1860s. It closed in 1994 and is in residential use. Primitive Methodist chapels were built at West Grafton by 1874 and at Wexcombe in the 1880s. By the 1960s, both were in residential use. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions.  Amenities and attractions  East Grafton has village hall, the Coronation Hall, built in 1937 and renovated in 2009. There is no school in the parish. A National School was opened at East Grafton in 1846 and improved in the 20th century; it closed in 2011 owing to falling pupil numbers. Wilton has a pub, The Swan. On high ground above Wilton is a working 19th-century flour mill, Wilton Windmill. Crofton Pumping Station, which supplies the Kennet and Avon Canal and has a 200-year-old beam engine, is just beyond the northern boundary of the parish. Its reservoir, Wilton Water, is a nature reserve.

In the last decades of the 20th century, it was replaced with or evolved into Lunfardo.Universidad Ca'Foscari: Cocoliche and Lunfardo (in Spanish) History Between 1880 and 1910, Argentina and Uruguay received a large number of Italian immigrants, mostly poor country folk who arrived with little or no schooling in the Spanish language and often were only semi-literate or totally illiterate in their Italian languages. As those immigrants strove to communicate with the local criollos, they produced a variable mixture of Spanish with Standard Italian (Florentine) and Italian languages, which was given the derogatory name Cocoliche by the locals. Italian proper never took hold very well in Argentina, especially because most immigrants used their local languages, and were not proficient in the standard language. This prevented the development of an Italian-language culture. Since the children of the immigrants grew up speaking Spanish at school, work, and military service, Cocoliche remained confined mostly to the first and second generation of Italian immigrants, and slowly fell out of use. The pidgin was depicted humorously in literary works and in the Argentine sainete theater, e.g. by Dario Vittori. The area where most Italian emigrants and their descendants spoke the Cocoliche was near the port of Buenos Aires, mainly in the barrios Belgrano and Palermo. These two areas were 70% speaking \\"Cocoliche\\" at the beginning of the 20th century. Additionally it is noteworthy to pinpoint that it was in the \\"barrio\\" La Boca of Buenos Aires, where the local slang at the end of the XIX century was the Genoese dialect called \\"Xeneise\\", that was used for the first time the word \\"Lunfardo\\" by those Genoese for the language/dialect used by the local criminals (mostly Italians but even Spanish, French, Portuguese, Indian, etc...): later in the XX century the Lunfardo assimilated the Cocoliche, that disappeared after World War II. Influence Many Cocoliche words were transferred to the Lunfardo (a local Spanish dialect that some linguists -like Garbarino- think it is a mixture of Spanish, Lombard, and Italian). For example: * manyar (to eat) from Venetian and Lombard \\"magnar\\" (mangiare in Italian) * lonyipietro (fool) * fungi (mushroom) -> in Lunfardo: hat * vento (wind) -> in Lunfardo: money * matina (morning) from Italian \\"mattina\\" * mina (girl) from Lombard \\"mina\\" (busty woman or prostitute) * laburar (to work) from Italian \\"lavorare\\" * minga (nothing) from Lombard \\"minga\\" (negative particle like not in English or ne pas in French) * yeta (bad luck) from Neapolitan \\"iettatore\\" * yira (to go for a walk) from Italian \\"girare\\" * salute (cheers) from Italian \\"salute\\" * fiaca (laziness) from Italian \\"fiacca\\" Some of these words show a characteristic codialect evolution, for example in the case of manyar, the word manyar exists with the same meaning in Spanish even though it is considered jargon and not proper Spanish, being derived from Occitan and reinforced by the Italian .

It is said to be named after Coel Hen, a king of the Britons, who was reputedly killed in battle in this area and is said to be buried in a cairn near Mauchline. Geographical Extent The area is bordered by the historical districts of Cunninghame to the north, Clydesdale to the east and by Carrick to the south. The Firth of Clyde lies to the west. Kyle was the central of the three districts in the sheriffdom of Ayr (Ayrshire), which was divided naturally by its three primary rivers all running in a generally westward direction to flow into the firth of Clyde. The River Irvine forms the northern boundary of Kyle with Cunninghame; the River Doon established its southern boundary with Carrick. Additionally, Kyle itself was sub-divided into two parts. To the north of the River Ayr was \\"Kyle Stewart\\" (sometimes called \\"Stewart Kyle\\" or \\"Walter's Kyle\\"), lands held by the FitzAlans (the future Stewart Kings of Scotland) since the 12th century. To the south was \\"Kyle Regis\\" or \\"King's Kyle\\", lands historically retained by the monarch under royal authority from the royal castle at Ayr. Kyle was combined with Cunninghame and Carrick under Ayrshire County Council as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889; this Act established a uniform system of county councils and town councils in Scotland and restructured many of Scotland‚Äôs areas. Kyle and Carrick District From 1975 to 1996 Kyle and Carrick was the name of a local government district in Strathclyde region, although the larger part of historic Kyle formed Cumnock and Doon Valley district. In 1996 Kyle and Carrick was constituted as a Unitary Authority, but renamed South Ayrshire. Council ward In local government the area of Kyle makes up a council ward, bordering the council wards of Troon; Prestwick; Ayr North and Maybole, North Carrick & Coylton in the South Ayrshire Council area. It has 3 local councillors belonging to the Conservative Party, the Scottish National Party and the Labour Party. The area of Kyle includes the villages of Annbank, Mossblown, Tarbolton, Monkton, Symington and Dundonald as well as a number of smaller surrounding settlements such as Craigie, St Quivox and Loans. The area encompasses the northern portion of South Ayrshire excluding Troon, Prestwick and Ayr. It is bounded by the northern and eastern borders of the South Ayrshire Council area, which border North and East Ayrshire respectively. The southern border of the area follows the River Ayr between Ayr and the administrative border between South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. Kyle Castle At Dalblair near Cumnock, at the confluence of Guelt and Glenmuirshaw Waters, lie the ruins of the once impressive 15th century Kyle Castle.

That area is leased by the Canadian Coast Guard. Because of the location in a high tidal current area, there is an exceptional variety of marine life to be found, including marine mammals, sea birds, fish, marine invertebrates, and marine algae and sea grass. It is a haulout area for California and Northern sealions and a birthing rookery for Harbour seals and it is also the most northerly birthing colony on the Pacific Coast of North America for the elephant seal,Mirounga-angustirostris.http://www.racerocks.ca/race-rocks-animals- plants/elephant-seals-mirounga-angustirostris-at-race-rocks/ History The idea of protecting Race Rocks came about following a marine science project by the students of Pearson College UWC under the supervision and guidance of their teachers, Garry Fletcher and Marks McAvity, in 1978. They described an area of great biodiversity and ecological importance. In 1980, the rocks and surrounding areas were protected as an ecological reserve under joint BC Parks-Pearson College UWC management.http://www.racerocks.ca/history-of-race- rocks-ecological-reserve/ In 1998, Race Rocks was proposed to become the first marine protected area of Canada. However, Fisheries and Oceans Canada deemed the site unfit for the new designation and the bid was cancelled in 2000. Instead, the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents would go on to become the first marine protected area in 2003. In 2006 and 2007, the Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project was installed. After a six-year period for experimental research, the tidal energy generator was removed.

Its range of mints and fruit-flavored candies is known for its distinctive packaging, coming in paper-wrapped aluminum foil rolls. Candy manufacturer Clarence Crane of Garrettsville, Ohio (father of the poet Hart Crane) invented the brand in 1912 as a \\"summer candy\\" that could withstand heat better than chocolate. The candy's name is due to the fact that its shape resembles that of a traditional ring-style life preserver also known as a \\"life saver\\". After registering the trademark, Crane sold the rights to his Pep-O-Mint peppermint candy to Edward John Noble for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very successful, Noble created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh. Noble founded the Life Savers and Candy Company in 1913 and significantly expanded the market for the product by installing Life Savers displays next to the cash registers of restaurants and grocery stores. He also encouraged the owners of the establishments to always give customers a nickel in their change to encourage sales of the 5¬¢ Life Savers. The slogan \\"Still only 5 cents\\" helped Life Savers to become a favorite treat for children with a tight allowance. Since then, many different flavors of Life Savers have been produced. The five-flavor roll first appeared in 1935. A series of mergers and acquisitions by larger companies began in 1956. Life Savers is currently a property of Mars, Incorporated. In recent decades, the brand expanded to include Gummi Savers in 1992, Life Saver Minis in 1996, Creme Savers in 1998, and Life Saver Fusions in 2001. Discontinued varieties include Fruit Juicers, Holes, Life Saver Lollipops, and Squeezit. In 1995, a Life Savers drink was introduced to compete with Snapple and Fruitopia, but it was quickly discontinued. verbicide magazine,13 March 2013. History Life Savers was first created in 1912 by Clarence Crane, a Garrettsville, Ohio, candy maker (and father of the famed poet Hart Crane). Clarence had switched from the maple sugar business to chocolates the year before, but found that they sold poorly in the summer, because air conditioning was rare and they melted. He saw a machine pharmacies used to make pills that were round and wafer-shaped, and thought he'd use those to make mints, which at the time were made square (because they were pressed in sheets and then sliced into squares).10 Things You Might Not Know about Life Savers The machinery could also punch a hole in the center, and Crane named the candy after its resulting life preserver shape. In 1913, Crane sold the formula for his Life Savers candy to Edward Noble of Gouverneur, New York for $2,900. Noble started his own candy company and began producing and selling the mints known as Pep-O-Mint Life Savers. He also began to package the mints into rolls wrapped in tin foil to keep them from going stale. This process was done by hand until 1919 when machinery was developed by Edward Noble's brother, Robert Peckham Noble, to streamline the process. 1917 newspaper ad for the product, showing the product packaging and the varieties available. Robert was a Purdue-educated engineer. He took his younger brother's entrepreneurial vision and designed and built the manufacturing facilities needed to expand the company. The primary manufacturing plant for Life Savers was located in Port Chester, New York, a local landmark replete with a Life Savers motif cast into the cornice. Robert led the company as its Chief Executive Officer and primary shareholder for more than 40 years, until selling the company in the late 1950s. By 1919, six other flavors (Wint-O- Green, Cl-O-Ve, Lic-O-Rice, Cinn-O-Mon, Vi-O-Let and Choc-O-Late) had been developed, and these remained the standard flavors until the late 1920s. In 1920, a new flavor called Malt-O-Milk was introduced. This flavor was received so poorly that it was discontinued after only a few years.New Yorker Magazine, 28 February 1925, pp. 47‚Äì50. In 1925, the tinfoil was replaced with aluminum foil. Noble promoted the candy at the cash registers of saloons, cigar stores, drug stores, barber shops, and restaurants. He had the candy placed, with a five-cent price, near the cash register. In 1921, the company began to produce solid fruit drops. In 1925, technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies. These were introduced as the \\"fruit drop with the hole\\" and came in Orange, Lemon and Lime, each of which were packaged in their own separate rolls. In contrast to the opaque white mints previously produced by the company, these new candies were crystal-like in appearance. These new flavors quickly became popular with the public. Four new flavors were quickly introduced, namely, anise, butter rum, cola and root beer, which were made in the clear fruit drop style. These did not prove to be as popular as the three original fruit drop flavors. In 1931, the Life Savers \\"Cough Drop\\" was introduced with menthol, but it was not successful. In 1931, rolls of pineapple and cherry fruit drops were also introduced. As the public response proved positive for these, a new variety of mint called Cryst-O-Mint, made in this same crystal-like style, was introduced in 1932. In 1935, the classic \\"Five Flavor\\" rolls were introduced, offering a selection of five different flavors (pineapple, lime, orange, cherry, and lemon) in each roll. This flavor lineup was unchanged for nearly 70 years, until 2003, when three of the flavors were replaced in the United States, making the rolls pineapple, cherry, raspberry, watermelon, and blackberry. However, orange was subsequently reintroduced and blackberry was dropped. The original five flavor lineup is still sold in Canada. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, four new mint flavors were introduced: Molas-O-Mint, Spear-O-Mint, Choc-O-Mint and Stik-O-Pep. During the Second World War, other candy manufacturers donated their sugar rations to keep Life Savers in production so that the little candies could be shared with Armed Forces as a tasty reminder of life at home. Soon after the war ended, the manufacturing license was withdrawn. In 1947, U.K.-based Rowntree's‚Äîwhich formerly had been licensed to make Life Savers‚Äîstarted to manufacture a similar product called the Polo mint. In 1981, Nabisco Brands Inc. acquired Life Savers from the E.R. Squibb Corporation. A number of early mint flavors, including Cl-O-Ve, Vi-O-Let, Lic-O-Rice and Cinn-O-Mon were discontinued due to poor sales. Nabisco introduced a new Cinnamon flavor (\\"Hot Cin-O-Mon\\") as a clear fruit drop-type candy. This replaced the white mint flavor Cinn-O-Mon, which had recently been discontinued. The other original mint flavors were retired. A number of other flavors were also quickly discontinued, after Nabisco took over, in order to make the business more profitable. In 2004, the U.S. Life Savers business was acquired by Wrigley's. Wrigley's introduced two new mint flavors (for the first time in over 60 years) in 2006: Orange Mint and Sweet Mint. They also revived some of the early mint flavors (such as Wint-O-Green). Life Savers production was based in Holland, Michigan, until 2002 when it was moved to Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada. Significantly lower sugar prices in that country were the reason behind the move. The company's headquarters in Port Chester, New York, where Life Savers were made from 1920 until 1984, was distinctive. Although it has been converted to apartments, it still retains some Lifesavers signage. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the partition of India in 1947, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non- contiguous East Bengal province having a mainly Bengali population. In 1948, the Government of the Dominion of Pakistan ordained Urdu as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956. The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the 6-Point Movement and subsequently the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987. In Bangladesh, 21 February (Ekushey February) is observed as Language Movement Day, a national holiday. The Shaheed Minar monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims.

Background The current nations, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were part of an undivided India during the British colonial rule. From the mid-19th century, the Urdu language had been promoted as the lingua franca of Indian Muslims by political and religious leaders, such as Sir Khwaja Salimullah, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq. Urdu is an Indo- Aryan language of the Indo-Iranian branch, closely related to Hindi and belonging to the Indo-European family of languages. It developed under Persian, Arabic and Turkic influence on apabhramshas (last linguistic stage of the medieval Indian Aryan language Pali-Prakrit) in South Asia during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. With its Perso-Arabic script, the language was considered a vital element of the Islamic culture for Indian Muslims; Hindi and the Devanagari script were seen as fundamentals of Hindu culture. While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of Bengal (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language. Bengali is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language that arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages around 1000 CE and developed considerably during the Bengal Renaissance. As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the Muslim feminist Roquia Sakhawat Hussain were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language. Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the partition of India, when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 Lucknow session of the Muslim League. The Muslim League was a British Indian political party that became the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state separate from British India. Early stages of the movement Britain's holdings on the Indian subcontinent were granted independence in 1947 and 1948, becoming four new independent states: the Dominion of India, the Union of Burma (now Myanmar), Dominion of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and the Dominion of Pakistan (including East Bengal, from 1956 East Pakistan, 1971-today Bangladesh). After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous eastern part of the Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In November 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu and English as the sole state languages. Opposition and protests arose immediately. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka. Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer Abul Mansur Ahmed said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions. The first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor Nurul Huq Bhuiyan of the Tamaddun Majlish convened the committee. Later, Parliament member Shamsul Huq convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language. Assembly member Dhirendranath Datta proposed legislation in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes. Datta's proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, Bhupendra Kumar Datta and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region. Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated. =Agitations of 1948= Muhammad Ali Jinnah on 21 March 1948 told at a public meeting that State language of Pakistan is going to be Urdu and no other language. Students of the University of Dhaka and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, Shawkat Ali, M Sirajul Islam, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader Mohammad Toaha was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including Abdul Matin and Abdul Malek Ukil took part in the procession. In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister Khawaja Nazimuddin's house was stopped in front of the Dhaka High Court. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including A. K. Fazlul Huq. Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language. In the height of civic unrest, Governor-General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at Racecourse Ground, he claimed that the language issue was designed by a \\"fifth column\\" to divide Pakistani Muslims. Jinnah further declared that \\"Urdu, and only Urdu\\" embodied the spirit of Muslim nations and would remain as the state language, labelling those who disagreed with his views as \\"Enemies of Pakistan\\". Jinnah delivered a similar speech at Curzon Hall of the University of Dhaka on 24 March. At both meetings, Jinnah was interrupted by large segments of the audience. He later called a meeting of a state language committee of action, and overruled the contract that was signed by Khawaja Nazimuddin with the student leaders. Before Jinnah left Dhaka on 28 March, he delivered a speech on radio reasserting his \\"Urdu-only\\" policy. Shortly thereafter, the East Bengal Language Committee, presided by Maulana Akram Khan, was formed by the East Bengal government to prepare a report on the language problem. The Committee completed its report on 6 December 1950. Events of 1952 Procession march held on 4 February 1952 at Nawabpur Road, Dhaka. Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in Dhaka The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general Khawaja Nazimuddin, staunchly defended the \\"Urdu-only\\" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952. On 31 January, the Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by Maulana Bhashani. The central government's proposal of writing the Bengali language in Arabic script was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies. In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed Section 144 in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering. =21 February= At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Sofiur Rahman, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests. =22 February= Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned the actions of the police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee Press and the Morning News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah. =Continued unrest= janaja at Dhaka Medical College on the University Dhaka road, Dhaka. Through the night of 23 February, students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a Shaheed Smritistombho, or Monument of Martyrs. Completed at dawn on 24 February, the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words \\"Shaheed Smritistombho\\". Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist Sofiur Rahman, the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police. On 25 February, industrial workers in the town of Narayanganj observed a general strike. A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating. The government censored news reports and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests. Most pro-government media held Hindus and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest. The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried to charge the police with murder, but the charges were dismissed by the police. On 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students. =Reaction in West Pakistan= Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for ethnic nationalism in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan. In the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan, the movement was seen as a sectional uprising against Pakistani national interests. The rejection of the \\"Urdu-only\\" policy was seen as a contravention of the Perso-Arabic culture of Muslims and the founding ideology of Pakistan, the two-nation theory. Some of the most powerful politicians from the western wing of Pakistan considered Urdu a product of Indian Islamic culture, but saw Bengali as a part of \\"Hinduized\\" Bengali culture. Most stood by the \\"Urdu only\\" policy because they believed that only a single language, one that was not indigenous to Pakistan, should serve as the national language. This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing, wherein there existed several linguistic groups. As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, \\"East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence.\\" Events after 1952 Foundation of the Shaheed Minar laid down in Dhaka by Abul Barkat's family members. The Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod, with support from the Awami Muslim League, decided to commemorate 21 February as Shohid Dibosh . On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners. However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an \\"enemy of the state\\". Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning. =United Front in 1954= Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition United Front coalition, which‚Äîled by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League‚Äîwanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested. A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low. The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the Bangla Academy to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage. However, the United Front rule was temporary, as Governor General Ghulam Muhammad cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954. The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though. Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed. =Constitutional status as a state language= On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali. Bengali was adopted as an official language of Pakistan along with Urdu in the article 214(1) when the first constitution of Pakistan was enacted on 29 February 1956. However, the military government formed by Ayub Khan made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages. =Assam= Outside East Bengal, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of Assam. On 19 May 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in police firing in Silchar Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given co-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam. =Independence of Bangladesh= The second Shaheed Minar (martyrs' monument) completed in 1963 Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan at the expense of East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under- represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War. Legacy =Bangladesh= Shaheed Minar, or the Martyr's monument, located near Dhaka Medical College commemorates those who lost their lives during the protests on 21 February 1952 The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or Shohid Dibosh (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the Ekushey Book Fair is held every year to commemorate the movement. Ekushey Padak, one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement. Songs such as Abdul Gaffar Choudhury's Ekusher Gaan, set to music by Shaheed Altaf Mahmud, as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement. Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala and February 1969 by Shamsur Rahman, the film Jibon Theke Neya by Zahir Raihan, the stage play Kobor by Munier Chowdhury and the novels Ekushey February by Raihan and Artonaad by Shawkat Osman. Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new Shaheed Minar (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect Hamidur Rahman began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry, and approved by a planning committee chaired by University of Dhaka Vice-Chancellor Mahmud Husain and College of Fine Arts principal Zainul Abedin. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by Abul Barkat's mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973. Ekushey Television, the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February. =India= The states of West Bengal and Tripura in India also follow and celebrate the Day by paying tribute to the unsung heroes. Moreover, all the Bengalis in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives just for the sake of the first language. The Silchar railway station has prominent portraits and a memorial of the 11 students who were killed in firing. The station in called Bhasha Shahid Railway station. =Worldwide= Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as International Mother Language Day. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.

Tampions can be found on both land-based artillery and naval guns. Naval tampions have developed into works of art.  History  Although the cannon of ships of the line were protected as they were retracted inside the ships, many smaller vessels had exposed gundecks which required a plug to protect inside of the barrels. To combat rust when ships were not in action the barrels were sealed, both with a tampion and plugs in the touch hole. A quantity of olive oil and a round shot were left inside in the barrel; With the gun laid horizontally the shot would roll up and down the barrel as the ship caught each wave, effectively lubricating the gun simply through the motion of the ship.Morris, 2006, p. 110. Later, the invention of mobile gun turrets meant that all guns were constantly exposed to water. Hence, when not in use, naval guns were protected by wooden, and, later, rubber, muzzle plugs. They were also used to protect the barrel whenever the guns were placed in storage, for example in the hold where moisture could cause corrosion, and sealed in with putty.Simmons, 1812, p. 65. Typically, rubber and plastic tampions can be shot through in case of an emergency. Plastic tampions are normally designed to be expelled by the build-up of pressure in the barrel as the first shell is fired. Over time, tampions were embossed or engraved with the arms of the unit, and they became collector's items. Nowadays, even warships that typically would not carry heavy guns, such as submarines, have their own badges in the shape of a tampion.

Roberts, a Navy coxswain who was killed evacuating Marines during the battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. The crew nicknamed the ship the \\"Steamin' Sammy B.\\" for its busy schedule. The second Samuel B. Roberts was laid down on 27 June 1945 by the Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas; launched on 30 November 1945; sponsored by the namesake coxswain's mother; and commissioned on 22 December 1946, Cmdr. C. T. Doss in command. 1947 ‚Äì 1953 Following shakedown training off Guantanamo Bay in February 1947, Samuel B. Roberts joined the Atlantic Fleet. The ship participated in Atlantic Fleet maneuvers before proceeding to the Mediterranean in January 1948. Returning to the United States in June, the destroyer began another year of operations along the East Coast of the United States. A second tour of foreign duty took the ship to northern Europe from May to September 1949. Roberts participated in western Atlantic operations until March 1950, when the ship sailed to the Mediterranean to join the 6th Fleet until October. Following operations in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, the Roberts got underway for Scotland on 10 September 1952 to join NATO forces in \\"Operation Mainbrace\\", before proceeding to the Mediterranean to join the 6th Fleet. Two months later, in November, the ship returned for duty off northern Europe, and finally sailed for the United States, arriving at Newport on 29 January 1953. 1953 ‚Äì 1957 Samuel B. Roberts operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean from early 1953 until 3 August 1954, when the ship headed for the western Pacific, via the Panama Canal, to begin an around-the- world cruise. The destroyer spent five months in the waters around Japan and the Philippines, then sailed across the Indian Ocean and through the Suez Canal, arriving home on 14 March 1955. The remainder of 1955 was spent in local operations with the exception of a hastily ordered voyage in July to a lifeguard station off Greenland during President Eisenhower's flight to Geneva. Western Atlantic operations in early 1956 gave way to foreign duty when Roberts again joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 27 September. On 25 October, Roberts weighed anchor for the Persian Gulf and duty with the Middle East Force. The destroyer transited the Suez Canal on the night of 27/28 October, the last warship to transit the canal southbound before it was closed during the invasion of Egypt. The ship was then on duty with the Middle East Force until sailing for home by way of Pakistan, India, East Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, and Brazil. Roberts arrived in Newport on 14 March 1957. With the exception of a Midshipman Cruise to Rio de Janeiro, Samuel B. Roberts remained near Newport until mid-September. The ship then participated in NATO exercises off northern Europe and returned to the United States on 22 October 1957. 1958 In March 1958, after a three-month overhaul, the destroyer moved into the Caribbean for refresher training. In May, the exercises were interrupted. Roberts deployed hastily to Venezuela and prepared to evacuate United States nationals following the violence during Vice President Nixon's visit to South America. By the 15th, however, the situation was under control. Roberts was relieved and returned to Newport. Two months later, the ship was ordered to Morehead City, North Carolina, to rendezvous with amphibious units carrying Marine reinforcements to the Mediterranean during the Lebanon crisis. By 25 July, the reinforcements were no longer needed. Roberts, as part of Destroyer Squadron 10, escorted the amphibious units to Puerto Rico, whence the destroyers continued on to the Mediterranean. Arriving on 10 August, Roberts cruised off the coast of Lebanon from 17 August to 25 August and again from 2 to 20 September to furnish gunfire support to the troops on the beach if it proved necessary. On 17 September, the ship transited the Suez Canal on the way to the Persian Gulf for a few weeks. On the trip home, Roberts returned through the canal on 19 October, passed Gibraltar on 4 November, and arrived at the United States on 13 November. 1959 ‚Äì 1960 Roberts operated continuously in the western Atlantic until 15 June 1959, when the destroyer sailed from Newport for the St. Lawrence River to participate in Operation \\"Inland Seas\\", the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. After official ceremonies attended by Queen Elizabeth and President Eisenhower, Roberts transited the Seaway and crossed Lake Ontario and Lake Erie to arrive at Detroit, Michigan, on 3 July. On 20 July, Roberts moved into Lake Michigan with the first destroyer division to traverse all five Great Lakes. On 27 July, Roberts headed for the Atlantic again and arrived at Newport on 12 September. After further U.S. East Coast activities, Roberts joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 31 March 1960. On 29 May, the ship headed through the Suez Canal to join the Middle East Force; on 30 June, the destroyer rejoined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. On 15 October, Roberts returned to Newport. 1962 ‚Äì 1966 Roberts spent most of 1961 undergoing a FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The refurbished destroyer returned to Newport on 26 February 1962 and remained in the western Atlantic for the rest of 1962 and most of 1963. During April and June of the latter year, the ship operated off the northern New England coast in search of the missing submarine, . In October 1963, Roberts resumed overseas operations; and, for the next two years, rotated between duty in the western Atlantic and tours with the 6th Fleet. In the fall of 1965, however, the ship headed south; transited the Panama Canal; and moved to the western Pacific to join the 7th Fleet. The destroyer operated primarily in Vietnamese and Philippine waters until 19 February 1966, then steamed for home via the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. Returning to Newport, R.I., on 8 April, Roberts cruised in the Atlantic and Caribbean until deploying to the Mediterranean again on 8 December. 1967 ‚Äì 1971 A-6As of VA-34, 1971. Samuel B. Roberts returned to Newport on 20 March, and remained in Atlantic and Caribbean waters until 10 January 1968, when the ship sailed on another tour of Mediterranean duty, returning to Newport on 17 May. The remainder of the year was spent in Atlantic operations, then Atlantic and Caribbean duty until deploying to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 22 November 1969. The ship steamed in the Black Sea from 9 to 12 December and returned to Newport on 22 May 1970. In August 1970, the Inspection and Survey team ruled the ship unfit for further service. The crew stripped her for decommissioning, and the ship was struck from the Navy List on 2 November. Roberts joined the Inactive Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until she was sunk as a target in the Atlantic Ocean 195 nautical miles (224 miles; 361 km) north of Puerto Rico on 14 November 1971. The ship's final resting place is , 3000 fathoms (18,000 feet; 5,486 meters) below the surface.

Clymer was a member of the Hiester family political dynasty and the Democratic Party. He was the nephew of William Muhlenberg Hiester and the cousin of Isaac Ellmaker Hiester. Although Clymer was born in Pennsylvania, he was adamantly opposed to Abraham Lincoln's administration and the Republican Party's prosecution of the American Civil War. Elected Pennsylvania state senator in 1860, Clymer opposed state legislation that supported the state Republican Party's war effort. After the American Civil War ended, Clymer unsuccessfully ran for the Pennsylvania Governor's office in 1866 on a white supremacist platform against Union Major- General John W. Geary. After his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872 as a Democrat, Clymer would be primarily known for his investigation of Sec. William W. Belknap's War Department in 1876. Belknap escaped conviction in a Senate trial, since he resigned his cabinet position before being impeached by the House of Representatives. Having retired from the House in 1881, Clymer served as Vice President of the Union Trust Co. of Philadelphia and president of the Clymer Iron Co. until his death in 1884. Early life Clymer was born near Morgantown, Pennsylvania. He attended Princeton University, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1849. Clymer practiced law in Berks County and Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. His brother, Edward M. Clymer, married the actress and poet, Ella Maria Dietz. Political career A racist pro-Clymer campaign poster for the 1866 governor's election. He was a delegate to the national conventions of the Democratic Party in 1860 and 1868. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 8th district from 1861 to 1866. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1866 on a white supremacist policy, losing to John W. Geary. In the controversial campaign, Clymer's camp produced some of the most virulently graphic racist posters and pamphlets of the decade. =U.S. Representative (1873‚Äì1881)= He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1872 and served from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1881. While in Congress, he served on the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State, and as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. Retirement and death After he left Congress, he served as vice president of the Union Trust Company in Philadelphia and as president of the Clymer Iron Company.

In climactic battles at the end of the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Campaign, usually referred to as the Siege of Petersburg,The campaign was not a true siege because the Confederate Army and the cities of Petersburg and Richmond were never surrounded and actions took place at locations other than Petersburg, principally in the Richmond area. See the Siege of Petersburg article for further details. starting with Lewis's Farm, the Union Army commanded by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant dislodged the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia commanded by General Robert E. Lee from defensive lines at Petersburg, Virginia and the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Many historians and the United States National Park Service consider the Battle of Lewis's Farm to be the opening battle of the Appomattox Campaign, which resulted in the surrender of Lee's army on April 9, 1865.Bryce A. Suderow, in his introduction to Chapter 5 of Ed Bearss's 2014 edition of Volume II of The Petersburg Campaign: The Western Front Battles, September 1864-April 1865, says this battle should be considered \\"the first battle of what should be viewed as the Five Forks Campaign.\\" Bearss, 2014, p. 313.National Park Service Civil War Battle Summaries by Campaign (Eastern Theater).Calkins, Chris M. The Appomattox Campaign, March 29 - April 9, 1865. Conshohocken, PA: Combined Books, 1997. . p. 12. In the early morning of March 29, 1865, two corps of the Union Army of the Potomac, the V Corps (Fifth Corps) under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren and the II Corps (Second Corps) under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys, moved to the south and west of the Union line south of Petersburg toward the end of the Confederate line. The Confederate defenses were manned by the Fourth Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson. The corps only included the division of Major General Bushrod Johnson. Turning north and marching up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate line, Warren's lead brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain, engaged three brigades of Johnson's division at the Lewis Farm. Reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and later relieved by two large regiments from the brigade commanded by Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory, the Union troops ultimately forced the Confederates back to their defenses and captured an important road junction. Chamberlain was wounded and narrowly escaped capture. Union Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson was awarded the Medal of Honor 32 years later for his heroic actions at the battle. Casualties were nearly even at 381 for the Union and 371 for the Confederates, but as the battle ended, Warren's corps held an important objective, a portion of the Boydton Plank Road at its junction with the Quaker Road. Within hours, Major General Philip Sheridan's cavalry corps, which was still acting apart from the Army of the Potomac as the Army of the Shenandoah, occupied Dinwiddie Court House. This action also severed the Boydton Plank Road. The Union forces were close to the Confederate line and poised to attack the Confederate flank, the important road junction of Five Forks and the two Confederate railroad lines to Petersburg and Richmond that remained open to the two cities. On April 2-3, 1865, the Confederates evacuated Petersburg and Richmond and began to move to the west. After a number of setbacks and mostly small battles, but including a significant Confederate defeat at the Battle of Sailor's Creek on April 6, 1865, Lee surrendered his army to Grant and his pursuing Union Army on April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Lynchburg, Virginia. By the end of June 1865, all Confederate armies had surrendered and the Confederacy's government had collapsed. Background =Military situation= =Richmond-Petersburg Campaign= On June 15-18, 1864, two Union Army corps, moved unobserved from the stalemated battle lines just north of Richmond across the James River to the south of Petersburg, Virginia. The Union force which joined with the Union Army of the James at Petersburg failed to seize the city from a small force of Confederate defenders at the Second Battle of Petersburg. By June 18, 1864, the Army of Northern Virginia had reinforced the defenders and the 292-day Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) had begun.Hess, Earl J. In the Trenches at Petersburg: Field Fortifications & Confederate Defeat. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009. . pp. 18-37. Grant's strategy had to become a campaign of trench warfare attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the Confederate Army, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and to extend the lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point.Beringer, Richard E., Herman Hattaway, Archer Jones, and William N. Still, Jr. Why the South Lost the Civil War. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1986. . pp. 331-332.Trudeau, Noah Andre. The Last Citadel: Petersburg, Virginia, June 1864-April 1865. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1991. . p. 18. During the rest of 1864 and early 1865, Grant slowly moved his forces in the Union line south of Petersburg to the west in six more Petersburg offensives, usually with simultaneous attacks at or near the Richmond lines.Hess, 2009, pp. 18-37.Sommers, Richard J.

Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2000. . p. 432. With supplies and men increasingly hard for Lee to obtain or replace, he knew that his army could not defend Petersburg and Richmond from the growing Union forces indefinitely, especially with the expected arrival of Union reinforcements from recent recruits in training, Major General Philip Sheridan's cavalry divisions from the Shenandoah Valley and possibly even Major General William T. Sherman's armies already operating in North Carolina when the roads dried out after spring rains abated.Trudeau, 1991, pp. 324-325.Greene, A. Wilson.

He then knew that part or all of his army must leave the Richmond and Petersburg lines, obtain food and supplies at Danville, Virginia or possibly Lynchburg, Virginia and join General Joseph E. Johnston's force opposing Sherman's army. If the Confederates could quickly defeat Sherman, they might turn back to oppose Grant before he could combine his forces with the remainder of Sherman's.Greene, 2008, p. 154.Calkins, 1997, pp. 14, 16.Hess, 2009, p. 253.Longacre, Edward G. The Cavalry at Appomattox: A Tactical Study of Mounted Operations During the Civil War's Climactic Campaign, March 27 ‚Äì April 9, 1865. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2003. . p. 39. Lee began preparations for the movement and informed Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge of his conclusions and plan.Trudeau, 1991, pp. 324‚Äì325.Hattaway, 1983, pp. 669‚Äì671. Lee accepted Major General John B. Gordon's proposal to attempt to break the Union lines and threaten their supply base at City Point, Virginia by attacking along a narrow front near Fort Stedman, east of Petersburg and south of the Appomattox River, in order to compel Grant to shorten his lines, at least temporarily.Trudeau, 1991, pp. 337-352. If successful, this could give Lee an opportunity to shorten his lines and an opening and head start in a movement to the west and toward North Carolina.Greene, 2008, p. 108.Davis, William C. An Honorable Defeat: The Last Days of the Confederate Government. New York: Harcourt, Inc., 2001. . p. 49. After Gordon's Confederates surprise attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hour of March 25, 1865 had some initial success, a Union counterattack at the Battle of Fort Stedman recaptured the fort and forced the Confederates to return to their lines and give up their advance picket line, including much of the western part of that line in the afternoon at the Battle of Jones's Farm. The Confederates suffered about 4,000 casualties which they could ill afford.Greene, 2008, pp. 114-115.Calkins, 1997, p. 12. After the defeat at Fort Stedman, Lee knew that he could not detach part of his army and be able to maintain the defenses of Petersburg and Richmond. He also knew that Grant would soon move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the Southside Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, beyond the end of his current defenses.Calkins, 1997, p. 16. =Grant's orders= Grant already had issued orders on March 24, 1865 for an offensive to begin on March 29 and was not deterred by the Battle of Fort Stedman. Grant planned for Sheridan's cavalry to cut the remaining open railroads, the Southside Railroad and the Richmond and Danville Railroad to Richmond, and for the infantry to turn the Confederates out of their positions if possible. On March 28, Grant told Sheridan to lead his troops around the Confederate right flank and to fight the Confederates, with infantry support, if the Confederates came out of their trenches.Greene, 2008, p. 152. Otherwise, Sheridan should wreck the railroads as much as possible and either return to the Petersburg lines or join Sherman in North Carolina at his discretion.Sheridan had no desire or intention to go to North Carolina. Grant assured him that was not Grant's plan and Sheridan had the discretion to join Sherman only if he needed it. Greene, 2008, p. 151.Hess, 2009, pp. 254-255. Grant ordered two corps of the Army of the Potomac, the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren and the II Corps under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys, to support Sheridan on his right flank, to the east of his objectives. Grant wanted these infantry corps to outflank the Confederates in their defenses and prevent them from interfering with Sheridan's mission, pushing them back to their lines if they came out to fight. Warren's corps initially also was ordered to seize Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia, which also would capture a portion of the Boydton Plank Road at that location, but later that task was given to Sheridan. Under Grant's order, on the night of March 27-28, Major General Edward Ord, quietly moved units from the Army of the James, including two divisions of Major General John Gibbon's XXIV Corps (Twenty-Fourth Corps), a division of Major General Godfrey Weitzel's XXV Corps (Twenty-Fifth Corps) and Brigadier General Ranald S. Mackenzie's cavalry division from the Richmond lines to fill in the Petersburg lines to be vacated by the II Corps when they moved to support Sheridan. Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps defending the Richmond lines failed to detect Ord's movement, thus limiting the number of men Lee could move to counter the movement of Grant's forces without fatally weakening the Richmond lines.Greene, 2008, p. 160. Actions at Petersburg before and during the Battle of Five Forks =Description of area roads= A good verbal description of the roads and positions in the area, given by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain in his 1915 book The Passing of the Armies, is recited in the footnote.The principal road leading out westerly from Petersburg is the Boydton Plank Road, for the first ten miles nearly parallel with the Appomattox [River], and distant from it from three to six miles. The Southside Railroad is between the Boydton Road and the river. South of the Boydton is the Vaughan Road; the first section lying in rear of our main entrenchments, but from our extreme left at Hatcher's Run inclining towards the Boydton Road, being only two miles distant from it to Dinwiddie Court House. Five miles east of this place the Quaker Road, called by persons of another mood, the \\"Military Road,\\" crosses the Vaughan and leads northerly into the Boydton Road midway between Hatcher's Run and Gravelly Run, which at this junction became Rowanty Creek. A mile above the intersection of the Quaker Road with the Boydton is the White Oak Road, leading off from the Boydton at right angles westerly, following the ridges between the small streams and branches, forming the headwaters of Hatcher's and Gravelly Runs, through and beyond the \\"Five Forks.\\" This is a meeting place of roads, the principal of which, called the Ford Road, crosses the White Oak at a right angle, leading from a station on the Southside Railroad, three miles north, to Dinwiddie Court House, six miles south. The enemy's main line entrenchments west from Petersburg covered the important Boydton Plank Road, but only so far as Hatcher's Run, where at Burgess' Mill their entrenchments leave this and follow the White Oak Road for some two miles, then cross it, turning to the north and following the Claiborne Road, which leads to Sutherland's Station on the Southside Railroad ten miles distant from Petersubrg, covering this road till it strikes Hatcher's Run about a mile higher up. This \\"return\\" northerly forms the extreme right of the enemy's entrenched line. Chamberlain, Joshua L. The Passing of Armies: An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac. New York: Bantam Books, 1993. . pp. 31-32\\\\. First published New York and London, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1915. =Initial movements: March 29= Major General Bushrod Johnson Warren's V Corps of over 17,000 men moved from their reserve position south of the Union front line on the Stage Road at 3:00 a.m. on March 29, crossed Rowanty Creek and proceeded west on Vaughan Road to the intersection with Quaker Road.Greene, 2008, p. 155.Trulock, Alice Rains. In the Hands of Providence: Joshua L. Chamberlain and the American Civil War. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992. . pp. 229-230.Salmon, John S., The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide, Stackpole Books, 2001, . p. 457. Warren reported to his immediate superior, Major General George G. Meade, who remained in direct tactical command of the Army of the Potomac, that Dinwiddie Court House was undefended. By 8:45 a.m., Meade sent an order to Warren which arrived at 10:20 a.m., and told Warren to advance in strength on the Quaker Road across Gravelly Run and contact the II Corps to his right.Trulock, 1992, p. 230.Bearss, 2014, p. 333. Warren misunderstood or ignored the order and sent only Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's brigade up the Quaker Road until noon.Bearss says that Warren misunderstood the order. Bearrs, 2014, p. 333. Then Warren sent other units forward in response to a second order from Meade.Greene, 2008, p. 155-157. The II Corps moved from Hatcher's Run at about 6:30 a.m.Bearss, 2014, p. 334. Humphreys was careful not to leave a gap between his corps at Hatcher's Run and the troops of the XXIV Corps which took the positions in the Union line that were being vacated by the II Corps.Greene, 2008, p. 157. Meade wanted the V Corps to move up the Quaker Road to prevent a gap developing between the V Corps and the II Corps. After having moved over the Vaughan Road to within of Dinwiddie Court House, Chamberlain's brigade marched a short distance back to the Quaker Road and led the Union advance north on that road, as Meade had ordered Warren.Trulock, Alice Rains. In the Hands of Providence: Joshua L. Chamberlain and the American Civil War. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992. . p. 230. After leading the brigade about north on Quaker Road, Chamberlain's skirmishers reported that the bridge over Gravelly Run had been destroyed and that Confederates were entrenched on the other side.Chamberlain, 1915, p. 33. Confederate Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson, as a corps commander of only the division of Major General Bushrod Johnson, was stationed on the Confederate right flank west of Petersburg at Hatcher's Run about east of Five Forks and immediately south of Sutherland Station. When Confederate scouts reported that a large force of Union infantry was moving north on Quaker Road, Anderson ordered Johnson to drive them back to Vaughan Road. Three Confederate regiments of the brigade commanded by Brigadier General Henry A. Wise, followed by the brigades of Brigadier Generals William H. Wallace, Young Marshall Moody and Matt Whitaker Ransom, moved south on the Quaker Road and the Boydton Plank Road with the intent of carrying out the order.Greene, 2008, p. 158.Trulock, 1992, p. 234. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle =Fighting begins= Map of Lewis's Farm Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Chamberlain placed the 198th Pennsylvania Infantry on the right side of the road to fire on the Confederates as a diversion while he led the 185th New York Volunteer Infantry across Gravelly Run to attack the Confederate right flank where a hand-to-hand fight developed.Trulock, 1992, p. 231. Both Union regiments were oversize for that time period with about 1,000 officers and men.Calkins, Chris. The Appomattox Campaign, March 29 - April 9, 1865. Conshohocken, PA: Combined Books, 1997. . p. 20. The rest of Chamberlain's brigade crossed the stream following the New Yorkers' attack. The Confederates retreated to the Lewis farmhouse clearing about further north on the Quaker Road. After a stand near the farmhouse, the Confederates moved back into the woods where they were reinforced by other Confederate soldiers behind breastworks. Here, the Confederates drove back the advancing Union skirmishers but not without losing about 100 men as prisoners.Trulock, 1992, pp. 231, 234. Chamberlain brought the rest of his men forward and the Confederates who had moved out to meet the skirmishers again returned to their works.Calkins, 1997, p. 20-21.Chamberlain, 1915, p. 34. =Chamberlain wounded; rallies his men= Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain After a pause in the fighting, Chamberlain's division commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin came forward and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to both sides of the Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck.The same bullet deflected off some papers and a pocket mirror with a brass back in Chamberlain's coat pocket near his heart, then hit his aide, Lieutenant Vogel, in his pistol and knocked him from his horse. Chamberlain, 1915, p. 35. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition.Trulock, 1992, p. 235. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge.Chamberlain, 1915, p. 35. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.Trulock, 1992, pp. 235-236.Chamberlain, 1915, p. 37. =Union reinforcements drive back Confederates= Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson After another brief pause, Chamberlain saw that his New York regiment was being driven back from an attempt to take the Confederate works in the woods ahead. Chamberlain and the regiment's officers steadied the men and soon they pushed the Confederates back until Union artillery under Regular Army Lieutenant John Mitchell came up with four guns to support them.Trulock, 1992, pp. 236-237.Calkins, 1997, p. 20.Chamberlain, 1915, pp. 38-39. Despite the artillery fire, the Confederates tried to outflank and charge the Union position. Chamberlain's men and the artillery held the position, but then the Confederates charged the Pennsylvania troops in the center and on the right of the Union position.Trulock, 1992, pp. 237-238. These Union soldiers were nearly out of ammunition and began to slowly retreat.Trulock, 1992, p. 238. As Chamberlain's line was falling back, his First Brigade was reinforced by the 188th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 155th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Zouaves) of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory's Second Brigade. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson led the Pennsylvanians to the center and toward the sawdust pile that the Confederates were using for cover. Pearson grabbed the regimental colors and charged toward the sawdust pile with his men following and passing through the ranks of the exhausted First Brigade. Thirty-two years later, Pearson was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Lewis's Farm.Pearson's Medal of Honor citation reads: \\"At Lewis' Farm, Va., 29 March 1865, Seeing a brigade forced back by the enemy, he seized his regimental color, called on his men to follow him, and advanced upon the enemy under a severe fire. The whole brigade took up the advance, the lost ground was regained, and the enemy was repulsed. Date of issue: 17 September 1897.\\" When they saw these Union reinforcements, the Confederates retreated to their main entrenchments along White Oak Road, abandoning control of the Boydton Plank Road and leaving behind badly wounded men and some others who surrendered. Chamberlain then positioned his men along with the artillery battery on either side and in front of the Lewis farm buildings.Chamberlain, 1915, p. 40.Salmon, 2001, p. 459. =Number engaged; casualties= Chamberlain wrote that he had fewer than 1,700 officers and men in his brigade and that his reinforcements numbered about 1,000. He wrote that the Confederates had 6,277 effective officers and men in Johnson's Division according to their morning report.Although he notes that Ransom's brigade moved out to meet Chamberlain's advance, Historian A. Wilson Greene does not identify that unit from Johnson's division as among the brigades he states were in the fighting. Greene, 2009, p. 158. He stated that he lost about a quarter of his men while the Confederate total loss was \\"slight in numbers,\\" although in a paragraph after this statement he said that he saw that evening 150 dead and severely wounded Confederates lying around the breastworks and noted that almost 200 prisoners had been taken by his brigade.Chamberlain, 1915, pp. 41-42. Modern casualty estimates are 381 for the Union force and 371 for the Confederates.Kennedy, Frances H., ed., The Civil War Battlefield Guide, 2nd ed., Houghton Mifflin Co., 1998, . p. 412. Aftermath =Union positions= Warren was able to take a position near the junction of the Quaker Road and the Boydton Plank Road.Hess, 2009, p. 256. Griffin's division and Brigadier General Samuel Crawford's division taking up positions along the Boydton Plank Road, the Union movements on March 29 and Chamberlain's success in taking the Lewis Farm position enabled the Union Army to cut this important communication and supply road and to set up to attack the White Oak Road Line.Calkins, 1997, p. 21. Having to deal with muddy roads over a longer route, Sheridan's cavalry divisions reached Dinwiddie Court House at about 5:00 p.m. on March 29, 1865.Hess, 2009, p. 255. Sheridan put troops of Devin's and Crook's divisions into position to guard the Vaughan Road, Flat Foot Road, Boydton Plank Road and Adams Road.Bearss, 2014, p. 330. =Grant's change in orders= Encouraged by the Confederate failure to press their attack at Lewis's Farm and their withdrawal to their White Oak Road Line, Grant decided to expand Sheridan's mission to a major offensive rather than just a railroad raid and forced extension of the Confederate line.Greene, 2008, p. 162. He wrote in his letter to Sheridan: \\"I now feel like ending the matter....\\"Bearss, 2014, 348. =Lee's actions= Lee had anticipated that with the Confederate defeat at Fort Stedman and the arrival of Sheridan's cavalry at Petersburg, Grant would make a move on Lee's right flank such as Grant had ordered on March 24. Lee had only 6,000 cavalry north of the James River or at Stony Creek Depot, south of Petersburg and about 5,000 effective infantry that he could send to extend his line to the west to counter the anticipated Union movement. In the morning on March 29, Lee prepared to have Major General George Pickett take this force to Sutherland Station and move to protect Five Forks in Dinwiddie County. Lee ordered Pickett to take the brigades of Brigadier Generals William R. Terry, Montgomery Corse and George H. Steuart on the Southside Railroad to Sutherland Station, west of Petersburg, and he ordered Brigadier General Eppa Hunton to be ready to move to reinforce Pickett or to defend the junction of the Southside and Richmond and Danville Railroads at Burkeville, Virginia.Bearss, 2014, pp. 337-338. Lee also ordered Major General Fitzhugh Lee to take his cavalry division to Sutherland Station and join with the cavalry divisions of Major Generals Rooney Lee and Thomas L. Rosser.Bearss, 2014, p. 337. Fitzhugh Lee was ordered to take command of the combined cavalry. General Lee thought that Pickett might be able to extend the Confederate line from its right flank east of Five Forks to Five Forks. The Union Army movement on March 29 troubled Lee so he ordered additional movements to strengthen his right flank. Besides moving Brigadier General Samuel McGowan's brigade farther west to extend Johnson's line along White Oak Road, he thinned the White Oak Road line further by moving Brigadier General William MacRae's brigade to the west. After arriving at Sutherland Station on the night of March 29, as ordered, Pickett moved his three brigades under Brigadier Generals George H. Steuart and Montgomery Corse and William R. Terry's Brigade, and Brigadier Generals Matt Ransom's and William Henry Wallace's brigades from Johnson's division, a cavalry division under Major General Fitzhugh Lee and six guns under the command of Colonel William Pegram to Five Forks on March 30. Then he sent Terry's brigade and Corse's brigade to the south. Nonetheless, a gap continued to exist between Pickett's force and McGowan's brigade at the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line.Hess, 2009, p. 257. Lee ordered Hunton's brigade to stand in reserve near Manchester, Virginia where it could support Pickett or move by rail to defend the junction of the Southside Railroad and Richmond and Danville Railroad at Burkeville, Virginia if a Union force moved to attack it. =March 30, 1865 action= Rain poured down on the area all night on March 29 and continued the following day, which limited the fighting on that day. Sheridan later stated that Grant thought about suspending operations altogether until the weather cleared and the ground dried but Sheridan convinced him to press ahead. On March 30, half of Sheridan's cavalry under Brigadier General Thomas Devin skirmished with Confederate cavalry under Fitzhugh Lee. As they approached Five Forks, a patrol of the 6th United States Cavalry Regiment under Major Robert M. Morris encountered Fitzhugh Lee's troopers and lost 3 officers and 20 men in the encounter.Bearss, 2014, p. 354. The Confederates also suffered some casualties, including Brigadier General William H. F. Payne who was wounded. Skirmishing with and reacting to feints from Union patrols from the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Charles L. Leiper delayed Pickett's force from reaching Five Forks until 4:30 p.m.Bearss, 2014, p. 353. Rosser's and Rooney Lee's cavalry divisions arrived even later. Meanwhile, skirmishers from Warren's V Corps kept the Confederates in their White Oak Road Line between the Boydton Plank Road and Claiborne Road. Despite incomplete information and somewhat vague and conflicting orders from Meade and Grant, on Grant's order, Warren pushed the Union V Corps forward to strengthen his hold on a part of the Boydton Plank Road and the V Corps entrenched a line to cover that road from its intersection with Dabney Mill Road south to Gravelly Run.Trulock, 1992, p. 242.Bearss, 2014, p. 363. In the afternoon, Warren saw Griffin's men take over Confederate outposts but he also saw that movement further up the Boydton Plank Road was covered by Confederate artillery and fortifications.Bearss, 2014, p. 366. Humphrey's II Corps closed the gap between the V Corps and the XXIV Corps. The latter corps captured a large part of the Confederate picket line.Greene, 2008, pp. 163, 165. Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres's division of the V Corps made a reconnaissance toward the White Oak Road a short distance west of Claiborne Road.Bearss, 2014, p. 367. The lead brigade under Colonel Frederick Winthrop crossed a swollen branch of Gravelly Run which was to feature in the following day's battle. Two other brigades did not cross but began to entrench. Ayres saw only empty space to the northeast and failed to see heavy fortifications near the intersection of White Oak Road and Claiborne Road which angled sharply back to Hatcher's Run directly to his north.Bearss, 2014, pp. 367-368. As dark approached, Ayres had a number of outposts prepared to cover his position.Bearss, 2014, p. 368. Union casualties for the March 30 actions at the White Oak Line were 1 killed, 7 wounded and 15 missing; the number of Confederate casualties is unknown.Calkins, 1997, p. 201. =Prelude to March 31, 1865 battles= The fighting, maneuvering and skirmishing at Lewis's Farm on March 29, 1865 and in the vicinity of that farm along the White Oak Road Line on March 30, 1865 set the stage for the Battle of White Oak Road and the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House on March 31, 1865.Hess, 2009, pp. 258-260.

It is estimated Fulk constructed approximately 100 castles, along with abbeys throughout the Loire Valley in what is now France. He fought successive wars with neighbors in Brittany, Blois, Poitou and Aquitaine and made four pilgrimages to Jerusalem during the course of his life. He had two wives and three children. Fulk was a natural horseman and fearsome warrior with a keen sense of military strategy that bested most of his opponents. He was allied with the goals and aims of the Capetians against the dissipated Carolingians of his era. With his county seat at Angers, Fulk's bitter enemy was Eudes II of Blois, his neighbor 128 km east along the Loire River, at Tours. The two men traded towns, followers and insults throughout their lives. Fulk finished his first castle at Langeais, 104 km east of Angers, on the banks of the Loire. Like many of his constructions, it began as a wooden tower, and was eventually replaced with a stone structure, fortified with exterior walls, and equipped with a thick- walled tower called a donjon in French (source of the English dungeon, which however implies a cellar, rather than a tower). He built it in the territory of Odo I, Count of Blois, and they fought a battle over it in 994. But Eudes I died of a sudden illness, and his son and successor, Eudes II, did not manage to evict him. Fulk continued building more towers in a slow encirclement of Tours: Montbazon, Montr√©sor, Mirebeau, Montrichard, Loches, and even the tower of Montboyau, erected just across the Loire from Tours in 1016. He also fortified the castles at Angers, Amboise, Chateau-Gontier, Chinon, Mayenne and Semblan√ßay, among many others. ‚ÄúThe construction of castles for the purpose of extending a ruler‚Äôs power was part of Fulk Nerra‚Äôs strategy,‚Äù wrote Peter Fraser Purton, in A History of Medieval Siege, c. 450‚Äì1220. Fulk was a devout Christian, who built, enlarged or endowed several abbeys and monasteries, such as the Abbey of Beaulieu-les-Loches, Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, Saint-Aubin, and a convent, Notre Dame de la Charit√© at Ronceray in Angers. Although he never learned to write, he endowed a school with revenue to provide poor students with an education. Fulk also undertook four pilgrimages to Jerusalem.  Family  He was the son of Geoffrey I of Anjou, also known as Geoffrey Grisegonelle, and Ad√©laide of Vermandois. He had an older sister: Hermengarde (b. 960), who married Conan of Brittany and a younger brother Geoffrey. A half-brother, Maurice, was born in 980. Fulk married Elisabeth de Vend√¥me (~979‚Äì999), daughter of Count Bouchard of Vendome, and they had a daughter: * Ad√®le, married Bodon, son of Landry, Count of Nevers. Their eldest son, Bouchard, inherited Vend√¥me. Elisabeth's death was recounted in the Chronicles of Saint-Florent: Elisabeth occupied the citadel at Anger with some supporters and while under siege from Fulk, she suffered a fall from a great height, and then was burnt at the stake for adultery. Fulk married Hildegarde de Sundgau, whose family was from Lorraine, around December 1005. They had two children: *Geoffrey II, in 1006, who became known as Geoffrey Martel, succeeded Fulk as Count of Anjou in 1040. *Ermengarde-Blanche, around 1018.  Combat  Fulk Nerra's first victory was in June 992 at Battle of Conquereuil, where he managed to defeat Conan I, Duke of Brittany. Conan's territorial ambitions had been quashed by Geoffroy Grisgonelle in 980, and seven years later, he planned an ambush on Angers while Fulk was at the crowning of Robert the Pious. Fulk and his men foiled the ambush, killing Conan's son, Alain, in the process. In 992 Fulk laid siege to Conan's castle at Nantes, but he slipped away to Conquereuil. Conan was killed in the battle, and Fulk installed a governor/regent, as the succeeding count was a child. While Fulk and Eudes II fought many skirmishes over territory and alliances, their biggest battle occurred in July 1016 at Battle of Pontlevoy. Eudes marched 10,000 men southward toward Fulk's tower at Montboyau; meanwhile, Fulk and his much smaller group attacked him from behind. Fulk's men were routed, retreated, and Eudes, thinking the battle won, went for a swim in the Cher River. Reinforcements led by Herbert Wake-Dog of Maine arrived to help Fulk, fought and routed Eudes' surprised men. Several thousand were reported killed.[Christian Thevenot, Foulque Nerra, Editions Alan Sutton, St. Cyr-sur- Loire, 2009]  Pilgrimages  Fulk also undertook four pilgrimages to Jerusalem--first and second as a penitent seeking forgiveness for sins and third and fourth to protect pilgrims. In 1003, Fulk traveled to Jerusalem for his first pilgrimage. The journey was across the Alps at the Grand Bernard Pass in today's Switzerland, over land to Bari in the southern Italian peninsula (a stop in Rome was usually made), by ship to the Holy Land. The travel took as long as six months, through deeply dangerous territory.[Jonathan Sumption, The Age of Pilgrimage, The Medieval Journey to God, Paulist Press, 2003] Fulk made a second pilgrimage in 1008, obliged to do so by the king as punishment after Fulk ordered the murder of an enemy. For his third and fourth trips, Fulk had a moral obligation to protect pilgrims in the years following the desecration of Jerusalem by the \\"Mad Caliph\\" Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and provided armed security against robbers, murderers and enslavers along the route. In 1035, the third pilgrimage with Robert I, Duke of Normandy and in 1038, he made his final pilgrimage. He died in Metz in 1040 on his return from that trip, and was buried in the chapel of his monastery at Beaulieu. Fulk Nerra's castle keep at Loches.  Succession  His son Geoffrey II (Geoffrey Martel) succeeded him as Count of Anjou in 1040 and held the title until 1060. Since he had no children from either of two marriages, when he died the Anjou title went to his nephews, the two sons of his sister Ermengarde-Blanche (m. Geoffroy V of Ch√¢teau-Landon). Geoffroy III Le Barbu (the Bearded) was Count of Anjou from 1060 to 1098; Fulk IV R√©chin (the Mouth) was count from 1098 to 1109. Fulk IV's grandson, Geoffrey Plantagenet, married Matilda, heir to the English throne, and began the House of Plantagenet line of English kings.

It transferred to the command of the British Army in 1862. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 103rd Regiment of Foot in 1881 to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. History Sir Robert Vivian, colonel of the regiment in the 1860s =Formation= The regiment was raised by the Honourable East India Company as the Madras Europeans from independent companies in 1742 ‚Äì \\"European\\" indicating it was composed of white soldiers, not Indian sepoys. It saw action at the Siege of Arcot in autumn 1751 during the Second Carnatic War and went on to fight at the Battle of Plassey in June 1757, the Battle of Condore in December 1758 and the Battle of Wandiwash in January 1760 during the Seven Years' War. It also fought at the Siege of Pondicherry in September 1760 during the Third Carnatic War. It became the 1st Madras Europeans, on formation of the 2nd and 3rd Madras Europeans, in 1766. It went on to become the 1st Madras European Regiment in 1774. After that it took part in the Siege of Nundydroog in October 1791 and the Siege of Seringapatam in February 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. =Early nineteenth century= A view of Ternate occupied by the regiment in the early nineteenth century The regiment next took part in expedition to the Dutch East Indies seeing action at the capture of Amboyna in February 1796 and its recapture in February 1810, the capture of Ternate in April 1801 and its recapture in August 1810 and the capture of Banda in March 1796 and its recapture in August 1810. =The Victorian era= The regiment returned to India in 1816 and took part in the Battle of Mahidpur in December 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. It was deployed to Burma in 1824 for service in the First Anglo-Burmese War: it formed part of an army which advanced up the River Irrawaddy to the Kingdom of Ava. It returned to India arriving in Madras in 1826. It transferred to Malacca in 1835 and became the 1st Madras (European) Fusiliers in 1843. After returning to India in early 1852 it was deployed to the Province of Pegu in April 1852 during the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The regiment fought at the Siege and relief of Lucknow in November 1857 during the Indian Rebellion. Three members of the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the siege. After the Crown took control of the Presidency armies in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion, the regiment became the 1st Madras Fusiliers in July 1858 and then the 1st Royal Madras Fusiliers in May 1861. It was then renumbered as the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) on transfer to the British Army in September 1862. The regiment embarked for England in 1870 and was then deployed to Gibraltar in April 1876 and to Ceylon in 1879. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 102nd was linked with the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers), and assigned to district no. 66 at Naas Barracks in County Kildare. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers) to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for and in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as and in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football's greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002.  Playing career  Born in Caulfield, Victoria, Bunton Jr. moved with his father first to Western Australia and then to South Australia. Bunton was hospitalised for two years from the age of three due to a fractured pelvis and Perthes disease in his hip. He wore leg braces and used crutches until he was aged ten. Haydn Bunton junior made his debut for at the age of 17, and two years seasons later was named an All-Australian player. In 1955, Bunton senior was killed in a car crash, but the following year, the younger Bunton showed his class as a player by finishing runner-up for the Magarey Medal to Dave Boyd. The following year, Haydn \\"stood out\\" as a player due to a transfer dispute with North Adelaide, who would not clear him, but amazingly served as a non-playing coach of . From 1958 to 1960, he played for Norwood, in spite of a serious knee injury sustained in a car accident in Tasmania in 1959.Devaney, John; Full Points Footy's WA Football Companion; p. 24. Bunton had another strong year in 1961, when he was recruited by Swan Districts in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) as captain-coach. At the time Swan Districts were the Cinderella side of the WAFL, having never won more than seven games in a season since 1945, and were generally regarded with \\"pity or scorn\\". Swan Districts had lost their last sixteen games of 1960, but improved immediately under Bunton's coaching. They won 12 and drew two of twenty-one matches to finish second, but after a loss to raging hot premiership favourite East Perth in the second semi final they were not considered a serious threat. However, after overcoming Subiaco in the preliminary, Bunton developed an ingenious tactic to counter Royals‚Äô champion Polly Farmer by using both Keith Slater and Fred Castledine in the ruck contests. Though this ploy was technically illegal, it was accepted by the umpires, and Swan Districts won by 24 points for their first WAFL premiership. In the process of lifting Swan Districts from cellar- dwellers to premiers, Bunton developed a use of handball that was far ahead of its time and also discouraged the use of the erratic drop kick. The following year Bunton won the Sandover Medal for the league's \\"fairest and best\\", completing a rare father-and-son achievement. Swan Districts took their first minor premiership and won both the second semi and grand finals against East Fremantle. Despite finishing fourth after the home-and-away rounds, Swan Districts managed to win three finals and a hat-trick of premierships in 1963; however, 1964 saw the team collapse to sixth of eight clubs with only nine wins. Bunton returned to Norwood as playing coach from 1965 until 1967, bringing his total number of games for Norwood to 97. In his first season the club played off in the finals,The Advertiser; 6 September 1965; p.6 but they slowly declined in 1966 and 1967 finishing seventh of ten teams. Coaching career After 1967, Bunton accepted another major challenge when he accepted an appointment as playing coach of Subiaco, for whom his father had won three Sandover Medals, but which had been almost continuously a cellar-dweller for thirty years. Between 1937 and 1967, Subiaco had played in only four finals series and overall managed just 184 wins and four draws from 574 senior games for a success rate of 32.4 percent. =Subiaco, 1968 to 1972= In 1967, Subiaco had won only three of 21 games to be four games clear on the bottom, but, aided by an amazing season from full forward Austin Robertson junior, they won twelve games in 1968 to finish fourth, but did not beat top three teams Perth, East Perth and West Perth during perhaps the most uneven season in any of the VFL/AFL, SANFL or WANFL. Bunton played for two more seasons during which Subiaco again lost the first semi-final (though it was their first consecutive seasons in the finals since 1935 and 1936), but stayed on as non-playing coach during 1971 and 1972. During these two seasons, Subiaco disappointed, winning only eighteen of forty-two games and finishing fifth and sixth in an eight-team competition. However, when Subiaco won its first premiership since 1924 under new coach Ross Smith, it was generally acknowledged that Bunton had played a critical role in raising the team from last to first over the six seasons between 1967 and 1973. During this time, he played a leading role in completely banishing the drop kick from football. =South Adelaide, 1975 to 1982= After a two-year sabbatical, Bunton returned to coach South Adelaide in 1975. As with Subiaco, the Panthers had struggled severely ever since World War II, playing in the finals only during the three years of Neil Kerley's tenure as captain-coach. Unlike Subiaco, South Adelaide's improvement under Bunton's patented methods of fast, skilful football was gradual, but the Panthers played in the major round for the first time in eleven years in 1977 and two years later played in only its second grand final since the war (and last to date, as of 2019). However, on a muddy ground and extremely windy if dry day Port's experience and luck with the toss told: the Magpies‚Äô five goals with the breeze was more than South could manage for a day when not one goal was kicked against the windThe Sunday Mail, 8 October 1989; p. 2 says that the game was lost for South by quarter time and by the last quarter South had little left in them, losing by the score of 3-14 (32) to 9-9 (63). The Panthers did, however, win the NFL night series with VFA and WAFL clubs plus representative teams from \\"developing\\" football states in both 1978 and 1979. However, despite playing in the finals and achieving South Adelaide's best minor round since 1964 in the 1981 season, a decline to third last in 1982 saw Bunton replaced by Graham Cornes for 1983. =Subiaco, 1984 to 1992= In 1984, Bunton junior returned to his former haunt of Subiaco, who as a result of the loss of such players as Mike Fitzpatrick had endured another bleak era over the previous nine seasons. The Lions had not participated in the finals since 1974 and had finished dead last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982, when they were in danger of a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. Since 1975 Subiaco had recorded only 44 wins from 189 games and had lost its \\"average\\" game over these nine seasons by a margin of 36 points. However, under Bunton and aided by a powerful country zone, the Lions improved rapidly: from four wins and a percentage of 70 in 1983 they went to nine wins and a percentage of 100 in 1984 and fifteen wins and a percentage of 124.5 in 1985. Despite being in their first finals series since 1974, the Lions only just failed to beat East Fremantle in the grand final and gained ample revenge against the Sharks the following year by eleven and a half goals. Their team was sufficiently good to be competitive against VFL premiers Hawthorn in a post-season \\"challenge\\" match ‚Äì ironically Hawthorn's win was led by Subiaco's one star of the bleak late 1970s and early 1980s in Gary Buckenara. An irrepressible Claremont outfit under the innovative coaching of Gerard Neesham halted Subiaco in 1987, but the following year after losing the second semi to the Tigers and being unconvincing in the preliminary against East Fremantle, the Lions, playing a much more traditional game than Claremont and aided by the controversial inclusion of West Coast Eagle Laurie Keene, ran away to win by 62 points after an even first half. The massive drain of players to the VFL meant Subiaco could not keep up this standard, and they won only six games each in 1989 and 1990 before returning to the Grand Final in 1991 only for Claremont to have its revenge. A thrashing by East Perth in the first week of the 1992 WAFL finals saw Bunton resign at the end of the season after having coached Subiaco's most successful era since before World War II. =Sturt, 1993 to 1994= At the age of fifty-six, Bunton was appointed by a Sturt club looking for an experienced coachLysikatos, John; True blue: the history of the Sturt Football Club; pp. 314-320. after Kevin Higgins and Steven Trigg had guided them to only seven wins from 64 games between 1990 and 1992. Sturt had actually possessed interest in Bunton during the early 1980s when they were seeking a replacement for veteran coach Jack Oatey, but lost interest when a decision had to be made at the end of 1982.Lysitakos; True blue; p. 278 Bunton started very badly, with the Double Blues having lost as many as twenty consecutive games before their first win in July. However, they managed to win four of their last eight games but narrowly failed on percentage to avoid a fifth straight wooden spoon. In 1994, things started promisingly with two wins and a near miss against reigning premiers the Eagles before Sturt fell back to its old ways and won only two of its last seventeen games for a sixth wooden spoon on end. Bunton resigned at the end of 1994 to be replaced by Phil Carman, who resurrected the club after on paper the worst modern season in a major Australian rules league the following year. Bunton's stint at Sturt is generally regarded as his only failure as a coach, though he admitted he enjoyed it, that the Sturt district was \\"not as productive as it used to be\\" and that SANFL redistricting had hurt the club. Notes In terms of Noll- Scully competitive balance, the 1968 WANFL season's index of 2.5912 is the highest known in any of these leagues.

History Fu Manchu originally formed in 1985 as a hardcore punk band called Virulence. The line up was vocalist Ken Pucci, guitarist Scott Hill, bassist Mark Abshire, and drummer Ruben Romano. In 1987, Abshire left the band and was replaced by Greg McCaughey. They recorded their debut LP If This Isn't a Dream... in 1988, which was released on Alchemy Records (1989). In 1990, Pucci left the band and was replaced by vocalist Glenn Chivens, and they changed their name to Fu Manchu. Soon after they released the \\"Kept Between Trees\\" 7 inch single on Slap A Ham Records. McCaughey was replaced by Mark Abshire. Chivens also left the band around this time for unknown reasons. Rather than search for a new vocalist, Scott Hill added lead vocalist to his guitar duties. To compensate, Scott Votaw was recruited as lead guitarist. In 1992, Fu Manchu released three 7 inch singles: \\"Senioritis,\\" \\"Pick Up Summer,\\" and \\"Don't Bother Knockin' (If This Vans Rockin')\\". In 1993, Votaw left the band and was replaced by lead guitarist Eddie Glass, who had previously played drums in the band Olivelawn. Fu Manchu's first album, No One Rides for Free (1994), was released by Bong Load Custom Records, an independent label. Abshire left Fu Manchu before they recorded their second album, Daredevil, in 1995. He was replaced by Brad Davis. The band promoted Daredevil with extensive touring throughout the US and Canada, and reached a wider audience thanks to an opening slot with Monster Magnet, who at the time were the commercial darlings of the stoner rock genre. Romano and Glass left shortly after the release of Fu Manchu's third album, In Search Of... (1996), citing personal and musical differences with Hill. They were replaced by Brant Bjork and Bob Balch, respectively. Glass, Romano and Abshire soon regrouped to form Nebula, a power trio that took the jam-influenced side of Fu Manchu and expanded on it. Members of Nebula have commented that \\"we're all family\\" to fans wearing Fu Manchu shirts at their concerts. Fu Manchu went on to release several successful albums and reinforce their reputation as a powerful live act. The band had gained this reputation over the years due to their performance when touring with notable bands such as Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity, White Zombie, Sevendust, and P.O.D., among others. In 2001, the band released an album, California Crossing.\\"CD REVIEWS: Bush, Headstones, Incubus, Rheostatics and many more\\". Chart Attack, October 23, 2001 By: Debbie Bento Brant Bjork left the band soon after to pursue a solo career and was replaced by former Sunshine and Smile drummer Scott Reeder (often confused with bassist Scott Reeder, of Kyuss, Unida, and Goatsnake fame). In 2004, Fu Manchu released their eighth album, Start The Machine. Fu Manchu's ninth album is called We Must Obey which was released on 19 February 2007. The band has spent most of 2007 and 2008 on tour, playing several shows in North America and Europe. In February 2008, the track \\"Mongoose\\" (from the California Crossing album) was featured in a Super Bowl ad for the Toyota Sequoia. Their tenth album Signs of Infinite Power was released on October 19, 2009 in Europe and October 20 in North America. On March 10, 2010, it was announced that Scott Reeder would play drums for Social Distortion for the South American tour dates in April. In June 2012, the band stated they had begun writing for a new record. In 2014, the band released its eleventh album, Gigantoid. In December 2017, they announced their twelfth album, Clone of the Universe, which released on February 9, 2018.

Later generations of his family believed he was the son of Tertullus (Tertulle) and Petronilla. Around 877 he inherited his father Tertullus's lands in accordance with the Capitulary of Quierzy which Charles the Bald had issued. His father's holdings from the king included Ch√¢teau-Landon in , and he was a in the G√¢tinais and Francia. Contemporary records refer to Ingelger as a , a great military man. Later family tradition makes his mother a relative of Hugh the Abbot, an influential counselor of both Louis II and Louis III of France, from whom he received preferment. By Louis II Ingelger was appointed viscount of Orl√©ans, which city was under the rule of its bishops at the time. At Orl√©ans Ingelger made a matrimonial alliance with one of the leading families of Neustria, the lords of Amboise. He married Adelais, whose maternal uncles were Adalard, Archbishop of Tours, and Raino, Bishop of Angers. Later Ingelger was appointed prefect (military commander) at Tours, then ruled by Adalard. At some point Ingelger was appointed Count of Anjou, at a time when the county stretched only as far west as the Mayenne River. Later sources credit his appointment to his defence of the region from Vikings, but modern scholars have been more likely to see it as a result of his wife's influential relatives. He was buried in the church of Saint-Martin at Ch√¢teauneuf-sur- Sarthe. He was succeeded by his son Fulk the Red. His wife was Adelais. Her good connections may have helped her husband gain the title of Count of Anjou. Notes References External links *Halphen, Louis and Ren√© Poupardin.

In this process, the kinetic energy of a particle is conserved in the center-of-mass frame, but its direction of propagation is modified (by interaction with other particles and/or potentials). Furthermore, while the particle's kinetic energy in the center- of-mass frame is constant, its energy in the lab frame is not. Generally, elastic scattering describes a process in which the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. During elastic scattering of high-energy subatomic particles, linear energy transfer (LET) takes place until the incident particle's energy and speed has been reduced to the same as its surroundings, at which point the particle is \\"stopped\\". Rutherford scattering When the incident particle, such as an alpha particle or electron, is diffracted in the Coulomb potential of atoms and molecules, the elastic scattering process is called Rutherford scattering. In many electron diffraction techniques like reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), transmission electron diffraction (TED), and gas electron diffraction (GED), where the incident electrons have sufficiently high energy (>10 keV), the elastic electron scattering becomes the main component of the scattering process and the scattering intensity is expressed as a function of the momentum transfer defined as the difference between the momentum vector of the incident electron and that of the scattered electron. Optical elastic scattering * In Thomson scattering a photon interacts with electrons (this is the low-energy limit of Compton scattering). * In Rayleigh scattering a photon penetrates into a medium composed of particles whose sizes are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident photon. In this scattering process, the energy (and therefore the wavelength) of the incident photon is conserved and only its direction is changed. In this case, the scattering intensity is proportional to the fourth power of the reciprocal wavelength of the incident photon. Nuclear particle physics For particles with the mass of a proton or greater, elastic scattering is one of the main methods by which the particles interact with matter. At relativistic energies, protons, neutrons, helium ions, and HZE ions will undergo numerous elastic collisions before they are dissipated. This is a major concern with many types of ionizing radiation, including galactic cosmic rays, solar proton events, free neutrons in nuclear weapon design and nuclear reactor design, spaceship design, and the study of the earth's magnetic field. In designing an effective biological shield, proper attention must be made to the linear energy transfer of the particles as they propagate through the shield. In nuclear reactors, the neutron's mean free path is critical as it undergoes elastic scattering on its way to becoming a slow-moving thermal neutron. Besides elastic scattering, charged particles also undergo effects from their elementary charge, which repels them away from nuclei and causes their path to be curved inside an electric field. Particles can also undergo inelastic scattering and capture due to nuclear reactions. Protons and neutrons do this more often than heavier particles. Neutrons are also capable of causing fission in an incident nucleus. Light nuclei like deuterium and lithium can combine in nuclear fusion.

Before his election as governor, Blunt served ten years in the United States Navy, was elected to serve in the Missouri General Assembly in 1998, and as Missouri's Secretary of State in 2000. He grew up in a political family; his father, Roy Blunt, served in a variety of political offices (including as Missouri secretary of state and congressman, and since 2011 in the U.S. Senate). A Republican, Matt Blunt was elected governor on November 2, 2004, carrying 101 of Missouri's 114 counties. At age 33, he became the second- youngest person ever elected to that office after Kit Bond. Blunt did not seek a second term as governor, announcing his decision on January 22, 2008, in an address to Missourians,Governor Matt Blunt's Address to Missouri, \\"YouTube\\", January 22, 2008. which surprised many supporters and staff. After working as a consultant, Blunt was hired as the president of the American Automotive Policy Council in 2011, representing the auto lobby in Washington, D.C.\\"Blunt to head auto body lobby\\", Detroit News Early life and education Born in 1970 in Greene County, Missouri, Blunt is the son of politician Roy Blunt and his first wife Roseann Ray Blunt. The senior Blunt was first elected to office in 1984 as Secretary of State for Missouri. He was elected as US Representative in 1997 and as U.S. Senator (R-Missouri) in 2010. After graduating from Jefferson City High School in Jefferson City, Missouri, Matt Blunt was accepted into the United States Naval Academy, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1993. Blunt and his wife Melanie were married in May 1997. The couple has two sons, William Branch Blunt, born on March 9, 2005, and Brooks Anderson Blunt, born on January 1, 2010. Blunt is a member of the State Historical Society of Missouri, the American Legion, and the Missouri Farm Bureau. Naval career As an officer in the United States Navy, Blunt served as an engineering officer aboard the USS Jack Williams and as the navigator and administrative officer on the destroyer USS Peterson. His active duty service included participation in Operation Support Democracy, involving the United Nations blockade of Haiti, missions to interdict drug traffic off the South American coast, and on duties involved in the interdiction of Cuban migrants in 1994. During his Naval career, Blunt received numerous commendations, including four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement medals. He entered the Navy Reserve. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Blunt was called back into active naval service, after he had been elected to the office of Secretary of State for Missouri. He completed a six-month tour of duty in Great Britain during Operation Enduring Freedom, during which time he continued to work full-time for the state as well. He was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Reserve. Early political career In 1998, Blunt was elected as a Republican to the Missouri House of Representatives to represent the 139th legislative district for a two-year term. In 2000, he was elected Missouri Secretary of State; although only a first-term state representative, Blunt defeated the Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, Steve Gaw. Blunt was the only Republican elected to statewide office in Missouri in 2000. In the general election on November 7, 2000, Blunt defeated Democratic opponent Steve Gaw with 51.4% of the vote, to Gaw's 45.1%. Blunt was 29 on election day, 30 at the time he assumed office, making him the youngest ever to win statewide office in Missouri. His father had been elected to the same office at age 34. As Secretary of State, Blunt promoted a state election reform bill in 2002, which won support of the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic House. In 2004, Blunt required all electronic voting machines purchased by the state to produce a voter-verified paper ballot.Blunt Announces Security Requirement for Electronic Voting Machines in Missouri, sos.mo.gov, February 26, 2004. Governor of Missouri =2004 election= Blunt faced only token opposition in the Republican primary, which he won with 534,393 votes (68.28%). In the general election, he faced Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill, who had defeated incumbent Governor Bob Holden in the Democratic primary. The first of two debates between Blunt and McCaskill was held on 18 October where McCaskill compared her experience to Blunt's inexperience; while Blunt said that McCaskill would not support the Marriage protection amendment to the State Constitution. In the two debates Blunt described himself as bringing change to Missouri and was assisted by President George W. Bush during the campaign. McCaskill kept her distance from Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry due to Bush's lead in Missouri. In the end Blunt narrowly defeated McCaskill with surveys showing his conservative stance on social issues and the strong showing of President Bush in Missouri helped him to victory. Blunt obtained strong leads in the rural parts of the state which was sufficient to overcome McCaskill's leads in St. Louis and Jackson County. Blunt defeated McCaskill by 1,382,419 votes (50.83%) to 1,301,442 (47.85%) and thus became Missouri's second-youngest Governor. =Tenure= Governor Matt Blunt visits Louisiana Col. Steve Arthur presents Missouri Governor Matt Blunt with an American flag flown on a combat mission over Afghanistan and certificate following a bill-signing ceremony in Warrensburg, Missouri in 2008 When Blunt took office on January 10, 2005, it was the first time in Missouri since 1921 that a Republican held the Governor's office with Republican majorities in both houses of the State Legislature. Blunt and his allies in the Missouri General Assembly moved quickly to enact legislation that they said would create a positive business climate in the state and result in job growth. With legislative support, Blunt claimed in 2009 that he had enacted almost all of his policy proposals. Among the legislation passed were tort reform measures that overhauled the state's legal system, and changes in the state's workers compensation laws. Blunt's first year in office was difficult, and he was criticized by both the right and the left. In February 2006, a poll conducted by SurveyUSA showed him with a 33% job approval rating, the fifth lowest of any governor in the nation.\\"Approval Ratings of Governors\\", SurvveyUSA, 14 February 2006, accessed 15 September 2014 His approval among Republicans polled was 62%, but his rating among Democrats was only 12%.\\"Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #8272\\", SurveyUSA, 14 February 2006, accessed 15 September 2014 This was one of the greatest partisan divides of any governor. In September 2009, the state insurance agency issued a report showing medical malpractice claims in Missouri at a 30-year low in 2008, believed to result from Blunt's restriction of injury settlements under tort reform in 2005. \\"...Missouri's medical malpractice insurers made a profit for the fifth straight year in 2008. It also shows an increase in the number of medical providers getting insurance through nonprofit coalitions.\\" =Fiscal policy= Blunt believed he had to reduce spending to deal with what he described as a state financial crisis. He trimmed state spending in order to keep the budget balanced without raising taxes. Particularly controversial were provisions reducing coverage of programs created by state legislation to provide a social net, especially to families. Two years later, with an election almost a year away, Governor Blunt implemented the MO HealthNet Initiative, Senate Bill SB577. This was intended to offer residents more choices and rewards for healthy behavior. Some citizens were deemed qualified again for Medicaid coverage. In July 2007, Blunt signed an executive order launching the Missouri Accountability Portal (MAP), which provides Missourians with free, immediate, online information about how the state spends taxpayer money. Blunt signed into law tax cuts. Blunt created the Quality Jobs program, an initiative has been expanded by his successor, Governor Jay Nixon. In 2005, Blunt and the Republican-controlled Missouri General Assembly enacted an overhaul of the state workers' compensation system, making it more difficult for employees to obtain workers' compensation benefits. The overhaul was supported by business interests and opposed by labor unions.Associated Press, Court rejects workers' comp challenge (February 25, 2009).Erin Fuchs, Mo. High Court Upholds Tweaked Workers' Comp Law, Law360 (February 26, 2009). Also in 2005, Blunt signed into law \\"tort reform\\" legislation that limited the damages that juries could award in medical malpractice, placed a cap on punitive damages, lowered the maximum amount that juries could award in non-economic damages, and repealed Missouri's shared liability law.Mark Bliss, Gov. Matt Blunt touts tort reform legislation at ceremony in Cape. Southeast Missourian (March 29, 2005). In 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court struck down the cap on medical malpractice damages, ruling that the measure infringed \\"on the jury's constitutionally protected purpose of determining the amount of damages sustained by an injured party.\\"Blythe Bernhard, Medical malpractice cap is struck down by Missouri Supreme Court, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (August 1, 2012). =Legislative initiatives= Blunt provided annual increases in state funding for K-12 education, signed legislation authorizing $335 million for college construction, expanded college scholarships, and enacted a new school funding method. Blunt proposed selling Missouri's student loan agency, known as MOHELA, and using the proceeds to pay for endowments and new construction for the state's public universities. In the area of elementary and secondary education, Blunt has proposed that school districts be required to spend at least 65% of their budgets on student instruction. After the proposal was criticized, Blunt suggested that the 65% threshold should be a goal, rather than a mandate. Blunt signed bills to expand Missouri's right-to-carry firearms. At the NRA's annual meeting, held in St. Louis in 2007, Blunt signed legislation prohibiting the seizure of firearms during declared states of emergency. Blunt opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother.Ontheissues.org - Matt Blunt He supported measures to prevent the ban on research regarding somatic cell nuclear transfer. There were efforts to pass such a ban in the Missouri General Assembly during the 2005 session. Disagreements among Republicans over the stem cell issue held up efforts to pass restrictions on abortion, such as a 24-hour waiting period, and a restriction on helping minors cross state lines to avoid Missouri's parental consent requirement. In September 2005, Blunt called a special session of the General Assembly specifically to address abortion. The General Assembly passed the above-noted restrictions, and Blunt signed them into law. He signed legislation providing income tax credits for contributions to qualified crisis pregnancy centers, removing taxpayer funding for abortion providers, banning Planned Parenthood from Missouri classrooms, requiring medical standards for abortion clinics, and funding for the alternatives to abortion program. Blunt supported measures that would allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception, in contrast to Illinois, which enacted legislation requiring pharmacies as public businesses to fill such prescriptions. In 2005, Blunt signed legislation to limit sales of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products, the key ingredients needed to make methamphetamine. In the 2006 legislative session, Blunt's stated priorities included enacting a version of \\"Jessica's Law,\\" requiring a minimum 25-year sentence for child sex offenders, as one of his legislative priorities. In 2008, Blunt signed legislation requiring ignition interlocks for drunk drivers who commit two or more drunk driving offenses. He signed legislation to lower the legal intoxication limit for boaters from .10 to .08 percent. Blunt ended localities' reliance on requiring many victims of sexual assault or rape to pay for their own forensic examinations; he secured $2.8 million in the state budget to pay for the rape kits. Blunt secured funding which led to the creation of the new Springfield Crime Lab. Blunt signed an immigration bill prohibiting \\"sanctuary cities\\" in Missouri; requiring verification of legal employment status for public employees through E-verify; allowing cancellation of state contracts for contractors that hire illegal immigrants; requiring public agencies to verify the legal status of applicants before providing welfare benefits; criminalizing the transportation of illegal immigrants for exploitative purposes; and enacting provisions to punish employers who willfully hire illegal immigrants. In 2006, Blunt signed legislation requiring gasoline sold in Missouri to contain 10% ethanol. Blunt has supported the development of biomass, biofuels, wind power and solar energy as alternative energy sources. Air quality continues to be a problem for the state, which has a high rate of air pollution due to burning of coal.\\"Missouri Sees Rise in Carbon Dioxide,\\" Columbia Tribune, June 3, 2007 In his 2008 State of the State address, Blunt proposed a one-week state sales tax exemption on Energy Star- certified new appliances. Missouri became the fourth state in the nation to enact such a tax break. Also in 2008, Blunt and Arkansas Democratic Governor Mike Beebe signed an historic bi-state water quality agreement to protect watersheds and aquifers that cross state lines. =Executive actions= Blunt issued Executive Orders and programs to encourage university cooperation, tax relief, research funds and seed capital for \\"life science\\" start-up firms, and an innovative program to reward insurance companies and other large institutional investors for investing in funds that hold biotech stocks. Blunt has promoted Missouri as a potential hotspot for bioscience. He was criticized for limiting science funding for research related to stem cells; this was considered to discourage the science community at large from working in the state. In 2005 Governor Blunt created the Missouri Life Sciences Trust Fund, to accept transfers of monies from the Tobacco Settlement fund and apply them to biotech efforts. In January 2006 Gov. Blunt created the Lewis and Clark Discovery Initiative (LCDI), designed to spread biotechnology across the State. The LCDI is funded by the Missouri higher-education learning assistance fund (MOHELA). =Alleged misuse of state offices= In August 2007, a reporter for the Springfield News-Leader filed to gain access to emails by Ed Martin, Blunt's Chief of Staff, under the state's Sunshine Law. He was investigating whether Martin had used his office to try to influence anti- abortion groups in relation to opposition to state Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat. Nixon was expected to run against Blunt in the 2008 gubernatorial election. Martin responded on September 4 that he had no such emails, but the reporter later said someone gave him a copy of one, showing that Martin's claim was false. At the same time, \\"Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer insisted to reporters that 'there is no statute or case that requires the state to retain individual's e-mails as a public record.' Blunt himself told reporters that his staffers would not be required to save e-mails for three years,\\" although this was \\"widely understood to be state law\\" (known as the Sunshine Law). It was later revealed that Scott Eckersley, a deputy chief counsel, provided copies of language in the state employees' handbook to general counsel Henry Herschel on September 10 about this state requirement to save such materials. Eckersley was soon locked out of his office by order of Martin. On September 28, 2007, the governor's office fired Eckersley, a political appointee. It distributed packets of emails and documents to four major newspapers in Missouri to support its claims that the attorney had made inappropriate use of a state computer. Eckersley said he was terminated for other reasons, related to trying to ensure employees complied with the state's email retention policy under its Sunshine Law. In the first known \\"whistleblower\\" case against the Missouri state government, Eckersley filed suit for wrongful termination and defamation of character against Blunt and his senior appointees. Due to concerns expressed to his office in November 2007 that there were actions underway to overwrite email tapes and the Governor's Office was not complying with the Sunshine Law, AG Jay Nixon appointed special investigators on November 15 to study what was taking place.Special Investigators C.E. Fisher and E.S. Wilhoit, Report of Investigation: Of the Practices and Policies of the Office of Governor Matt Blunt for the Identification and Retention of Public Records and Response to Requests for Public Records , 13 February 2009, State of Missouri, pp.2-3 Nixon's team had to go to court in the spring of 2008 to get a ruling on whether the governor's office was required to comply with their requests for information, at the expense of the state. Through various legal maneuverings, the court ruled in favor of the investigation, appointing two Special Attorneys General to lead it. The governor never was deposed. Eventually the completion of the investigation was extended to February 2009 because of the volume of materials that needed to be reviewed.Fisher and Wilhoit (2009), Report of Investigation, pp. 5-9 The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Associated Press filed petitions in August 2008 as intervening plaintiffs to gain preliminary and injunctive relief, declaratory judgment that the emails were public records under the state Sunshine Law, and access to the emails under discussion.Fisher and Wilhoit (2009), Report of Investigation, p. 7 Martin resigned in November 2007 as chief of staff, without explanation. Blunt's General Counsel Henry Herschel left soon after. On January 22, 2008, Blunt surprised voters, \\"staffers and supporters\\" by announcing he would not run for another term, although he reportedly already had millions of dollars in a war chest for his upcoming campaign., FOX News, 23 January 2008, accessed 12 September 2014 More than a year later and after Blunt had left office, \\"An investigation by state officials later found that the governor's office failed to properly disclose Mr. Martin's emails.\\"Chris Blank, AP, \\"Fired Aide to Blunt Runs for Governor's Dad's Seat\\", eMissourian.com, 2 September 2010, accessed 15 September 2014 This investigation, which cost the state $2 million, found that Martin had illegally destroyed some emails, in violation of the state's open government or Sunshine Law. It also found he had used his office to influence outside groups against opponents of Blunt.\\"Editorial: Ed Martin finally wins an election, to the shame of the GOP\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 8 January 2013, accessed 15 September 2014 After a year-long legal effort, in November 2008, the Kansas City Star and St. Louis Post Dispatch reported having gained access to 60,000 pages of Blunt administration emails. Their analysis showed that Ed Martin, former chief of staff to Blunt, had used his state office to try to influence outside political groups, among other internal problems. In addition to trying to encourage opposition to AG Jay Nixon, Martin worked with political groups to oppose the appointment of Patricia Breckenridge to an open seat on the Missouri Supreme Court. (Blunt has supported her and she later gained the seat.)\\"The e-mails that brought down a Republican Governor\\", 17 November 2008, accessed 12 September 2014 On May 22, 2009, the Missouri Attorney General's office announced that Eckersley's lawsuit against Blunt and others had been settled for $500,000. =Favorability= His approval ratings gradually rose during his term in office. A February‚ÄìMarch 2008, poll by the Republican polling firm American Viewpoint showed Blunt with an approval rating of 57%. On January 22, 2008, Blunt surprised the GOP when he announced he would not run for re-election. Polls showed that he was running behind the presumptive Democratic nominee, Attorney General Jay Nixon. Other activities As Governor, Blunt was a member of the National Governors Association, Southern Governors' Association, and the Republican Governors Association. As Commander-in-Chief of the Missouri National Guard, Governor Blunt visited Missouri National guard troops serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Kuwait, and on the Mexican border. Because he had been called for active duty while serving as Secretary of State, Blunt's office responded to questions about what would happen if the governor were called to service. In accordance with Pentagon regulations and the Missouri Constitution, if Blunt was called for military duty while Governor, he would have been required to either transfer his gubernatorial powers to Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, or resign from the Naval Reserve. Career after governorship Prior to his appointment as president of the American Automotive Policy Council in 2011, Blunt served as a member of the board of Copart, an auto salvage company in Fairfield, California; an advisor for Solamere Capital, a suburban Boston private equity firm started by Tagg Romney; a consultant for Cassidy & Associates, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm, and a partner with The Ashcroft Group, the Washington, D.C. and St. Louis-based consulting firm founded by former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Blunt has continued to advocate for greater transparency in government spending, state and national lawsuit reform and improving public education. Blunt has been critical of cuts to education funding, arguing that they will erode Missouri's future. He wrote, \\"States will either be welfare states that protect welfare programs, or they will be education states that prepare for the future.\\" He has also questioned the proposal to cut state scholarship funding for private colleges, writing in an op-ed, \\"I have been surprised to see those private schools and their students become a scapegoat as the state cuts education funding and scholarships.\\" =President of the American Automotive Policy Council= In February 2011, Matt Blunt was selected as president of the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC). The AAPC is a policy association created by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The council, is a bipartisan 501(c)6 based in Washington, D.C. and its mission is to promote the unique and significant economic contribution of the U.S.-based auto companies to the American economy. Blunt's leadership at one of the United States' top automobile and component-producing states is a major reason he was chosen to lead the policy initiatives of General Motors, Ford, Chrysler.

Obtaining this qualification allows a doctor to become a member of one of the four surgical colleges in the UK and Ireland, namely the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The examinations are currently organised on an intercollegiate basis. Thus today's MRCS has replaced the former MRCS(Eng), MRCS(E), MRCS(G), and MRCS(I). (Similarly, the MRCP is also now intercollegiate.) History Each college used to hold examinations independently, which is what the post- nominal MRCS used to indicate, for example, MRCS (London) specifically. After decades of discussion of possible intercollegiate MRCS and FRCS, they were implemented in the 21st century, at first by unifying the syllabus of the separate qualifications of MRCS(Eng), MRCS(G), MRCS(E), and MRCS(I). In January 2004, the four colleges switched over to a common examination, known as the Intercollegiate MRCS. Examination The MRCS qualification consists of a multi-part examination including both theory and practical assessments. Until 2018, Part A was a 5-hour written examination which was used to assesses the applied basic sciences (a 3 hour paper in the morning) and principles of surgery in general (a 2 hour paper in the afternoon) using multiple-choice Single Best Answer only. It has a passing mark around 71% and pass rate of around 30 per cent. Part B is a 4-hour practical examination which assesses elements of day-to-day surgical practice through a series of stations on anatomy, pathology, critical care, clinical procedures and patient evaluation (history taking, clinical examination and communication skills). It has a pass rate of around 50 per cent. Current curricula have changed to introduce the completion of both exams as a mandatory requirement to complete core surgical training prior to application to higher surgical training (ST3) in the UK. Trainees often require multiple attempts at the examination in order to pass. In January 2017, the format of Part A changed, with an increase in the number of questions from 270 to 300 and an increase in time from 4 to 5 hours. Examination preparation A large and varied collection of commercial revision resources are available which can improve a candidate's chances of success. These resources include courses, books, online question banks and mobile applications.

It was founded by Nazi Germany on November 14, 1944, in Prague, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (purposely chosen because it was a Slavic city that was still under Axis control). Stated goals The goals of the committee were embodied in a document known as the Prague Manifesto. The manifesto's fourteen points guaranteed the freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly, as well as a right to self-determination of any ethnic group living in territories belonging to Russia. The Prague Manifesto did not contain any explicit anti- semitic or other racially inspired rhetoric, which caused a conflict with many Nazi propagandists. Although, criticism aimed at the Western Allies (specifically US and UK) was included in the manifesto's preamble. The chairman of the committee was General Andrey Vlasov, who also commanded the Russian Liberation Army. The committee was viewed as the political arm of the Russian Liberation Army, although it also united several Ukrainian and other ethnic forces that were anti-Soviet. After the surrender of Germany to the Allies, the committee ceased to operate. During the immediate post-war period, several new organisations sprang up that intended to continue the committee's goal of fighting communism (i.e., the Union of the St. Andrew Flag; the Committee of United Vlasovites; the Union of Battle for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia), started by veterans of the committee and the Russian Liberation Army who managed to escape forced repatriation to the Soviet Union. Two latter organisations participated in US-led efforts to form a united anti- Soviet platform of Soviet emigres. In the United States, a CIA-led organisation with a similar name, the American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, was founded in the late 1940s, and became known for their propaganda broadcaster Radio Liberty, which was run by the Central Intelligence Agency and later funded by the United States Congress. It operated from Munich, in West Germany. Gallery Image:Vlasov A.A.

Life Geoffrey was the eldest son of Fulk II, Count of Anjou and his first wife Gerberga. He succeeded his father as Count of Anjou about 960, at the age of 20. He married Adele of Meaux (934‚Äì982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois. Her father was a patrilineal descendant of Charlemagne, while her paternal grandmother was daughter of king Robert I of France. Through this marriage the Angevins joined the highest ranks of western French nobility. Geoffrey started by making his power-base the citadel of Angers strategically placing his in key areas surrounding the city to protect his territories. The lands of the abbeys of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Serge in Angers provided the for his most faithful adherents. On this subject which became this family's theme, Geoffrey advised both his sons, Fulk and Maurice: \\"No house is weak that has many friends. Therefore I admonish you to hold dear those fideles who have been friends.\\" Although one of the principal methods of Angevin expansion was by the creation of family connections Geoffrey exerted his control through various methods. His father had controlled Nantes through his second marriage to the widowed countess and Geoffrey continued this by making Count Guerech accept him as overlord. With an eye towards Maine, Geoffrey took advantage of the rift that developed between the Counts of Maine and the viscounts and Bishops of Le Mans. About 971 Geoffrey secured the see of Le Mans for his ally Bishop Seinfroy. In 973 Geoffrey had married his daughter Ermengarde-Gerberga to Conan I of Rennes but Conan began to oppose Geoffrey and in 982 the two met at the first battle of Conquereuil with Geoffrey defeating Conan. Geoffrey had influence in Aquitaine by way of his sister Adelaide-Blanche's first marriage to the powerful baron Stephen, Count of Gevaudan and Forez, after whose death the lands were ruled by Adelaide. His nephews Pons and Bertrand succeeded as counts there and his niece Adalmode married Adelbert, Count of Marche and P√©rigord. In 975 Geoffrey had his brother Guy appointed Count and Bishop of Le Puy. In 982 Geoffrey married his now widowed sister Adelaide-Blanche to the fifteen-year-old Louis V of France, the two being crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine. But the marriage to a woman thirty years his senior failed as did Geoffrey's plans to control Aquitaine through his young son-in-law. After the death of his first wife Adele, Geoffrey married secondly Adelaise de Ch√¢lon and for nearly a decade exerted control over the county of Ch√¢lons. Through the marriage of his son, Fulk III, to Elisabeth the heiress of Vend√¥me Geoffrey brought that county into the Angevin sphere of influence. At this time Geoffrey made Fulk his co-ruler, and died shortly thereafter while besieging the fortress of Mar√ßon on 21 July 987. Family He married Adele of Meaux (934‚Äì982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. Their children were: * Ermengarde-Gerberga of Anjou (b. 956), married Conan I of Rennes. She secondly married William II of Angoul√™me. * Fulk III of Anjou (970-1040), he succeeded his father as Count of Anjou. * Geoffrey of Anjou (971-977), died young.

After having released several titles, they filed for bankruptcy in September 2001.  History  The \\"jewel in the crown\\" of the company was the PC F√∫tbol series, which featured an annual installment for a decade. Originally only featuring the Spanish leagues, later versions were developed for Italy (PC Calcio) and Argentina (PC F√∫tbol Apertura and Clausura). For the broader English market, EuroLeague Football was released in 2000, following a brief licensing of the Premier Manager franchise in the late 1990s. Dinamic also released other sports games, such as PC Basket, PC Atletismo or Eurotour Cycling, as well as adventure games such as Hollywood Monsters, one of the biggest projects in Spanish game development history. Most of the house titles and Spanish-produced games were marketed as budget titles and were fiercely championed by the local gaming press. In their late years, Dinamic expanded to Italy (in 1997) and distributed several titles in Spain, including high-profile titles such as Flying Corps Gold, Blade Runner, Sega Rally Championship 2 and Shogo. In 1999, the Ru√≠z brothers and Carlos Abril left the company on disagreements with the main owner, and co-founded FX Interactive. Dinamic fell into financial turmoil during the first half of 2001. The publisher's ventures related to the dot-com bubble‚Äîsuch as the massively multiplayer online role-playing game La Prisi√≥n‚Äîproved unsuccessful, and the company was caught in the global dot-com collapse. By early March, rumors had spread that Dinamic was in danger of closing. The company responded that only its online division was being shuttered, and traditional game projects such as Runaway: A Road Adventure were not in jeopardy, despite their delays. However, key faculty secretly departed Dinamic to join Pyro Studios during the period, and Dinamic entered receivership and cut 39 jobs in late March. Dinamic owed a significant debt of 1.5 billion pesetas to multiple creditors by this time. On September 24, Dinamic announced its liquidation, following its financial upheaval earlier in the year. Although certain commentators had speculated that Runaways sales would save the publisher, it was ultimately Dinamic's last published title. Dinamic's bankruptcy came as a major blow to the domestic game market: at the time, a writer for VNUNet reported the closure as \\"bad news ... for the battered Spanish game software industry\\". In retrospect, David Navarro of MarcaPlayer called it \\"probably the most traumatic event that the Spanish video game industry has experienced in history\\".

It was founded in 1983, and its activity ceased in 1992, comprising the Golden Era of Spanish Software. One year later, a part of its owners founded an independent company named Dinamic Multimedia. At the end of the 1980s, another company, Aventuras AD destinated to produce text adventures, was born from Dinamic Software.  History  At the beginning of the 1980s, young brothers Pablo, Nacho and Victor Ruiz had their first contact with computers. In the case of Victor Ruiz, he started with a Sinclair ZX81, creating some amateur self-made games. On their first attempt as a company, they created NCM, which would later become Dinamic. Their original idea was simply to create a team of programmers, they never thought that it would start such an intense commercial activity. On their first months, they created themselves all the code, recorded themselves the programs on tape, designed and printed artboxes and manuals, and distributed them, as well as designing their ads to publish them on newspapers and magazines. Their official debut was Yenght, a text adventure with graphics for ZX Spectrum, and Artist, a graphic design program, both released in 1983. But their first commercial success would come with the release of Saimazoom in 1984, which would start a trilogy, followed by Babaliba and Abu Simbel Profanation. In 1986, Victor Ruiz would create Camelot Warriors, and the same year he would start the \\"Moves\\" trilogy, with Army Moves in 1986, followed by Navy Moves in 1988. In 1991, Arctic Moves was designed to be published for the Atari ST, but this version was not released due to Dinamic's bankruptcy. The game would be redesigned for PC and published in 1995 by Dinamic Multimedia. After Fernando Martin Basket Master became one of the most successful Spanish video games to date, they started a tradition to hire famous people, mainly sportsmen, to back their video games, something imitated by the rest of the Spanish companies at the time, and later by themselves, with the release of Aspar GP Master and M√≠chel F√∫tbol Master Super Skills. 1987 proved to be their most active year. They released one of the most commercially successful text adventures in Spain, Don Quijote, based on the cartoon series released at the time, both of which are based on the early 17th century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. With it they created the trademark Aventuras Dinamic which would be dedicated entirely on text adventures. However, text adventures, with or without graphics, eventually proved to be commercially unsuccessful in the Spanish market, and Aventuras Dinamic was bought by Andr√©s Samudio, so he could create Aventuras AD, on the condition that he would produce the games, but Dinamic had to distribute them, and so it was. Other titles with massive Spanish and international distribution were Game Over, and Phantis (this one released in the United Kingdom as Game Over II). Their covers included girls with sexy corsets, which were heavily censored outside Spain. It is specially remembered in the case of Game Over where a nipple was visible, and it was covered in the UK with the Dinamic logo, a screen capture or directly with a redrawn corset in subsequent editions. Other successful titles by Dinamic were Freddy Hardest (1987) and its sequel Freddy Hardest In South Manhattan (1989), Turbo Girl (1988), and After the War (1989). During the Golden age of Spanish software, Dinamic distributed their own games in Spain, as well as the ones by Aventuras AD and other minor companies, becoming a rival to Erbe Software in this work. However, with the change of decade and the migration to 16-bit platforms, sales of 8-bit computer games plummeted and after launching Narco Police (1991), Dinamic became unable to distribute their titles any longer. Their last title, Risky Woods, could be released, exclusively for 16-bit platforms, thanks to co-production with Zeus Software, and distribution by Electronic Arts, since Dinamic Software was already immersed in an economical crisis that would lead to their closedown in bankruptcy in 1992. One year later, the Ruiz brothers, with Carlos Abril (one of the designers of Phantis) and the owner of HobbyPress, Jos√© Ignacio G√≥mez-Centuri√≥n, would create a new company, which was named Dinamic Multimedia in honor of the defunct company, but would only be owned on a 30% by the Ruiz Brothers.

He was the son of Fulk the Black. He was bellicose and fought against William VII, Duke of Aquitaine, Theobald I, Count of Blois, and William, Duke of Normandy. During his twenty-year reign he especially had to face the ambitions of the Bishop of Le Mans, Gervais de Ch√¢teau-du-Loir, but he was able to maintain his authority over the County of Maine. Even before the death of his father in 1040, he had extended his power up to the Saintonge, where he founded the Abbey aux Dames. Geoffrey Martel and his wife Agnes also founded the Abbaye de la Trinit√© at Vend√¥me. The first mention of Geoffrey in the Gesta Normannorum Ducum reads: \\"Geoffrey, count of the Angevins, nicknamed Martel, a treacherous man in every respect, frequently inflicted assaults and intolerable pressure on his neighbors.\\"Van Houts, p. 123. \\"In alliance with King Henry I of France, Count Geoffrey laid siege to Tours in the winter of 1042‚Äì3. After the battle of Nouy on 21 August 1044 Count Theobald I of Blois-Chartres (1039‚Äì89) was taken prisoner by [Count Geoffrey], to whom he surrendered Tours with Chinon and Langeais, excluding, however, the monastery of Marmoutier.\\" Henry and Geoffrey became estranged after this, and were not reconciled again until c. 1052, when their names appear together in a charter of August of that year. This is in conjunction with the rebellion of William of Talou against the duke of Normandy, and Count Geoffrey's taking possession of the city of Mans (shortly after 26 March 1051). Allied once again with King Henry, Count Geoffrey assaulted Normandy and seized the towns of Domfront and Alen√ßon, evidently with the help of treachery within. Duke William laid siege to Domfront, which resisted his efforts to retake it throughout the winter of 1052. At this point Talou withdrew from the siege and started his rebellion. Duke William rapidly retook Alen√ßon and then Domfront, driving Count Geoffrey back across the Norman border into Maine. While Count Geoffrey was off balance, Duke William laid siege to Talou's castle at Arques. King Henry failed to relieve Arques, and Talou's rebellion had failed and he was exiled by late 1053. In late January, early February 1054, Count Geoffrey and King Henry together invaded Normandy and marched down the Seine toward Rouen. The King had divided his army and sent the other wing through eastern Normandy under the command of his brother Eudes, supported by Count Reginald of Clermont, Count Ralph of Montdidier, and Guy I, Count of Ponthieu. This army was defeated in a battle near Mortemer. Upon learning of this reverse, King Henry insisted upon retreating from Normandy, and Count Geoffrey accompanied him. For the next several years, the war was centered in the County of Maine, with Duke William on the offensive. But King Henry in 1057, \\"burning to avenge the insult inflicted on him by the duke, summoned Geoffrey, count of Anjou, to prepare a large army for another expedition into Normandy.\\" (GND) This combined effort placed Duke William temporarily on the defensive. He retreated before the invaders as they moved deeper into Normandy. After penetrating to the Bessin, the Franco-Angevin army began to ford the River Dives near the estuary which is tidal. After the king and Count Geoffrey had crossed over, the remainder of their army got stuck on the opposite bank by the incoming tide. Duke William launched a sudden attack and defeated them. King Henry and Count Geoffrey withdrew again from Normandy and never returned. Count Geoffrey continued to offer resistance in Maine against the Norman expansion until his death on 14 November 1060. Family An unusual entry in the cartulary of Ronceray describes a dispute over a vineyard seized by Geoffrey Martel and granted to his \\"wives, or rather concubines\\", Agnes, Gr√©cie, Adele, and Adelaide. Whether these women were his wives or concubines, each relationship can be described. Geoffrey II's first wife was Agnes of Burgundy, the widow of William V, Duke of Aquitaine; she and Geoffrey married in 1032, but had divorced by 1050. His second wife was Gr√©cie of Langeais. Geoffrey II dismissed her to marry Ad√®le, the daughter of a \\"Count Odo\\", perhaps Odo II, Count of Blois. He also divorced Ad√®le, and took Gr√©cie back as his wife. His last wife was a German woman named Adelaide. Despite these marital escapades, Geoffrey died childless. He became a monk in Saint-Nicolas d'Angers in 1060. Succession He was the last member of his paternal House to rule Anjou. He was succeeded by his distaff nephew Geoffrey III of the House of G√¢tinais.

Porto Ferreira was officially established on 9 February 1888, as a part of the municipality Descalvado. It was detached from Descalvado and attached to Pirassununga on 1 October 1892. It became an independent municipality on 29 July 1896.IBGE, history  Demography  Data of the Census - 2010 Total population: 58.797 *Urban: 56.901 *Rural: 1.896 *Male: 29.240 *Female: 29.550 *Infant mortality up to 1 year (for a thousand): 12,76 *Life expectancy (years): 81,82 *Fertility rate (children per woman): 1,95 *Literacy rate: 96.34% *Human Development Index (IDH-M): 0,812 *IDH-M Income: 0,845 *IDH-M Longevity: 0,850 *IDH-M Education: 0,880 (Source: IPEA DATE) Per capita income: U$$3879,56 (estimative of 2010) Urbanization rate: 96.61% Annual Population Growth rate: 1.86% Number of hospital beds: 45 (per thousand inhabitants - 0,73) Population that has access: *Water supply: 98.5% *Sewage: 97.6% *Garbage collection: 100% Source: IBGE  Geography  The highest point of the city is the High Mount, with 798 meters.

At the time, the owners of the land were the Siqueira family, Jos√© Contador, Jo√£o Francisco Pinto and the Manfredini family. A village was created with the time. Another version tells that the brothers Jos√© and Joaquim Gon√ßalves de Souza were the first to arrive. The creation of the city started in 1905, with the distribution of lands between the heirs of Jo√£o Ant√¥nio de Siqueira.

See Ziolkowski et al., 78, and Bachrach, 114. was Count of Anjou from 1103 until his early death, either co-ruling with his father, Fulk IV, or in opposition to him. He was popular with the Church and grew a reputation for curbing tyranny and opposing his violent father, who, according to Orderic Vitalis, enjoyed pillaging and terrorising his subjects.Ziolkowski et al., 78. Geoffrey was a son of Fulk's second wife, Ermengard of Bourbon. His father tried to disinherit him in favour of Fulk the Younger, his son by his fourth wife, Bertrada of Montfort. Fulk, by then an old man, had previously delegated much of his authority to Geoffrey.Bachrach, 125‚Äì26, relying on documents in the cartulary compiled for the church of Saint-Laud-d'Angers. With the support of his father's adversaries, Geoffrey seems to have achieved recognition from his father and from 1103 styled himself \\"count\\" (comes in the Latin of the day) and took control of the government.While Ziolkowski et al., 78‚Äì79, represent Geoffrey as forcing his father to recognise him, Bachrach, 114, citing Kate Norgate, treats Fulk as effectively deposed for three years. He allied with Renaud de Martign√©, Bishop of Angers, against the baron Maurice of Craon. An anonymous poem by a scholar or cleric addressed to a certain Philip, probably Philip of Melun, son of Philip I of France through his dalliance with Bertrada, is an encomium of a \\"Count Martel\\" (Martellus consul), probably Geoffrey IV.The poem's incipit is \\"Omnibus in rebus quas, mi Philippe, uidemus\\" (In all things we see, my dear Philip) and it is found only in the late twelfth-century manuscript collection of Latin verse known as the Carmina Houghtoniensia (Poem 90). It is fifty elegiac distichs long. For an edition of the poem with translation, analysis and commentary, see Ziolkowski et al., 77‚Äì93. The poem is didactic and upholds the count, only named as Martel, as an exemplar of good rulership. The last lines offer hope that he may \\"long prosper\\", and so must have been written during the brief period of his rule in Anjou. Geoffrey was besieging a rebellious baron in the castle of Cand√© when, on 19 May 1106, he was struck and killed by an arrow while going to negotiations. The Chronica de gestis consulum andegavorum attributed this assassination to Fulk and Bertrada, and praised the late count as \\"an admirable man, distinguished in justice, a cultivator or the whole of goodness, who was a terror to all his enemies.\\"Quoted in Ziolkowski et al., 78‚Äì79: admirabilem virum, justitie insignem, totius boni cultorem, qui terror omnium inimicorum suorum fuit, from Louis Halphen and Ren√© Poupardin, edd., Chroniques des comtes d'Anjou et des seigneurs d'Amboise (Paris: A.

He was made nationally famous by Walter D. Edmonds' popular 1936 novel Drums Along the Mohawk with its depiction of \\"Adam Helmer's Run\\" of September 16, 1778, to warn the people of German Flatts of the approach of Joseph Brant and his company of Indians and Tories. Background Adam Helmer was born in German Flatts, New York, to Maria Barbara Kast, and George Friedrich Helmer, who was born on June 9, 1706, in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse a city in the Rhineland-Palatinate region in southwestern Germany. G.F. Helmer emigrated to America sometime before 1710 and eventually settled in one of the numerous Palatine farming communities on the south side of the Mohawk River in central New York. As late as 1774, this Palatine district and others in the area widely supported British control, but with the death of the powerful loyalist Mohawk Valley landowner Sir William Johnson and news of the Declaration of Rights by the Continental Congress, anti-British sentiments began to surface and a Tryon County Committee of Safety was organized. This and the news of Continental Army resistance at the Battle of Lexington and Concord encouraged the remaining Johnson family and other loyalists to fortify their properties and to recruit Iroquois to side with the British. This in turn prompted the colonists in 1775 to organize a militia under the command of Colonel Nicholas Herkimer. Early the next year, Herkimer aided General Philip Schuyler who was sent by Congress to disarm the Loyalists. Many of the loyalists and sympathizing Iroquois led by William Johnson's son Sir John Johnson escaped to Canada where they began to organize to take back their Mohawk Valley holdings. During the summer of 1776 Colonel Herkimer allowed his regular militia to return to their farms; however, about one out of every fifteen soldiers, including Lieutenant Adam Helmer, was assigned to ranger duty. Helmer was assigned as a scout in Captain John Breadbake's company. Battle of Oriskany In the summer of 1777, Herkimer, by then a Brigadier General in the provincial militia, was warned by friendly Oneidas of the impending siege of Fort Stanwix (known to the Americans as Fort Schuyler) by British Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger. General Herkimer ordered Tryon County militia to assemble at Fort Dayton to go to the aid of Colonel Peter Gansevoort at Fort Stanwix. G.F. Helmer and Adam Helmer's brother Johan Fredrich Helmer, as part of the Tryon County militia were called up. Herkimer sent three scouts, Captain Hans Mark Demuth, Hans Yost Folts, and Lieutenant Adam Helmer to Fort Stanwix to relay the news to Colonel Gansevoort. Pressured by his subordinate commanders on August 6, General Herkimer reluctantly and prematurely set out to attack St. Leger's army. While passing through a ravine, they were ambushed by British regulars, Tories, and Indians under the command of Joseph Brant and John Butler, thus starting what would become known as the Battle of Oriskany, Adam Helmer lost his brother, Capt. Johann Friedrich Helmer, in the battle and another, Lt. George Frederick Helmer II, was seriously wounded. Helmer, the fittest of the three scouts, reached Fort Stanwix with the message ahead of the other two, having traversed swampy terrain and floated down river when a severe storm flooded his route. News of the Oriskany battle arrived shortly after Helmer's did, and Ganesvoort ordered an attack on the British encampments. Some combination of the weather and Gansevoort's attack contributed to the retreat of the British from the Oriskany battlefield back to their camps surrounding the fort. In any case, Herkimer's troops were able to escape to await reinforcements. Herkimer himself was wounded in the fight, returned to his home and died soon after. Gansevoort refused to submit to the siege, and the British withdrew from the area with the news that Benedict Arnold had arrived at Fort Dayton with reinforcements. Adam Helmer's run In September 1778, Lt. Helmer and eight scouts under his command were sent to the Unadilla River Valley to spy on Joseph Brant's company of Indians and Tories who were encamped at Unadilla near the confluence of the Unadilla and Susquehanna Rivers. It was feared that Brant would send a raiding party north to the Mohawk Valley during the harvest season to forcefully obtain stores for the winter ahead. When Helmer's scouts reached Edmeston Manor, the farm of Percifer Carr, just north of what is now South Edmeston, they were attacked by a large group of Brant's men, apparently part of the feared raiding party on its way north. Several of the scouts were killed, but Helmer managed to escape. Helmer took off running to the north-east, through the hills, toward Schuyler Lake and then north to Andrustown (near present-day Jordanville, New York) where he warned his sister's family of the impending raid and obtained fresh footwear. He also warned settlers at Columbia and Petrie's Corners, most of whom then fled to safety at Fort Dayton. When Helmer arrived at the fort, severely torn up from his run, he told Colonel Peter Bellinger, the commander of the fort, that he had counted at least 200 of the attackers en route to the valley. (see Attack on German Flatts (1778)). The straight-line distance from Carr's farm to Fort Dayton is about thirty miles, and Helmer's winding and hilly route was far from straight. It was said that Helmer then slept for 36 hours straight. During his sleep, on September 17, 1778, the farms of the area were destroyed by Brant's raid. The total loss of property in the raid was reported as: 63 houses, 59 barns, full of grain, 3 grist mills, 235 horses, 229 horned cattle, 279 sheep, and 93 oxen. Only two men were reported killed in the attack, one by refusing to leave his home when warned. Three days later Helmer led another group of militia back to the Carr farm on the Unadilla, discovered the bodies of three of his scouts, and buried them at that site. The fate of the other five scouts is not known. Helmer also served in the New York State Levies under Colonel Lewis DuBois. Personal Helmer married Anna Bellinger (1757-1841) and sired ten children: Frederick (1777), Margaret (1778), Anna (1781), Adam (1783), Peter (1786), Elizabeth (1788), Catharine (1790), David (179?), Maria Barbara (1795), and Eve (1800). Adam Helmer died on April 9, 1830, in the town of Brutus in Cayuga County, New York. Helmer in novel and film Adam Helmer was an important but fictionalized character in Edmonds' novel, Drums Along the Mohawk. Although Helmer's military actions were generally portrayed with accuracy, including his famous run, Edmonds' description of his person varies from historic description. The book pictures Helmer as a large, unschooled, bachelor womanizer with long blonde hair, while historic descriptions indicate he was a lean , married farmer, seeming to have more in common with the book's main character, Gil Martin. In John Ford's 1939 film adaptation of the novel, Helmer is portrayed by Ward Bond as \\"Adam Hartman\\". Helmer's run was omitted from the film and replaced with a run by Gil to get reinforcements from the nearest fort. The run is the heroic highpoint of the film.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2006 representing the Greater Toronto Area riding of Markham. He was a municipal councillor for the city of Markham from 1997 to 2004 and served as a York Region Councillor from 2006 to 2009. Background Wong was born in Hong Kong and he studied at the Diocesan Boys' School. He received a Bachelor's degree in math from the University of Toronto and Master's in computer science from the University of Missouri. He was a lawyer (University of Toronto) and founding director of the Metropolitan Toronto Southeast Asian Legal Clinic. He was a partner in his own practice, Wong and Chun. He served as a board member of the Markham Stouffville Hospital Foundation, the St. John's Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation and the York Region Police Services Board. He is cousin of Toronto City Councillor Cynthia Lai. Politics In 1997 Wong, ran for the municipal council in Markham, Ontario. He received 1,406 votes defeating his nearest rival by 774 votes. In the 2000 election, he was elected as one of four regional councillors. He was a leading figure in calling for reconciliation between the city's Chinese and Muslim communities in 1999, after a controversy concerning the construction of a local mosque. In 2003, he spoke against an attempt by the government of China to enact \\"anti-subversion\\" legislation in Hong Kong (many recent Chinese immigrants in Markham have dual Canadian/Hong Kong citizenship). In the 2003 provincial election, he contested Markham for the Liberal Party against David Tsubouchi, a prominent cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Markham had been represented by the Progressive Conservative Party since its creation in 1987, and it was anticipated that Tsubouchi would be re- elected despite a strong provincial swing to the Liberals; instead, Wong defeated him by 5,996 votes. Wong acknowledged that his candidacy benefited from a large ethnic Chinese immigrant population in the riding. The Liberals won the provincial election, and Wong was subsequently named parliamentary assistant to Joseph Cordiano, the Minister of Economic Development and Trade. Not long after his election, Wong held a benefit dinner for the daughters of Geng Chaohui, a recent Chinese immigrant to Canada who committed suicide because of underemployment. The event raised $30,000, although it was little reported outside of the Chinese-language press. On September 25, 2006, Wong resigned his seat in the legislature to run for York Regional Council. He won one of four seats in November 2006. He served in council until March 2009 and took a leave of absence. Wong was expected to return to council in September. Wong died of liver failure on June 17, 2009 at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. He is survived by his wife Ellee and his daughter Daphne.

It still retains its former name Praia locally, owing to the parish having once been the historical municipality of Praia. The population in 2011 was 836,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 12.82 km¬≤.Eurostat History S√£o Mateus was one of the first Captaincies of the Azores, and administered by its Captain-Donatorio, Duarte Barreto. The main centre and parish seat obtained the category, and elevated to the title, of vila (or town) during the reign of King John III, by royal charter on 1 April 1546. It operated as the municipal seat until 1867, when its role was superseded by the much larger Santa Cruz da Graciosa. Yet, it still retained the honorific title of vila. During this time, the settlers of the island formed historical, social and economic contacts with the peoples and economy of Terceira, in addition to those ships travelling between Europe and Brazil. In the 16th century it had become a rich parish, and competed with Santa Cruz. In 1890, there were over 1783 inhabitants, but it had already begun a slow decline. Part of the population emigrated to the United States or Canada, while the remaining population relied primarily on a subsistence lifestyle for local consumption. Geography Within an area of less than 13 kilometres square, the parish includes various individual rural localities, including Vila da Praia, Fenais, Fonte do Mato, Lagoa, Pedras Brancas and Feteira. The parish occupies the extreme southeast, along a long valley which separates the Caldeira massif from the rest of the island. To the interior the volcanic crater, simply the Calderia (caldera), is the largest volcanic structure on the island. Within its crater, is the Furna do Enxofre, a large cavern and subterranean lake bio- system popular with tourists. Located directly opposite the village is the Praia Islet, an important natural reserve, classified as a \\"Zone of Special Protection\\", due to the abundant marine bird species that use it for nesting and as transitory stop in annual migrations. The population is aging in this community, and is shifting into a bedroom community of the much larger Santa Cruz. Economy In addition to agriculture, a staple of the fertile lands of the Azores, Praia has been known for being an important fishing community and supplier for the economy of Graciosa. In addition to fish, fisherman have collected and dried algae (Sargassum) as fertilizer. Similarly, Graciosense were producers of tile, for the regional market, resulting in periods of boom. Other complementary activities, in addition to the small garages and mechanical shops, the parish is a center of civil construction and bread makers, and has an outpost of the fiscal auditors, customs, post office and bank.

Aerial view (1953) History Dietwil is first mentioned in 1236 as Tuetwile. To distinguish it from the municipality of Grossdietwil in Lucerne it was also called Kleindietwil or Dietwil im Reusstal. At the beginning of the 15th Century, the Lucerne von Moos family acquired the right to low justice in the village, which they relinquished in 1422 to Lucerne. After the conquest of the Aargau in 1415, the village came under the authority of the city of Lucerne and was part of the Meienberg district. In 1798 Dietwil's ties to Lucerne were severed. With the Act of Mediation in 1803, it became part of the newly created Canton of Aargau. In 1863 a decision of the Cantonal Council of Aargau naturalized all the gypsies who had settled in Dietwil after fleeing Napoleon's armies in Belarus. In 1145 the Catholic parish church of St. James the elder was dedicated. It was replaced in 1780 by the current rococo aisleless church. Between 1370-1806, the Knights of Malta house at Hohenrain possessed the right of patronage. The municipality has a little regional agricultural trade. The ferries from Eien and Gumpelsfahr connect Dietwil with Zug. The nearby on-ramp to the A14 Motorway, which runs from Zug to Lucerne, has led to growth in Dietwil.

With the capital earned through these mills, they invested in railroads, especially the Boston and Lowell. These railroads helped transport the cotton from warehouses to factories. These Boston-based investors established banks‚Äîsuch as the Suffolk Bank‚Äîand invested in others. In time, they controlled 40% of banking capital in Boston, 40% of all insurance capital in Massachusetts, and 30% of Massachusetts' railroads.

Nearby neighborhoods include Windgap, Chartiers City, Crafton Heights, Esplen, and Elliott. The neighborhood was named for William Sheraden, a settler who gave land for the construction of a railroad depot in exchange for the naming rights. Sheraden's original homestead still stands at 2803 Bergman Street, easily distinguished for the two sycamore trees which grow together to form an arch, a legacy of Sheraden's horticulturalist grandson. Originally incorporated as Sheraden Borough in 1894, it grew quickly and was annexed by the City of Pittsburgh in 1907. Shortly thereafter, the Public School Board of Pittsburgh opened numerous educational facilities around Sheraden, including Langley High School, completed in 1923, which replaced the former borough's Riverview High School. Sheraden grew to become a hub for Irish and German immigrants to Pittsburgh. However, in the 70's when suburbia was coming up, the Irish and Germans moved from Sheraden into places like Robinson and even Crafton. Most of the Irish schoolchildren went to Holy Innocents grade school, which is currently closed along with its parish. Holy Innocents also had a high school. Sheraden Park includes a swimming pool, tennis courts, ballfields, outdoor basketball courts and picnic and playground areas. Education Pittsburgh Public Schools operates public schools.

He practiced mostly in Southern California and designed the homes of numerous celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Lon Chaney, Barbara Stanwyck and Charles Correll. He also designed many public and private buildings.Hudson, Karen E., Paul R. Williams Architect: A Legacy of Style, Rixxoli International Publications, Inc., New York, New York, 1993.Hudson, Karen E., The Will and the Way: Paul R. Williams, Architect, Rixxoli International Publications, Inc., NY 1994. Early life and education Williams came from a family of middle class Memphis residents: Chester Stanley and Lila Wright Williams. They migrated to Los Angeles in 1893 with their son, Chester, to start a fruit business, but were not successful. Paul was born in Los Angeles on February 18,1894. His father died in 1896 from tuberculosis and his mother two years later from the same illness, leaving the boys in foster care. He was eventually adopted by C.I. Clarkson and his wife. Williams was the only African-American student in his elementary school. He studied at the Los Angeles School of Art and Design and at the Los Angeles branch of the New York Beaux-Arts Institute of Design Atelier, subsequently working as a landscape architect with Wilbur Cook, Jr. He studied architectural engineering from 1916 to 1919 at the University of Southern California, where he earned his degree, designing several residential buildings while a student there.Mark Alan Hewitt, \\"Williams, Paul R.,\\" in Joan Marter, Ed., Grove Encyclopedia of American Art (Oxford, 2011): online edition Williams became a certified architect in 1921 and the first certified African-American architect west of the Mississippi. He married Della Mae Givens on June 27, 1917, at the First AME Church in Los Angeles. They had three children: Paul Revere Williams Jr. (born and died June 30, 1925, buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Los Angeles); Marilyn Frances Williams (born December 25, 1926) and Norma Lucille Williams (born September 18, 1928). Career Poster from Office of War Information. Domestic Operations Branch. News Bureau, 1943 Williams won an architectural competition at age 25, and three years later opened his own office. Known as an outstanding draftsman, he perfected the skill of rendering drawings \\"upside down.\\" This skill was developed because in the 1920s many of his white clients felt uncomfortable sitting directly next to a Black man. He learned to draft upside down so that he could sit across the desk from his clients who would see his drafts right-side-up. Struggling to gain attention, he served on the first Los Angeles City Planning Commission in 1920. From 1921 through 1924, Williams worked for Los Angeles architect John C. Austin, eventually becoming chief draftsman, before establishing his own office. In 1923, Williams became the first African-American member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). In 1939, he won the AIA Award of Merit for his design of the MCA Building in Beverly Hills (now headquarters of the Paradigm Talent Agency). At one point in his career Williams became interested in prefabricated structures. He worked together with Wallace Neff to design experimental Airform structures which were small homes that only took a few days to construct using simple materials. A. Quincy Jones (1913‚Äì79) was an architect who is claimed to have hired Williams and later collaborated with him on projects in Palm Springs, including the Palm Springs Tennis Club (1947) and the Town & Country (1948) and Romanoff's on the Rocks (1948) restaurants.Barbara Thornburg, \\"The man behind the look\\", Los Angeles Times, February 14, 2009. Lockheed and Guerdon Industries recruited Williams to design a concept for a car-alternative travel system in Las Vegas. He developed the idea of a monorail-like system called the Skylift Magi-Cab that would bring people to and from McCarran Airport and the city center. During World War II, Williams worked for the Navy Department as an architect. During his career Williams designed over 2,000 buildings.  Awards, recognition and honors  = During his lifetime = In 1951, Williams won the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Man of the Year award and in 1953 he received the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP for his outstanding contributions as an architect and member of the African-American community. Williams also received honorary doctorates from Lincoln University of Missouri (doctor of science, 1941), Howard University (doctor of architecture, 1952), and the Tuskegee Institute (doctor of fine arts, 1956). In 1956, he won an award for service, from Wisdom magazine, for \\"contributions to knowledge and distinguished service to mankind.\\" In 1957, he became the first Black member to be inducted into the AIA's College of Fellows. An April 2, 1957 letter from the Executive Secretary of AIA, offered Williams the honor of Fellowship and membership in the College of Fellows \\"for your notable contribution in Public Service.\\" = Posthumous honors = USC listed him among its distinguished alumni in the television commercial for the school shown during its football games in 2004. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) gave him its Gold Medal in 2017, 37 years after Williams's death.

Works =Private homes= Lon Chaney High Sierra House designed by Williams - Inyo National Forest Williams designed more than 2,000 private homes, most of which were in the Hollywood Hills and the Mid-Wilshire portion of Los Angeles (including his own home in Lafayette Square, part of historic West Adams, Los Angeles. He also designed at least one home in the San Rafael district along with many others in Pasadena and La Ca√±ada Flintridge. The Linda Vista Area of Pasadena has many Spanish Colonial and French Country homes of his design including many commissioned by business magnates (Chrysler Corporation) and actors. His most famous homes were for celebrities, and he was well regarded for his mastery of various architectural styles. Modern interpretations of Tudor-revival, French Chateau, Regency, French Country, and Mediterranean architecture were all within his vernacular. One notable home, the Jay Paley House, which he designed for Jay Paley in Holmby Hills, and later the residence of Barron Hilton, was used as the 'Colby mansion' in exterior scenes for The Colbys television series. Williams's client list included Frank Sinatra (the notorious pushbutton house), Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Lon Chaney, Sr., Lucille Ball, Julie London, Tyrone Power (two houses), Barbara Stanwyck, Bert Lahr, Charles Correll, Will Hays, Zasu Pitts, and Danny Thomas. In contrast to these splendid mansions, Williams co-designed with Hilyard Robinson the first federally funded public housing projects of the post-war period (Langston Terrace in Washington, D.C.) and later the Pueblo del Rio project in southeast Los Angeles. Williams famously remarked upon the bitter irony of the fact that most of the homes he designed, and whose construction he oversaw, were on parcels whose deeds included segregation covenants barring Black people from purchasing them. A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Works= (In Los Angeles, unless otherwise noted) *28th Street YMCA, 1006 E. 28th St., Los Angeles (Williams, Paul R.), NRHP-listed *421 La Fayette Park Place, Los Angeles, CA *Angeles Mesa Elementary School, Los Angeles, California *Angelus Funeral Home, 1010 E.

The tomb and fountain are prominently visible from the adjacent San Diego Freeway. It is perhaps a fitting tribute to both Williams and Jolson that he was chosen to design Jolson's resting place since Jolson had a long history of supporting African- American entertainers, in a time when that was controversial. =Professional records= In 1955, Williams was hired to transform a W.W.Woolworth store at the corner of Broadway and 45th in Los Angeles into the Broadway Federal Savings and Loan. When the bank opened, Williams safeguarded much of his business papers in the bank. During the fires that consumed the area after the Rodney King trial in 1992, the Broadway Bank burned and it was feared that much of Williams‚Äô archives had been lost. Williams family had carefully curated the documents and Williams‚Äô granddaughter, Karen Elyse Hudson, agreed to the acquisition of the archive by the Getty Research Institute and the USC School of Architecture. In June 2020, Milton Curry of USC announced the contents of the archive: about 35,000 architectural plans, 10,000 original drawings, blueprints, photographs, and correspondence that help ‚Äúfill the gaps of Los Angeles Modernism in the 20th century.‚Äù Death Memorial to Paul R Williams north of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building dedicated October, 2015 Williams retired his practice in 1973, and died from diabetes on January 23, 1980, at age 85.The Political Graveyard His funeral was held at the First AME Church he designed, and the presiding minister, Rev. Cecil Murray, was joined in the pulpit by Dr. William H.D. Hornaday, the Senior Minister of Founder's Church of Religious Science, that Williams also had designed. Dr. Hornaday described Williams as a gentle and courtly man of the highest integrity. Williams was interred in the Sanctuary of Radiance, Manchester Garden Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood. Williams's widow Della Williams (1895‚Äì1996) co-founded (with Fannie Williams) 'The Wilfandel Club' Established November 21, 1945, by black women active in the Los Angeles, California, community. The Wilfandel Club's goal has been to promote civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, and general culture. The Wilfandel Club is the oldest African-American women's club in Los Angeles. Club meetings are still held at the beautiful Wilfandel Club House on 3425 West Adams Blvd in Los Angeles. Della Williams survived her famous husband by 16 years, living to the age of 100; she died on July 24, 1996. Her funeral was held at Founder's Church of Religious Science, designed by her husband. She was interred in the Williams crypt Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood. On October 29, 2015 a monument and memorial plaza to Paul Williams was dedicated just to the north of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building as part of its recent renovation. The monument, made by artist Georgia Toliver features a 9-foot-tall bas relief of Paul Williams with many of his significant works. The bas relief is flanked with interpretive panels with a biography of Mr. Williams as well as a history of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company.

The only difference is that some people get a license to get paid for thinking and the rest of us just contribute our good thoughts to our fellow man.\\" \\"Without having the wish to 'show them,' I developed a fierce desire to 'show myself,'\\" Williams wrote in his 1937 essay for American Magazine, I Am a Negro. \\"I wanted to vindicate every ability I had.

(1992) Istoria azerbaijanskoi muziki Maarif, Baku, pp. 85-86, in Russian Growing up, Hajibeyov was strongly influenced by Natavan's work.Naroditskaya, Inna (2000) \\"Azerbaijanian Female Musicians: Women's Voices Defying and Defining the Culture\\" Ethnomusicology 44(2): pp. 234-256, p.242 Shusha, often dubbed as the cradle of Azerbaijani music and culture, had a reputation for its musical heritage. The town was also referred to as \\"the Music Conservatory of the Caucasus\\" because of its many talented musicians and singers. And the fact that Hajibeyov grew up in Shusha explains how at 22, in 1908, with very little formal musical education, he was capable of writing a full-length opera. Huseyngulu Sarabski as the first Majnun in the opera Leyli and Majnun (Baku, 1908). Hajibeyov received his early education in a religious school (madrasah), where he perfected his Arabic and Persian. Later he studied at a two-year Russian-Azerbaijani school. Here, with the help of his favourite teacher Mirza Mehdi Hasanzadeh, he familiarized himself with the heritage of the famous classic writers of the East and the West. The richness of the musical performance tradition of Shusha greatly influenced the musical education of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. He would later reflect on his experiences: \\"The first musical education I got as a child in Shusha came from best singers and saz-players. At that time I sang mughams and tasnifs. The singers liked my voice. They would make me sing and teach me at the same time.\\" Uzeyir Hajibeyov's first teacher was his uncle Agalar Aliverdibeyov, an excellent connoisseur of Azeri folk music. In 1897‚Äì1898, when Azerbaijani playwright Abdurrahim Hagverdiyev and singer Jabbar Garyagdyoglu staged the episode Majnun on Leyli's grave from Leyli and Majnun, 13-year-old Uzeyir sang in the choir.Uzeyir Hajibeyov . AzWorld.org. From 1899 to 1904 Uzeyir Hajibeyov studied at the Gori Pedagogical Seminary. There, along with general education, he also acquired music. In this school Hajibeyov learned to play the violin, the violoncello and the brass instrument. After his graduation from the Pedagogical Seminary, Uzeyir Hajibeyov was appointed a teacher to the village of Hadrut in Upper Karabakh. Having worked there for a year, Hajibeyov permanently settled in Baku, where he carried on his career in teaching mathematics, geography, history, Azeri and Russian languages, and music. He wrote the Turkic-Russian and Russian-Turkic Dictionary of Political, Legal, Economic and Military Terms, Used in Press in 1907 and the textbook Arithmetic Problems in 1908, and had them published by the Orujov Brothers Publishing House in Baku.Biography of Uzeyir Hajibeyov at Uzeirbey.aznet.org Hajibeyov was no stranger to the tragic chaos of war; he lived through the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the fall of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan in 1920, and both World Wars. The political repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times ‚Äî from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic\\"Alphabet Transitions: The Latin Script: A Chronology\\" Azerbaijan International, Vol. 5:2 (Summer 1997), pp. 22-24. ‚Äî a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well have been one of the factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage. Merging traditional and Western styles Uzeyir Hajibeyov with his wife Throughout all the tumultuous change in Azerbaijan that took place between 1900 and 1940, one characteristic consistently reflects the character of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. He always searched for ways to merge and integrate the past with the present rather than to discard either form. Rather curiously, even files at the Gori Pedagogical Seminary have shown his persistence in holding on to his own roots even under pressure. On December 3, 1900, when he was 15, it is noted that \\"the student, Uzeyir Hajibeyov, was rebuked because he was talking in his native language.\\" Conversely, when Russian-influenced musicians tried to ban traditional Azerbaijani instruments like the tar, zurna and kamancha, Hajibeyov and his colleagues pushed to incorporate them into the Western orchestra, thereby, giving them an even higher status and ultimately a chance to survive. The great composer √ú.Hacƒ±beyli had the opportunity to open music schools that combined various educational systems. In these schools, national cadres who could integrate into the world music culture were trained. History and music theory of Azerbaijani music were researched and education classes were written. Uzeyir Hajibeyli in the field of music education combined and created in Azerbaijan Western and East traditions. Musical contributions Arshin Mal Alan, written in 1913. In 1908, Hajibeyov wrote his first opera, Leyli and Majnun, based on the tragic love story\\"Leyli and Majnun - 90th Jubilee: The Opera that Shaped the Music of a Nation\\" Azerbaijan International, Vol. 5:4 (Winter 1997), p. 25. by the 15th century poet Fuz√ªl√Æ. This would be the first of 7 operas and 3 musical comedies that Hajibeyov would compose throughout his life. In Leyli and Majnun, the uniqueness of the traditional modal music of mugham was incorporated into a Western genre with the use of instruments indigenous to both traditions. Hajibeyov's second opera Sheikh Sanan was written in 1909 in a form that was entirely opposite to the first. This time Hajibeyov employed a purely European style. Sheikh Sanan received raves as a musical composition, but the content was too progressive for the period. In this opera, Hajibeyov advocated that marriage should not be bound by nationality or religion - in essence, it was another form of integration. But this time, it backfired. The story line follows a religious sheikh on his way to Mecca who meets a very beautiful Georgian lady. To his horror, the lovely creature's father turns out to be a swineherd, caring for what, to him, was a forbidden animal. In the end, the sheikh denounces his religion to win the woman. It is said that when the opera was performed, many people were offended and walked out, leaving Hajibeyov with the realization that he had outpaced his generation too much this time. As a result, he made a drastic decision and burned the score. When asked by Ramazan Khalilov, his assistant, how he could do that, Hajibeyov replied: \\"I didn't destroy my opera. It's my own creation so it's always in my head.\\" Khalilov said that Hajibeyov went on to use this same magnificent music 27 years later to create Koroƒülu, an opera that many acclaim to be his finest.\\"Composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov: 110 Jubilee\\" Azerbaijan International, Vol. 3:3 (Autumn 1995), pp. 76 ff.\\"Why Uzeyir Hajibeyov wrote Koroghlu at Height of Stalin's Repressions\\" by Betty Blair, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 14:2 (Summer 2006), p. 61. In contrast to Sheikh Sanan, Hajibeyov's operas Rustam and Sohrab (1910), Asli and Karam (1912), Shah Abbas and Khurshid Banu (1912), and Harun and Leyli (1915) were entirely based on Azeri folk music elements, primarily mugham. In October 2006, the musical comedy Arshin Mal Alan (\\"The Cloth Peddler\\") by Uzeyir Hajibeyov, written in 1913, was announced to be performed on western stages for the first time. A poster of \\"Arshin Mal Alan\\" at Femina theatre of Paris in 1925. One of Hajibeyov's greatest legacies was bringing forward the idea of establishing a professional music school. Hence the Baku Academy of Music (known then as the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire), was founded in 1920 and named after Hajibeyov after his death. The school has trained Azerbaijan's finest composers such as Gara Garayev, Fikrat Amirov, Jovdat Hajiyev, Soltan Hajibeyov, Tofig Guliyev, and Vagif Mustafazade. His statue \\"sits\\" in front of this grand building that is still devoted to the synthesizing Eastern and Western musical traditions. In 1931, Hajibeyov helped in establishing the Azeri Folk Instruments Orchestra affiliated with the Radio Committee. This orchestra performed European classical pieces, such as those by Mikhail Glinka, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, Georges Bizet and others. Hajibeyov thus was the first musician to adapt the note system to traditional Azeri musical instruments. In 1936, Hajibeyov assisted in founding of the Azerbaijani State Choir within the Azerbaijan Philharmonic Society. One of the most serious problems he faced was the mono-voiced repertoire of Azeri folk songs, which allowed harmonization distort style of the song and, on occasion, even alter the melody line when it changed modes. Hajibeyov resolved this problem by using contrapuntal polyphony and unison-doubling rather than four- part singing in the problematic sections. Hajibeyov devoted much energy to the idea of integrating woman's role and status into the male-dominated world. The concept of women's emancipation runs through many of his works often in the form of comedy or satirization as in the case when he makes fun of the process of selecting marriage partners, a process hindered by the fact that women were still wearing veils until the 1920s when the Soviet regime prohibited them. Publications From 1919 to 1920 Hajibeyov served as editor-in-chief for the newspaper Azerbaijan, the main governmental media body of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1927, Hajibeyov published Collection of Azerbaijani Folk Songs along with composer Muslim Magomayev. For the first time, more than 300 pieces of Azeri folk music were documented by notation. In 1945, he published the book entitled The Basis of Folk Music in Azerbaijan, which has been translated into several languages including English.

It was first published in Japan in 2002 by Entertainment Software Publishing and later by Ubisoft in North America and Europe. The game contains an abbreviated version of Evolution: The World of Sacred Device along with the full sequel Evolution 2: Far Off Promise on the same disc. Both games were originally released on the Sega Dreamcast.  Story  The game is set in the year of 930. An ancient civilization had met its demise one thousand years before. Special individuals are able to use Cyframes, ancient tools, which were excavated from the ruins of the ancient civilization. These individuals are known as Cyframe users or adventurers, and are assigned jobs from the Society, a research institute. The adventurers use their Cyframes to explore ruins. Some of the ruins have hieroglyphics that tell of a Cyframe called Evolutia that has tremendous power. Many search for the fabled Evolutia like the Launcher family and even the army.  Major characters  *Mag Launcher: The only offspring of the renowned Launcher family, Mag lives in his parents' mansion west of Pannam Town. His dream is to become as famed and successful an adventurer as his father, Asroc, who was lost while adventuring and never returned. Now, Mag is the only one to lead the family; despite his talent and enthusiasm, the Launcher family has since spiraled into debt. He is voiced by Thor Bishopric in English. *Linear Cannon: She is always following Mag around on his adventures. Three years before the events of Evolution Worlds, she appeared at the Launcher home with a letter from Mag's father, which requested that Mag protect her. When she first arrived Linear was afraid of everything around her, when Mag gave her an Ocarina she slowly started to feel safer. Linear is habitually shy and silent, only occasionally daring to voice her thoughts, but she wields mysterious healing powers. It is later learned that she is Evolutia, the god of evolution. After defeating Eugene, and revealing her true form, she begins to speak, addressing Mag only, and in combat, or when examining objects. Her sentences are still short. She is voiced by Maria Bircher in English. *Gre Nade: He is the Launcher family's butler. He watches over Mag and Linear with a stern eye, charged by Asroc Launcher with their safety. Gre is often strict, but skilled in all respects befitting a butler: he is good with money, a master chef, and in times of battle, an excellent shot with a rifle. Gre takes away no money when chosen for a dungeon. He is voiced by Richard M. Dumont in English. *Pepper Box: She is a wild adult adventurer with a bazooka-like Cyframe attached to her hip. Pepper is a beautiful and flirtatious young blonde woman who seems to have much experience as an adventurer. Her Cyframe, once sufficiently upgraded, can become extremely powerful. Pepper takes almost half of the prize money when completing a dungeon with her. She wears a stylish blue ensemble. She is voiced by Jennifer Seguin in English. *Chain Gun: A young girl whose family has always been rivals with the Launchers. Chain is brash and a little conceited, but she is always willing to help Mag on a trip into the ruins (in no small part because of her secret infatuation with him). The Guns had wanted a male heir to carry on their legacy, and when Chain was born, her parents raised her as something of a tomboy. Chain takes a small portion of the prize money when completing a dungeon with her. She is voiced by Pauline Little in English. *Carcano: A mysterious but honorable bandit who raids the train Mag and friends are on to Museville. Mag later finds his hideout at Pine Village and defeats him. Near the end of the adventure, impressed with the young Launcher's strength and devotion, he joins Mag to defeat Yurka. Carcano can steal items from enemies, and he wields a devastating and versatile Cyframe that is fashioned after a drill. He is voiced by Terrence Scammel in English. *Eugene: Refined and intelligent, Eugene holds unsurpassed military clout as the head of the 8th Imperial Army. He stations his troops in Pannam Town while searching for Evolutia, in hopes of harnessing its power as a source of unlimited energy. Disturbingly enamored with Linear, he eventually captures her, forcing Mag to confront and defeat him. He is voiced by Arthur Holden in English. *Yurka: The evolution of Destruction, he may also be Linear's brother. After visiting her a few times at hotel he convinces Linear to leave Mag under the presumption that if she stays with Mag he will be in danger. He later combines Linear's power and his own to power a machine called Ulticannon. Linear is brought out of a trance that Yurka put her in by Mag when he plays the Ocarina he gave her. When Linear leaves his jealousy and anger transforms the Ulticannon to a much darker form but is defeated by Mag and his friends. He is voiced by Daniel Brochu in English.  Re-release  Evolution Worlds has several changes in its re-release of Evolution and Evolution 2. The first Evolution has no spoken dialogue, and the sequel has a Japanese voice track. Evolution Worlds uses newly recorded English voice acting for both games. The Linear Watch was removed, due to lack of Dreamcast's portable memory cartridge, Visual Memory Unit. Due to limited disc space, the first part (re-release of Evolution) is highly trimmed down, eliminating almost all of its dungeon crawling and condensing the game's entire plot into fewer, but much longer, cutscenes.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

The album reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. \\"Pictures on My Wall\\" and \\"Rescue\\" had previously been released as singles. Recorded at Eden Studios in London and at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth, Crocodiles was produced by Bill Drummond and David Balfe, while Ian Broudie had already produced the single \\"Rescue\\". The music and the cover of the album both reflect imagery of darkness and sorrowfulness. The album received favourable reviews from the music press, receiving four out of five stars by both Rolling Stone and Blender magazines. Background and recording Echo & the Bunnymen formed in 1978 and originally consisted of Ian McCulloch (lead vocals), Will Sergeant (lead guitar), Les Pattinson (bass) and a drum machine. They released their debut single, \\"The Pictures on My Wall\\", in May 1979 on the independent label Zoo Records. The band then signed with WEA subsidiary label Korova and were persuaded to employ a drummer.Adams 2002, p. 34 Pete de Freitas subsequently joined the band, and in early 1980 they recorded their second single, \\"Rescue\\". The single was recorded at Eden Studios in London and produced by fellow Liverpudlian and ex-member of Big in Japan Ian Broudie. A British tour followed in June 1980 before the band went to Rockfield Studios to record their debut album. Despite talk of the American singer Del Shannon being asked to produce the album, it was produced by the band's manager Bill Drummond and his business partner and The Teardrop Explodes keyboard player David Balfe.Adams 2002, p. 39 The recording of the album only took three weeks, but Pattinson was surprised by the boring nature of the recording process: \\"There was a lot of hanging about. I didn't get all the 'drop-ins' and 'edits' bit.\\"Bell 2003, pp. 6‚Äì7 Music and lyrics The music on Crocodiles is generally dark and moody: In 1980, the British music magazine NME described McCulloch's lyrics as \\"scattered with themes of sorrow, horror, and despair, themes that are reinforced by stormy animal/sexual imagery\\" and American music magazine Creem described Crocodiles as \\"a moody, mysterious, fascinating record.\\"Adams 2002, p. 41 In 1981, music journalist David Fricke, writing for Rolling Stone magazine, said, \\"Instead of dope, McCulloch trips out on his worst fears: isolation, death and emotional bankruptcy.\\" In his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978‚Äì1984, British music journalist Simon Reynolds describes the sound of the album as \\"pared and sparse.\\"Reynolds 2006, p. 440 He goes on to describe Pattinson's \\"granite basslines\\" carrying the melody; Sergeant's guitar playing as \\"jagged- quartz\\" and avoiding \\"anything resembling a solo, apart from the odd flinty peal of lead playing\\"; de Freitas' drumming as minimal and \\"surging urgency\\"; and McCulloch's vocals as having \\"precocious authority.\\" Reynolds describes the songs as being rooted in \\"doubt, anguish, despair\\" while the \\"tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence, vigour and euphoria.\\" He also describes how the line \\"Stars are stars and they shine so hard\\" from the track \\"Stars Are Stars\\" showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous.Reynolds 2006, p. 443 In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how, as a teenager, he felt there was \\"a big movie camera in the sky.\\" McCulloch described the opening line of the track \\"Going Up\\" \\"Ain't thou watching my film\\" as a terrible line, and he went on to say \\"It was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that was what spurred me on.\\" Cover The cover photograph is one of a series taken by photographer Brian Griffin in the woods near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire at night. The photos show themes of introspection, despair and confusion.Adams 2002, pp. 39‚Äì40 Describing the cover photo, music journalist Chris Salewicz said, \\"[...] the Bunnymen are placed in poses of histrionic despair in a near-neurotically gothic woodland that evokes memories of elfin glades and fabled Arthurian legends.\\" Creem magazine said, \\"The cover art suggests four boys dazed and confused in a drugged dream, a surreal where-are-we landscape. The Bunnymen's images are of loneliness, disconnection, a world gone awry.\\" Originally the band wanted the pictures to include burning stakes, but given the possible KKK connotations, they settled for moody lighting instead. However, McCulloch was pleased with the cover, saying \\"the cover [...] is better to look at than the Mona Lisa.\\"Adams 2002, p. 40 Sergeant was less happy, saying that he \\"was pissed off that there was a solo picture of [McCulloch] on the back cover.\\"Bell 2003, p. 7 In the book The KLF: Chaos, Magic and the Band Who Burned a Million Pounds by John Higgs, Bill Drummond says that he saw the face of \\"Echo\\", an imagined giant rabbit, in the cover design. Releases The album was originally released as an LP in the United Kingdom on 18 July 1980 by Warner Bros. subsidiary label Korova. Two tracks, \\"Do It Clean\\" and \\"Read It in Books\\", were included on the cassette but were initially omitted from the LP version of the album because the managing director of Warner Bros., Rob Dickins, mistakenly thought that they contained obscenities. After Dickins realised his error, the tracks were included on the American version of the album, which was released by Sire Records on 17 December 1980. The two tracks were included with the UK release as a limited-edition single. The album was first released on CD in May 1989 by WEA in the UK. It was released on CD in the US by Sire Records the following year. The track listings found on these versions were the same as those of the original LP releases for each country. Along with Echo & the Bunnymen's first five albums, Crocodiles was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003, marketed as a 25th-anniversary edition ten bonus tracks on the UK version and eight on the American version. The UK version contained the missing tracks \\"Do It Clean\\" and \\"Read It in Books\\". The other bonus tracks included \\"Simple Stuff\\", which was the B-side to the single \\"Rescue\\"; early versions of \\"Villiers Terrace\\", \\"Pride\\" and \\"Simple Stuff\\" from the album's recording sessions; and the four tracks from the Shine So Hard EP, \\"Crocodiles\\", \\"Zimbo\\", \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Over the Wall\\". The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot. Two singles were released before the album's release. \\"Pictures on My Wall\\" (as \\"The Pictures on My Wall\\"), the band's first single, was released on 5 May 1979. The single version was recorded before de Freitas had joined the band, but the song was re-recorded for the album with de Freitas on drums. The band's second single, \\"Rescue\\", released on 5 May 1980, became the band's first song to chart when it reached number 62 on the UK Singles Chart. Scottish band Idlewild covered the track \\"Rescue\\" on their single \\"These Wooden Ideas\\" in June 2000. In late 2001, American singer-songwriter Kelley Stoltz released the album Crockodials, a track-by-track cover version of the original Crocodiles album. Reception Writing for NME in 1980, Chis Salewicz described the album as \\"being probably the best album this year by a British band.\\" In his review of the album for Smash Hits, Ian Cranna said that the album was \\"proof positive that there's just no substitute for a good song delivered with power and emotion.\\" Cranna added, \\"[The band] deliver attractive melodies with dark and moody (but not obscure) personal lyrics, all turned into compulsive listening by a driving beat, ringing guitars and a hauntingly emotional voice.\\" Reviewing the album in 1981 for Rolling Stone magazine, David Fricke awarded it four out of five stars and described McCulloch's vocals: \\"[He] specializes in a sort of apocalyptic brooding, combining Jim Morrison-style psychosexual yells, a flair for David Bowie-like vocal inflections and the nihilistic bark of his punk peers into a disturbing portrait of the singer as a young neurotic.\\" Fricke went on to say, \\"Behind him, gripping music swells into Doors-style dirges ('Pictures on My Wall'), PiL-like guitar dynamics ('Monkeys'), spookily evocative pop ('Rescue') and Yardbirds-cum-Elevators ravers jacked up in the New Wave manner ('Do It Clean,' 'Crocodiles').\\" Reviewing the 2003 remastered version for American music magazine Blender's website, reviewer Andrew Harrison also gave the album four out of five stars and said, \\"[...] the Bunnymen were a pure nihilistic thrill, with Will Sergeant's desperate, mantra-like guitar summoning up a primal night of blinking hallucinations.\\" Crocodiles reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart in July 1980. The album has since sold over copies and the band were awarded a gold disc for the album on 5 December 1984 by the British Phonographic Industry.

The range rises to the west of Canberra, the capital city of Australia, and includes the Namadgi National Park in the ACT and the Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in New South Wales. The Brindabellas are visible to the west of Canberra and form an important part of the city's landscape. Location and features The Brindabella Range is located in the northern tip of the Australian Alps bioregion, marking the dividing line with the southern tip of the South Eastern Highlands bioregion and the eastern limits of the Riverina. The northern point of the range is Mount Coree, situated west-northwest of Canberra. From this point the range heads generally south, towards the eastern watershed of the Murrumbidgee River, in a line that marks the western edge of the ACT border with NSW. The most southern point of the range is at Bimberi Gap on the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales border. The range is located adjacent to the Bag Range, Baldy Range, Codys Ridge, Dingi Dingi Ridge and Webbs Ridge. Scabby Range and Bimberi Range lie to the south. The geology of the range comprises block-faulted granites and Palaeozoic metamorphic rocks. There are small areas of Tertiary basalt with buried river gravels and lake sediments. The typical characteristics of the range include low-relief high plains with steep margins and slopes and fault aligned river valleys with deep gorges and waterfalls. Soils in the range change with altitude. At lower levels in forests, texture contrast soils are the norm. In the sub-alpine snow gum areas deep gradational soils with moderate amounts of organic matter are common. Vegetation changes with altitude, aspect, cold air drainage and soil saturation. Low elevations with dry aspects carry red stringybark, white gum, broad-leaved peppermint, candlebark and brittle gum. Moist sites have alpine ash, mountain gum, narrow-leaved peppermint, manna gum and brown barrel, with tree ferns, blackwood and sassafras in gullies. Between alpine ash and mountain gum dominate and abruptly change to sub-alpine snow gum woodlands, heath, grasslands and bogs between . Common species include snow grasses, leafy bossiaea, yellow kunzea, alpine pepper and sphagnum bogs, with candle heath and swamp heath. Alpine herbfield and rare feldmark communities are found above the tree line at . Common species include prickly snow grass, alpine wallaby grass, silver snow daisy, ribbony grass, white purslane, eyebrights, gentians and buttercups. Most alpine species have a limited range. =Peaks= The highest mountain within the range is Mount Gingera at , Mount Ginini at , Mount Franklin at , Mount Aggie at , Mount Coree at , Mount Bramina at , Bulls Head at , Black Bottle Mountain at , Mount Lickhole at , and Brindabella Mountain at . =Nature reserves and national parks= The range straddles both the Brindabella National Park and Kosciuszko National Park, within New South Wales, and the Namadgi National Park, within the ACT and covers an area of . The Brindabella Valley, in the middle of the range, is south-west of Canberra and from Sydney. The valley is on the edge of the Snowy Mountains and the Goodradigbee River flows through the valley. History The traditional custodians of the area now known as the Brindabella Range are the Ngunnawal, Walgalu and Djimantan, all Aboriginal Australian peoples. The Brindabella Valley, located in New South Wales to the west of the range, was first settled by Europeans as a stock outstation for the Yarralumla station in the 1830s, with the first land grant made in 1849. Gold was found in 1860 and mined from the 1880s. In 1887 the Brindabella Gold Mining Company was formed and mining continued until 1910. The valley is now an agricultural area and consists of a number of small cattle farms including the heritage-listed Brindabella Station, the childhood home of Miles Franklin, an early 20th-century Australian author. Australian author Miles Franklin grew up in the Brindabella Valley and wrote an autobiographical work, Childhood at Brindabella, which told of her early life in the valley. =Etymology= The name brindabella is said to mean ‚Äútwo kangaroo rats‚Äù in one of the local Aboriginal language. However, another account states that \\"Brindy brindy\\" was a local term meaning water running over rocks and bella was added by the Europeans from the Italian bella vista, meaning \\"beautiful view\\". Snow country The city of Canberra looking towards the Brindabella Range. The most northerly ski fields in Australia are located in the Brindabella Range and include the Namadgi National Park in the ACT and Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in New South Wales. The highest mountain in the ACT is Bimberi Peak, which lies above the treeline at , at the northern edge of the Snowy Mountains. A ski chalet was constructed at Mount Franklin in 1938 to service the Canberra Alpine Club. Ski runs were cleared and ski tows were improvised. The chalet later operated as a museum before being destroyed in the 2003 Canberra bushfires. A new shelter designed and built by University of Adelaide students opened in 2008. Today, cross country skiing is possible in the area, when conditions allow. Cross Country skiing is also practised at Mount Gingera, which rises above the city of Canberra to an elevation of , and is the most prominent snow-covered peak above the city. Snow play is available at Corin Forest, near Canberra, at an elevation of . A development plan was drafted following the 2003 bushfires which would see three chairlifts installed together with snowmaking facilities and accommodation at this site.

Accessed 27 August 2020.. The sport consists of stand up striking and clinch fighting where the objective is to knock an opponent out, force a technical knockout, or win a match by points. Pradal Serey is most well known for its kicking technique, which generates power from hip rotation rather than snapping the leg, Pradal Serey consists of four types of strikes: punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes. The clinch is used to wear down the opponent. In the clinch, opponents battle for dominant position for short range strikes by way of elbows and knees. Cambodian fighters tend to utilize more elbow strikes than that of other martial arts in the region. In pradal serey, more victories come by way of an elbow technique than any other strikes. History A map of the Khmer Empire which is where Pradal Serey traces its origin The story of pradal serey starts with the Khmer Empire. The Khmer Empire was founded in 802 A.D. at a time when many modern Southeast Asian countries didn't exist yet. Martial arts were used by the military of the Khmer Empire. Pradal Serey has its root from the hand to hand combat use by the military of the Khmer Empire. In the Angkor era, both armed and unarmed martial arts were practiced by the Khmers. Evidence shows that a style resembling pradal serey existed in the 9th century, which may be one of the reasons why the Khmer Empire was such a military powerhouse in Southeast Asia. The Khmer Empire used an early form of pradal serey along with various weapons and war elephants to wage war against their main enemy, the principalities of Champa. The combat between VƒÅli and Sugrƒ´va is depicted on the western gopura of the Banteay Srei (967 A.D.). Thrust kicks and clinching depicted in the bas-relief are still used in pradal serey today. At this time, the Khmer Empire dominated and controlled most of what is now Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and parts of Vietnam.Michael Freeman, Claude Jacques: Ancient Angkor, Asia Books, . As a result, Cambodia has influenced much of Thai and Lao culture.Cambodia: History, britannica.com (retrieved January 28, 2009). This leads the Khmer to assert all Southeast Asian forms of boxing started with the early Mon-Khmer people. The basis of this statement is oral stories from their ancestors supplemented with the bas-reliefs/stone carving in the ancient temples of the Bayon, Banteay Chhmar and other Angkor temples that predate the existence of neighboring nations. Much of the writing on ancient Khmer art has been destroyed by the invading Thai armies when the Siamese sacked and looted Angkor.The Ayutthayan period, britannica.com (retrieved November 5, 2006). During the colonial period, martial arts like pradal serey were considered by the European colonists to be brutal and uncivilized. The French turned the art into a sport by adding timed rounds, a boxing ring and western boxing gloves in an attempt to lessen injury. Originally matches were fought in dirt pits with limited rules while hands were wrapped in rope. Some matches had boxers wrap seashells around their knuckles to increase the damage that could be inflicted. Matches ending in death were not uncommon. Roeun, Van, & Doyle, K. (2003, August 23).

During the chaos of the Vietnam War, Cambodia was undergoing its own civil war. On April 17, 1975, the Maoist Communist rebels, the Khmer Rouge, overthrew the government of the Khmer Republic led by Lon Nol. The Khmer Rouge's plan was to eliminate modern society and create an agrarian utopia.Sites, Kevin. July 18, 2006. Year Zero , Yahoo.com (retrieved November 5, 2006) The Khmer Rouge executed educated people, others who had ties to the old government or anyone who was believed to be advantaged by the old society (doctors, teachers, soldiers, actors, singers, boxers, etc.) and forced the remaining Khmer population into labor camps, in which many died of starvation and diseases, to be re-educated under the new government. Traditional martial arts were banned at this time and many boxers were executed or worked to death, which nearly caused the death of pradal serey. An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians or 21% of the population died during the Khmer Rouge regime according to the studies of the Cambodia Genocide Program of Yale University.\\"Cambodia Genocide Project  Yale University.\\" Cambodian Genocide Project.(retrieved 16 Jan. 2009) This lasted for four years until 1979 when the Vietnamese along with ex-Khmer Rouge officers, including current prime minister Hun Sen, overthrew the Khmer Rouge. During the relative peace since the departure of the Vietnamese and the re-establishment of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the country's traditional arts were revived, including pradal serey. Pradal serey is making a strong comeback since its prohibition in the 1970s. Cambodia is making an attempt to market their style of boxing at the same caliber as other martial arts even though its status as a fourth world country renders a lack of financial funding. Numerous gyms have opened and large masses of students, local and foreign, have come to train in Cambodia. There are weekly matches held, the majority televised live, and many of Cambodia's best have traveled internationally to compete. There are currently approximately 70 boxing clubs nationwide. In 1987, one of the first pradal serey schools abroad opened in the United States. It was started by a former national champion by the name of Oumry Ban in Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California.

All referees, judges and fighters must be licensed by the CABF. Television stations which hold Khmer boxing tournaments do so under the supervision of the CBF. The individual stations are responsible for organizing boxers, trainers, medical staff and musicians. The CBF supplies the match referees, judges and time-keepers. The current president of the CBF is Major- General Tem Moeun. Abroad, Cambodian boxing is promoted by four organizations. These organizations include the European Khmer Boxing Federation based in Germany, the F√©d√©ration des Arts Martiaux Khmers also called FAMK, based in France, the Anh Binh Minh Khmer Martial Arts Association in Vietnam and Kun Khmer Australia based in Australia.

As of 2012, there are over 50 Kun Khmer fights held every week in the Phnom Penh region. =Attempt to unite boxing styles= Nearby Southeast Asian countries have similar styles of boxing martial arts. At an ASEAN meeting in 1995, Cambodia suggested Muay Thai be renamed as \\"Sovannaphum boxing\\" or \\"SEA Boxing\\", which represented Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Sovannaphum means \\"golden land\\" in Khmer and is written as Suwannabhumi in Thai. The name refers to mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian language of Pali. The aim was to unite the styles of Southeast Asian boxing and to avoid a politically incorrect misnomer. Thailand would not compromise, stating that each Southeast Asian country has its own boxing style and that Thailand was responsible for making its boxing style an international sport. At the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, Cambodia did not enter the Muay Thai event in protest of the name used to refer to the sport.

Cambodian boxers train in a gym under a Pradal Serey kru. Many boxers train 6‚Äì8 hours a day and 7 days a week. Health risk As with all contact sports, health risks are a factor. According to Chhoeung Yavyen, a ringside doctor for the Cambodian Amateur Boxing Association, in the past five years 30 kick boxers have sustained serious injury in the ring including broken wrists and arms, broken shins, broken noses, dislodged shoulders, hip injuries and broken jaws. One Cambodian boxer died in the ring in Svay Rieng Province in 2001, but that death was the result of a heart attack, probably brought on by diet pills consumed to help the boxer reduce his weight before the bout. Most of the injuries suffered are curable and don't leave lasting problems. Most boxers are allowed to return to the ring after receiving treatment. Rules and match setup A match consists of five three-minute rounds and takes place in a 6.1 meter square boxing ring. A one-and-a-half- or two-minute break occurs between each round.

He is most notable for the influence he had on the work of his great-grandson, author William Faulkner. Family background He was born in Knox County, Tennessee, to Joseph Falkner (or Forkner or Faulkner).and Caroline Word (or Ward). Both Caroline's paternal grandfather Charles and his brother Cuthbert died during the American Revolutionary War while serving under the command of George Washington. Her father Thomas Adams Word moved the family to Georgia in 1812. Caroline's sister Justianna Dickinson Word married John Wesley Thompson, who in 1834 was arrested for killing a man during a fight. JWT was subsequently acquitted during a trial, and afterwards moved with Justianna to Ripley, Mississippi. Thompson eventually became a district attorney, and later a district judge, in Mississippi. William Clark Falkner lived with his family in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri and Pontotoc, Mississippi, joining the Thompsons in Ripley in 1842. In 1847, he married Holland Pearce. Their only child John Wesley Thompson Falkner, named after WC's uncle, was born in 1848. Holland died in 1849. Elizabeth Houston Vance (1833‚Äì1910) became his second wife in 1851. They were the parents of the following eight children: *William Henry Falkner (1853‚Äì1878) - son *Willett Medora Falkner Carter (1856‚Äì1918) - daughter *Thomas Vance Falkner (1859‚Äì1861) - son *Lizzie Manassah Falkner (1861‚Äì1861) - daughter *Fannie Forest Falkner Dogan (1866‚Äì1929) - daughter *Effie Falkner Davis (1868‚Äì1957) - daughter *Alabama Leroy Falkner McLean (1874‚Äì1968) - daughter *Unknown (died young) Military service He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as First Lieuteant of the 2nd Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers.Robarts, William Hugh (1887). Mexican War Veterans. Washington, DC, p. 59. When the American Civil War broke out, he raised a company of men and was made colonel in the Second Mississippi Infantry of the Confederate Army. Later, he was demoted in an election of officers; he subsequently formed a unit known as the 1st Mississippi Partisan Rangers. and cited by He never regained a prominent role in the Confederate Army, but he was forever known as \\"Colonel Falkner\\" or just \\"The Old Colonel\\" after the war. Later life and death During Reconstruction, he was active in rebuilding northern Mississippi and founded the Ship Island, Ripley, and Kentucky Railroad Company. The first station on the line north of Ripley was located in what is now the community of Falkner. On November 5, 1889, he was shot by Richard Jackson Thurmond, a former business partner. The motive for the shooting was believed to have been a lingering grudge dating back to their partnership. Falkner had just been elected to serve in the Mississippi legislature. He died the next day. Literary works Falkner was also an author, writing novels, poems, a travelogue, and at least one play. His most famous work was a novel entitled The White Rose of Memphis (New York, G. W. Carleton & co.; 1881), a murder mystery set on board a steamboat of the same name. This work was popular enough to be reprinted several times through the early 20th century, selling over 160,000 copies. Partial source: Mississippi Writers and Musicians * *The Life and Confession of A. J. MacCannon, Murderer of the Adcock Family (1845) The Lost Diamond (1867)  * Influence WC Falkner's oldest child John Wesley Thompson Falkner was the father of Murry Cuthbert Falkner. Murry's oldest child was Nobel laureate author William Faulkner. As a child, William (who later changed his surname to Faulkner) reportedly said, \\"I want to be a writer like my great-granddaddy.\\" The elder Falkner served as the model for the character of Colonel John Sartoris, who appeared in the novels Sartoris (1929; reissued in an expanded edition as Flags in the Dust, 1973) and The Unvanquished (1938) as well as a number of short stories. Thus, Colonel Falkner is the inspiration for an integral part of the history of Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. Faulkner's short story \\"Knight's Gambit\\" (in the 1949 collection Knight's Gambit) has been viewed as including a commentary on Falkner's The White Rose of Memphis (1881).

He had a long career in art education and has many sculptures on public display, but he may be best known for That Which Might Have Been‚Äîhis memorial to the four girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Early life Waddell was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1921 and moved to Evanston, Illinois, at the age of ten. There he began to study art at the Katherine Lord Studio, and by the age of 16 was teaching classes there. In 1939, he graduated from Evanston Township High School and moved to Chicago where he attended the School of the Art Institute. In 1942, Waddell married his first wife, Elizabeth Owen, and they had three children: Sean Owen, Seamus, and Seanchan Waddell. Elizabeth and John divorced in 1948. At the time, he was working at Buick Aviation Plant, Melrose Park, Illinois‚Äîas America had entered World War II. Waddell's education was interrupted by a stint in the US Army 1943-1945. Serving as Private First Class during the War, one of his contributions was as a muralist of hope. On the GI Bill, Waddell returned to the School of the Art Institute. He earned two Master's Degrees there and later an Honorary Doctorate from the National College of Education, Chicago (now known as National Louis University). It was at the Art Institute that Waddell met artist Ruth Holland. In 1949, they were married in a small ceremony with friends and fellow students, Leon Golub and Nancy Spero, as witnesses. Through the decades Ruth appeared in many of his paintings and sculptures. Waddell also became a primary muse in Ruth‚Äôs work. They remained married until Waddell's death in 2019 and had two additional sons and a daughter: Lindsey and William Waddell and filmmaker Amy Waddell, respectively. Career Waddell began having one- man shows of his artwork as early as 1942. He had dozens of such shows over the course of six decades as a professional artist. His career as an art educator began in earnest in 1947 when he started teaching evening adult classes in the Central YMCA Adult Education Program in Chicago, which he did until 1955. Overlapping with this position was the teaching of art and art education at the National College of Education‚Äîfrom 1949 to 1955. He assumed the position of head of art education at the IIT Institute of Design in 1955. While in Chicago, Waddell designed a program for students with Down's Syndrome and varied mental and physical challenges at Bruno Bettelheim‚Äôs Orthogenic School. In 1957, Waddell moved his family to Arizona and became head of Art Education at Arizona State College (later known as Arizona State University). He retired from ASU in 1964 to devote all of his energies to his artwork. In 2007, several life-sized bronze sculptures by Waddell were stolen, probably due to the value of the metal after the work has been melted. Death Waddell died November 27, 2019, at the age of 98.

It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004. It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film compares the rise of the neoconservative movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries‚Äîand particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.‚Äîin a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas. The Power of Nightmares was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.  Synopsis  = Part 1. \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" = The first part of the series explains the origins of Islamism and neoconservatism. It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by westernisation under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of Islamic law while still using western technology. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite \\"vanguard\\" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he influences Ayman al- Zawahiri, the future mentor of Osama bin Laden, to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the 1979 Iranian revolution, Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by jahilliyah and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace it with a 'pure' Islamist state. At the same time in the United States, a group of disillusioned liberals, including Irving Kristol and Paul Wolfowitz, look to the political thinking of Leo Strauss after the perceived failure of President Johnson's \\"Great Society\\". They conclude that an emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of Johnson's plans. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the neoconservatives, came to power during the 1980s under the Reagan administration, with their allies Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. They alleged that the Soviet Union was not following the terms of a disarmament treaty between the two countries, and together with the outcomes of \\"Team B\\", they built a case using dubious evidence and methods to prove it to Ronald Reagan. = Part 2. \\"The Phantom Victory\\" = In the second part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich Saudi acolyte Osama bin Laden, join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the Soviet Union's demise. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims. In America, neoconservative aspirations to use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States. = Part 3. \\"The Shadows in the Cave\\" = 11 September attacks, with al-Fadl's description of al-Qaeda, to launch the War on Terror. The final part addresses the actual rise of al-Qaeda. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called \\"al-Qaeda\\". With the September 11 attacks, neoconservatives in the new Republican administration of George W. Bush use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the War on Terror. After the American invasion of Afghanistan fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist sleeper cells in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror to a war on general perceived evils with the invasion of Iraq. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where Tony Blair uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, many allegedly taken on the word of the anti- Taliban Northern Alliance without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of \\"preemption\\" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a dirty bomb attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, \\"In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.\\" Contributors  Content  Adam Curtis, the director of The Power of Nightmares Adam Curtis originally intended to make a film about conflict within the conservative movement between the ideologies of neoconservative \\"elitism\\" and the more individualist libertarian factions. During his research into the conservative movement, Curtis discovered what he saw as similarities in the origins of the neoconservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned documentary shifted to these other two ideologies, with the libertarian element eventually being phased out. Curtis first pitched the idea of a documentary on conservative ideology in 2003 and spent half a year researching the film. Final recordings were made on 10 October, 19 October and 1 November 2004. As with many of Curtis's films, The Power of Nightmares uses a montage of stock footage taken from the BBC archives which Curtis narrates. Curtis has credited James Mossman as the inspiration for his montage technique, which he first employed for the 1992 series Pandora's Box, while his use of humour has been credited to his first work with television as a talent-scout for the magazine programme That's Life! Curtis has also compared the entertainment aspect of his films to the Fox News channel in America, claiming that the network is successful because of \\"[their viewers] really enjoying what they're doing.\\" To help drive his points, Curtis uses interviews with various political and intellectual figures. In the first two parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror, comments in The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas. The film's soundtrack includes at least two pieces of music from the films of John Carpenter, who Curtis credited as inspiration for his soundtrack arrangement techniques, as well as tracks from Brian Eno's Another Green World. There is also music by composers Charles Ives and Ennio Morricone, while Curtis has credited the industrial band Skinny Puppy for the \\"best\\" music in the films.  Airings and distribution  The Power of Nightmares was first broadcast in three parts on BBC Two in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning with 'Baby it's Cold Outside' on 20 October, 'The Phantom Victory' on 27 October, and 'The Shadows in the Cave' on 3 November. The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode prior to its airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the third part updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal. In May 2005, the film was screened in a 2¬Ω hour edit at the Cannes Film Festival. Path√© purchased distribution rights for this cut of the film. By 2008, the film had yet to be aired in the United States. Curtis has remarked on this failure, Although the series has never been shown on U.S. television, its three parts were shown on 26 February 2005 as part of the True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, with a personal appearance made by Curtis. It has also been featured at the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival and the San Francisco International Film Festival, the latter awarding Curtis their Persistence of Vision Award. The film was also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, and there was a brief theatrical run in New York City in 2005. The film was first aired by CBC in Canada in April 2005, and again in July 2006. The Australian channel SBS had originally planned to air the series in July 2005, but it was cancelled, reportedly in light of the London bombings of 7 July. It was ultimately aired in December, followed by Peter Taylor's The New Al-Qaeda under the billing of a counter-argument to Curtis. In April 2005, Curtis expressed interest in releasing an official DVD because of popular demand, but noted that his montage technique created serious legal problems with getting such a release approved. An unofficial DVD release was made in the quarterly DVD magazine Wholphin over three issues.  Reaction  = Critical reaction = The Power of Nightmares received generally favourable reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, with an average score of 8.1/10, based upon a sample of 8 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 78, based on six reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Entertainment Weekly described the film as \\"a fluid cinematic essay, rooted in painstakingly assembled evidence, that heightens and cleanses your perceptions\\" while Variety called it \\"a superb, eye-opening and often absurdly funny deconstruction of the myths and realities of global terrorism.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to \\"a brilliant piece in the Atlantic Monthly that's (thankfully) come to cinematic life.\\" The New York Times had a more skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare attacks on Bill Clinton by American conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a review by literary and film critic A. O. Scott) that, \\"its understanding of politics, geo- and national, can seem curiously thin.\\" In May 2005, Adam Curtis was quoted as saying that 94% of e-mails to the BBC in response to the film were supportive. The film won a BAFTA Award in the category of Best Factual Series in 2005. Other awards were given by the Director's Guild of Great Britain and the Royal Television Society. =Political reaction= Progressive observers were particularly pleased with the film. Common Dreams had a highly positive response to the film, comparing it to the \\"red pill\\" of the Matrix series, a comparison Curtis appreciated. Commentary in The Village Voice was also mostly favorable, noting, \\"As partisan filmmaking, it is often brilliant and sometimes hilarious ‚Äì a superior version of Syriana.\\" The Nation, while offering a detailed critique on the film's content, said of the film itself \\"[it] is arguably the most important film about the 'war on terrorism' since the events of September 11.\\" Among conservative and neoconservative critics in the United States, The Power of Nightmares has been described as \\"conspiracy theory\\", anti-American or both. David Asman of FoxNews.com said, \\"We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti- American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity.\\" His views were shared by commentator Clive Davis, ending his commentary on the film for National Review by saying, \\"British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of 'Amerika' as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth.\\" Other commentators have variously described the film as pushing a conspiracy theory. Davis and British commentator David Aaronovitch both explicitly labelled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis \\"his argument is as subtle as a house-brick.\\" Attacks in this vein continued after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, with the Christian Broadcasting Network referencing the film as a source for claims by the \\"British left\\" that \\"the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud\\", and the Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council calling it \\"the loopiest, most extreme anti-war documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC.\\" In The Shadows in the Cave, Curtis emphasises that he does not discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, but that the threat of terrorism had been greatly exaggerated. He responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory by saying he believes the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film \\"have stumbled on it.\\" Peter Bergen, writing for The Nation, offered a detailed critique of the film. Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised as the Bush administration stressed, it is still a very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, \\"This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks.\\" Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September. Additional issues have been raised over Curtis's depiction of the neoconservatives. Davis's article in National Review showed his displeasure with Curtis's depiction of Leo Strauss, claiming, \\"In Curtis's world, it is Strauss, not Osama bin Laden, who is the real evil genius.\\" Peter Bergen claimed the film exaggerated the influence of Strauss over neoconservatism, crediting the political philosophy more to Albert Wohlstetter. A 2005 review on Christopher Null's Filmcritic.com took issue with Curtis's retelling of the attacks on Bill Clinton in 'The Phantom Victory', crediting these more to the American Religious Right than the \\"bookish university types\\" of the neoconservative movement. Daniel Pipes, a conservative American political commentator and son of Richard Pipes who was interviewed in the film, wrote that the film dismisses the threat posed by Communism to the United States as, in Pipes words, \\"only a scattering of countries that had harmless Communist parties, who could in no way threaten America.\\" Pipes noted that the film adopts this conclusion without mentioning the Comintern, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Klaus Fuchs or Igor Gouzenko. Allegations have been made of omissions in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb. = Comparisons to Fahrenheit 9/11 = After its release, The Power of Nightmares received multiple comparisons to Fahrenheit 9/11, American filmmaker Michael Moore's 2004 critique of the first four years of George W. Bush's presidency of the United States. The Village Voice directly named The Power of Nightmares as, \\"the most widely discussed docu agitprop since Fahrenheit 9/11.\\" The Nation and Variety both gave comments lauding Curtis's film as superior to Fahrenheit and other political documentaries in various fields; the former cited Curtis's work as being more \\"intellectually engaging\\" and \\"historically probing\\", while the latter cited \\"balance, broad-mindedness and sense of historical perspective.\\" Moore's work has also been used as a point of comparison by conservative critics of Curtis. Curtis has attempted to distinguish his work from Moore's film, describing Moore as \\"a political agitprop film-maker,\\" arguing that, \\"you'd be hard pushed to tell my politics from watching [The Power of Nightmares].\\"  See also  * Culture of fear * Adam Curtis * Bitter Lake (2015) * The Century of the Self (2002) * The Living Dead (1995) * The Mayfair Set (1999) * Pandora's Box (1992) * The Trap (2007)  References   External links  * Part 1 - Official page at BBC News * Part 2 - Official page at BBC News * Part 3 - Official page at BBC News * * Power of Nightmares re-awakened ‚Äì Questions from BBC viewers answered by Curtis * Power of Nightmares background ‚Äì Further reading suggested by Curtis * Interview with Adam Curtis at Cinema Scope * Interview with Adam Curtis at GreenCine, 12 May 2005 (archived 2013) * \\"Adam Curtis talks with Errol Morris\\" at errolmorris.com Category:2004 British television series debuts Category:2004 British television series endings Category:2000s British documentary television series Category:BBC television documentaries Category:Criticism of neoconservatism Category:Works about Islamism Category:Works about al-Qaeda Category:Works about the Taliban Category:Works about neoconservatism Category:British political television series Category:British television miniseries Category:English-language television shows Category:2004 in British politics ","title":"The Power of Nightmares"},{"id":"1133408","title":"Pornography laws by region"},{"id":"1133419","text":"Anti-pornography protest on Oxford Street, London Reasons for opposition to pornography include religious objections, feminist concerns, and claims of harmful effects, such as pornography addiction. Anti-pornography movements have allied disparate social activists in opposition to pornography, from social conservatives to harm reduction advocates. The definition of \\"pornography\\" varies between countries and movements, and many make distinctions between pornography, which they oppose, and erotica, which they consider acceptable. Sometimes opposition will deem certain forms of pornography more or less harmful, while others draw no such distinctions. A 2018 Gallup survey reported that 43% of U.S. adults believe that it is \\"morally acceptable,\\" a 7% increase from 2017. Historically, from 1975‚Äì2012, the gender gap in pornography opposition has widened, with women remaining more opposed to pornography than men and men's opposition has declined faster. Religious views Most world religions have positions in opposition to pornography from a variety of rationales, including concerns about modesty, human dignity, chastity and other virtues. There are numerous verses in the Bible which are cited as condemning pornography or adultery, notably for Christians, Matthew 5:28 in the Sermon on the Mount which states \\"that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly condemns pornography because it \\"offends against chastity\\" and \\"does grave injury to the dignity of its participants\\" since \\"each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others\\". Islam also forbids adultery, and various verses of the Quran have been cited as condemning pornography, including Quran 24:31 which tells men to \\"restrain their eyes\\" from looking sexually at women. Feminist views Some feminists are opposed to pornography, arguing that it is an industry which exploits women and is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they charge that abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where they charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment).Morgan, Robin (1974). \\"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\\". In: Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist. Random House. . They charge that pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism.MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. pp. 146‚Äì150. However, many other feminists are opposed to censorship, and have argued against the introduction of anti-porn legislation in the United States - among them Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, Karen DeCrow, Wendy Kaminer and Jamaica Kincaid. Some sex-positive feminists actively support pornography that depicts female sexuality in a positive way, without objectifying or demeaning women.  Conservative views  Religious conservatives commonly oppose pornography, along with a subset of feminists, though their reasoning may differ. Many religious conservatives view pornography as a threat to children. Some conservative Protestants oppose pornography because it encourages non-procreative sex, encourages abortion, and can be connected to the rise of sexually transmitted diseases. Concerned Women For America (CWA) is a conservative organization that opposes same-sex marriage and abortion. When discussing violence against women, the CWA often uses pornography to illustrate their points. The CWA asserts that pornography is a major reason why men inflict harm on women. The CWA argues that pornography convinces men to disrespect their wives and neglect their marriages, thereby threatening the sanctity of traditional marriage. Unlike other issues CWA has tackled, they are less forcefully anti-feminist when it comes to the topic of pornography, as many of their points surrounding why pornography is distasteful parallels those of anti-pornography feminists. Harm-based views Dolf Zillmann argued in the 1986 publication \\"Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography\\" that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many unfavorable sociological effects, including a decreased respect for long-term monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He describes the theoretical basis of these experimental findings: > The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family > concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor > marriage, family, and children... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual > engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or > committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again... > Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional > attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the > relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, > curtailments, and costs...Zillmann, pages 16-17 A study by Zillman in 1982 also indicated that prolonged exposure to pornography desensitized both men and women toward victims of sexual violence. After being shown pornographic movies, test subjects were asked to judge an appropriate punishment for a rapist. The test subjects recommended incarceration terms that were significantly more lenient than those recommended by control subjects who had not watched pornography. Some researchers like Zillman believe that pornography causes unequivocal harm to society by increasing rates of sexual assault. Other researchers believe that there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes. Pornography is often criticized for presenting an inaccurate picture of human sexuality. The appropriation of the sexually explicit in American culture is part of what has been called \\"the pornification of America\\". Rape culture is often discussed when it comes to pornography, and is defined by society victim-blaming women because of their rape. It is known as society making rape less substantial. Some of the most searched titles on pornography websites is rape scenes. Allegations of pornophobia Pornophobia, from Greek roots pornƒì, \\"whore\\" and phobia, literally means fear of prostitutes. It may also refer to fear of sexual expression, in particular, fear of pornography. Nadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, uses the coinages \\"pornophobia\\" and \\"pornophobes\\" when referring to attitudes of pro- censorship and conservatives to the imagery of nudity, which they often refer to as \\"pornography\\". :Adapted from: Strossen states that incidents have occurred at several colleges such as the University of Arizona and the University of Michigan Law School where feminist students have physically attacked exhibits of photographic self-portraits claiming that they must be taken down because these exhibits had sexual themes.

Early life He was born in Calverley Old Hall, near Bradford, the son of Ellis Cunliffe Lister (1774‚Äì1853), the first Member of Parliament elected for Bradford after the Reform Act of 1832 and Mary (n√©e Kay) Lister. In 1854 he married Anne Dearden, daughter of John Dearden; they had five daughters. He started his working life working for a Liverpool firm of merchants. Industry and enterprise Lister's Mill Lister went on to play a key role in the development of Bradford's wool industry during the nineteenth century Industrial Revolution. The textile industry transformed Bradford from a small rural town into a rich and famous city. As well as being a successful mill owner he occasionally diverged to other subjects, such as an air brake for railways. He was fond of outdoor sports, especially coursing and shooting, and was a keen patron of the fine arts. In 1838 he and his elder brother John started as worsted spinners and manufacturers in a new mill which their father built for them at Manningham. Lister's Mill (otherwise known as Manningham Mills), and its owner, were particularly well known in the district. The business eventually made Lister one of Bradford's most famous fathers, a multi-millionaire and the provider of thousands of jobs in the city. Lister's Mill changed the identity of the region, and its economy. Lister himself came to epitomise Victorian enterprise. However it has been suggested that his capitalist attitude made trade unions necessary.  Textiles  Lister nip comb in Bradford Industrial Museum Lister invented the Lister nip comb which separated and straightened raw wool, which has to be done before it can be spun into worsted yarn, and in the nineteenth century it was a hot, dirty and tiring job. By inventing the nip comb, Lister revolutionised the industry. Around 1855 he began work to find a way of utilising the fibre contained in silk waste. The task occupied his time for many years and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy, but at last he succeeded in perfecting silk-combing appliances which enabled him to make good quality yarn at a low cost. Another important invention in connection with silk manufacture was a velvet loom patent that he bought in 1867 to the Catalan inventor Jacint Barrau. The new loom was built at Manningham Mills by Jaume Reixach, Barrau's foreman and Lister's Mill director afterwards, and made him very rich. However, the business was seriously affected by the prohibitory duties imposed by the United States, making him an early critic of the British policy of free trade.  Honours  Memorial plaque of Samuel Lister and family In 1887 he was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire. In 1891 he was made a peer; he took his title from the little Yorkshire town of Masham, close to which is Swinton Park, purchased by him in 1888. He died at Swinton Park on 2 February 1906, and was succeeded by his son, Samuel Cunliffe Lister, 2nd Baron Masham.  Lister Park  The statue of Lister in Bradford's Lister Park depicts him standing with a two-foot rule clasped across his chest. A statue of him now stands in Lister Park, in Manningham,Bradford, West Yorkshire, sculpted by Matthew Noble from a block of white Sicilian marble and unveiled on Saturday 15 May 1875 by W. E. Forster, then Member of Parliament for Bradford. Lister Park was donated to the people of Bradford by Lister.

He is an independent member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of Simcoe‚ÄîGrey, and was first elected in 1990 to the predecessor riding of Simcoe West. He sat as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario caucus from his first election until November 2, 2018, when he resigned from caucus due to allegations of sexual misconduct. While part of the PC caucus, Wilson was chosen by his fellow caucus members on July 2, 2014, to serve as interim leader of the party and Leader of the Opposition following the resignation of Tim Hudak. He continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition until September 2015 when new party leader, Patrick Brown entered the legislature through a by-election. Background Wilson was educated at St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto where he served as student council president and as a member of the university's governing council. During and after his graduation, he worked as an assistant to Ontario Management Board chair George McCague, and subsequently worked for federal cabinet minister Perrin Beatty. Politics =In opposition= In the 1990 provincial election, he was elected in Simcoe West by 1940 votes over New Democrat Leo Loserit. The NDP won a majority government in this election, while the Tories won only 20 seats of 130 for third-party status. In September 1991, Wilson was appointed as party Critic for health policy. =Harris government= There was a significant swing to the Progressive Conservatives in the 1995 provincial election, and Wilson was re-elected by almost 20,000 votes over his nearest opponent. On June 26, 1995, he was appointed Minister of Health in the government of Mike Harris. As health minister, Wilson resigned in the wake of allegations that a member of his staff improperly obtained and leaked confidential information about a cardiologist's income as part of a bid to discredit a vocal opponent in the continuing dispute over government cutbacks in doctors' incomes. The personal information leaked was deemed to be without the knowledge of, or at the request of the minister or ministry staff. In October 1997, Wilson was named as Minister of Energy, Science and Technology. After redistribution, Wilson ran for re-election in the 1999 provincial election in the new seat of Simcoe‚ÄîGrey. He defeated his nearest opponent, Liberal Norman Sandberg, by over 19,000 votes. =Eves Government= He was retained in the Energy, Science and Technology portfolio until April 2002, when Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier. Eves named Wilson as Minister of Northern Development and Mines, and Chair of the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation. On June 17, 2003, he was also named Minister of Environment. =Opposition (2nd time)= The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 election, although Wilson retained Simcoe‚ÄîGrey by a reduced margin. In 2004, he supported John Tory's successful bid to replace Eves as party leader. In 2009, he supported Tim Hudak's successful bid to replace Tory as party leader. He was re-elected to the Ontario Legislature on October 10, 2007, defeating his nearest opponent by 11,711 votes. He was re-elected again in the 2011 election for his sixth term defeating his nearest opponent by 14,935 votes. He was re-elected by a slimmer margin in the 2014 provincial election. Under Hudak, from 2011 to 2014, Wilson served as Opposition House Leader. Interim leadership Following Hudak's resignation, Wilson was chosen interim leader by caucus on July 2, 2014, defeating John Yakabuski and Randy Hillier and served until a leadership election was held in May 2015 which chose Patrick Brown as Hudak's permanent successor. In the fall of 2015, Wilson then returned to his role as Opposition House Leader. =Ford government and resignation from PC caucus= Wilson was sworn in as Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade when the ministry was formed. Wilson resigned from cabinet and the Progressive Conservative caucus on November 2, 2018. A statement from the Office of the Premier stated that his resignation was to \\"seek treatment for substance addiction\\". Media later reported that Wilson's resignation was related to allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The Premier's Office initially refused to confirm or deny the reports. However, Premier Doug Ford confirmed on November 7, 2018, that Wilson was asked to resign from caucus in response to allegations of sexual misconduct; Ford further added that his office had initially claimed publicly that Wilson's resignation was for substance abuse treatment to protect the complainant. In September 2020, after having served 30 years in the legislature, Wilson announced that he will not seek re- election.

He is best known for spreading literacy in Wales with his circulating schools.Griffith Jones an.d the Circulating Schools. Retrieved 1 December 2018. Family background Jones was born in 1683 or 1684 at Penboyr, Carmarthenshire, and christened on 1 May 1684. His father was John Ap Gruffydd, \\"a godly father\\", Revd Ivor J. Bromham: \\"Welsh Revivalists of the Eighteenth Century\\" Churchman (72/1 1958), p. 1. and his mother Elinor John. Later in life, he married Margaret, who was described as a charitable and pious woman. Education After village school, Jones became a shepherd, but then entered Carmarthen Grammar School, with the aim of becoming a clergyman. About 1707 he applied for ordination, and according to John Evans of Eglwys Cymyn (1702‚Äì1782), was rejected more than once, but owing to the influence of Evan Evans, vicar of Clydeu, Pembrokeshire, he was at last ordained as a priest by Bishop George Bull in 1708.David Jones, Life and Times of Griffith Jones (1902) online Circulating schools Jones was appointed in 1716 rector of Llanddowror, where he remained for the rest of his working life. He was an enthusiastic member of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. In 1731, he started what were known as circulating schools, in order to teach people to read. These were held in one location for about three months before moving (\\"circulating\\") to another place in Carmarthenshire. The language of instruction in these schools was the language of the people, Welsh. The idea met with enthusiasm, and by his death in 1761, it is estimated that over 200,000 people had learnt to read in schools organised by Jones throughout the country. Jones taught people to read that they might know those things that were necessary for their salvation ‚Äì the curriculum at his schools consisted only in the study of the Bible and the catechism of the Church of England. But in doing so he joined in creating a country with a literate population and a deeper knowledge of the Christian scriptures. This may have played a key role in making the people of Wales ready to accept Methodism. He is often thought of as the forerunner of Methodist ideas in Wales. He was a powerful preacher and he would preach in the open air, as later the Methodists would do, and bring upon himself the censure of bishops for addressing irregular meetings. He lent his critical support to the Methodist revival, and was associated with the early leaders. Daniel Rowland was converted through his preaching. On 8 April 1761, aged 77, he died at the home of Bridget Bevan in Laugharne, where he had resided since his wife's death. Bridget Bevan continued to manage and support the schools until she died in 1779. Both were buried in Llanddowror Church. Griffith Jones and the Circulating Schools. Retrieved 1 December 2018.

The dock is located in the northern dock system in Vauxhall, connected to Sandon Half Tide Dock to the north and Nelson Dock to the south. Jesse Hartley was the architect with opening in 1848. In December 2019 Everton F.C. applied for planning permission for a stadium to be built on the dock.The People's Project History The dock was opened on 4 August 1848, as part of Jesse Hartley's major northern expansion scheme of that year, and was named after and opened by John Bramley-Moore, chairman of the dock committee at the time. When built, Bramley-Moore Dock was the most northerly part of the dock system. At the time, access to the River Mersey was from the south, through the new Nelson and Salisbury Docks, which were all commissioned simultaneously. When built, Bramley-Moore Dock was used for the largest steamships of the era. In 1851, further docks were opened to the north. These included Wellington Half Tide Dock, which gave a second access point for Bramley-Moore into the Mersey. The berthing of the larger ships was moved to the new Sandon Dock and Huskisson Dock within a few years of opening because of the ease of access to the river these docks offered. Around 1900, the Wellington Dock and the adjoining Sandon Dock were realigned, with the half tide dock separated as Sandon Half Tide Dock, as it remains today. Although a mixed use dock, with one of the original transit sheds still in place, Bramley-Moore did extensive coal trade. The coal handling included both coal for export and bunker coal for steamships in the port, transported from the South Lancashire Coalfield. A high-level railway opened in 1857 to transport coal directly to the north quay. The high-level railway was connected by viaduct to the adjacent Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway line. The high-level railway was operational from 1856 to 1966. After the decline in coal-fired steamships, the dock continued to export coal. Following the demise of coal mining in South Lancashire, and most of the UK, the export market for coal dissolved with the dock ceasing coal exports in 1988. The dock is still commercially active with one of the original 1848 transit sheds still in use. Two other quays are used for unloading aggregates. The port's Svitzer tugs are based, with their home berths, in the dock. Disused hydraulic accumulator tower Bramley-Moore Dock is the location of one of Liverpool's brick-built hydraulic accumulator towers. The tower provided hydraulic power to dock gates and lifting equipment.

Bramley-Moore Dock is encompassed in the site. Bramley-Moore Dock is the most northern of the docks within the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City World Heritage Site & the planned Liverpool Waters and the most southerly of the working docks. The hydraulic tower and dock retaining walls are Grade II listed buildings. On 23 March 2017 it was announced that an agreement was reached between Liverpool City Council, Everton F.C. and Peel Holdings to acquire the dock for a new football stadium.

In Japan, „É¢„Ç∞„É©ÈÄÄÊ≤ª (mogura taiji, \\"Mole Buster\\") is a popular arcade game invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada of TOGO, based on ten of the designer's pencil sketches from 1974, licensed to Bandai in 1977. It can also be commonly found at Japanese festivals. A typical Whac- A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, soft, black mallet. Five holes in the play area top are filled with small plastic moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by whacking each mole as it appears. The faster the reaction the higher the score. Play The cabinet has a three-digit readout of the current player's score and, on later models, a best score of the day readout. The mallet is usually attached to the game by a rope in order to prevent anyone from walking away with it. Current versions of the Whac-A-Mole include three displays for Bonus Score, High Score as well as current game score. Home versions, as distributed by Bob's Space Racers, include one display to show the current score. If the player does not strike a mole within a certain time or with enough force, it will eventually sink back into its hole with no score. Although gameplay starts out slow enough for most people to hit all of the moles that rise, it gradually increases in speed, with each mole spending less time above the hole and with more moles outside of their holes at the same time. After a designated time limit, the game ends, regardless of the skill of the player. The final score is based upon the number of moles that the player struck. In addition to the single-player game described above, there is a multi-player game, most often found at amusement parks. In this version, there is a large bank of individual Whac-A-Mole games linked together, and the goal is to be the first player to reach a designated score, rather than hit the most moles within a certain time. In most versions, striking a mole is worth ten points, and the winner is the first player to reach a score of 150 (i.e., 15 moles). The winner receives a prize, typically a small stuffed animal, which can be traded up for a larger stuffed animal should the player win again. Game play options have become more adjustable, allowing the operator and/or owner to selectively alter the high score, hits points, rate of progressive speed as well as the game time. Variations Whac-A-Mole machine for small children in Hainan, China The original Whac-A-Mole game inspired the first genre of games with a violent aspect as central to their user experience. Researchers have used Whac-A-Mole and its variations to study the violent aspects of these games. The Whac-A-Mole game trademark is owned by Bob's Space Racers.Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS), United States Patent and Trademark Office Machines with similar gameplay are sold under other names. Whac-A-Mole has also been the basis for a number of internet games and mobile games that are similar in play and strategy. Engineer Tim Hunkin built and installed a \\"Whack a Banker\\" machine at Southwold Pier in England in 2009 made from parts of a previous \\"Whack a Warden\\" machine. Design The moles are mounted on rods and raised by a lever and crank system. When the user strikes the mole, a microswitch is activated by a pin housed within the mole and the system lowers the mole. The timing of the moles was originally controlled by tones from an audio tape which then drive an air cylinder system. Colloquial usage The term \\"Whac-a-mole\\" (or \\"Whack-a- mole\\") is used colloquially to depict a situation characterized by a series of repetitious and futile tasks, where the successful completion of one just yields another popping up elsewhere. In computer programming/debugging it refers to the prospect of fixing a bug causing a new one to appear as a result. In an Internet context, it refers to the challenge of fending off recurring spammers, vandals, pop-up ads, malware, ransomware, and other distractions, annoyances, and harm. In law enforcement it refers to criminal activity popping up in another part of an area after increased enforcement in one district reduces it there.Eleanor Clift, et al. \\"Refusing To Lose.\\" Newsweek 150.4 (2007): 22‚Äì30. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Dec. 2011. In a military context it refers to ostensibly inferior opposing troops continuing to appear after previous waves have been eliminated. It has also been applied to fake news, where as soon as one story is debunked another appears elsewhere - or sooner. In late June 2020, Boris Johnson based the UK's COVID-19 strategy on the game.

Operation  Video describing the United States' nuclear launch authorization process If the president (who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces) decides to order the use of nuclear weapons, he or she would be taken aside by the \\"carrier\\" and the briefcase would be opened. A command signal, or \\"watch\\" alert, would then be issued to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president would then review the attack options with the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and decide on a plan, which could range from a single cruise missile to multiple ICBM launches. These are preset war plans developed under OPLAN 8010 (formerly the Single Integrated Operational Plan). Then, using Milstar, the aide, a military officer, would contact the National Military Command Center and NORAD to determine the scope of the pre-emptive nuclear strike and prepare a second strike, following which Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency or Boeing E-4Bs and TACAMOs would air the currently valid nuclear launch code to all operational nuclear delivery systems. Where a two-person verification procedure would be executed following this, the codes would be entered in a Permissive Action Link. Before the order can be processed by the military, the president must be positively identified using a special code issued on a plastic card, nicknamed the \\"biscuit\\".Hacking Nuclear Command and Control, International Commission on Nuclear Non proliferation and Disarmament, p. 10. The United States has a two- man rule in place at nuclear launch facilities, and while only the president can order the release of nuclear weapons, the order must be verified by the secretary of defense to be an authentic order given by the president (there is a hierarchy of succession in the event that the president is killed in an attack). This verification process deals solely with verifying that the order came from the actual president. The secretary of defense has no veto power and must comply with the president's order. Once all the codes have been verified, the military would issue attack orders to the proper units. These orders are given and then re-verified for authenticity. It is argued that the president has almost sole authority to initiate a nuclear attack since the secretary of defense is required to verify the order, but cannot veto it. The football is carried by one of the rotating presidential military aides, whose work schedule is described by a top-secret rota (one from each of the six service branches). This person is a commissioned officer in the U.S. military, pay- grade O-4 or above, who has undergone the nation's most rigorous background check (Yankee White).\\"The Football\\" ‚Äì GlobalSecurity.org article These officers are required to keep the football readily accessible to the president at all times. Consequently, the aide, football in hand, is always either standing or walking near the president, including riding on Air Force One, Marine One, or the presidential motorcade with the president. The operational plan for nuclear strike orders is entirely concerned with the identity of the commanding officer and the authenticity of the order, and there are no safeguards to verify that the person issuing the order is sane. Notably, Major Harold Hering was discharged from the Air Force in late 1973 for asking the question \\"How can I know that an order I receive to launch my missiles came from a sane president?\\" There are three nuclear footballs in total. Two are allocated to the president and vice president, with the last being stored in the White House.  History  The football dates back to Dwight D. Eisenhower, but its current usage came about in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when John F. Kennedy was concerned that a Soviet commander in Cuba might launch missiles without authorization from Moscow. Kennedy asked several questions related to the release of US nuclear weapons. These were: # \\"Assuming that information from a closely guarded source causes me to conclude that the U.S. should launch an immediate nuclear strike against the Communist Bloc, does the JCS Emergency Actions File permit me to initiate such an attack without first consulting with the Secretary of Defense and/or the Joint Chiefs of Staff?\\" # \\"I know that the red button on my desk phone will connect me with the White House Army Signal Agency (WHASA) switchboard and that the WHASA switchboard can connect me immediately to the Joint War Room. If I called the Joint War Room without giving them advance notice, to whom would I be speaking?\\" # \\"What would I say to the Joint War Room to launch an immediate nuclear strike?\\" # \\"How would the person who received my instructions verify them?\\"Trachtenberg, Marc, 1999, A Constructed Peace: The Making of the European Settlement, 1945‚Äì1963, Princeton: Princeton University Press An Associated Press article stated that the nickname \\"football\\" was derived from an attack plan codenamed \\"Dropkick\\". The nickname has led to some confusion as to the nature‚Äîand even the shape‚Äîof the device, as the leather bag or \\"jacket\\" in which it is carried appears large enough to contain an actual football. During their presidencies, both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan preferred to keep the launch codes in their jacket pockets.Reagan, Ronald. An American Life. p. 257. Among those who carried the football for Carter and Reagan was a future U.S. congressman, John Kline, who served as a colonel in the United States Marine Corps before representing Minnesota in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2017. The coded card was separated from Ronald Reagan immediately after the 1981 assassination attempt against him, when his clothing was cut off by the emergency department trauma team.\\"Clinton drops nuclear football\\". BBC News, April 26, 1999. Accessed December 16, 2009. It was later discovered lying unsecured in one of his shoes on the emergency department floor. This led to an urban legend that Reagan carried the code in his sock. Reagan was separated from the rest of the football as well, because the officer who carried it was left behind as the motorcade sped away with the wounded president. On occasion, the president has left his aide carrying the football behind. This happened to Nixon in 1973; after Nixon presented Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with a Lincoln Continental at Camp David, Brezhnev unexpectedly drove with Nixon off the retreat onto a highway while leaving Nixon's Secret Service personnel behind, separating Nixon from the football (and his security detail) for nearly 30 minutes. Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush,Pullella, Philip. \\"Bush's nuclear 'football' in Vatican hallowed halls\\" (archived from the original on 2016-03-14).

In February 2017, a guest at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort posed for a photo with the military aide carrying the football, posting the image to Facebook and identifying the aide by his first name. The photo was posted while Trump was hosting Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, around the same time as news broke that North Korea had fired a nuclear-capable Pukkuksong-2 ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan. U.S. military officials clarified that it was neither illegal nor against proper procedure for the officer to appear in such a photo, although they admitted that the situation was strange. On November 8, 2017, when President Trump made an official state visit to China, U.S. military aides carrying the football were reportedly involved in a brief tussle with Chinese security officials, after the latter tried to bar the former access to the Great Hall of the People auditorium. Political correspondent Jonathan Swan, who reported the incident, wrote that \\"at no point did the Chinese have the nuclear football in their possession or even touch the briefcase. ...

It is the oldest continually published general interest magazine in the United States. History =Early history= The magazine was founded as The National Press by poet and essayist Nathaniel Parker Willis and New York Evening Mirror newspaper editor George Pope Morris in 1846. Eight months later, it was renamed The Home Journal.Auser, Courtland P. Nathaniel P. Willis. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1969: 125. After 1901, the magazine's name became \\"Town & Country,\\" and it has retained that name ever since. Throughout most of the 19th century, this weekly magazine featured poetry, essays and fiction. As more influential people began reading it, the magazine began to include society news and gossip in its pages. After 1901, the magazine continued to chronicle the social events and leisure activities of the North American landed aristocracy, including debutante or cotillion balls, and also reported on the subsequent \\"advantageous marriages\\" that came from people meeting at such social engagements. The magazine's earlier readership consisted of members of the Establishment. This included older wealthy families of New York City, Boston Brahmins and, later, those people in other parts of the United States whose surnames may have appeared in the Social Register (established 1887). Willis owned and edited the magazine from 1846 until his death in 1867. =Modern history= After Willis's death, the magazine went through several owners and editors until William Randolph Hearst acquired ownership in 1925. The first editor under Hearst ownership was Harry Bull. He edited the magazine from 1925 through 1949. Henry B. Sell became Bull's successor. The magazine is still owned and published by the Hearst Corporation. It is published monthly, and its readership is composed of mainly younger socialites, caf√© society, and middle class professionals. Most of the advertising copy in the magazine is for luxury goods and services. The feature articles and photography focus primarily on fashion, arts, culture, interior design, travel, weddings, parties, gala events and other interests and concerns of the upper class. In May 1993, Pamela Fiori became the first woman editor-in-chief of Town & Country magazine. During her tenure, Fiori was credited with increasing circulation by making the magazine more fashion forward and in recent years, making philanthropy more of a priority for the magazine. Fiori also pushed for more diversity in the magazine's coverage. In an effort to play down the magazine's perceived snobbish and elitist WASP, or preppy image, more celebrities have been showing up on the magazine's covers, and there has been an increase in the number of articles showcasing the events and weddings of socially prominent persons of African-American descent, as well as the social activities of people of other ethnicities. On April 6, 2010, Fiori was replaced by Steven Drucker as the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Jay Fielden was named editor-in-chief in 2011. Fielden was previously editor-in-chief of Men's Vogue. Earlier in his career, he had worked at Vogue and The New Yorker. He said his goal was to bring \\"a lot of people under the tent\\" of \\"a snooty, exclusionary magazine.\\" He later said, \\"I gave Town & Country some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn't always that which, well, Emily Post would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks.\\" In 2014, Fielden convinced novelist Jay McInerney to move his column about wine from the Wall Street Journal to Town & Country. Fielden inaugurated the T&C; 50 lists, including rankings of philanthropists and influential American families. In 2014, he founded the Town & Country Philanthropy Summit, which has featured speakers such as Michael Bloomberg, Chelsea Clinton, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bradley Cooper, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Geoffrey Canada. Fielden left Town & Country in 2016, when he replaced David M. Granger as editor-in-chief of Esquire Magazine. Adweek wrote that Fielden had transformed the magazine from \\"dusty publication to buzzy brand.\\" According to HuffPost on May 9, 2018, Town & Country took criticism for disinviting Monica Lewinsky from its philanthropic summit because former President Bill Clinton decided to attend the event.Peck, Emily. Town & Country Magazine Uninvited Monica Lewinsky From An Event Because Of Bill Clinton, YahooNews, May 9, 2018. AccessDate = 5/9/2018. Hollywood producer Judd Apatow commented, \\"This is what everyone is fighting against.\\" He then added that Town & Country \\"should be ashamed of themselves.\\" =Spin-off= In September 2003, a spin-off magazine entitled, Town & Country Travel, appeared. It is published quarterly. In September 2007, Town & Country Travel launched a travel website and a staff travel blog. There is a special edition of the magazine focusing on wedding planning. In the past decade, the magazine has also published several etiquette, wedding and lifestyle guidebooks. Among the most recent books published by the magazine is \\"Modern Manners: The Thinking Person's Guide to Social Graces,\\" released in 2005 and edited by Town & Country senior editor Thomas Farley. In 2003, Town & Country released Town & Country Weddings, which is published twice yearly. The first international version of the magazine, called Town & Country Philippines, was launched by Summit Media in 2007. A British Town & Country magazine was launched by Hearst Magazines UK, a subsidiary of Hearst Corporation, in May 2014.

It runs along the Rideau Canal from the end of Sussex Drive at Rideau Street. It then continues south and west to Hog's Back Road, winding through several residential areas and going past Dow's Lake and Carleton University. To the north, the road passes Department of National Defence Headquarters, the Ottawa Congress Centre and the Westin Hotel before ending at Wellington Street and Rideau Street. The rear door of the Government Conference Centre can be accessed from the street as well, after it passes under the Mackenzie King Bridge. It is named for Lieutenant-Colonel John By, who built the Rideau Canal. The winding two-lane road has a speed limit of . For many decades the area east of the canal had held Ottawa's main rail lines connecting to the Ottawa Train Station near the northern end of the canal. In the mid-1960s the train station was controversially relocated about southeast in an industrial area in the east end of the city, leaving the area on the eastern bank of the canal open for development. The National Capital Commission thus decided to create a scenic parkway. The Queen Elizabeth Driveway, another scenic Canadian parkway, already served the same purpose on the other side of the canal. Like the adjacent Queen Elizabeth Driveway on the other side of the canal, pedestrians and bicycles are a common sight on the paths running alongside Colonel By. Every Sunday, during the summer months, Colonel By is closed to motor vehicle traffic so that bicycles and pedestrians can have the road to themselves.

Anderson trained in the office of George Gilbert Scott in London before setting up his own practice in Edinburgh in 1860. During the 1860s his main work was small churches in the 'First Pointed' (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott's former assistants. By 1880 his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland. His works include the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, the University of Edinburgh; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station, the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute for the 3rd Marquess of Bute. Early life Anderson was born at Liberton, outside Edinburgh, the third child of James Anderson (1797-1869), a solicitor, and Margaret Rowand (1797-1868). Educated at George Watson's College, he began a legal apprenticeship in 1845, and briefly worked for his father's firm. He began to study architecture in 1849, attending classes at the Trustees' Drawing Academy (which later became Edinburgh College of Art), and was articled to architect John Lessels (1809‚Äì1883). In 1857 he took a two-year post as an assistant to George Gilbert Scott, in his office at Trafalgar Square, London. Here he worked alongside many influential architects. He then spent time travelling and studying in France and Italy, also working briefly for Pierre Cuypers in Roermond, Netherlands. Architectural career In 1860 Anderson returned to Edinburgh, and began working as an architect with the Royal Engineers, undertaking works on coastal defences, and the 78th Highlanders memorial outside Edinburgh Castle. For Giles Gilbert Scott he supervised the construction of St James's Church in Leith, which led to further commissions from the Scottish Episcopal Church, including Christ Church, Falkirk (1862), All Saints, Brougham Place, Edinburgh (1864), St Andrew's Church in St Andrews (1866), St John's, Alloa (1866), and St James, Cupar (1866). All of these were carried out alongside his work for the Royal Engineers, and show the influence of Scott's church designs. Anderson set up his own independent practice in 1868. His first significant commission came in 1871, for the restoration of St Vigeans Parish Church, Angus. He went on to win the competition to design the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh, now the Mansfield Traquair Centre on Mansfield Place in Broughton. Anderson joined the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, where he met future clients including the Marquis of Bute. In 1873 a short-lived partnership with David Bryce began, but was dissolved only a few months later. In 1874 he was invited to submit designs for a competition for the University of Edinburgh Medical Faculty and graduation hall. He undertook further study tours to Europe, resulting in the winning Italian Renaissance style design which was finalised in 1877. The design secured Anderson's election to the Royal Scottish Academy, although the Medical School was not completed until 1886, and the McEwan Hall not until 1897. His next major commission came soon after, in 1876, when he was appointed as architect for Glasgow Central Station. In 1878 Anderson designed a new Mount Stuart House (1878‚Äì1896) in an Italian Gothic style for the 3rd Marquess of Bute, following the destruction by fire of the previous house. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery (1884‚Äì1889) was designed in a similar style, and also executed in red sandstone. In 1881 Anderson made his employee George Washington Browne a partner, and two years later the firm became Wardrop, Anderson and Browne, following the death of Maitland Wardrop and the merger of his practice with Anderson's. However, Browne left in 1885, and Hew Wardrop died in 1887 at Udny Castle, leaving Anderson as sole partner again. Notable architects employed within the Anderson practice included Robert Weir Schultz, Robert Lorimer, Sydney Mitchell, and James Jerdan. During the 1880s, Anderson's style became increasingly influenced by Scottish historical architecture, possibly as a result of his friendship with architectural historians MacGibbon and Ross. The Scottish influence is evident in the Normand Memorial Hall, Dysart (1882), Ardgowan Estate Office, Greenock (1886), and the Pearce Institute, Govan (1892). From the 1890s, restoration became the focus of Anderson's architecture, as major commissions declined. He had already undertaken work at Iona Abbey and Jedburgh Abbey in the 1870s, and now restored Dunblane Cathedral and Paisley Abbey. He became more involved in teaching, helping to set up a School of Applied Art in 1892. In 1903 this merged into the new Edinburgh College of Art, with Anderson as a trustee. In his later years Anderson became difficult to work with, and was perceived as arrogant. Another partnership, formed in 1899, was dissolved following lawsuits in 1902. Rowand Anderson and Paul was formed in 1904, with Arthur Forman Balfour Paul (who had trained under him 1892-6), son of Sir James Balfour Paul, the Lord Lyon. Anderson was knighted in 1902 for his work at the Scottish royal residence, Balmoral Castle. In 1916 he was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for architecture. By 1916 he was ill, but was able to found the Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (later the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland) in that year, with fellow architect Alexander Lorne Campbell speaking and acting on his behalf. Anderson donated his own Rutland Square townhouse to be used as its headquarters. He retired to Allermuir House on Woodhall Road in ColintonEdinburgh and Leith Post Office directory 1911-12 and died there in 1921. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery. The grave is in a hard to find location on a lower level to the south-west, backing onto the western path. Gravestone of Sir Robert Rowand Anderson at Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh The Rowand Anderson practice Anderson's architectural practice was carried on as Rowand Anderson and Paul (with Paul as sole partner), until Basil Spence and William Kininmonth joined in 1934, forming Rowand Anderson and Paul and Partners. Paul died in 1938, and Spence left in 1945, leaving Kininmonth to carry on as Rowand Anderson, Kininmonth and Paul. When Kininmonth retired in 1976, the firm split, with the Rowand Anderson name taken by Richard Ewing, who had been made a partner around 1971. The Rowand Anderson Partnership is still based in Rutland Square.

In a simplified explanation of one form of the illusion, two discs, (referred to here as L for left and C for centre) are shown side by side as the first frame in a sequence of three frames. Next a blank frame is presented for a very short, variable duration. In the final frame, two similar discs (C for centre and R for right) are then shown in a shifted position. Depending on various factors including the time intervals between frames as well as spacing and layout, observers perceive either element motion, in which L appears to move to R while C remains stationary or they report experiencing group motion, in which L and C appear to move together to C and R. Both element motion and group motion can be observed in animated examples to the right in Figures 1 and 2. Overview Figure 3 ‚Äì Frames of a Ternus motion display ‚Äì As shown in Dodd (2005)In 1926 and then again in 1938, the Gestalt psychologist Joseph Ternus observed and defined the ‚Äúproblem of phenomenal identity‚Äù. Ternus‚Äô research was based around earlier undertakings in the domain by Pikler in 1917. This problem of phenomenal identity that Ternus had discovered occurs due to the human visual system's natural ability to establish and then preserve the entities of objects even when the defining attributes of those objects have undergone drastic changes and no longer resemble what they once did. The effect that Ternus had observed was in fact a bistable percept or perception of apparent motion which he found using a display consisting of three frames presented sequentially. When observers are presented with two immobile stimuli, that are presented in a sequential fashion at two differing locations, the stimuli will often be perceived as a solitary object that is simply moving from a starting location to another position. This apparent motion or apparent movement is of great interest to researchers because the perceived movement does not derive strictly from the physical aspect of vision such as the stimulation caused by impingement on the retina. Instead, apparent motion appears to arise from the visual system's processing of the physical properties of the percept. It is for this reason that apparent motion is a key area of research in the domain of vision research. The Ternus illusion is perhaps one of the best examples of such an effect. In order to observe the Ternus illusion/effect, observers view an apparent motion display known as a Ternus display. The Ternus display features a series of frames that are separated by what is known as a blank interstimulus interval (ISI). A standard Ternus display consists of three frames, sequentially presented to the observer. As can be seen in Figure 3, Frame 1 consists of three equally spread out discs that are laid out in a horizontal fashion. Frame 2 is the blank ISI which separates Frame 1 and 3 for a variable duration. Frame 3, is simply the reverse of Frame 1 with the discs on the right hand side instead. This means that the disc on the outside of Frame 1 will now appear to be in the location that the centre disc was originally in as part of Frame 1. When these three frames are quickly presented in a sequential manner, individuals report perceiving two discrete types of motion from observing the Ternus display. These different perceptions are dependent on the duration of the ISI. Numerous studies have demonstrated that short ISIs cause the observer to perceive the central elements as immobile with one outside element jumping across those elements, known as element motion. These studies also support the finding that longer ISIs create the perception that the elements are all moving as one from left to right, known as group motion and that these percepts are not capable of occurring simultaneously. Research suggests that these variations in apparent motion are achieved by grouping the visual elements in such a way that there is an intertwining of the perception of motion and the perception of the objects identity. At intermediate ISIs, perceived motion is bistable, meaning that for the observer the perceptual experience interchanges between element motion and group motion in a spontaneous manner. While the bistability is present, observers are still capable of judging which percept leaves more of a lasting impression. As aforementioned the two percepts are never experienced simultaneously. This occurs due to intermediate ISIs yielding different percentages of group movement and element movement that are each dependent upon their exact values. Element motion Figure 4 ‚Äì Element motion Element motion can be observed when ISI‚Äôs are presented for less than 50 milliseconds. Though the most common time frame used to achieve this illusion is usually around 20 milliseconds. Element motion is characterized as the outer disc in the Ternus display being seen as ‚Äújumping over‚Äù the other two discs in the display, which are then considered to be the (inner) discs; placing itself in the right hand side location. This effect can be seen in motion in the example at the top of the page in Figure 1. According to Braddick from his research in 1980, element motion can be attributed to the low-level short range motion process, signalling a null or no-movement for the two elements in the middle of the display between Frame 1 and Frame 3 when short ISIs are shown. As a response to this the higher level long-range motion process passes a signal of element movement. This means that the outer element appears to jump across to the opposite side of the display and back again. Group motion Figure 5 ‚Äì Group motion When the ISI (Frame 2) in the Ternus motion display is shown for the relatively long interval of at least 50 milliseconds, group motion can be observed. The longer the inter-frame interval or ISI the more likely a group motion effect is to occur. Group motion gives the perceiver the illusion that all of the discs within the display are moving simultaneously to the right and then back again. As with element motion this effect can be seen in Figure 3 as well as demonstrated in Figure 2. Braddick in 1980 posited that the occurrence of group motion at longer ISIs can be attributed to the short-range motion process signalling motion in the central elements of the motion display, which in turn leads to the long-range process to signal that the three elements are moving in unison. Factors Since the discovery of the Ternus illusion there has been an abundance of research into how and why it occurs. As can be deemed from research above, one of the most critical factors appears to be the length of the ISI, as it seems to be a heavy determinant in which percept becomes apparent to the observer however there are many other factors implicated. A reasonable amount of the research in this area appears to be well empirically supported, such as the idea that lower level (short range processes) and higher level (long range processes) are involved in determining which illusion is perceived. A study by Scott-Samuel & Hess found that the perception of element motion is influenced by changes in the spatial appearance within the Ternus display which suggests that apparent motion is mediated entirely by a long-range motion process. Research undertaken by Kramer and Yantis in 1997 found that perceptual grouping of the elements also appears to have important implications. Kramer and his colleagues found an increase in observers perceiving group motion when the elements in the display seemed to form a logical group in contrast to when they were independently arranged. Yantis found that the perceived continuity of a briefly interrupted element in perception depends on early neural mechanisms in the visual system such as visible persistence as well as on a representation of a three-dimensional surface layout. As previously mentioned, studies have alluded to the idea that high level motion mechanisms determine the final decision in which percept shows through, however recent research by He & Ooi suggests that this final decision is also influenced by accounting for numerous grouping factors such as proximity, similarity and common surface amongst the elements in the scene. Though there are many ideas relating to causative factors, even current research seems to be lacking in a conclusive explanation for why the Ternus effect occurs and has not yet discovered exactly which mechanisms are responsible. Petersik and his team in 2006 suggested that intensive brain- imaging research on each percept is the way forward and is the most likely way to discover the answer. On the other hand, Grossberg and Rudd (1992, Psychol. Rev., 99, 78‚Äì121) have developed a neural model of motion perception that simulates many examples of long-range apparent motion, including both the Ternus and reverse-contrast Ternus illusions .

The gallery holds the national collections of portraits, all of which are of, but not necessarily by, Scots. It also holds the Scottish National Photography Collection. Since 1889 it has been housed in its red sandstone Gothic revival building, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson and built between 1885 and 1890 to accommodate the gallery and the museum collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. The building was donated by John Ritchie Findlay, owner of The Scotsman newspaper. In 1985 the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland was amalgamated with the Royal Scottish Museum, and later moved to Chambers Street as part of the National Museum of Scotland. The Portrait Gallery expanded to take over the whole building, and reopened on 1 December 2011 after being closed since April 2009 for the first comprehensive refurbishment in its history, carried out by Page\\\\Park Architects. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery is part of National Galleries of Scotland, a public body that also owns the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. History The founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1780), David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, formed a collection of Scottish portraits in the late 18th century, much of which is now in the museum. In the 19th century, the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle was among those calling for a Scottish equivalent of the very successful National Portrait Gallery, London, established in 1856, but the government in London refused to fund the venture. Eventually John Ritchie Findlay stepped in and paid for the entire building, costing ¬£50,000.Press, \\"Facts and Statistics\\" and \\"The History of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery\\"; History & Architecture , NGS Galleries occupying the western half of the building housed the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. The portrait gallery museum was established in 1882, before its new building was completed. The London National Portrait Gallery was the first such separate museum in the world, however it did not move into its current purpose-built building until 1896, making the Edinburgh gallery the first in the world to be specially built as a portrait gallery.Press, \\"The History of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery\\"; History & Architecture , NGS Special national portrait galleries remain a distinct Anglophone speciality, with the other more recent examples in Washington DC (1968), Canberra, Australia (1998), and Ottawa, Canada (2001) not so far copied in other countries. The famous collection of portraits housed in the Vasari Corridor in Florence remains only accessible to the public on a limited basis. The building was opened in 1889 under curator John Miller Gray. Over the years new facilities such as a shop and caf√© were added in a piecemeal fashion, and the galleries rearranged and remodelled, generally reducing the clarity of the layout of the building, and often the ceiling height, as well as blocking off many windows. The building was shared with the National Museum of Antiquities, now the Museum of Scotland, until they moved to a new building in 2009, at which point the long-planned refurbishment of the Portrait Gallery could begin, with funding from the Scottish Government and the Heritage Lottery Fund, amongst others. The work generally restores the gallery spaces to their original layout, with areas set aside for education, the shop & caf√©, and a new glass lift‚Äîgreatly improving access for disabled visitors. In total the Portrait Gallery has 60% more gallery space after the changes, and at the reopening displayed 849 works, of which 480 were by Scots. The cost of the refurbishment was ¬£17.6 million. The entire building comprises 5672 Sq. metres.Portrait, 9‚Äì10; Press, Facts and Statistics The building Sculpted figures of David Hume and Adam Smith on the Gallery exterior William Hole frieze of 1898 The Scottish National Portrait Gallery building is a large edifice at the east end of Queen Street, built in red sandstone from Corsehill in Dumfriesshire. It was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson in the Gothic Revival style with a combination of Arts and Crafts and 13th-century Gothic influences, and is a Category A listed building. Built between 1885 and 1890, the building is noted for its ornate Spanish Gothic style, an unusual addition to Edinburgh's mostly Georgian Neoclassical New Town. The windows are in carved pointed arches and the main entrance on the Queen Street front, surrounded by a large gabled arch, leads to the main entrance hall, arcaded with pointed arches, which originally served both the Portrait Gallery to its east, and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland to its west. A distinctive feature of the gallery is its four octagonal corner towers topped with crocketed Gothic pinnacles; originally, Anderson had intended to flank the facade with a pair of large Franco-Scottish tourelles, but these were replaced at the request of the benefactor by the pointed turrets seen today. Anderson's design was influenced by a number of other Gothic and Gothic Revival architectural works, in particular the rectangular Gothic Doge's Palace in Venice and the works of George Gilbert Scott, and similarities have also been drawn between the Portrait Gallery and Anderson's Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, which he designed for the 3rd Marquess of Bute in the late 1870s. Around the exterior are sculpted figures of noted Scots set in niches, designed by William Birnie Rhind. These were added in the 1890s to compensate for the lack of contemporary portraits of medieval Scots in the gallery's collection at the time, as was the large processional frieze inside the main entrance hall, painted by William Hole. This mural, added in 1898, depicts an array of notable Scots from history, ranging from Saint Ninian to Robert Burns. Figures were added to the frieze over the years after the gallery opened, and Hole added further large mural narrative scenes on the 1st floor later.Portrait, 12‚Äì13 Collection The museum's collection totals some 3,000 paintings and sculptures, 25,000 prints and drawings, and 38,000 photographs.Press, Press release, p. 1, (not yet online here) The collection essentially begins in the Renaissance, initially with works mainly by foreign artists of Scottish royalty, nobility, and mainly printed portraits of clergymen and writers; the most notable paintings were mostly made on the Continent (often during periods of exile from the turbulent Scottish political scene). As in England, the Scottish Reformation all but extinguished religious art, and until the 19th century portrait painting dominated Scottish painting, with patrons gradually extending down the social scale. In the 16th century most painted portraits are of royalty or the more important nobility; the oldest work in the collection is a portrait of James IV of Scotland from 1507.Press, \\"Facts and Statistics\\" The collection includes two portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots, although neither dates from her lifetime; one was painted some 20 years after her death in 1587, and the other is later still; there are also a number of 19th-century paintings showing scenes from her life. Mary's circle is actually better represented by portraits from the life, with her three husbands all having portraits, including Darnley by Hans Eworth and an unknown painter, and miniatures from 1566 of Bothwell and his first wife. There is a portrait of Mary's nemesis, Regent Morton, by Arnold Bronckhorst who was from 1581 the first artist to hold the title of \\"King's Painter\\" in Scotland, though he only spent about three years there. The gallery holds several works by Bronckhorst and his successor, Adrian Vanson; both were skilled painters in the Netherlandish tradition.MGS website online collection (also includes Scottish National Gallery) for Vanson and Bronckorst The collection includes portraits by Bronckhorst and Vanson of James VI and I, but the others were made after he succeeded to the English throne and moved to London, where the many portraits of other Stuart monarchs were also mostly painted. The first significant native Scot to be a portrait painter, George Jamesone (1589/90-1644) only once got the chance to paint his monarch, when Charles I visited Edinburgh in 1633. The collection includes two Jamesone self-portraits and portraits of the Scottish aristocracy, as well as some imagined portraits of heroes of Scotland's past.MGS website online collection (also includes Scottish National Gallery) for Jamesone There are three portraits by Jamesone's talented pupil John Michael Wright and ten aristocratic portraits by Sir John Baptist Medina, the last \\"King's Painter\\" before the Acts of Union 1707.MGS website online collection (also includes Scottish National Gallery) for Medina File:Agnes Douglas Countess of Argyll.jpgAdrian Vanson, Agnes Douglas, Countess of Argyll, 1599 File:Mary, Queen of Scotland, legitimist pretender to England, Ireland and France.jpgMary, Queen of Scots, posthumous portrait, c. 1610 File:GeorgeJamesone.jpgGeorge Jamesone, self-portrait, c. 1642 File:John Michael Wright - Lord Mungo Murray (Am Morair Mungo Moireach), 1668 - 1700.

Also wearing tartan is Flora MacDonald, painted by Richard Wilson in London after her arrest for helping Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape after the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion.

The museum owns the iconic portrait of Robert Burns by Alexander Nasmyth. The largest number of works by a single artist is the 58 by the sculptor and gem- cutter James Tassie (1735‚Äì1799), who developed a distinctive format of large fired glass paste (or vitreous enamel) relief \\"medallion\\" portraits in profile, initially modelled in wax. His subjects include Adam Smith, James Beattie and Robert Adam. Adam disliked having his portrait taken but Tassie was a member of his social circle he did not refuse, with the result that, as with the Naysmyth portrait of Burns, almost all images of Smith derive from the exemplar in the museum.Press, \\"Facts and Statistics\\", see also MGS website online collection (also includes Scottish National Gallery) for Tassie and Adam Smith File:Wilson - Flora MacDonald.jpgRichard Wilson, Flora MacDonald, 1747 File:David Hume 2.jpgAllan Ramsay, David Hume, 1766 File:Charles Edward Stuart (1775).jpgHugh Douglas Hamilton, \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" in later life, 1775 File:PG 1063Burns Naysmith.jpgRobert Burns by Alexander Nasmyth, 1787 File:Sir Henry Raeburn - Portrait of Sir Walter Scott.jpgHenry Raeburn, Sir Walter Scott, 1822 The later 19th century in Scotland had no such dominant figures, but many fine artists, and saw the beginning of photography.

Thought to have begun performing her new art style of (lit., \\"the art of singing and dancing\\") theatre in the dry riverbed of the River in Kyoto, 's performances gained immense popularity, and were known for their performances, who were often lower-class women had recruited to act in her all-female troupe. Few concrete details are known about her life; born around 1572 near province, worked as a (shrine maiden) for several years at the (the Grand Shrine of ) until gaining popularity for her dramatised dance performances, which onlookers gave the name of . continued to perform kabuki with her troupe until her retirement and disappearance sometime around 1610. She is believed to have died sometime around 1613. History =Early years= 282x282px Born c. 1572, grew up in the vicinity of the shrine, where her father, , worked as a blacksmith, and where several other family members served. Eventually joined as a (shrine maiden), where she was known for her skill in dancing and acting, as well as her beauty. As it was a custom of the time to send priests, and others to solicit contributions for the shrine, she was sent to Kyoto to perform sacred dances and songs. It was during her performances in Kyoto that she also became known for her performances of (or dance) in honor of the Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to , a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by 's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for 's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back. =Founding of kabuki= Okuni Kabuki-zu Byobu, six-panel canvas, (oldest painting with Izumo no Okuni). Around 1603, began performing on the dry riverbed of the (Fourth Street Dry Riverbed) of the River and at Shrine. also performed for the ladies of the imperial court. Gathering up the female outcasts and misfits of the region, particularly those involved in prostitution, gave them direction, teaching them acting, dancing and singing skills in order to form her troupe. Several theories exist as to the etymology of the word \\"kabuki\\", one being that it is derived from those who, oddly dressed and swaggering on the street, had been dubbed (from , \\"to lean in a certain direction\\", and , \\"people\\"). Another possible origin is , which means \\"slanted\\" or \\"strongly-inclined.\\" In either case, others labeled 's troupe's performances \\"kabuki\\" due to their eccentricity and social daring. The earliest performances of kabuki were dancing and song with no significant plot, often disdained as overly sexual and cacophonous, but equally lauded as colourful and beautiful. 's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. As her troupe gained fame, she was emulated by many others, particularly brothels, which offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, as well as to gain prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female troupes became known by the alternative names of and ,\\"Okuni.\\" Japan Encyclopedia. Ed. Louis Fr√©d√©ric. Trans. K√§the Roth. Harvard University Press. (from , the Japanese word for \\"woman\\" or \\"girl\\") and . =Later years= Eventually, with the aid of , who supported financially as well as artistically, kabuki evolved into a more dramatic style. On a more personal level, was also said to be 's lover, though they never married. After his death she continued without him, continuing to merge the drama with the music and dance. Eventually, her fame and that of her kabuki troupe spread throughout Japan. 12th page of showing , the founder of kabuki theatre, on stage. retired around 1610, and after that time she disappeared. In 1629, due to outcry for moral reform and concern about fights breaking out between men trying to win the attention of the actresses, forbade women from performing in kabuki. They were quickly replaced by young men as actors/\\"actresses\\", though this was soon banned as well due to some of the same issues of prostitution and corruption of morals, restricting the performances to those by older men, which is a standing practice in the official theatres even today. There are several conflicting theories of 's year of death; some say she died in 1610, others in 1613, or in 1640. Cultural impact In addition to her founding of kabuki, contributed to Japanese theatre as a whole. She is said to have introduced the forerunner of the (path of flowers), a runway leading from the rear of the theatre and crossing between the audience to the stage. This has been incorporated in several Japanese theatre arts beyond that of kabuki. In addition, she has also influenced modern musical theatre. In November 2002 a statue was erected in her honor and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki. The statue stands at the east end of the bridge crossing the River diagonally across from the , the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto.

Corner of a ‚Ä≥loft‚Ä≥ store-house, a horse stable and a log barn An old log house in Pargas, Finland. Log building in German is known as Blockbau. Farmhouse, Bavaria, Germany Russian-style log house alt=Two-story log house in winter, with large porch and dormer roof alt=Front view of two- story log house in summer, with porch and dormer roof A log house, or log building, is a structure built with horizontal logs interlocked at the corners by notching. Logs may be round, squared or hewn to other shapes, either handcrafted or milled. The term \\"log cabin\\" generally refers to a smaller, more rustic log house, such as a hunting cabin in the woods, that may or may not have electricity or plumbing. Log construction was the most common building technique in large regions of Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Baltic states and Russia, where straight and tall coniferous trees, such as pine and spruce, are readily available. It was also widely used for vernacular buildings in Eastern Central Europe, the Alps, the Balkans and parts of Asia, where similar climatic conditions prevail. In warmer and more westerly regions of Europe, where deciduous trees predominate, timber framing was favoured instead. *Sawn logs, logs sawn to a standard width, but with their original heights *Milled (also called machine-profiled), made with a log house moulder: Constructed of logs that have run through a manufacturing process which convert them into timbers which are consistent in size and appearance Handcrafted log houses have been built for centuries in Fennoscandia, Fenno- Ugric areas such as Karelia, Lapland, Eastern parts of Finland. Also in Scandinavia,Holan, Jerri, \\"Norwegian Wood, A Tradition of Building\\", Rizzoli Intl Publications1990 RussiaOpolovnikov, Alexander, \\"The Wooden Architecture of Russia\\", Harry Abrams, Inc., 1989 and Eastern Europe, and were typically built using only an axe and knife.Phleps, Hermann, \\"The Craft of Log Building\\", Harpers Collins reprint edition, 1989 The settlers from the northern Europe brought the craft to North America in the early 17th century, where it was quickly adopted by other colonists and Native Americans.Bruce D. Bomberger (1991), The Preservation and Repair of Historic Log Buildings, Preservation Briefs #26, Heritage Preservation Services Division, National Park Service Possibly the oldest surviving log house in the United States is the C. A. Nothnagle Log House (circa 1640) in New Jersey. Pre-fabricated log houses for export were manufactured in Norway from the 1880s until around 1920 by three large companies: Jacob Digre in Trondheim, M. Thams & Co. in Orkanger, and Str√∏mmen Tr√¶varefabrik at Str√∏mmen. They were factory built from sawn or milled logs, numbered and dismantled for transportation, and reassembled on the buyer's site. Buyers could order standard models from catalogs, custom-made houses designed by architects employed by the companies, or houses of their own design. Log houses from Thams were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris. During the 1920s the first American milled log houses appeared on the market, using logs which were pre-cut and shaped rather than hand-hewn. Many log houses today are of the milled variety, mainly because they require less labor-intensive field work than handcrafted houses. There are about 500 companies in North America which build the handcrafted, scribe-fit type of log house. Components alt=Close-up of new logs in interior house wall The logs in log houses have a varying degree of moisture content; all logs have moisture when freshly cut. In the case of handcrafted logs moisture will naturally leave the timber, drying it out until it stabilizes with its climate. This drying-out causes movement and shrinking of the log's diameter. As logs and timbers dry, the differential shrinkage (radial versus tangential) causes small cracks (known as \\"checks\\") to open slowly over time. Checking is a natural process in both air- and kiln-dried logs. This occurs in all log houses regardless of construction method or how the timber is allowed to dry, and is considered normal. Milled logs are processed in a different manner from handcrafted logs. Logs destined to become milled logs may become one of several types, depending on the desired quality and results. = Green logs = Logs that are cut from the butt forest, brought to a mill or to a log-house construction yard, have their bark removed and are used to build a log-house shell (handcrafted log houses), or sent through profiling machines (manufactured logs) are usually referred to as \\"green\\" logs if they have not been air- or kiln-dried. \\"Green\\" does not refer to color, but to moisture content.International Log Builders Association, \\"Log Building Standards\\", 2000, Section 2.A The actual moisture content of \\"green\\" logs varies considerably with tree species, the season in which it was cut, and whether sapwood or heartwood is being measured. Green logs may have a moisture content ranging from about 20% to 90%.Chambers, Robert W., \\"Log Construction Manual\\", Deep Stream Press, 2006 One type of air-dried log is \\"dead standing,\\" which refers to trees which have died from natural causes (bug kill, virus, fire etc.) and cut down after they died. Standing dead trees may be cut one month or several decades after they died, so the term \\"dead standing\\" does not necessarily mean the logs have dried down to equilibrium moisture content. Dead standing logs can be green, or more-or-less dry. After construction, green logs dry in service in the log building. Within about four years, green logs which are part of a completed log house reach equilibrium with local conditions and have an equilibrium moisture content of between 6% and 12%, which varies by local climate, season and location.Hoadley, Bruce: \\"Understanding Wood\\", Fine Homebuilding Books, 1980 = Air-dried logs = Some log home companies let the fresh-cut logs (or milled timbers) sit outside in the open air to dry naturally. The timbers may be stacked with spacers (known as \\"stickers\\") between them. This process allows the moisture content of the logs to naturally fall as the timber dries. In areas of high humidity, it may require as much as one year per inch of log thickness to dry. Arid climates may require less. A log with a diameter of 8 inches will usually reach equilibrium in about 18 months in the Rocky Mountains of North America. Air circulation is critical or the logs may begin to rot before properly drying, especially in humid regions. If the logs are to be dried to equilibrium with the local climate the process may take several years, depending on the location and size of the timbers. In some environments, the logs must be kept under some type of roof or cover to reduce the impact of rain storms on the drying process. Once the logs have dried for the desired length of time, they are profiled prior to shipping. Profiling usually does not take place until shortly before shipment, to ensure that the logs stay as uniform as possible. It is uncertain whether this process is advantageous; it depends on many factors such as local climate, wood species, its size, and the location of the log structure. = Kiln-dried logs = Mills that have a kiln on site have the option of artificially accelerating the drying process. Green timber is placed inside a large oven, where heat removes moisture from them; however, they can suffer severe checking and cracking if the kiln controls are not properly monitored during the drying process. Use of a kiln can reduce the drying time from many months to several weeks. Kiln-drying usually results in an average moisture content of 18-20% (\\"average\\" means the average moisture content of the outside and the center of the log). In North America, logs reach equilibrium moisture content at about 6% and 12%;USDA Forest Products Laboratory, \\"The Wood Handbook\\", Ag Handbook #72 since most kiln-dried logs are dried down to about 18% to 20% moisture content, kiln-dried logs can be expected to shrink and settle over time, but to a lesser extent than green logs. = Glue-laminated timber = \\"Laminated\\" or \\"engineered\\" logs are a different approach to log-house building. Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the lamination process will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a surfacer (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, there are two ways to finish the lamination process. One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a \\"log cant\\" that is slightly larger than the buyer's desired profile. These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and edge gluing and a process known as finger- jointing. Boards which would be scrap at another mill may be used in the center of a laminated log or beam to minimize waste. = Types of milled logs = Milled log homes employ a variety of profiles which are usually specified by the customer: * D-shape logs: round on the outside and flat inside * Full-round logs: fully round inside and out * Square logs: flat inside and out, and may be milled with a groove which could be chinked. When dealing with milled logs, chinking is a personal preference and not required to seal a house; however, a log house will eventually leak if it is not properly sealed. * Swedish Cope logs: round inside and out, with a half- moon-shaped groove on the bottom Nearly every profiled log on the market features an integral tongue and groove milled into the top and bottom of the log; this aids in stacking, and reduces the need for chinking. Wood is not airtight ‚Äî caulking or chinking will improve energy efficiency.  Construction methods  Lom Stave Church in Norway. *Scandinavian Full- Scribe (also known as the \\"chinkless method\\") is naturally-shaped, smoothly- peeled (drawknifed) logs which are scribed and custom-fitted to one another. They are notched where they overlap at the corners, and there are several ways to notch the logs. *In the flat-on-flat method, logs are flattened on the top and bottom and then stacked (usually with butt-and-pass corners). *Milled log houses are constructed with a tongue-and-groove system which helps align one log to another and creates a system to seal out the elements. *With the tight- pinned butt and pass method, the logs are not notched or milled in any way. They are in a single course and do not overlap; vertical pairs of logs are fastened with tight, load-bearing steel pins. = Corner styles = Corner notch in medieval Norwegian log buildings Traditional corner notch used in Norway from the 14th century until the present * Interlocking saddle notch: Normally seen on D- or full-round profiles, where a notch is cut into the top of one log and the bottom of another; these two logs then interlock, creating a tightly-sealed corner. Also popular in handcrafted, full-scribe log houses. * Dovetail: Typically seen on square, hewn, or chink-style logs. A dovetail joint is cut on the end of a log, where it would rest in a corner‚Äîone to the right and one to the left; this creates a tight, interlocking corner. Handcrafted dovetails can be \\"full dovetail\\" (notch surface slopes in two directions simultaneously) or \\"half dovetail\\" (notch surface slopes in one direction). * Locked or Tooth-edged joint: Typically seen in square logs. A lock/tooth joint is where distinct tooth-like profiles are cut at the end of each log for a tight \\"locked\\" fit.Lars Pettersson (ed.), \\"The Finnish Wooden Church\\", Helsinki, Otava, 1992, pp.28-29. * Butt-and-pass: Unscribed (or milled) logs butt up against each other at the corners without notching * Saddle notch: Used where two round logs overlap each other near the corners; common with the Swedish cope profile * Vertical corner post also known as post-and-plank: Typically larger (e.g., 8\\" x 8\\") than the wall logs (e.g., 6\\" x 6\\"). The wall logs would be \\"toe nailed\\" into the corner post. * Mortise and Tenon Joinery: the tenon (tongue) of one log connects to the mortise (hole) of another forming a 90 degree angle to secure the joint.

Some half-log sidings may also have saddle notch, butt-and-pass, or dovetail corners to give a more realistic appearance. * Palisade style: The logs are standing on end, and are either pinned or bolted together. * Piece en piece or piece sur piece. Similar to post-and- plank above: Uses short logs (e.g. 8' long) lying horizontally between upright posts, resembling post-and-beam construction (but usually lacking the complex notching seen with post-and-beam). Piece en piece typically uses a large (8\\"x 8\\") vertical corner post. It is important that a vertical component (often 3\\"x 6\\") be placed on both sides of each window and door. * A unique house type in the Oberlausitz region where Germany, Upper Lusatian house or Umgebinde in German. Part of the ground floor has log walls inside the posts of a timber frame. An Umgebinde house in far-eastern Germany = Settling = Once fabricated and assembled, the shell of the log house may be disassembled and the parts shipped to the building site. This allows for centralized manufacturing of the house, and relatively quick construction on site. Full- scribe-fit handcrafted log construction is a method of precisely marking where to cut each individual wall log to provide a tight fit between naturally- shaped logs along their entire length and in the corners. A high degree of craftsmanship is required for success in this method, and the resulting tight fit of naturally-shaped logs have aesthetic appeal. Log houses which settle require slip joints over all window and door openings, adjustable jacks under vertical elements (such as columns and staircases) which must periodically be adjusted as the building settles, allowances in plumbing, wiring, and ducting runs, and fasteners for the walls themselves to prevent uplift.International Log Builders Association, \\"Log Building Standards\\", 2000, Sections 5 and 6 See also * Burdei * Izba * Kit house * Log cabin * Magoffin County Pioneer Village and Museum, Kentucky * Carpathian Wooden Churches *The Hess Homestead  References   External links  * * National Park Service information on log cabins *International Log Builders Association *NAHB Log & Timber Council * Saving old Appalachian log homes * Building a traditional log house at Norsk Folkemuseum, Oslo Category:House styles Category:House types Category:American architectural styles Log house Category:Log houses ","title":"Log house"},{"id":"1133682","text":"Judy Garland in her role as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz is one of two likely origins for the phrase \\"friend of Dorothy\\" referring to a gay man or LGBTQ person. In gay slang, a \\"friend of Dorothy\\" (FOD) is a gay man; and more broadly, any LGBTQ person. The phrase dates back to at least World War II, when homosexual acts were illegal in the United States. Stating that, or asking if, someone was a friend of Dorothy was a euphemism used for discussing sexual orientation without others knowing its meaning.  Dorothy from Oz and Judy Garland  = Dorothy from Oz = The precise origin of the term is unknown. Some believe that it is derived from The Road to Oz (1909), a sequel to the first novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). The book introduces readers to Polychrome who, upon meeting Dorothy's travelling companions, exclaims, \\"You have some queer friends, Dorothy\\", and she replies, \\"The queerness doesn't matter, so long as they're friends.\\" There are numerous references to LGBTQ characters and relationships, including a possible innuendo about bisexuality ‚Äì when Dorothy asks Scarecrow which way to go on the yellow-brick road he says, \\"Of course some people go both ways\\" ‚Äì although it is unknown whether they were intentionally included. For instance, in a case that may be seen as changing gender identity, or transgender, Ozma, while still an infant, the baby daughter of the former King Pastoria of Oz, was given to the witch Mombi of the North by the Wizard of Oz. Mombi transformed Ozma into a boy and called him \\"Tip\\" (short for Tippetarius) in order to prevent the rightful ruler of Oz from ascending to the throne. Thus, Ozma spent her entire childhood with Mombi in the form of the boy Tip, and had no memory of ever having been a girl. Later, Princess Ozma would be the ruler of the fictional land of Oz. Princess Ozma is \\"one of the first transgender characters in literature.\\" This storyline is revived in Emerald City (2017). =The Wizard of Oz= More commonly, it is stated that friend of Dorothy refers to the derivative 1939 film The Wizard of Oz because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example, the \\"gentle lion\\" giving the line, \\"I'm afraid there's no denyin', I'm just a dandy lion.\\" The Wizard of Oz has a \\"particular resonance in the culture of the queer community\\". The struggles faced by Dorothy, Toto, and friends, especially against the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys can metaphorically mirror the difficulties of coming out. How the group of outcasts worked together likewise mirrors LGBTQ people who create new chosen families. Researchers also note there is an absence of a heteronormative male‚Äìfemale romance, and Dorothy and her friends \\"do not need to change themselves to become who they want to be\\". Many see Garland's portrayal as a \\"queer journey, an escape from the puritanical, morally rigid, black-and-white small-town life to Technicolor city existence with fabulous friends\\". Additionally relevant is the classic song \\"(Somewhere) Over the Rainbow\\" that Dorothy (Judy Garland) sings, which was possibly \\"the most memorable performance\\" of Garland's career, and the song \\"contributed to the evolution of the rainbow flag as a gay icon\\". The song \\"act[ed] as a cultural catalyst, propelling the eventual embrace of the rainbow symbol by the world's LGBTQ communities\\". Time magazine, in its August 18, 1967, review of Garland's final engagement at New York's Palace Theatre, observed: \\"A disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual. The boys in the tight trousers roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats, particularly when Judy sings ['Over the Rainbow'].\\" = Judy Garland = LGBTQ people could also empathize with the personal struggles of Judy Garland, as a persecuted people they identified with suffering. Garland's problems, \\"the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone\\", were documented in the media. She was among the first stars to have her \\"dirty laundry\\" aired publicly. She was the \\"archetype of the triumphant/tragic diva, paving the way for the stormy trajectories of superstars Elizabeth Taylor, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, and Lindsay Lohan\\". Biographer Gerald Clarke thinks she was likely bipolar, \\"explaining her many suicide attempts and use of alcohol and pills to self-medicate.\\" Her mental health problems were likely related to childhood trauma, possibly untreated complex PTSD, a common shared experience with LGBTQ+ people. In the face of these challenges she pressed forward, \\"explaining her enduring popularity among LGBTQ fans\\". She also endured \\"self- doubts about her capabilities, suffered crippling stage fright\\", yet beamed on stage. Onstage \\"she 'came out', expressing through her skills the real person she was meant to be\\". LGBTQ people notice this, \\"admiring her courage and resilience, adopting it as their own\\". One psychiatrist's explanation: \\"Judy was beaten up by life, embattled and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her.\\"Time, in its August 18, 1967, review of Garland's final engagement at New York's Palace Theatre. Gay men, particularly older ones, were among her biggest fans: According to United Press International's Marilyn Malara, \\"In the 1950s and 1960s, Garland acted as an unofficial mascot for a generation of gay men, who flocked to Garland's many performances, referring to themselves as 'friends of Dorothy.'\\" In September 2019, in reporting on the resurgence of interest in Garland due to the biopic Judy starring Ren√©e Zellweger, Louis Staples analyzed Garland‚Äôs story, to ‚Äúunderstand how and why some gay men look to famous women to help them navigate the world.‚Äù Both Dorothy and Garland are taken from ordinary lives into the spectacular, LGBTQ people perceiving themselves as abnormal, different, or ‚Äúother‚Äù could relate to not being ordinary. Once in the Hollywood movie business, Garland‚Äôs body was a battleground for never being sexy enough, or slim enough; LGBTQ people can relate to dealing with ‚Äúbody dysmorphia, harm[ing] their bodies, attempt[ing] suicide and suffer from eating disorders.‚Äù Richard Dyer argues that, after her artistic success in, but commercial failure of A Star Is Born (1954) ‚ÄúGarland‚Äôs work and life tells a story of survival, and of someone trying to assert some form of control in a world that was set up to destroy her.‚Äù Garland also had a number of gay men in her life including her father Frank Gumm who \\"preferred the company of very young men\\". Her second husband Vincente Minnelli had speculation for years in the entertainment community that he was gay or bisexual. A biography, Vincente Minnelli: Hollywood's Dark Dreamer, claims he lived as an openly gay man in New York prior to his arrival in Hollywood, where the town pressured him back into the closet. According to the biographer: \\"He was openly gay in New York ‚Äì we were able to document names of companions and stories from Dorothy Parker. But when he came to Hollywood, I think he made the decision to repress that part of himself or to become bisexual.\\" Garland's fourth husband, Mark Herron, was gay and in a long-lasting relationship with fellow actor Henry Brandon, which was only briefly interrupted by his marriage to Garland. The two men remained together until Brandon's death in 1990. Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli's first husband, Peter Allen, was discovered by Herron while Allen was performing in Hong Kong. Garland took the act, the Allen Brothers, under her care becoming manager and booking agent, and had them open her concerts in Britain and the United States. Garland also introduced Allen to her daughter, but Allen was having affairs with men before the marriage, he later came out as gay. Garland's death (June 22, 1969), and funeral held in New York City, happened days before the Stonewall Riots, the spark that started the modern LGBTQ rights movement, took place, although reports are that the riots were spontaneous and not related to her passing.  Dorothy Parker  Predating The Wizard of Oz origins of the phrase (although not connections to the L. Frank Baum Novels) is New York City's celebrated humorist, critic and \\"defender of human and civil rights\\" Dorothy Parker, whose social circles in the 1920s and 1930s included gay men. The two origin stories are not mutually exclusive, both could be somewhat true depending on how one learned of the phrase, or even separately where it derived. The socialite would throw \\"famous parties at Garden of Allah's lavish celebrity villas\\", gay men would use the phrase for entry. The Prohibition in the United States from 1920-1933, when social alcohol consumption was generally illegal, prompted all forms of illegal activities to circumvent the ban, including the speakeasies during the Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Age. Parker would invite gay men, who would in turn invite other gay men to her gatherings using the code phrase to gain entry. Parker had many gay fans, and was well known for her quick wit and use of sarcasm as well as social activism. Official bans on gays serving in the military first surfaced in the early 20th century. The U.S. introduced a ban in a revision of the Articles of War of 1916 and the UK first prohibited homosexuality in the Army and Air Force Acts in 1955. During World War II (1940s) many U.S. and British servicemen started meeting and forming friendships while serving in Europe. Living in fear of discovery and persecution, many began using the code language that Parker used commonly in her writings as a form of social networking including \\"friend of Dorothy\\". In conversation and in letter writing, phrases like \\"simply divine\\", \\"fabulous\\" and \\"nelly\\" began to be used by men, who later brought its use back to the United States. By the 1960s and onward the social stigma of being gay was slowly lifting, including the Stonewall Riots in 1969 which launched the modern LGBTQ rights movement, the phrase wasn't in need as much.  Military investigation  In the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as \\"friends of Dorothy\\". Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that there actually was a woman named Dorothy at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel, so they launched an enormous and futile hunt for the elusive \\"Dorothy\\", hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay service members.  Usage  Ponsonby, Auckland's gay village, is a play on the slang term. Starting in the late 1980s, on several cruise lines, gay and lesbian passengers began approaching ship staff, asking them to publicise gatherings in the daily cruise activity list. As the cruise lines were hesitant to announce such things so blatantly in their daily publications, they would list the gathering as a \\"Meeting of the Friends of Dorothy\\". The use of this phrase likely comes from the cruise directors who were also familiar with and using the \\"Friends of Bill W.\\" phrase in their programs to tell members of Alcoholics Anonymous that there were support group meetings on the trip. Such meetings have expanded in popularity and frequency over the years. Now, many cruise lines will have multiple FOD events, sometimes as many as one each night. Despite this, many FOD meetings have low turnout rates.  Friend of Mrs. King  Similar to friend of Dorothy is, friend of Mrs. King (i.e. Queen, in the meaning of \\"gay man\\") was used in England, mostly in the first half of the 20th century.

The manga was licensed in the United States by Tokyopop. The Tokyopop translation is imported to Australia by Madman Entertainment. Dragon Knights has a large cast of characters and many overlapping subplots that all weave together to form a main story line. __TOC__ Characters =Dragon Knights= ;Rath Illuser:The Dragon Knight of Fire. One of his favorite hobbies is killing demons, and will go out of his way to seek them out. He uses the Fire Dragon sword, and later the Light Dragon Sword, as his weapon. He also boasts Ice and Fire magic and a strange ability to both create temporary copies of himself and to absorb others' powers, along with special ties to the Light Dragon. It is now known that he wasn't the true Dragon Knight of Fire. Rath harbors a great amount of self-hate, frequently projecting this hatred onto others. In volume 19, he also nearly commits suicide by Thatz's Earth Dragon Sword. It takes a special person and a lot of effort to break through his many masks. He is also the only heir to the Dragon Lord. He is somehow related to the Demon Lord and believes that he shouldn't be living. Cesia and Rune are those that Rath acts naturally around. When he and Cesia travel together to look for a way to revive Crewger, Rath's demon dog, he begins to develop feelings for Cesia. He would do anything to save her from the many demons that are after her. :Rath used to be an evil spirit that had possessed the dead body of the Dragon dog, Illuser. Ace used his blood to turn it into one of the Dragon Tribe. After going to Nadil's castle to rescue Lii with Rune and Thatz, Rath is captured and Cesia releases all the souls that were held inside of Rath, most notably Gil and Bierrez, and Rath disappears. It is unknown whether or not Rath is dead at this point or not and the story seems to indicate that Cesia will bring him back again at some later point. :When Cesia finally revives Rath once more, he goes back to Nadil's castle where Nadil reveals that Rath is the Demon King. This finally explains Karl's inexplicable loyalty to Rath and Rath's ability to continually return to life in different bodies. Rath uses Rakeita, the magical gun, with the help of the Dragon lord and Dragon empress' dragon eyes. In the end, Rath and Cesia become the Dragon Lord and Queen. ;Rune:The Dragon Knight of Water, an elfin prince. He gave up his elfin powers when he became a dragon knight, and spent much time trying to recover them. He is incredibly focused, and seems to hold the current mission above all else in his priorities. He uses the Water Dragon sword as his weapon, although he can also harness the Power of Varawoo (a demon fish) and the purifying elfin power of Virtue. Although none of his friends tend to remember, Rune is also in love with and married to the elfin princess, Tintlet. He also resembles a girl, as noted by Rath and Thatz. He becomes the next White Dragon Officer in the end. ;Thatz:(or in the original Japanese version, That's) The Dragon Knight of Earth, a human. He was originally a thief before he awoke the Earth Dragon while trying to steal its seal from the Dragon palace. He still has a weakness for treasure and food. He uses the Earth Dragon sword as his weapon and, unlike the other two Knights, has no extra powers. In one of his battles against the Fire Demon Fedelta, he lost his left arm. Thatz, while coming off lighthearted, lazy, and even immature at times, cares deeply for Rath and Rune and tries hard to keep them both from harm‚Äîboth external and self-inflicted. He becomes the next Blue Dragon Officer in the end. =Leading ladies= ;Cesia:A part-Yokai whom the Dragon Knights accidentally \\"rescued\\" from a witch. She can control wind magic and amplifies the powers of others who are near her. Her power amplification is one of the most sought after skills by both the Dragon Tribe and the Demon armies, and she has found herself to be of surprising worth. Cesia uses the Wind Staff both as a weapon and an object of healing‚ÄîAlthough she has yet to unlock all of its secrets. She is one of the few who can get through to Rath and the person he feels the most comfortable around, as they share many aspects in their pasts. Cesia promises Rath that she would be the one to save him as she cares deeply for Rath.In volume 25 she eventually saves Rath and in doing so Rath and Cesia share a \\"Hello\\" kiss as Rath calls it. Cesia is a psychologically strong character, although she is also fighting her own inner demons which come not only in the more traditional forms of self-doubt and fear, but her Yokai side as well. She is very susceptible to curses. ;Kitchel:A human thief like Thatz, she used to be his rival when they were both scraping a living on the streets. She stole all of Thatz's money and food when she got a job working for Lord Lykouleon, actually forcing Thatz to sneak into the castle and eventually become a Dragon Knight. She is currently enlisted as a treasure hunter for the Dragon Lord. Very upbeat and cheerful, Kitchel prides herself on both her ability to always look on the bright side and for still being the best thief around. She managed to find the Three Treasures. ;Tintlet:The elfin princess and wife of Rune, Tintlet holds a surprising amount of power. Appearing at first glance to be no more than a delicate addition to the cast, her elfin powers are quite strong. Very adept at healing and purifying magic, Tintlet can also \\"kick butt\\" when riled. She has the ability to change her form into that of a young human-looking girl and so be able to better traverse the countryside without giving away her true identity. In addition, Tintlet is able to split her body and soul, an ability that has already proven useful multiple times. A deeply loving and understanding character, Tintlet, although remaining largely unseen until the (after a brief appearance in the sixth and thirteenth) fifteenth book, has quickly shown her worth and ability to handle all thrown at her. She is caring of others, especially for the Elfin race. =Dragon Lord and consort= ;Lord Lykouleon:The Dragon Lord, and previous Light Dragon Knight. He is a powerful fighter and an empathetic caretaker of the people, but is constantly being kept in the castle by his underlings. He feels responsible for Rath's troubles and hurt by Rath's inability to see eye-to-eye with him. His blood is poisonous to most people, being described like an \\"overdose of light medicine\\". He uses the Imperial Dragon Sword as his weapon, although Rath currently has this in his possession. Lykouleon takes all under his wing, welcoming humans, yokai, and elves alike into the Dragon castle. Except for Rath, his blood brother, he is the last of the royal line. By the end of the series, he dies and his soul helps Rath level the magic gun at Nadil. It is believed that he was the sacrifice Nadil was talking about, in order for Rath to retain his dragon powers as he shot Nadil. ;Lady Raseleane:The consort to the Dragon Lord, Lady Raseleane is Lykouleon's beloved wife. Greatly popular among the Dragon Tribe, she is a nurturing mother to all within the walls. Lady Raseleane was captured by Lord Nadil when the demons invaded Draqueen for the first time, prompting the start of the poor (to say the least) diplomatic relations between Kainaldia and Draqueen. She was eventually rescued by Lord Lykouleon, but not before Nadil had removed her Dragon Eyes (greatly stunting her ability to foretell the future and use magic) and rendered her unable to bear the Dragon Lord an heir. Nadil tries to kidnap her after he is revived and Rath dies. Lykouleon saves her. After the Dragon Lord dies, she secludes herself and Cenozurna in a mountain mansion. She also tells Rath, the new Dragon Lord, that he and Lykouleon are one. =Dragon officers= ;Alfeegi:The White Dragon Officer and Secretary, Alfeegi takes upon himself much of the responsibility for the every day affairs in the palace. He often scolds Ruwalk, Kaistern, Lykouleon and the three Knights for not finishing their work on time or giving extra money to Kaistern on his trips and such. As well as the castle finances, Alfeegi is in charge of their fortunetellers, placing Cesia under his care. Alfeegi has fantastic intuition and a keen mind, and although it seems like he enjoys yelling, he cares for all the Dragons very much. He was killed by Rath (who was possessed by Nadil at the time) in book 11. He returns in the latest book with the death faery, though unseen by any of the inhabitance of the Dragon Castle. It is assumed that he is either a ghost or a death faery now. He also visits Draqueen in the end, before Lykouleon dies, with Reema and Duuma. At that time, he instructs Saabel - whose soul was separated from his body and Alfeegi was talking to Saabel's soul - to find the Diamond Clover, a powerful dragon/monster that can defeat Yuusurgi. He is married to Reema, the death fairy. ;Ruwalk:The Yellow Dragon Officer, Ruwalk acts as the Dragon Lord whenever Lykouleon cannot. He is childish and mischievous, but fights hard to protect the Dragon Tribe. Ruwalk has a tendency to give extra money to Kaistern for his frequent trips and help Lord Lykouleon slip out of the castle unnoticed. Always one to stand up for those trying to slide around the various castle formalities, he tends to get in trouble with Alfeegi quite often. He is Lykouleon's childhood friend and most of the time calls him by his given name without the title of \\"Lord\\": Ruwalk is Lykouleon's closest confidant and one of the few who are close enough to him to give him blunt advice or help. Ruwalk was also the one who chose to keep \\"Illuser\\" [\\"Eryusa\\" in Japanese] as Rath's last name. He and Cenozurna are paired up at the end. ;Kaistern:The Blue Dragon Officer, Kaistern travels around the world as a diplomat with other countries on the continent of Dusis. He is the closest to Rath and the Dragon/Demon dog Crewger, taking Crewger along on several of his trips. He has spent the last several years searching for the mystical Wind Dragon in a desperate effort to save Rath, whom he cares deeply for, acting as a joint mentor-father-therapist for the Knight of Fire. Kaistern would (and, indeed, does) lay everything on the line for Rath, and although he is the only one who Rath tells everything to, he never truly is let in by the Knight, no matter how hard he has tried to be accepted. After being poisoned by demon water, he gives up his lifeforce to help resurrect Rath. (He died in book 12, after being poisoned in an earlier book.) ;Tetheus:The Black Dragon Officer and in charge of security and of overseeing the Dragon Fighters and Knights, Tetheus does a commendable job to protect the Dragon Castle from harm. Brother to Shydeman and Shyrendora, meaning that he is a demon, he was rescued by Lykouleon and vowed to serve him. Dark, mysterious and incredibly strong, not much is known about his past or, in reality, his present. Tetheus isn't as harsh as he sometimes comes off, however, and while he can be very strict, is also protective to a fault, loyal, and with the uncanny ability to see far more than he reveals. He was able to kill his brother, Shydamen, and become a full dragon. He also, as he was fighting off Shydamen, reinforced Saabel's soul's instructions to find Diamond Clover. He and Kitchel are paired up in the end. =Historian= ;Cernozura:In charge of the castle maids and other lower staff, Cernozura has recently taken up the post of castle historian as well. Renowned for her culinary skills, Cernozura is a favorite of the younger members of the castle and a close friend and lady-in-waiting to Lady Raseleane. Often seen nursing the hurts (both major and minor) of the Dragon Clan, Cernozura is dutiful and friendly, and also a self-admitted romantic. She finds hope in reading into peoples' interactions and uncovering the latent feelings below. =Nadil's army= ;Nadil:The Demon Lord, arch-enemy of Lord Lykouleon. He was decapitated, but his armies still scour the land. Long ago, he worked with the Dragon Lord but betrayed him to lead his demonic forces. He was the true Dragon Knight of Wind, but consumed the Wind Dragon to gain power and further his own means. Ruthless and cruel, Nadil desires Cesia's power as well in order to strengthen his weakened, but by no means minute, forces. He harbors secret ties to Rath Illuser and is capable of possessing his body on occasion and wreaking havoc through him. While his exact plans are largely unknown to all by himself, Nadil's motives are clear: control of all three lands of Kainaldia, Dusis, and Arinas. ;Shydeman and Shyrendora:Shyrendora is the younger twin sister of Shydeman. They share a single joined soul, making it so that if one of them dies, the other will as well. She was separated from her older siblings, Shydeman and Tetheus, when they were separated in a great war between the Dragon Lord and Demon Lord. She followed Shydeman when he chose to side with Nadil in order to gain new powers and to save each other from death. She has a hot temper, is easily agitated, and thinks of people as objects. Shyrendora is devoted to Nadil and is extremely distressed whenever his life is in danger. She is fairly amused by Sabel, and she finds pleasure in agitating him as well as the other lesser demons. Shydeman is the older twin brother of Shyrendora. He nearly died in the battle between the Dragon Lord and Demon Lord. Believing that Tetheus had died and while he himself was rendered weak, Shydeman joined with Nadil to receive enough power to make up for his lacking past. His strength grew and his lust for power grew with it, making him as power-hungry as Nadil. Just like his sister, he likes to control people {i.e. Gil} and show others that he is not to be toyed with. Shydeman cares nothing for Tetheus, deciding that anyone who joins the Dragon Tribe must be an enemy. He is smart and calm through most situations, and is careful to think before taking action. He has, oddly enough, formed a relatively open bond with the Fire demon Fedelta, promoting him to work directly under him and carry out his specific commands. ;Fedelta:Fedelta is a Fire yokai and Shydeman's loyal spy. He does anything Shydeman tells him to do without complaint. He likes to be alone, and he keeps to the shadows most of the time and lacks confidence in what others do, thinking that he must do a job himself to get the work done. Fedela only truly cares about Shydeman and is extremely jealous of anyone that likes him or who is liked by him. He greatly dislikes the amusement that Shydeman got from Gil and tends to mess with Saabel, who also annoys him because of his high rank. Lim Kaana double irritated him for being another of Shydeman's favorites and for also being female. Much of Fedelta's tactics are \\"hit and run\\", appearing at random to throw the metaphorical wrench into the spokes and severely set back his opponents. He is also Bierrez's Older Brother. ;Saabel:Saabel's past is deeply connected with the Spirit Tribe. Somewhere along the line, Nadil captured and gave Saabel his powers, and Saabel lost his memory. Afterwards, he became a corpse-gathering demon under Nadil's army. He gathers corpses and uses them like puppets to do whatever he pleases. He protects Nadil's castle in a sea of souls stolen from those he kills. While Saabel is bored easily, he also has a happy attitude and a quick temper. He is able to create portals, a power that he hides from other Yokai but commonly uses to his own advantage. Saabel is amused by Rath and curious as to why a yokai would help the Dragon Tribe. He uses the gifts he received from Nadil: Garaba (Galaba), Meteaura (Meteora), and the Black Thunder Demon, to kill people to use as his puppets. Saabel has an aversion to the Spirit Tribe, and feels pain whenever a faerie is close due to a curse placed on him by Nadil. ;Gil:Gil was once a human, but was transformed into a demon by Kharl. Later sold to Nadil's army, he was treated like a slave by Shydeman and Fedelta. Despite his hopeless situation, he was rescued by a rebel Yokai named Raamganas, who took care of him and treated him fairly and whom Gil eventually fell in love with. But the mind control placed on him by Shyrendora enabled Nadil's army to toy with him, turning him into a merciless demonic beast and, in doing so, to kill Raamganas. Gil has little recollection of the things he did, and he lacks the power to stop it. He later killed his brother Barl's wife, as well as his niece Fiji. While Gil is one of Lord Nadil's prized demons, he is also the rightful Dragon Knight of Fire. Later on Gil takes back his title as a Dragon Knight. (When he finally encounters Raamganas' spirit, it is revealed that Gil was tricked into thinking he had killed Raamganas when Shydeman and Shyrendora had actually been behind it.) ;Raamganas (Laamgarnas or Laamu Ghanasu):Raamganas was the demon who rescued Gil from Nadil's army and nursed him back to health. He risked his life to keep Gil safe and was eventually killed‚Äîby Shyrendora's mind control on Gil. Laamu Garnas loved Gil deeply, and his memory haunted Gil even after his \\"death\\" at Rath's hands. ;Bierrez (Viaresu):Bierrez (or Viaresu) is a youkai who is very loosely affiliated with Nadil's army. A rebel demon, Bierrez keeps his loyalties to himself and dislikes being told what to do, often masterminding his own schemes rather than following orders. Due to an encounter with the Dragon Lord's blood as a young youkai, Bierrez used to be the only youkai able to enter the Dragon castle. While pretending to retrieve Cesia for Nadil's army, Bierrez actually attacked the Dragon Castle single- handedly in order to rescue her (though she didn't know it and refused to leave). He has a very close attachment to Cesia, having known her for several years, always watching out for her from behind the scenes and protecting her from other youkai who want her powers. While he appears to simply be trying to better his own place in life, Bierrez actually puts a lot of effort into doing what he thinks is best for Cesia; ultimately, he asked Rath to kill him in order to protect her. At the time of his \\"death\\" in the fourth volume, Bierrez possessed the Red Dragon Gem and was the Red Dragon Officer candidate. When Rath \\"killed\\" him, he absorbed the Red Dragon Gem. When revived by Cesia in volume 21, Bierrez agreed to become the Red Dragon Officer. He now refers to himself as a Dragon rather than as a yokai. Also Fedelta's younger brother. ;Lim Kaana (Rim Kaana):Lim Kaana (or Rim Kaana), a young female demon, was created along with her sister Leelu Reel (or Riru Riru) by Shydeman. One of her first major tasks was to steal back the Power of Varawoo from Rune... A task that failed miserably. Currently containing some of Tintlet's memories, Lim has been converted from the yokai mission and now works for the Dragon Tribe, trying her best to help them with her mix of demon magic and newfound faerie powers. Lim Kaana is quickly falling in love with Rune, but Rune himself seems to remain oblivious... ;Roobal (Lobal):Roobal (or Lobal) is one of Bierrez's friends, who gave up his arm so that Bierrez could use it. This character somehow survived Illuser's attack way back at Nadil's castle. He used to work for Nadil but he rebelled and now seems to be allied with the Dragons. He finally reveals his face and name at the 22nd volume. =Lord Kharl and Garfakcy= ;Kharl the Alchemist:A mysterious yokai who manipulates parts of the demon army from behind the scenes. He is able to create demons from captured faeries using his alchemy (An alchemist in this world is one who \\"creates souls\\", not one who tries to create gold.). He can transform other species as well into demons using demon seeds, which infect the body and change it into an alternate demonic form. He uses two \\"birds\\", which are sometimes referred to as his \\"wings\\", to aid him in this process. Left Bird creates minds, while Right Bird creates bodies. Left Bird was killed by Rath, halting Kharl's construction of intelligent demons, but has a connection to the small demon named Zoma. Kharl also is the writer of the \\"Demon Bible\\", a \\"how-to\\" guide on creating demons out of your own force. He also has several clones floating around, and a Demon Dog named Sinistora which he crafted to look suspiciously like the dead Snow Crewger and Ice Illuser. Very interested in anything unusual, Kharl is fascinated with strange plants, food, demons, and humans. Strangely enough, Kharl has taken in a human boy named Garfakcy and prolonged his life, keeping him as a maid-cook-gardener-spy-assassin- experiment. He is also a slob and tends to forget things and make messes. His role is that of a mad scientist. Kharl also harbors a strong craving for Rath: he wants to steal him back from the Dragon Tribe, but is finding himself strangely unable to do so, and not because he lacks the power needed. It is later revealed that Kharl was a friend/adviser of the Demon King of Arinas. ;Garfakcy:A human boy taken in by Lord Kharl, Garfakcy has repeatedly voiced wishes to be turned into a demon, a desire Kharl simply laughs off. While unable to use magic of his own, Garfakcy casts spells using magical ash Kharl has created. He hates to feel weak or vulnerable, and doesn't let this side of himself show, preferring to come off as competent, even ruthless and vindictive. While seeming to be constantly irritated at the older yokai for his (many) annoying habits (forgetting things and making messes among them), Garfakcy is highly loyal to him and hates to see him threatened or hurt... Or to see him channeling his attention towards someone else. :These two are also very friendly to each other, like they are a real family. Dragon Knights volume 18 has a few bonus side stories based on these two's daily life, and it is quite funny. Two of these stories are a \\"cooking show\\" with Kharl and Garfakcy in which Kharl fails to make edible food and creates demons instead. =Others= ;Zoma :A demon Cesia took under her wing when she first escaped the witch, he is very protective of her, and she cares for him deeply. He was the only one who stayed with her during her time captive by Nadil's army and the witch, and accompanied her to the Dragon Castle, even though he is a demon. He doesn't have much confidence in his abilities as he spent most of his short life unable to walk and without any skills other than the odd talent of being able to travel through mirrors. Zoma has ties to both Rath and Nohiro, and holds an inner power far greater than he can imagine or comprehend. It is now known that Zoma is Lord Kharl's left bird and he is restored to his true shape when Rath, Rune, and Thatz go to Nadil's palace to rescue Cesia. ;Nohiro :A strange human, Nohiro has healing powers that far surpass that of any known faerie or elf. He has no recollections of his past apart from a vague memory of the Spirit Tribe. This has set off his quest to find out about the disappearance of the faeries and to save them from total destruction (and, of course, to wed a pretty elfin girl). He is also mysteriously connected to Rath and, therefore, to Zoma, although, when asked, Rath denied ever hearing of him. Very kindhearted, Nohiro is just learning how to use his powers and is currently traveling the land and working odd jobs in an attempt to earn money for his voyage. He also seems rather fond of Rune. ;Miyabi, Shian, and Hanakusuku :Miyabi, Shian, and Hanakusuku are three Water Lights or faeries who teamed up with Nohiro on his search for more of the Spirit Tribe. Tight friends, they spend much of their time arguing with each other and vying for \\"Lord Nohiro's\\" attention and praise. Of the three, only Miyabi currently survives, the other two falling in Nohiro's defense as they fled from Lord Kharl's castle. ;Ringleys :Ringleys, another Water Light, was rescued from a demon by Thatz and Kitchel and accompanied Kitchel on her quest for the Three Treasures. Lacking many powers, Ringleys comes along for moral support... And to be randomly thrust by Kitchel into situations against his will. ;Reema :Reema is a death fairy. She helps noble souls into the Afterlife. She behaves childishly and playfully at times. But when it suits her she seems to have the mind of an adult and displays omniscient tendencies, doing her best to warn the Dragon clan of impending disasters though apparently these preordained events must happen. She has some feelings for Alfeegi; she helped him and the Dragon King in a demon town, and as he was dying he kissed her. ;Duuma :Reema's companion and/or watcher, he takes their duties very seriously and tries to protect her. He appears to share the same foreknowledge of events. ;Heaven Star Princess :A mysterious girl whose real name is not revealed. She gives Cesia the Wind Staff. She knows things that are about to happen and gives the characters valuable information. Although there isn't much information about her, it's known that she has a greater role later in the story. ;Grinfish :The Heaven Star Princess's bodyguard. Like the princess, he is also a mysterious character with very few appearances. Not much is said about him either. Manga Dragon Knights was changed to being made in an unflopped format by Tokyopop in May 2002. Dragon Knights ended in May 2007 with 26 tankouban volumes. Reception According to Diamond Comic Distributors in December 2001, the third volume of Dragon Knights was the 243rd top selling comic.

Animal models representing specific taxonomic groups in the research and study of developmental processes are also referred to as model organisms. There are three main types of animal models: Homologous, Isomorphic and Predictive. Homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease. Isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments, only. Predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects. However, these are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features. Phylogeny and genetic relatedness Although scientific study of animals predates Charles Darwin by several hundred years, the primary justification for the use of animals in research is based on the evolutionary principle that all organisms share some degree of relatedness and genetic similarity due to common ancestry. The study of taxonomic human relatives, then, can provide a great deal of information about mechanism and disease within the human body that can be useful in medicine. Various phylogenetic trees for vertebrates have been constructed using comparative proteomics, genetics, genomics as well as the geochemical and fossil record. These estimations tell us that humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ancestor about 6 million years ago (mya). As our closest relatives, chimpanzees have a lot of potential to tell us about mechanisms of disease (and what genes may be responsible for human intelligence). However, chimpanzees are rarely used in research and are protected from highly invasive procedures. The most common animal model is the rodent. Phylogenic trees estimate that humans and rodents last shared a common ancestor ~80-100mya. Despite this distant split, humans and rodents have far more similarities than they do differences. This is due to the relative stability of large portions of the genome; making the use of vertebrate animals particularly productive. Recently, genomic data has been added to techniques to make close comparisons between species and determine relatedness. Humans share about 99% of our genome with chimpanzees (98.7% with bonobos) and over 90% with the mouse. With so much of the genome conserved across species, it is relatively impressive that the differences between humans and mice can be accounted for in approximately six thousand genes (of ~30,000 total). Scientists have been able to take advantage of these similarities in generating experimental and predictive models of human disease. Disease models Animal models serving in research may have an existing, inbred or induced disease or injury that is similar to a human condition. These test conditions are often termed as animal models of disease. The use of animal models allows researchers to investigate disease states in ways which would be inaccessible in a human patient, performing procedures on the non-human animal that imply a level of harm that would not be considered ethical to inflict on a human. As in noted the introduction, animal models can be classified as homologous, isomorphic or predictive. Animal models can also be more broadly classified into four categories: 1) experimental, 2) spontaneous, 3) negative, 4) orphan. Experimental models are most common. These refer to models of disease that resemble human conditions in phenotype or response to treatment but are induced artificially in the laboratory. Some examples include: * The use of metrazol (pentylenetetrazol) as an animal model of epilepsy * Immunisation with an auto-antigen to induce an immune response to model autoimmune diseases such as Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis * Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery as an animal model of ischemic stroke * Injection of blood in the basal ganglia of mice as a model for hemorrhagic stroke * Sepsis and septic shock induction by impairing the integrity of barrier tissues, administering live pathogens or toxins * Infecting animals with pathogens to reproduce human infectious diseases * Injecting animals with agonists or antagonists of various neurotransmitters to reproduce human mental disorders * Using ionizing radiation to cause tumors * Using gene transfer to cause tumors * Implanting animals with tumors to test and develop treatments using ionizing radiation * Genetically selected (such as in diabetic mice also known as NOD mice) * Various animal models for screening of drugs for the treatment of glaucoma * The use of the ovariectomized rat in osteoporosis research * Use of Plasmodium yoelii as a model of human malaria Spontaneous models refer to diseases that are analogous to human conditions that occur naturally in the animal being studied. These models are rare, but informative. Negative models essentially refer to control animals, which are useful for validating an experimental result. Orphan models refer to diseases for which there is no human analog and occur exclusively in the species studied. The increase in knowledge of the genomes of non-human primates and other mammals that are genetically close to humans is allowing the production of genetically engineered animal tissues, organs and even animal species which express human diseases, providing a more robust model of human diseases in an animal model. The best models of disease are similar in etiology (mechanism of cause) and phenotype (signs and symptoms) to the human equivalent. However complex human diseases can often be better understood in a simplified system in which individual parts of the disease process are isolated and examined. For instance, behavioral analogues of anxiety or pain in laboratory animals can be used to screen and test new drugs for the treatment of these conditions in humans. A 2000 study found that animal models concorded (coincided on true positives and false negatives) with human toxicity in 71% of cases, with 63% for nonrodents alone and 43% for rodents alone. In 1987, Davidson et al. suggested that selection of an animal model for research be based on nine considerations. These include ‚Äú1) appropriateness as an analog, 2) transferability of information, 3) genetic uniformity of organisms, where applicable, 4) background knowledge of biological properties, 5) cost and availability, 6) generalizability of the results, 7) ease of and adaptability to experimental manipulation, 8) ecological consequences, and 9) ethical implications.‚Äù Behavioral sciences Animal models observed in the sciences of psychology and sociology are often termed animal models of behavior. It is difficult to build an animal model that perfectly reproduces the symptoms of depression in patients. Animals lack self-consciousness, self-reflection and consideration; moreover, hallmarks of the disorder such as depressed mood, low self-esteem or suicidality are hardly accessible in non-humans. However, depression, as other mental disorders, consists of endophenotypes that can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals. An ideal animal model offers an opportunity to understand molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that may lead to depression. By using animal models, the underlying molecular alterations and the causal relationship between genetic or environmental alterations and depression can be examined, which would afford a better insight into pathology of depression. In addition, animal models of depression are indispensable for identifying novel therapies for depression. Challenges and criticisms Many animal models serving as test subjects in biomedical research, such as rats and mice, may be selectively sedentary, obese and glucose intolerant. This may confound their use to model human metabolic processes and diseases as these can be affected by dietary energy intake and exercise. Animal models of psychiatric illness give rise to other concerns. Qualitative assessments of behavior are too often subjective. This would lead the investigator to observe what they want to observe in subjects, and to render conclusions in line with their expectations. Also, the imprecise diagnostic criteria for psychiatric illnesses inevitably lead to problems modeling the condition; e.g., since a person with major depressive disorder may experience weight loss or weight gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, we cannot with any certainty say that a rat with insomnia and weight loss is depressed. Furthermore, the complex nature of psychiatric conditions makes it difficult/impossible to translate human behaviors and deficits; e.g., language deficit plays a major role in autistic spectrum disorders, but ‚Äì since rodents do not have language ‚Äì it is not possible to develop a language-impaired \\"autistic\\" mouse. Ethics Debate about the ethical use of animals in research dates at lease as far back as 1822 when the British Parliament enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle see text. This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835 and 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the National Anti- Vivisection Society, the Cruelty to Animals Act was amended to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over (see text). Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also Laboratory Animal Welfare Act) set standards for animal use and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS‚Äôs Animal Care program see AWA policies. In academic settings in which NIH funding is used for animal research, institutions are governed by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). At each site, OLAW guidelines and standards are upheld by a local review board called the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All laboratory experiments involving living animals are reviewed and approved by this committee. In addition to proving the potential for benefit to human health, minimization of pain and distress, and timely and humane euthanasia, experimenters must justify their protocols based on the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Replacement refers to efforts to engage alternatives to animal use. This includes the use of computer models, non-living tissues and cells, and replacement of ‚Äúhigher-order‚Äù animals (primates and mammals) with ‚Äúlower‚Äù order animals (e.g. cold-blooded animals, invertebrates, bacteria) wherever possible (list of common model organisms approved for use by the NIH). Reduction refers to efforts to minimize number of animals used during the course of an experiment, as well as prevention of unnecessary replication of previous experiments. To satisfy this requirement, mathematical calculations of statistical power are employed to determine the minimum number of animals that can be used to get a statistically significant experimental result. Refinement refers to efforts to make experimental design as painless and efficient as possible in order to minimize the suffering of each animal subject. While significant advances have been made in the care and treatment of animals, this is an ever-evolving debate. Animal rights and protection groups such as the ASPCA, PETA and BUAV continue to advocate for the best laboratory conditions, and experimental protocols possible for animals in research. Pressure from these groups has also led to novel modes of experimentation, which does not involve the sacrifice of live animals. One aspect of this debate; however, continues to be difficult to resolve: the classification of animals according to a hierarchy, which protects some species more than others. Next to humans, primates are the most protected species in experimentation. The rationale for this has both evolutionary and philosophical underpinnings. Because chimpanzees and other non-human primates can demonstrate intelligence, and social structure that they have a life experiences that is more cognitively complex than lower species. Conversely, this kind of moralizing of complexity of interaction and thought could be considered ‚Äúspecieisism.‚Äù Ultimately, this is an argument not likely to be resolved, however most people are more comfortable with the idea of experimentation that involves worms or flies than mice, dogs, or monkeys. Alternatives Ethical concerns, as well as the cost, maintenance and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease. Cell culture, or in vitro studies, provide an alternative that preserves the physiology of the living cell, but does not require the sacrifice of an animal for mechanistic studies. Human, inducible pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell regeneration. Imaging studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics can identify disease-associated genes, which can be targeted for therapies. Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for a living organism when studying complex interactions in disease pathology or treatments.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a polymer belonging to the polyesters class that are of interest as bio-derived and biodegradable plastics. The poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) form of PHB is probably the most common type of polyhydroxyalkanoate, but other polymers of this class are produced by a variety of organisms: these include poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV), polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH), polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) and their copolymers. Biosynthesis PHB is produced by microorganisms (such as Cupriavidus necator, Methylobacterium rhodesianum or Bacillus megaterium) apparently in response to conditions of physiological stress; mainly conditions in which nutrients are limited. The polymer is primarily a product of carbon assimilation (from glucose or starch) and is employed by microorganisms as a form of energy storage molecule to be metabolized when other common energy sources are not available. Microbial biosynthesis of PHB starts with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl- CoA to give acetoacetyl-CoA which is subsequently reduced to hydroxybutyryl- CoA. This latter compound is then used as a monomer to polymerize PHB. PHAs granules are then recovered by disrupting the cells. Structure of poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), a polyhydroxyalkanoate Chemical structures of P3HB, PHV and their copolymer PHBV Thermoplastic polymer Most commercial plastics are synthetic polymers derived from petrochemicals. They tend to resist biodegradation. PHB-derived plastics are attractive because they are compostable and derived from renewables and are bio-degradable. ICI had developed the material to pilot plant stage in the 1980s, but interest faded when it became clear that the cost of material was too high, and its properties could not match those of polypropylene. In 1996 Monsanto (who sold PHB as a copolymer with PHV under the trade name Biopol) bought all patents for making the polymer from ICI/Zeneca. However, Monsanto's rights to Biopol were sold to the American company Metabolix in 2001 and Monsanto's fermenters producing PHB from bacteria were closed down at the start of 2004. Monsanto began to focus on producing PHB from plants instead of bacteria. But now with so much media attention on GM crops, there has been little news of Monsanto's plans for PHB. In June 2005, a US company, Metabolix, received the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award (small business category) for their development and commercialisation of a cost-effective method for manufacturing PHAs in general, including PHB. Biopol is currently used in the medical industry for internal suture. It is nontoxic and biodegradable, so it does not have to be removed after recovery. TephaFLEX is a bacterially derived poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, manufactured using a recombinant fermentation process by Tepha Medical Devices, intended for a variety of medical applications that require biodegradable materials.Tepha Medical Devices Technology Overview Properties *Water-insoluble and relatively resistant to hydrolytic degradation. This differentiates PHB from most other currently available biodegradable plastics, which are either water-soluble or moisture-sensitive. *Good oxygen permeability. *Good ultra-violet resistance but poor resistance to acids and bases. *Soluble in chloroform and other chlorinated hydrocarbons. *Biocompatible and hence is suitable for medical applications. *Melting point 175 ¬∞C., and glass transition temperature 2 ¬∞C. *Tensile strength 40 MPa, close to that of polypropylene. *Sinks in water (while polypropylene floats), facilitating its anaerobic biodegradation in sediments. *Nontoxic. *Less 'sticky' when melted History Polyhydroxybutyrate was first isolated and characterized in 1925 by French microbiologist Maurice Lemoigne. Biodegradation Firmicutes and proteobacteria can degrade PHB. Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Streptomyces species can degrade PHB. Pseudomonas lemoigne, Comamonas sp. Acidovorax faecalis, Aspergillus fumigatus and Variovorax paradoxus are soil microbes capable of degradation. Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas, and Illyobacter delafieldi, are obtained from anaerobic sludge. Comamonas testosteroni and Pseudomonas stutzeri were obtained from sea water. Few of these are capable of degrading at higher temperatures; notably excepting thermophilic Streptomyces sp. and a thermophilic strain of Aspergillus sp.

At the time of the 2011 Census of India, they made up about 18% of the state's population.  Origin  Adi Dravida in a village Iyothee Thass, a leader of the Paraiyar community, believed that the term \\"Paraiyar\\" was a slur. He attempted a reconstruction of Tamil history, arguing that the Paraiyars were the original inhabitants of the land, who had been subjugated by upper-caste invaders. Another Paraiyar leader, Rettamalai Srinivasan, however, advocated using the term \\"Paraiyar\\" with pride, and formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (\\"Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly\\") in 1892. Thass, on the other hand, advocated the term \\"Adi-Dravida\\" (\\"Original Dravidians\\") to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term Adidravida Jana Sabhai to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the \\"People‚Äôs Assembly of Urdravidians\\" (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of \\"Adi Dravida\\" into political discussion.

Another Paraiyar leader, M C Rajah ‚Äî a Madras councillor ‚Äî made successful efforts for adoption of the term \\"Adi- Dravidar\\" in the government records.

They were said to have exceeded at least double normal human height, with some accounts giving heights of or more. Tales of these people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years. First mention of these people came from the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, who claimed to have seen them while exploring the coastline of South America en route to the Maluku Islands in their circumnavigation of the world in the 1520s. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the expedition's few survivors and the chronicler of Magellan's expedition, wrote in his account about their encounter with natives twice a normal person's height: Pigafetta also recorded that Magellan had bestowed on these people the name \\"Patag√£o\\" (i.e. \\"Patagon\\", or Patagoni in Pigafetta's Italian plural), but he did not further elaborate on his reasons for doing so.Antonio Pigafetta, Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo, 1524: \\"Il capitano generale nomin√≤ questi popoli Patagoni.\\" The original word would probably be in Ferdinand Magellan's native Portuguese (patag√£o) or the Spanish of his men (patag√≥n). Since Pigafetta's time the assumption that this derived from pata or foot took hold, and \\"Patagonia\\" was interpreted to mean \\"Land of the Bigfeet\\". However, this etymology remains questionable, since amongst other things the meaning of the suffix -gon is unclear. It is now understood that the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early 16th century.Anthony Munday, The Famous and Renowned Historie of Primaleon of Greece, 1619, cap.XXXIII: \\"How Primaleon‚Ä¶ found the Grand Patagon \\". Nevertheless, the name \\"Patagonia\\" stuck, as did the notion that the local inhabitants were giants. Early maps of the New World afterwards would sometimes attach the label regio gigantum (\\"region of giants\\") to the area. 1840s illustration of Patagon encampment; from account by French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville In 1579, Francis Drake's ship chaplain, Francis Fletcher, wrote about meeting very tall Patagonians, of \\"7 foote and a halfe\\". In the 1590s, Anthony Knivet claimed he had seen dead bodies long in Patagonia. Also in the 1590s, William Adams, an Englishman aboard a Dutch ship rounding Tierra del Fuego, reported a violent encounter between his ship's crew and unnaturally tall natives. In 1766, a rumour leaked out upon their return to the United Kingdom that the crew of HMS Dolphin, captained by Commodore John Byron, had seen a tribe of natives in Patagonia when they passed by there on their circumnavigation of the globe. However, when a newly edited revised account of the voyage came out in 1773, the Patagonians were recorded as being --very tall, but by no means giants. The people encountered by Byron were in all likelihood the Tehuelches, indigenous to the region. Later writers consider the Patagonian giants to have been a hoax, or at least an exaggeration and mis-telling of earlier European accounts of the region. These accounts may also refer to the Selk'nam people. A photo of a seven foot tall Selk'nam (\\"Ona\\") man can be found in the Library of Congress.Ona man, 7 ft. 4 in., standing Library of Congress.

It is set on the desert world of Angelis in the Warhammer 40,000 setting, and prominently features Orks. The player takes control of a group of warriors with the objective to gain wealth and experience. The rules are derived from the second edition of Warhammer 40,000, with extra vehicle rules and an extensive campaign system added. In 1998 it received an expansion set, Digganob, which introduced additional playable factions, special characters, and scenarios. In 2008 the rule book and source book for Gorkamorka were released on the Games Workshop website under the \\"Out of Print Games\\" section. The expansion set was not released in the same way. A video game based on Gorkamorka was also being developed for Windows and the Dreamcast, but was scrapped shortly before the latter system was discontinued. Background Aeons ago a Space Hulk filled with Orks on a Waaagh! (a huge Ork invasion) crashed into Angelis plowing a massive canyon, \\"Da Skid\\", and devastating the world's ecosystem. The Orks, a race who can survive just about any catastrophe, promptly decided that this wasn't the Waaagh! and resolved to find a way off-world as quickly as possible. They turned to their Mekboyz (Ork technicians, engineers, mechanics and the closest thing they have to scientists) for aid, who set the other Orks to work gathering up wreckage from the crash. Construction began on a huge machine, although what it was going to do differed depending on the ideas of the individual Mekboy. The lack of unity in the construction and the machine's resemblance to a religious idol led to conflict amongst the Ork population. A religious schism occurred and factions formed based around whether believers felt the idol was of the Ork god Gork or Mork. The resulting violence destroyed the entire machine, forcing the Meks to broker an unsteady peace between the warring sides. From then on the machine would be known as Gorkamorka, at least until the day of completion. Angelis was a suspected Necron tombworld, prompting Imperial efforts to assess the planet. At the time of the crash there were surveyors underground within the pyramids, an Imperial outpost, and an Imperial cruiser in orbit. The cruiser was brought down by the hulk with the disfigured descendants of the crash survivors became \\"Muties\\", while those inside the pyramids became primitive tribals known as \\"Diggas\\". Gameplay The object of the game is to lead a group of warriors to fame and fortune within the setting. Players choose from a range of factions with varying motivations and abilities and fight battles against others. Most of these groups are between five and fifteen fighters with appropriate transport, known as a \\"mob\\". Battles take place in an assortment of locations and scenarios, including sieges, races, and rescue missions. The gameplay is similar to Necromunda, https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/7decnl/im_andy_chambers_ask_me_anything/dpxciql/  \\"I banged that out in eight weeks basically by heavily re-writing Necromunda.\\" which also revolves around small gangs. The primary difference is the inclusion of vehicles, although there are many significant differences that lead to Gorkamorka being a less \\"serious\\" game by comparison, characterised particularly by less lethal ranged combat and the bizarre nature of the Orks. Games are designed to be played in a series and form a campaign, wherein fighters gain new abilities and suffer permanent battle injuries or death, and new warriors are purchased, or \\"retire\\" once they get to too high of a level. Players earn money (\\"Teef\\") based on how well they perform and the relative strength of their opponents. The campaigns are designed to be open- ended, allowing new players to join and leave at any time thanks to a mechanic which adjusts the rewards players receive evening out the power disparity. The closest thing to winning a campaign would be reaching the \\"retirement\\" level before other players. Mob types ; Orks : A fungus/algal-based race whose culture revolves around war, Orks are the most common species in the universe of Warhammer 40,000. They are split into two factions, Gorkers and Morkers. Gorkers favour brutal weaponry while Morkers favour enhancing their vehicles. ; Diggas : Tribal humans, descendants of an Imperial surveying team. ; Rebel Grots : A sub-set of the orkoid species similar to goblins. ; Muties : Mutants originating from the shipwrecked crew of the survey team's orbiting vessel. Community creations Since the release of the rulebook PDFs on the Games Workshop site in 2008 the community surrounding Gorkamorka has grown substantially online resulting in the creation of a large volume of fan-made content. Several community created mob types have been added to the game: ;Feral Orks : Primitive Orks with no access to higher technology, relying instead on squigs, squiggoths, and psychic powers. ;Freebooters : Orks who have no affiliation with Gorkers or Morkers, preferring instead to live as pirates and mercenaries. ;The Dust Rats : Humans trapped within the Imperial surveyors' outpost at the time of the space hulk's crash. Best described as somewhere between a militia and the Imperial Guard. ;Snortaz : Orks who eschew vehicles in favour of large boars. ;Dark Eldar : A cruel and technologically advanced race from the Warhammer 40K universe. There have also been many scenarios and extra rules created, most of which have been published on The Unnamed Gorkamorka Site.

Watercolor and ink by Marion Griffin 1894 Design for Suburban Residence Exhibit plan 2 Design for Suburban Residence Exhibit Plan 1 Marion Mahony Griffin (February 14, 1871 ‚Äì August 10, 1961) was an American architect and artist. She was one of the first licensed female architects in the world, and is considered an original member of the Prairie School.The First American Women Architects, by Sarah Allaback, p. 87 Her work in the United States developed and expanded the American Prairie School. Her work in India and Australia reflected Prairie School ideals of indigenous landscape and materials in the newly formed democracies. The scholar Deborah Wood has stated that Griffin \\"did the drawings people think of when they think of Frank Lloyd Wright (one of her collaborating architects).\\" She produced some of the best architectural drawing in America and Australia during the time she was active and was instrumental in envisioning the design plans for the capital city of Australia, Canberra.Paull, John (2012) Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, Architects of Anthroposophy, Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 106 (Winter), pp. 20-30. Early life and education Mahony was born in 1871 in Chicago, Illinois, to Jeremiah Mahony, a journalist, poet, and teacher from Cork, Ireland, and Clara Hamilton, a schoolteacher.Anna Rubbo, \\"Marion Mahony Griffin: A Portrait,\\" in Walter Burley Griffin‚ÄîA Re-View, ed. Jenepher Duncan (Clayton, Victoria, Australia: Monash University Gallery, 1988), 16; James Weirick, \\"Marion Mahony at M.I.T.,\\" Transition 25, no. 4 (1988): 49. Her family moved to nearby Winnetka in 1880 after the Great Chicago Fire. In her memoir, Mahoney vividly describes her mother carrying her as an infant in a clothes basket, as they escape from the fire. Growing up in Winnetka, she became fascinated by the quickly disappearing landscape as suburban homes filled the area. She was influenced by her first cousin, architect Dwight Perkins, and decided to further her education. She graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 1894. She was the second woman to do so, after Sophia Hayden, the designer of the Woman's building at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Though highly talented, she sometimes struggled with her place in both society and the field. She was unsure of her ability to complete the thesis required for her bachelor's degree, but her professor, Constant-D√©sir√© Despradelle, pushed her forward.The American Midwest, by Richard Sisson, Christian K. Zacher, Andrew Robert Lee Cayton, Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 558 Architectural career =Work with Frank Lloyd Wright= After graduation, Mahony returned to Chicago, where she became the first woman to be licensed to practice architecture in Illinois. She worked in her cousin's architecture firm, which was located in Steinway Hall at 64 E. Van Buren in downtown Chicago. The space was shared with many other architects, including Robert C. Spencer, Myron Hunt, Webster Tomlinson, Irving Pond and Allen Bartlitt Pond, Adamo Boari, Birch Long and Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1895, Mahony, the first employee hired by Frank Lloyd Wright, went to work designing buildings, furniture, stained glass windows and decorative panels.Walter Burley Griffin, by Paul Kruty, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Her beautiful watercolor renderings of buildings and landscapes became known as a staple of Wright's style, though she was never given credit by the famous architect. Over a century later she would be known as one of the greatest delineators of the architecture field, but during her life her talent was seen as only an extension of the work done by male architects. She was associated with Wright's studio for almost fifteen years and was an important contributor to his reputation, particularly for the influential Wasmuth Portfolio, for which Mahony created more than half of the numerous renderings. Architectural writer Reyner Banham called her the \\"greatest architectural delineator of her generation.\\"Reyner Banham, ‚ÄúDeath and Life of the Prairie School,‚Äù Architectural Review 154 (August 1973): 101 Her rendering of the K. C. DeRhodes House in South Bend, Indiana, was praised by Wright upon its completion and by many critics.Frank Lloyd Wright's Right- Hand Woman, by Lynn Becker, 2005 Wright understated the contributions of others of the Prairie School, Mahony included. A clear understanding of Marion Mahony's contribution to the architecture of the Oak Park Studio comes from Wright's son, John Lloyd Wright, who says that William Drummond, Francis Barry Byrne, Walter Burley Griffin, Albert Chase McArthur, Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts and George Willis were the draftsmen‚Äîthe five men and two women who each made valuable contributions to Prairie style architecture for which Wright became famous.\\"My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright\\", by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; p. 35 During this time Mahony designed the Gerald Mahony Residence (1907) in Elkhart, Indiana for her brother and sister-in-law. David M. Amberg House, 2009 When Wright eloped to Europe with Mamah Borthwick Cheney in 1909, he offered the Studio's work to Mahony but she declined. After Wright had gone, Hermann V. von Holst, who had taken on Wright's commissions, hired Mahony with the stipulation that she would have control of design.Mahony Griffin, Marion, \\"The Magic of America\\" In this capacity, Mahony was the architect for a number of commissions Wright had abandoned. Two examples were the first (unbuilt) design for Henry Ford's Dearborn mansion, Fair Lane and the Amberg House in Grand Rapids, Michigan. =Work with Walter Burley Griffin= Mahony recommended Walter Burley Griffin to von Holst to develop landscaping for the area surrounding the three houses commissioned from Wright in Decatur, Illinois. Griffin was a fellow architect, a fellow ex-employee of Wright, and a leading member of the Prairie School of architecture. Mahony and Griffin worked on the Decatur project before their marriage; afterwards, Mahony worked in Griffin's practice. A Walter Burley Griffin/Marion Mahony designed development that is home to an outstanding collection of Prairie School dwellings, Rock Crest ‚Äì Rock Glen in Mason City, Iowa, is seen as their most dramatic American design development of the decade. It is the largest collection of Prairie Style homes surrounding a natural setting. Mahony and Griffin married in 1911, a partnership that lasted 26 years. Mahony's watercolor perspectives of Griffins's design for Canberra, the new Australian capital, were instrumental in securing first prize in the international competition for the plan of the city. In 1914 the couple moved to Australia to oversee the building of Canberra. Mahony managed the Sydney office and was responsible for the design of their private commissions. In Australia, Mahony and Griffin were introduced to Anthroposophy and the ideas of Rudolf Steiner which they embraced enthusiastically, and in Sydney they joined the Anthroposophy Society.Paull, John (2012) Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, Architects of Anthroposophy, Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 106 (Winter), pp. 20-30. In Australia, they pioneered the Knitlock construction method, inexactly emulated by Wright in his California textile block houses of the 1920s. Walter was invited to design a library for the University of Lucknow in India, and travelled there in September 1935, and soon gained numerous other commissions. Marion arrived in April 1936, and soon took charge of the office, where she oversaw the design of many buildings.The First American Women Architects, by Sarah Allaback, p. 89 Less that a year later, in Feb 1937. Walter died of peritonitis following a cholecystectomy. Mahony then would up the office, leaving many projects unbuilt, and returned to Australia. Mahony and Griffin spread the Prairie Style to two continents, far from its origins. She credited Louis Sullivan as the impetus for the Prairie School philosophy. She thought Wright's habit of taking credit for the movement explained its early death, in the United States.The Magic of America: Electronic Edition online version of Marion Mahony Griffin's unpublished manuscript, made available through The Art Institute of Chicago Death and legacy Marion Mahony Griffin did not stay long in Australia after Walter's death. By then in her late 60s, she returned to the United States and afterward was largely retired from her architectural career. \\"The one time she addressed the Illinois Society of Architects, she made no mention of her work, instead lectured the crowd on anthroposophy, a philosophy of spiritual knowledge developed by Rudolf Steiner.\\" She did however spend the next twenty years working on a massive volume of 1400 pages and 650 illustrations detailing her and Walter's working lives, which she titled \\"The Magic of America\\", which has yet to be formally published in book form. A manuscript deposited at the Art Institute of Chicago in c1949 was digitized, and is since 2007 has been available on-line. She died in 1961 aged 90, and is buried in Graceland Cemetery. In 2015, the beach at Jarvis Avenue in Rogers Park, Chicago was named in Mahony Griffin's honor. When she returned to the United States in 1939, after her husband's death, she lived near the beach. The Australian Counsel General, Roger Price, attended the beach's dedication for the woman who was instrumental in the design the Australian capital. An exhibition of some of her work was held at the Block Museum of Northwestern University in 2015. In 2016-17, an exhibit of her work was on display at the Elmhurst History Museum. In the United States there are a few surviving works attributed to Mahony. There is a small mural in George B. Armstrong elementary school in Chicago attributed to Mahony, and several homes in Decatur. The Australian Institute of Architects, NSW Chapter, honors her work with an annual award, the Marion Mahony Griffin Prize, for a distinctive body of work by a female architect for architectural education, journalism, research, theory, professional practice or built architectural work..

Military career Foulkes was born in Stockton-on-Tees, England and joined the Canadian Army in 1926.Juno Beach Centre Biography In 1937 he attended the Staff College in Camberley, England. In 1939, Foulkes was serving as a major with the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. He went on to be a General Staff Officer with 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. After serving as a Brigade Commander from August 1942, he was appointed General Officer Commanding 2nd Canadian Infantry Division in January 1944 and led the division through the Normandy Campaign. In November 1944 he was made General Officer Commanding I Canadian Corps in Italy. On 4 May 1945, south of Hamburg, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery accepted the unconditional surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany including all islands, in Denmark and all naval ships in those areas. The surrender preceded the end of World War II in Europe and was signed in a carpeted tent at Montgomery's headquarters on the Timeloberg hill at Wendisch Evern. On 5 May 1945, Foulkes summoned German General Blaskowitz to the Hotel de Wereld (\\"Hotel the World\\") in Wageningen to discuss the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands. His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard, acting as commander in chief of the Dutch Interior Forces, attended the meeting as well. Blaskowitz agreed with all of the proposals made by Foulkes. However, nowhere in the building ‚Äì some sources claim: nowhere in the whole town ‚Äì could a typewriter be found. Thus the surrender document could not be typed. The next day, May 6, both parties returned, and in the presence of both General Foulkes and Prince Bernhard, Blaskowitz signed the surrender document which in the meantime had been typed.Monument Wageningen General Foulkes, seated 2nd from right, with other Generals of the First Canadian Army. After the war, Foulkes was appointed Chief of the General Staff and, in 1951, the first Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff. He retired in 1960. In 1968 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He taught at Carleton University in 1968 and 1969. He died in Ottawa in 1969. His medals and other personal artifacts are on display at the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario. He was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Western Ontario on 11 June 1947.

Her mother, Caecilia Pilea/Pilia (before ca 75 BC - 46 BC), daughter of Pileus/Pilius, was a maternal granddaughter of Marcus Licinius Crassus, a member of the First Triumvirate. Atticus and Pilea/Pilia were married in 58 BC/56 BC, when Atticus was already 53/54 years old, and she died after 12 years of marriage. Caecilia's aunt, Pomponia, married Cicero's younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero around 70 BC. She also had an older brother named after his father, Titus Pomponius Atticus. Name In history Caecilia Attica is often called Pomponia Attica. This confusion arises from the fact that her father Titus Pomponius Atticus was at a relatively advanced age adopted by his uncle, Quintus Caecilius Metellus. This meant according to the Roman custom that his name changed to Quintus Caecilius Pomponianus Atticus, and Pomponia Attica's name into Caecilia Attica. Relationship to Cicero Caecilia Attica is several times mentioned in the letters between her father and Cicero. Cicero was very fond of this little girl, whom he would never see growing into an adult as he was murdered in 43 BC. He gave her the pet name Attica, the feminine equivalent to her father's cognomen Atticus. (In Rome women generally did not have a cognomen; their name was just the feminine form of their father's surname, in Caecilia's case Caecilius). In his letters to Atticus Cicero often sent greetings to her, and often asked if she had one of her bouts of high fever that caused distress to him. In one letter in the beginning of the 40s BC Cicero tells him not to reprimand Attica, who was sulking and angry at Cicero. He said that she was quite right in insisting that Cicero on his last visit had not said goodbye to her properly.Marcus Tullius Cicero: \\"Samtliga brev\\"/\\"Collected letters\\" d.u. Education Caecilia Attica was given a broad literary education. Her education started at the early age of five or six. Her father procured her a private tutor, one of his freedmen. (Having a private tutor and education at home was considered to be the proper way to educate women in Rome.) There was gossip that she had had an affair with this tutor. However, Roman historians were very fond of scandals and used sources that modern historians would consider unreliable. Marriage and children Around 37 BC, she married Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Octavian's right-hand man and trusted friend. Octavian and Agrippa were childhood friends and had studied together in Apollonia, Illyria (modern Albania) before Gaius Julius Caesar had adopted Octavian. This was socially a very fortunate marriage for Attica, as Augustus had secretly planned to make Agrippa his successor and heir. This was disclosed when Augustus, during a serious illness, handed over his seal ring to Agrippa. However, Agrippa died before Augustus in 12 BC. The marriage was negotiated by Mark Antony. Caecilia Attica's and Agrippa's daughter Vipsania Agrippina was born in 36 BC, she was engaged at only a year old to the future emperor Tiberius. It is possible that she and Agrippa had another daughter who was married to Quintus Haterius. In 28 BC Agrippa married for a second time the Emperor Augustus' niece Claudia Marcella Major in a political alliance. It is unknown whether Agrippa divorced Attica or if she had already died.

The earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994. In 1997, Nokia launched the very successful Snake. Snake (and its variants), that was preinstalled in most mobile devices manufactured by Nokia, has since become one of the most played games and is found on more than 350 million devices worldwide. A variant of the Snake game for the Nokia 6110, using the infrared port, was also the first two-player game for mobile phones. Today, mobile games are usually downloaded from an app store as well as from mobile operator's portals, but in some cases are also preloaded in the handheld devices by the OEM or by the mobile operator when purchased, via infrared connection, Bluetooth, memory card & side loaded onto the handset with a cable. Downloadable mobile games were first commercialised in Japan circa the launch of NTT DoCoMo's I-mode platform in 1999, and by the early 2000s were available through a variety of platforms throughout Asia, Europe, North America and ultimately most territories where modern carrier networks and handsets were available by the mid-2000s. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators and third party portals (channels initially developed to monetise downloadable ringtones, wallpapers and other small pieces of content using premium SMS or direct carrier charges as a billing mechanism) remained a marginal form of gaming until Apple's iOS App Store was launched in 2008. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a mobile platform holder, the App Store significantly changed the consumer behaviour and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as almost every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps. History Towards the end of the 20th century, mobile phone ownership became ubiquitous in the industrialised world - due to the establishment of industry standards, and the rapid fall in cost of handset ownership, and use driven by economies of scale. As a result of this explosion, technological advancement by handset manufacturers became rapid. With these technological advances, mobile phone games also became increasingly sophisticated, taking advantage of exponential improvements in display, processing, storage, interfaces, network bandwidth and operating system functionality. The first such game that demonstrated the desire for handset games was a version of Snake that Nokia had included on its devices since 1997. The launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 and the App Store in 2008 radically changed the market. The iPhone's focus on larger memory, multitasks, and additional sensing devices, including the touchscreen in later model, made it ideal for casual games, while the App Store made it easy for developers to create and post apps to publish, and for users to search for and obtain new games. With several games released at launch of the App Store featured as rags to riches stories, developers drove to the iPhone and App Store. Further, the App Store added the ability to support in-app purchases in October 2009. This allowed games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope to find new monetization models away from the traditional premium \\"pay once\\" model. Meanwhile, Apple's disruption caused the market to stabilized around iPhone devices and Google's Android-based phones which offered a similar app store through Google Play. A further major shift game with 2012's Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons, games that used a stamina-like gameplay feature found in social-network games like FarmVille to limit the number of times one could play it in a single period, but allowed optional in-app purchases to restore that stamina immediately and continue playing. This new monetization brought in millions of players to both games and million of dollars in revenue, establishing the freemium model that would be a common approach for many mobile game going forward. Mobile gaming grew rapidly over the next several years, buoyed by rapid expansion in China. By 2016, top mobile games were earning over a year, and the total revenue for the mobile games sector had surpassed that of other video game areas. Other major trends in mobile games have include the hyper-casual game such as Flappy Bird and Crossy Road and location-based games like Pok√©mon Go. =Calculator games= Clone of Tetris being played on a TI-83 Plus Portal Calculator gaming is a form of gaming in which games are played on programmable calculators, especially graphing calculators. An early example is the type-in program Darth Vader's Force Battle for the TI-59, published in BYTE in October 1980. The magazine also published a version of Hunt the Wumpus for the HP-41C. Few other games exist for the earliest of programmable calculators (including the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, one of the first scientific calculators), such as the long-popular Lunar Lander game often used as an early programming exercise. However, limited program address space and lack of easy program storage made calculator gaming a rarity even as programmables became cheap and relatively easy to obtain. It was not until the early 1990s when graphing calculators became more powerful and cheap enough to be common among high school students for use in mathematics. The new graphing calculators, with their ability to transfer files to one another and from a computer for backup, could double as game consoles. Calculators such as HP-48 and TI-82 could be programmed in proprietary programming languages such as RPL programming language or TI-BASIC directly on the calculator; programs could also be written in assembly language or (less often) C on a desktop computer and transferred to the calculator. As calculators became more powerful and memory sizes increased, games increased in complexity. By the 1990s, programmable calculators were able to run implementations by hobbyists of games such as Lemmings and Doom (Lemmings for HP-48 was released in 1993; Doom for HP-48 was created in 1995). Some games such as Dope Wars caused controversy when students played them in school. The look and feel of these games on an HP-48 class calculator, due to the lack of dedicated audio and video circuitry providing hardware acceleration, can at most be compared to the one offered by 8-bit handheld consoles such as the early Game Boy or the Gameking (low resolution, monochrome or grayscale graphics), or to the built-in games of non-Java or BREW enabled cell phones. Games continue to be programmed on graphing calculators with increasing complexity. A wave of games appeared after the release of the TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus series, among TI's first graphing calculators to natively support assembly. TI-BASIC programming also rose in popularity after the release of third-party libraries. Assembly remained the language of choice for these calculators, which run on a Zilog Z80 processor, although some assembly implements have been created to ease the difficulty of learning assembly language. For those running on a Motorola 68000 processor (like the TI-89), C programming (possible using TIGCC) has begun to displace assembly. Because they are easy to program without outside tools, calculator games have survived despite the proliferation of mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. Industry structure Total global revenue from mobile games was estimated at $2.6 billion in 2005 by Informa Telecoms and Media. Total revenue in 2008 was $5.8 billion. The largest mobile gaming markets were in the Asia-Pacific nations Japan and China, followed by the United States. In 2012, the market had already reached $7.8 billion A new report was released in November 2015 showing that 1887 app developers would make more than one million dollars on the Google and iOS app stores in 2015. Mobile gaming revenue reached $50.4 billion in 2017, occupying 43% of the entire global gaming market and poised for further growth. It is expected to surpass the combined revenues from both PC gaming and console gaming in 2018. Different platforms Mobile games have been developed to run on a wide variety of platforms and technologies. These include the (today largely defunct) Palm OS, Symbian, Adobe Flash Lite, NTT DoCoMo's DoJa, Sun's Java, Qualcomm's BREW, WIPI, BlackBerry, Nook and early incarnations of Windows Mobile. Today, the most widely supported platforms are Apple's iOS and Google's Android. The mobile version of Microsoft's Windows 10 (formerly Windows Phone) is also actively supported, although in terms of market share remains marginal compared to iOS and Android. Java was at one time the most common platform for mobile games, however its performance limits led to the adoption of various native binary formats for more sophisticated games. A mobile game displaying a full-screen interstitial ad for a different game Due to its ease of porting between mobile operating systems and extensive developer community, Unity is one of the most widely used engines used by modern mobile games. Apple provide a number of proprietary technologies (such as Metal) intended to allow developers to make more effective use of their hardware in iOS-native games. Monetization With the introduction of the iOS App Store and support for in-app purchases by October 2009, the methods through which mobile games earn revenue have diverged significantly away from traditional game models on consoles or computers. Since 2009, a number of models have developed, and a mobile game developer/publisher may use one or a combination of these models to make revenue. ;Premium :The premium model is akin to the traditional model where the user pays for the full game upfront. Additional downloadable content may be available which can be purchased separately. Initial games released to the App Store before in-app purchases were available used this approach, and still common for many types of games. ;Freemium :The freemium or \\"free to try\\" model offers a small portion of the game for free, comparable to a game demo. After completing this, the player is given the option to make a one-time in- app purchase to unlock the rest of the game. Early games shortly after the introduction of the in-app purchase feature used this approach such as Cut the Rope and Fruit Ninja. ;Free-to-play :A free-to-play game requires no cost at all to play, and generally is designed to be playable from start to finish without having to spend any money into the game. However, the game will include gameplay mechanics which may slow progress towards completing the game. Commonly in mobile games, this is some form of energy or stamina that limits how many turns or actions a player can take each day. By using in-app purchases, the player can immediately restore their energy or stamina and continue on. In-app purchases can also be used to buy power-ups and other items to give the player a limited-time advantage to help complete the game. While free-to-play games had been common on computers prior to mobile, the method was popularized in mobile gaming with Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons. ;Advertising-supported :A ad-supported game will be free to download and play, but periodically or persistently, the game will show an ad to the user which they will have to watch through before they can continue with the game. The developer earns revenue from the advertising network. In some cases, an in-app purchase allows the player to fully disable ads in these games. ;Subscription model :A subscription-based game will offer a base version with limited features that can be played for free, but additional premium features can be obtained if the user pays a monthly subscription fee. If they terminate their subscription, they lose access to those features, though typically not any game progression related to those features, and can pick up those features later by restarting their subscription. Many game apps are free to play through a combination of these models. Over time, mobile developers of these types of apps have observed that the bulk of their players do not spend any funds on their game, but instead revenues are generated from a small fraction, typically under 10% of their total players. Further, most of the revenue is generated by a very small fraction, about 2%, of the total players, who routinely spend large amounts of money on the game. A similar split on revenue had been seen in social-network games played in browsers. These players are known as \\"whales\\", inspired by same term used for high rolling gamblers. The social nature of a mobile game has also been found to affect its revenue, as games that encourage players to work in teams or clans will lead to increased spending from engaged players. Common limits of mobile games Mobile games tend to be small in scope (in relation to mainstream PC and console games) and many prioritise innovative design and ease of play over visual spectacle. Storage and memory limitations (sometimes dictated at the platform level) place constraints on file size that presently rule out the direct migration of many modern PC and console games to mobile. One major problem for developers and publishers of mobile games is describing a game in such detail that it gives the customer enough information to make a purchasing decision. Location-based mobile games Games played on a mobile device using localization technology like GPS are called location-based games or location- based mobile games. These are not only played on mobile hardware but also integrate the player's position into the game concept. In other words, while it does not matter for a normal mobile game where exactly the player is (play them anywhere at any time), the player's coordinate and movement are the main elements in a location-based mobile game. A well known example is the treasure hunt game Geocaching, which can be played on any mobile device with integrated or external GPS receiver. External GPS receivers are usually connected via Bluetooth. More and more mobile phones with integrated GPS are expected to come. Several other Location-based mobile games, such as BotFighters, are in the stage of research prototypes rather than being commercial successes. Augmented reality games Augmented reality games, while not limited to mobile devices, are also common on newer mobile platforms where the device includes a reverse-facing camera. While playing the game, the player aims the device's camera at a location and through the device's screen, sees the area captured by the camera plus computer-generated graphics atop it, augmenting the display and then allowing the player to interact that way. The graphics are generally drawn as to make the generated image appear to be part of the captured background, and will be rendered appropriate as the player moves the device around. The starting location may be a special marker that is picked up by the camera and recognized by the software to determine what to present, or may be based on the location through GPS. While other augmented reality examples exist, one of the most successful is Pok√©mon Go where the player, using the game app, travels to locations marked on their GPS map and then uses the augmented reality mode to find Pok√©mon to capture.  Multipurpose games  Since mobile devices have become present in the majority of households at least in the developed countries, there are more and more games created with educational or lifestyle- and health-improvement purposes. For example, mobile games can be used in speech-language pathology, children's rehabilitation in hospitals (Finnish startup Rehaboo!), acquiring new useful or healthy habits (Habitica app), memorising things and learning languages (Memrise). There are also apps with similar purposes which are not games per se, in this case they are called gamified apps. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a line between multipurpose games and gamified apps. Multiplayer mobile games Many mobile games support multiple players, either remotely over a network or locally via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or similar technology. There are several options for playing multiplayer games on mobile phones: live synchronous tournaments and turn- based asynchronous tournaments. In live tournaments random players from around the world are matched together to compete. This is done using different networks such as Game Center, Google+, and Facebook. In asynchronous tournaments, there are two methods used by game developers centered around the idea that players matches are recorded and then broadcast at a later time to other players in the same tournament. Asynchronous gameplay resolves the issue of needing players to have a continuous live connection. This gameplay is different since players take individual turns in the game, therefore allowing players to continue playing against human opponents. This is done using different networks including OpenFeint (now defunct) and Facebook. Some companies use a regular turn-based system where the end results are posted so all the players can see who won the tournament. Other companies take screen recordings of live players and broadcast them to other players at a later point in time to allow players to feel that they are always interacting with another human opponent. Distribution Mobile games can be distributed in one of four ways: * Over the Air (OTA) - a game binary file is delivered to the mobile device via wireless carrier networks. * Sideloaded - a game binary file is loaded onto the phone while connected to a PC, either via USB cable or Bluetooth. * Pre-installed - a game binary file is preloaded onto the device by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). * Mobile browser download - a game file is downloaded directly from a mobile website. Until the launch of Apple App Store, in the US, the majority of mobile games were sold by the US wireless carriers, such as AT&T; Mobility, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile US. In Europe, games were distributed equally between carriers and off-deck, third-party stores. After the launch of Apple App Store, the mobile OS platforms like Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows Phone, the mobile OS developers themselves have launched digital download storefronts that can be run on the devices using the OS or from software used on PCs. These storefronts (like Apple's iOS App Store) act as centralized digital download services from which a variety of entertainment media and software can be downloaded, including games and nowadays majority of games are distributed through them. The popularity of mobile games has increased in the 2000s, as over US$3 billion worth of games were sold in 2007 internationally, and projected annual growth of over 40%. Ownership of a smartphone alone increases the likelihood that a consumer will play mobile games. Over 90% of smartphone users play a mobile game at least once a week. Many mobile games are distributed free to the end user, but carry paid advertising: examples are Flappy Bird and Doodle Jump. The latter follows the \\"freemium\\" model, in which the base game is free but additional items for the game can be purchased separately.

It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall and is connected to Nelson Dock to the north, Trafalgar Dock to the south and inland to Collingwood Dock. History Designed by Jesse Hartley, the dock opened in 1848. Its purpose was as a half tide dock, connected directly to the river via two lock entrances. These provided access between the Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. By the mid twentieth century, the dock was the principal hub for coastal and barge traffic in Liverpool. =Victoria Tower= The hexagonal Victoria Tower, consisting of six clock faces, is located between the now disused lock entrances. The tower was based on an 1846 design by Philip Hardwick and built by Jesse Hartley in 1847-8 using irregular shaped granite blocks. The tower is inscribed with the date of its construction: '1848'. South of the former river entrance is the former Dock Master's Office, also built by Hartley in 1848 using masonry in the Cyclopean style. The tower's bell provided tidal and weather warnings to shipping. Although Grade II listed, the buildings are now disused and derelict. Regeneration Salisbury Dock is part of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area and is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to the Pier Head. In 2007, the Peel Group, owners of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, unveiled the ¬£5.5 billion 'Liverpool Waters' regeneration programme. The project includes the restoration of Victoria Tower and the construction of two skyscrapers near the historic building.

The epic picture was directed by Michael Anderson and produced by Mike Todd, with Kevin McClory and William Cameron Menzies as associate producers. The screenplay, based on the classic 1873 novel of the same name by Jules Verne, was written by James Poe, John Farrow, and S.J. Perelman. The music score was composed by Victor Young, and the Todd-AO 70 mm cinematography (shot in Technicolor) was by Lionel Lindon. The film's six-minute-long animated title sequence, shown at the end of the film, was created by award- winning designer Saul Bass. The film won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.Award Wins and Nominations for Around the World in 80 Days. IMDb. Retrieved March 2, 2013. Plot Broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow presents an onscreen prologue, featuring footage from A Trip to the Moon (1902) by Georges M√©li√®s, explaining that it is based loosely on the book From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne. Also included is the launching of an unmanned rocket and footage of the earth receding. In 1872, an English gentleman Phileas Fogg (David Niven) claims he can circumnavigate the world in eighty days. He makes a ¬£20,000 wager (worth about ¬£ in 2015) with four skeptical fellow members of the Reform Club (each contributing ¬£5,000 to the bet) that he can arrive back eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening. Together with his resourceful valet, Passepartout (Cantinflas), Fogg goes hopscotching around the globe generously spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can accommodate tight steamship schedules. They set out on the journey from Paris by a gas balloon named La Coquette upon learning the mountain train tunnel is blocked. The two accidentally end up in Spain, where Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight. Next, he goes to Brindisi. Meanwhile, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen ¬£55,000 (around ¬£ today) from the Bank of England so Police Inspector Fix (Robert Newton) is sent out by Scotland Yard to trail him (starting in Suez) and keeps waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in the British ports they visit. In India, Fogg and Passepartout rescue young widow Princess Aouda (Shirley MacLaine) from being forced into a funeral pyre with her late husband. The three visit Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and the Wild West (including the Sioux Nation). After sailing across the Atlantic, and only hours short of winning his wager, Fogg is arrested upon arrival at Liverpool, by the diligent yet misguided Inspector Fix. At the jail, the humiliated Fix informs Fogg that the real culprit was caught in Brighton. Although he is now exculpated, he has insufficient time to reach London before his deadline and thus has lost everythingbut the love of the winsome Aouda. Salvation is at hand when, upon returning to London, Passepartout buys a newspaper and sees it is still Saturday. Fogg then realizes that by traveling east towards the rising sun and by crossing the International Date Line, he has gained a day. There is still time to reach the Reform Club and win the bet. Fogg arrives at the club just before the 8:45 pm chime. Passepartout and Aouda then arrive, shocking everyone, as no woman has ever entered the Reform Club before. Cast The film boasts an all star cast, with David Niven and Cantinflas in the lead roles of Fogg and Passepartout. Fogg is the classic Victorian gentleman, well-dressed, well-spoken, and extremely punctual, whereas his servant Passepartout (who has an eye for the ladies) provides much of the comic relief as a \\"jack of all trades\\" for the film in contrast to his master's strict formality. Joining them are Shirley MacLaine as Princess Aouda and Robert Newton as the Detective Fix, in his last role. The role of Passepartout was greatly expanded from the novel to accommodate Cantinflas, the most famous Latin-American comedian at the time, and winds up as the focus of the film. While Passepartout describes himself as a Parisian in the novel, this is unclear in the filmhe has a French name, but speaks Spanish when he and his master arrive in Spain by balloon. In the Spanish version, the name of his character was changed from the French Passepartout to the Spanish Juan Picaporte, the name he has in the early Spanish translations of the novel. There is also a comic bullfighting sequence especially created for Cantinflas that is not in the novel.Page in Spanish about movies filmed in Chinch√≥n, with photos Retrieved December 12, 2010 Indeed, when the film was released in some non-English speaking nations, Cantinflas was billed as the lead. According to the guidebook, this was done because of an obstacle Todd faced in casting Cantinflas, who never had appeared in an American movie and had turned down countless offers to do so. Todd allowed Cantinflas to appear in the film as a Latin, \\"so,\\" the actor said himself, \\"...to my audience in Latin America, I'll still be Cantinflas.\\" More than 40 famous performers make cameo appearances, including Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, George Raft, and Frank Sinatra. The film was significant as the first of the so-called Hollywood \\"make work\\" films, employing dozens of film personalities. John Wayne turned down Todd's offer for the role of the Colonel leading the Cavalry charge,Wayne's declining the role of the cavalry colonel confirmed by film historian Robert Osbourne on February 12, 2014 following the TCM broadcast of the movie on that date a role filled by Colonel Tim McCoy.

The director he hired, Michael Anderson, had directed the highly acclaimed British World War II feature The Dam Busters (1955), George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four feature (1956), and other classic films. Todd sold his interest in the Todd-AO format to help finance the film. Because Todd-AO ran at 30 frames per second, which was incompatible with the 35mm standard of 24 fps, Around the World in 80 Days was filmed twice, like the first feature in Todd-AO, Oklahoma!. Unlike Oklahoma!, however, which was filmed additionally in 35mm CinemaScope, Around the World in 80 Days was filmed simultaneously in Todd-AO at 24 frames per second so that from this negative, 35mm reduction prints could be produced for general release. After these two films, the specification for Todd-AO was altered after the third film in the format, South Pacific, to 24 fps running, making it unnecessary to film subsequent productions twice. In his 1972 autobiographical book The Moon's a Balloon, actor David Niven discussed his meeting with Todd and the subsequent events that led to the film being produced. According to Niven, when Todd asked him if he would appear as Fogg, Niven enthusiastically replied, 'I'd do it for nothing!' He later admitted to being grateful that Todd did not hold him to his claim. He also described the first meeting between Todd and Robert Newton (who suffered from drinking problems) when the latter was offered the role of the detective, Fix; Niven alleged that Newton was offered the part on condition that he did not drink any alcohol during the filming, and that his celebration following the completion of his role led to his untimely demise (he did not live to see the film released). Filming took place in late 1955, from August 9 to December 20. The crew worked fast (75 actual days of filming), producing of film, which was edited down to of finished film. The picture cost just under $6 million to make, employing 112 locations in 13 countries and 140 sets. Todd said he and the crew visited every country portrayed in the picture, including England, France, India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), Spain, Thailand, and Japan. According to Time magazine's review of the film, the cast, including extras, totaled 68,894 people; it also featured 7,959 animals, \\"including four ostriches, six skunks, 15 elephants, 17 fighting bulls, 512 rhesus monkeys, 800 horses, 950 burros, 2,448 American buffalo, 3,800 Rocky Mountain sheep and a sacred cow that eats flowers on cue\\". There is also a cat at the Reform Club. The wardrobe department spent $410,000 to provide 74,685 costumes and 36,092 trinkets. This is allegedly the most costumes ever required for a Hollywood production.Turner Classic Movies introduction to the film, February 10, 2019. Some 10,000 extras were used in filming the bullfight scene in Spain, with Cantinflas as the matador; Cantinflas had previously done some bullfighting. They used all 6,500 residents of a small Spanish town called Chinch√≥n, from Madrid, but Todd decided there weren't enough spectators. So he found 3,500 more from nearby towns. He used 650 Indians for a fight on a train in the West. Many were indeed Indians, but some were Hollywood extras. All 650 had their skin color altered with dye. Todd used about of orange-coloured dye for those extras. Todd sometimes used models of boats, ships, and trains in the film, but he often decided that they didn't look realistic so he switched to the real thing where he could. The scene of a collapsing train bridge is partly without models. The overhead shot of a train crossing a bridge was full scale, but the bridge collapse was a large-scale miniature, verifiable by observing the slightly jerky motion of the rear passenger car as the train pulls away, as well as the slowed-down water droplets which are out of scale in the splashing river below. All the steamships shown in the first half are miniatures shot in an outdoor studio tank. The exception is the American ship shown at the intermission point, which is real. A tunnel was built for a train sequence out of paper mache. After the train filming was complete, the \\"tunnel\\" was pushed over into the gorge. Many of the special effects are described and pictured in a 1956 Popular Mechanics article.Stimson, Thomas E., Jr. \\"Move Magic and Illusions Take You Around The World in Eighty Days.\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1956, 65-69. The scenes of the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by steamship took place off San Francisco and were shot on a specially built prop steamer, a converted barge mocked up to resemble a small ocean-going steamship, with mock paddles driven by the electric motor from an old streetcar. In his memoirs, Niven described the whole thing as being dangerously unstable (though stability improved as it was dismantled as though to feed it into its own furnaces as the plot required). One of the most famous sequences in the film, the flight by hydrogen balloon, is not in the original Jules Verne novel. Because the film was made in Todd AO, the sequence was expressly created to show off the locations seen on the flight, as projected on the giant curved screen used for the process. A similar balloon flight can be found in an earlier Jules Verne novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon, in which the protagonists explore Africa from a hydrogen balloon.\\"Movie Magic and Illusions Take You ‚Äì Around The World IN 80 Days.\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1956, pp. 65-69/226. Many of the balloon scenes with Niven and Cantinflas were filmed using a crane. Even that height bothered Niven, who was afraid of heights. Tom Burges, who was shorter than Niven, was used as a stand-in for scenes where the balloon is seen from a distance. Many of the lots used in the film are now on the land occupied by Century City, an office complex in the L.A. area. In his memoirs, Niven related that Todd completed filming while in considerable debt. The post-production work on the film was an exercise in holding off Todd's creditors long enough to produce a saleable film, and the footage was worked upon under the supervision of Todd's creditors and returned to a secure vault each night, as if it were in escrow. The film's release and subsequent success vindicated Todd's considerable efforts. Release The film premiered on October 17, 1956 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City and played to full houses for 15 months. It ran for 102 weeks at the theater, with 1,564 performances, 2,173,238 patrons and a gross of $4,872,326. By the time of Todd's death in a private plane crash, 18 months after the film had opened, it had grossed $33 million. By November 1958, the film had earned worldwide rentals of $22 million including $4.6 million from overseas from just 280 engagements. None of the overseas engagements at that date had been in Todd- AO. In Spanish and Latin American posters and programs of the movie, Cantinflas is billed above the other players because he was very popular in Spanish-speaking countries. There were two souvenir programs sold in theatres. For Roadshow screenings Todd-AO is mentioned, though for general release those pages are not contained in the book. The program was created by Todd's publicist, Art Cohn, who died in the plane crash with him. His biography, The Nine Lives of Michael Todd, was published after their deaths which put a macabre spin on the title. Reception =Critical response= Bosley Crowther called the film a \\"sprawling conglomeration of refined English comedy, giant-screen travel panoramics and slam-bang Keystone burlesque\\" and wrote that Todd and the film's crew \\"commandeered the giant screen and stereophonic sound as though they were Olsen and Johnson turned loose in a cosmic cutting-room, with a pipe organ in one corner and all the movies ever made to toss around\\". Time magazine called it \\"brassy, extravagant, long- winded and funny\\" and the \\"Polyphemus of productions,\\" writing \\"as a travelogue, Around the World is at least as spectacular as anything Cinerama has slapped together\\". Time highlighted the performance of \\"the famous Mexican comic, Cantinflas [who in] his first U.S. movie ... gives delightful evidence that he may well be, as Charles Chaplin once said he was, \\"the world's greatest clown\\". Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 42 reviews and gave the film an aggregate score of 69%, with a rating average of 5.94/10, with the site's consensus stating: \\"It's undeniably shallow, but its cheerful lack of pretense -- as well as its grand scale and star-stuffed cast -- help make Around the World in 80 Days charmingly light-hearted entertainment\\". The development of the film and the personal life of actor Mario Moreno during that time were dramatized later in the 2014 film Cantinflas. =Accolades= Academy Awards The film was nominated for eight Oscars,New York Times, Academy Awards. of which it was awarded five, beating out critically and publicly praised films Friendly Persuasion, The Ten Commandments, Giant, and The King and I: * Won: Best Picture ‚Äì Michael Todd, producer * Won: Best Cinematography, Color ‚Äì Lionel Lindon * Won: Best Film Editing ‚Äì Gene Ruggiero and Paul Weatherwax * Won: Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture ‚Äì Victor Young * Won: Best Writing, Best Screenplay, Adapted ‚Äì John Farrow, S.

Sullivan * Nominee: Best Costume Design, Color ‚Äì Miles White * Nominee: Best Director ‚Äì Michael Anderson Although not nominated for Best Original Song, the film's theme song \\"Around the World\\" (music by Victor Young, words by Harold Adamson), became very popular. It was a hit for Bing Crosby in 1957, and was a staple of the easy-listening genre for many years: \\"Around the world, I searched for you / I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous ... No more will I go all around the world / For I have found my world in you.\\" It is also one of the few Best Picture winners not to be nominated in any acting category. Golden Globes The film was also nominated for three Golden Globes, of which it was awarded two: * Won: Best Dramatic Motion Picture ‚Äì Michael Todd, producer * Won: Best Motion Actor in a Comedy/Musical Film ‚Äì Cantinflas * Nominee: Best Director ‚Äì Michael Anderson Other awards * The film received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture and Best Screenplay award for S. J. Perelman. * The film won the Writers Guild of America Best Written American Comedy award for James Poe, John Farrow and S. J. Perelman. * The film was screened at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. =Anniversary celebration= CBS paid Mike Todd for the rights to cover the anniversary celebration as a television special. Todd and his wife Elizabeth Taylor are seen here at home in a film clip which was used for the television special. On the first anniversary of the film's release, Todd threw a party at the Madison Square Garden attended by 18,000 people; Time magazine called the party a \\"spectacular flop\\" though Todd shrugged off the remark, saying \\"You can't say it was a little bust.\\" The event, featured on a 90-minute CBS telecast, could boast of \\"a colossal hodgepodge of bagpipers, folk dancers, Philadelphia Mummers, Russian wolfhounds, oxen, Siamese cats, elephants, clowns, a fire engine, and a symphony orchestra.\\"\\"Todd's Little Garden Party.\\" LIFE, 28 October 1957, 149-150. Distribution and ownership The film was originally distributed by United Artists in two Todd-AO 70 mm versions, one for Todd-AO 70 mm release at 30 frames per second, and an alternative 70 mm version at 24 frames per second reduced to 35 mm for general release. The original Todd-AO 70mm running time without the extra music was 179 minutes. However, after the Chicago showing Todd cut four minutes out of the Western sequence where Cantinflas is pursued by Indians. The 70mm print shown at The Rivoli theatre in NYC was 175 minutes. However, the original 35mm Technicolor/anamorphic magnetic stereo and mono optical prints ran the complete 179 minutes with the chase scene intact. Although the leaders on the optical sound prints were labelled for Perspecta directional encoding, the prints do not contain the signal and were standard mono. In 1968, additional cuts were made including removing most of the prologue with the changing aspect ratios. Only a brief few shots with Edward R. Murrow remained and the entire \\"Trip to the Moon\\" clips were cut. Since the opening shot of Murrow was 1.33 window boxed in the wide frame, they had to crop and blow up that shot for the 2.35 ratio which made it very grainy. The intermission was also cut for the 1968 re-release which included the freeze frame of the ship and fade into the second half. The reels just jump cut with an awkward sound gap between the first and second half. The chase scene was missing from this version too which reduced the running time to 167 minutes. However, some uncut 179-minute 35mm Technicolor prints were struck too which meant at least some theatres played the Roadshow version even though the vast majority showed the shorter cut. 35mm IB/Scope copies of both versions exist from 1968. The 24 frames per second 70mm prints were also the 167-minute version in that year too. As a publicity stunt, Todd Jr. called the press when he removed a 70mm copy from a bank vault claiming it had been stored there since 1956 for safe keeping and was being shown at a theatre again. It was absurd since an original 70mm would've faded to pink by 1968 and the copy they exhibited was the cut re-issue 167-minute version. Around 1976, after its last network television broadcast on CBS, UA lost control of the film to Elizabeth Taylor, who was the widow of producer Michael Todd and had inherited a portion of Todd's estate. In 1983, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the film from Taylor, and reissued the film theatrically in a re-edited 143-minute version (this version would subsequently air only once on Turner Classic Movies, this was before any restoration on the movie was announced). In the years that followed, a pan-and-scan transfer of the alternative 24 frame/s version (presented at its full 183-minute length) was shown on cable television. In 2004, WB issued a digitally restored version of the 24 frame/s incarnation on DVD, also at its full 183-minute length, but also including the original intermission, Entr'acte, and exit music segments that were a part of the original 1956 theatrical release, and for the first time on home video at its original 2.2:1 aspect widescreen ratio. This restored version was reconstructed from the best available elements of the 24 frame/s edition WB could find, and was subsequently shown on Turner Classic Movies. The original elements from the 30 frame/s/70 mm Todd-AO version (as well as the original prints derived from these elements) still exist, albeit in faded condition due to the passage of time, but remain to be formally restored by WB. There is some missing footage in the India train ride where the image artificially fades in and out to compensate for the missing shots. Warner's retained Andy Pratt Film Labs who in conjunction with Eastman Kodak developed a method to remove the cracked and faded-to-brown, clear lacquer from the original 65 mm Technicolor negative. Warners did nothing further to restore the negative. Due to costs of making a 70 mm release print even without magnetic striping, using DTS disk for audio, there are no immediate plans for any new prints. The 65 mm roadshow print negative was used for the DVD release. Had any 35 mm Anamorphic elements been used the aspect ratio would have been 2.35:1. Mike Todd had limited 35 mm anamorphic prints made with a non-standard compression ratio to provide a 2.21:1 viewing experience. These special 35 mm prints are called Cinestage, the same name of Mike Todd's showcase theatre in Chicago. Best available prints of the 30 frame/s/70 mm version have recently been exhibited in revival movie houses worldwide. As of the present time, WB remains the film's rights holder. Soundtrack and DVD releases The DVDs for Around the World in 80 Days include four hours of supplemental material, in addition to the restored three-hour wide-screen presentation. Included on one of the disks is a documentary film, about 50 minutes long, about Michael Todd. The soundtrack was commercially released on vinyl and audio tape. Two CD versions were released as well, including a digital remastering of the original Decca Records album on MCA in the 1980s and an expanded version with extra tracks on the Hit Parade Records label in Canada in 2007. There was also a model kit of the balloon, a board game, and a Dell Comics adaptation. A Cantinflas puppet was released separately, dressed in an outfit similar to the Passepartout costume. Theme parks During the 1970-80s, the Alton Towers theme park in England had a boat ride based on the film.

He is known for his extensive and authoritative knowledge about the classic rock radio format, recorded music in general, and specifically the era of punk rock. His broadcast programs have been heard in various formats in the US, Canada, Europe and New Zealand, via licensed stations and unlicensed pirate radio transmitters. Early life After attending Wallace Elementary School in Dallas, George Gimarc graduated from Lake Highlands High School in the Class of 1975. =DJ career= Gimarc began his career as an intern at WRR AM in Dallas in April of 1975, then worked at college as a disc jockey on the University of North Texas radio station KNTU. In the spring of 1977, he started a new weekly show called Punk & New Wave, which eventually became known as The Rock & Roll Alternative when it moved to KZEW-FM in Dallas, making its debut on May 18, 1980. This was one of the first regular new wave or punk radio shows in the United States. The Rock & Roll Alternative program was responsible for introducing acts such as R.E.M., The Go-Go's, U2, The Psychedelic Furs, The Sex Pistols, Devo, The B-52's, XTC, The Smiths, The Cult, and hundreds of others to the listening audience of the Dallas and Fort Worth metroplex listening area from 1977 onwards. It went through three different theme songs, but its most familiar was the one provided by new friends The Bangles when they were recording their first album. The Rock & Roll Alternative program moved to commercial radio on May 18, 1980 and continued for 14 years until it was retired. Along the way, it was heard on four different licensed stations throughout its run in Texas - KNTU / KZEW / KNON / KDGE. After the show moved to KZEW (The Zoo) in Dallas, George Gimarc in association with John England began to promote the ideology of free radio (as opposed to government censored radio) within the show. Gimarc announced the show as being heard on the flagship station KZEW and the Four Freedoms World Service (4FWS) which relayed the program via recordings for retransmission by a network of unlicensed pirate radio stations that transmitted on AM, FM and shortwave in Europe, and shortwave from New Zealand via KIWI Radio, to Australasia. A Texas network of Public-access television cable TV channels called 4FTN, also aired special editions of Gimarc's programs. While Gimarc was hosting The Rock & Roll Alternative on KZEW-FM, in 1983 he also became music director on its sister AM station KRQX (K-Rocks) and turned it into a new format designed to be the flipside to the AOR sister station KZEW. While the Zoo was playing Kansas, The Eagles and Eddie Money, this new station played the older items they could no longer fit into the playlist - the Beatles, CCR, and Hendrix. In 1987, after both KZEW and KRQX changed ownership (from Belo to Anchor) and formats, he began a new program called Back Pages on KZPS in Dallas. This was an eclectic classic rock show combining rare records, intriguing stories and listener requests. In 1989, Gimarc was the first official hire of the new station KDGE (The Edge) where he developed the new commercial alternative format along with Wendy Naylor. He was on air daily in the afternoons and served as Music Director as well as doing the R&R; Alternative for another year or so. He, and several other key members of the staff were shown the door in 1993 when the station decided to take a more mainstream (chart) approach to music, and was no longer as keen on breaking new acts, as they were of following new trends. After years of music radio, Gimarc ventured into talk radio via the several appearances he'd made in the 1990s as a regular guest in Dallas with Mark Davis and Kevin McCarthy. He got his own show on the Texas State Network on Saturday nights and it was called The Lost Tapes. Again, it was songs and the stories behind them, with frequent guests and off-beat topics. The program even had one of the last interviews with Buddy Ebsen discussing his long and unknown singing career. Gimarc continued innovation with Radio Sass (Short Attention Span System), a new protocol for music radio allowing a broadcaster to play up to twice as much music in an hour as was previously possible, by cutting out parts of the song, time-compressing the music and other electronic \\"slice and dice\\" techniques. Gimarc is so proud of this new form of \\"radio formatics\\" that he has successfully received a pair of U.S. Patents on the technique, the first to ever apply to a radio format. Gimarc promotes the method as \\"groundbreaking in its approach to streamlining radio for modern listeners\\", despite the contention of his critics that what Gimarc calls \\"streamlining\\" is really \\"butchering\\" and \\"dumbing down\\". At this time, there is great enthusiasm among corporate radio interests and conglomerates that this may be the future path for Top 40 and CHR formats. Gimarc was pleasantly surprised to find that listeners in research groups did not detect the edits, although very familiar with the music. He says that the shortening parallels what listeners already do by punching from station to station, a behavior even found with iPods and personal devices. This protocol is now in use under the name 'Quick Hitz.\\" =Producer and author= While at KDGE, Gimarc produced and financed the twice-annual Tales From The Edge CD releases, eventually producing eleven volumes. All were loaded with unsigned local acts from North Texas, and many groups found this to be their first ever release on CD. The CDs typically sold out in a month or so. In all, over 100,000 Tales From The Edge CDs hit the streets of Dallas. After leaving the station Gimarc also produced the Edge Home Movie, a music video collection hosted by Edge DJs, that was a free video rental via Blockbuster outlets in DFW. 1,000 units were produced each month, and there were about a dozen issues before the station lost interest in promoting videos from alternative bands that weren't necessarily on their playlist yet. From left to right: Bryan Boyd, Eric Gardner, John Lydon, George Gimarc In addition to his on-air work and CDs, Gimarc became the sole writer for Rotten Day, a nationally syndicated radio program starring John Lydon, which aired in over 50 markets. When the radio show, distributed by Album Network, concluded its run, John Lydon and Gimarc moved on to VH1 with the show 'Rotten Television' While doing the irreverent program for VH1, Lydon also got to be a live host on the red carpet for the Grammy Awards, with Gimarc helping along with special material and props for the guests. Gimarc acted as consultant for the Time/Life and The History of Rock and Roll series, compiled several record collections and written liner notes for many record labels. He has also written several books, including Punk Diary 1970-1979 'Punk Diary 1980-1982 and Hollywood Hi Fi. As a result of being a voracious record collector and remaining in Dallas for his entire career, Gimarc has amassed an enormous archive of Texas music stretching back over 100 years. On many occasions, North Texas alt bands have had long lost recordings presumed lost, returned to them in clear, digital restorations. His expertise in Texas Music has gained him a seat on the advisory board of the new Texas Musicians Museum . Many items from his collection are on display there, including a field recorder used by Library of Congress historian Alan Lomax. 24/7Comedy and Today's Comedy In 2008 Gimarc began developing an All-Comedy radio format for AM & FM with a partner launching it in Riverside, CA. in September 2010. In the two years that followed, 24-7 Comedy Radio grew to 20 affiliates across the US and Canada, as well as becoming a national channel on the new iHeart app. In July 2012 it was purchased by Clear Channel M+E and was rolled out on even more stations bringing the total by years end up to nearly 40 stations. Gimarc was Comedy Brand Manager for Clear Channel and ran the operation from Dallas with a small, tight staff. It can be heard on stations in Austin , Atlanta, Dallas, Hamilton ON, Toronto, Denver , and many others, or via the iHeart mobile app, or through its website at www.247Comedy.com. The entire crew was terminated in the summer of 2014 when the 24/7 Comedy brand was reduced to just a digital stream. At the same time, Gimarc launched his new FM & AM stream Today's Comedy which can be heard on the Radio.com app or through their Radio.com web page. Published works Punk Diary 1970-79: \\"The beginning of punk in 1970. There are over 2,000 music news entries and 1,000 recordings detailed.

One of them was finding an hour of previously unknown live Hank Williams from 1950. Released by Omnivore Recordings in 2014 as The Garden Spot Programs, 1950 the album won a Grammy in the Best Historical Album category. Another lost audio project was released in 2018 by Universal Music Enterprises titled Glen Campbell Sings For The King. It contains demos of songs being pitched to Elvis Presley in the 1960s, that all featured studio musician Glen Campbell playing guitar and singing in his best Elvis vocal impersonation. Gimarc provided masters for eight of the songs on the set, and still retains another dozen or more that remain unreleased. In addition to his on-air work and CDs, Gimarc became the sole writer for Rotten Day, a nationally syndicated radio program starring John Lydon, which aired in over 50 markets. When the radio show, distributed by Album Network, concluded its run, John Lydon and Gimarc moved on to VH1 with the show 'Rotten Television' While doing the irreverent program for VH1, Lydon also got to be a live host on the red carpet for the Grammy Awards, with Gimarc helping along with special material and props for the guests.

Karl Meyer classified these enzymes in 1971, into three distinct groups, a scheme based on the enzyme reaction products. The three main types of hyaluronidases are two classes of eukaryotic endoglycosidase hydrolases and a prokaryotic lyase-type of glycosidase. In humans, there are five functional hyaluronidases: HYAL1, HYAL2, HYAL3, HYAL4 and HYAL5 (also known as SPAM1 or PH-20); plus a pseudogene, HYAL6 (also known as HYALP1). The genes for HYAL1-3 are clustered in chromosome 3, while HYAL4-6 are clustered in chromosome 7. HYAL1 and HYAL2 are the major hyaluronidases in most tissues. GPI-anchored HYAL2 is responsible for cleaving high-molecular weight HA, which is mostly bound to the CD44 receptor. The resulting HA fragments of variable size are then further hydrolized by HYAL1 after being internalized into endo- lysosomes; this generates HA oligosaccharides. According to their enzymatic mechanism, hyaluronidases are hyaluronoglucosidases (), i.e. they cleave the (1->4)-linkages between N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronate. The term hyaluronidase may also refer to hyaluronoglucuronidases (), which cleave (1->3)-linkages. In addition, bacterial hyaluronate lyases () may also be referred to as hyaluronidases, although this is uncommon.  Use as a drug  = Medical uses= By catalyzing the hydrolysis of hyaluronan, a constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM), hyaluronidase lowers the viscosity of hyaluronan, thereby increasing tissue permeability. It is, therefore, used in medicine in conjunction with other drugs to speed their dispersion and delivery. Common applications are ophthalmic surgery, in combination with local anesthetics. It also increases the absorption rate of parenteral fluids given by hypodermoclysis, and is an adjunct in subcutaneous urography for improving resorption of radiopaque agents. Hyaluronidase is also used for extravasation of hyperosmolar solutions. Hyaluronidase is used by plastic surgeons and dermatologists to reverse the effects of hyaluronic acid injections used as dermal fillers whenever the patient receiving the injections is unhappy with the results. Besides, hyaluronidase is a recommended antidote for vinca alkaloid overdose or extravasation. =Purified and recombinant hyaluronidases= Four different purified hyaluronidases have been approved for use in the United States, three of animal origin and one recombinant. They are indicated as adjuvants in subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, for increasing the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs, or for improving resorption of radiopaque agents, in subcutaneous urography. The three naturally-sourced hyaluronidases are orthologs of human HYAL5 (PH20) obtained from testicular preparations. They are sold under the trade names Vitrase (ovine, FDA-approved in May 2004), Amphadase (bovine, October 2004) and Hydase (bovine, October 2005). Human recombinant hyaluronidase (Hylenex)‚Äîapproved for use in the United States in December 2005‚Äîcorresponds to the soluble fragment of human HYAL5 (PH20) produced in culture by genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding the enzyme. =Combination treatments= A human recombinant hyaluronidase kit, HyQvia, was approved for use in the European Union in May 2013, Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. and in the United States in September 2014. It is a dual vial unit with one vial of immune globulin infusion 10% (human) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase. It is an immune globulin with a recombinant human hyaluronidase indicated in the United States for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency in adults. This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies. In the European Union it is indicated as replacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years) in: * Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production. * Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are contra‚Äëindicated. * Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. * Hypogammaglobulinaemia in patients pre‚Äë and post‚Äëallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A form of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) that uses Hylenex to allow for a far greater volume of SCIG to be administered than would normally be possible to administer subcutaneously, providing a form of SCIG that can be dosed on a monthly basis, a longer period of time than other forms of SCIG allow. HyQvia had a rate of systemic adverse effects higher than traditional subcutaneous forms of immunoglobulin injection, but lower than those typical in IVIG patients. Also in epidural lysis of adhesions for pain management. Hyaluronidase is available in some fixed-dose combination drug products in the United States: rituximab/hyaluronidase (Rituxan Hycela), trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin Hylecta), daratumumab/hyaluronidase- fihj (Darzalex Faspro), and pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase‚Äìzzxf (Phesgo).  Role in cancer  The role of hyaluronidases in cancer has been historically controversial due to contradictory observations, namely that levels of hyaluronidase (HYAL1/2) are increased in some cancers (colorectal, bladder, prostate, breast and brain), whereas low expression of HYAL1 is correlated with a decrease in survival of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The reason for this apparent contradiction is that both the accumulation of HA (due to increased HAS levels and decreased HYAL levels), and the degradation of HA into HA oligosaccharides by high HYAL levels result in increased tumor malignancy. Elevated tissue expression of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase validates the HA-HAase urine test for bladder cancer. Limited data support a role of lysosomal hyaluronidases in metastasis, while other data support a role in tumor suppression. Other studies suggest no contribution or effects independent of enzyme activity. Non-specific inhibitors (apigenin, sulfated glycosaminoglycans) or crude enzyme extracts have been used to test most hypotheses, making data difficult to interpret. It has been hypothesized that, by helping degrade the ECM surrounding the tumor, hyaluronidases help cancer cells escape from primary tumor masses. However, studies show that removal of hyaluronan from tumors prevents tumor invasion. Hyaluronidases are also thought to play a role in the process of angiogenesis, although most hyaluronidase preparations are contaminated with large amounts of angiogenic growth factors.  Role in pathogenesis  Some bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium perfringens, produce hyaluronidase as a means of using hyaluronan as a carbon source. It is often speculated that Streptococcus and Staphylococcus pathogens use hyaluronidase as a virulence factor to destroy the polysaccharide that holds animal cells together, making it easier for the pathogen to spread through the tissues of the host organism, but no valid experimental data are available to support this hypothesis. Hyaluronidases are found in the venom of certain lizards and snakes, as well as honeybees, where they are referred to as \\"spreading factors\\", having a function akin to bacterial hyaluronidases.  Role in immune response  White blood cells produce hyaluronidase to move more easily through connective tissue to get to infected sites.  Role in fertilization  In mammalian fertilization, hyaluronidase is released by the acrosome of the sperm cell after it has reached the oocyte, by digesting hyaluronan in the corona radiata, thus enabling conception. Gene-targeting studies show that hyaluronidases such as PH20 are not essential for fertilization, although exogenous hyaluronidases can disrupt the cumulus matrix. The majority of mammalian ova are covered in a layer of granulosa cells intertwined in an extracellular matrix that contains a high concentration of hyaluronan. When a capacitated sperm reaches the ovum, it is able to penetrate this layer with the assistance of hyaluronidase enzymes present on the surface of the sperm. Once this occurs, the sperm is capable of binding with the zona pellucida.

For a short distance (corresponding to the middle leg of the letter \\"Z\\"), the direction of travel is reversed, before the original direction is resumed.Raymond 1912. \\"Switch-back development ‚Ä¶ necessitating the use of switches at these ends and the backing of the train up alternate stretches.\\" Not all switchbacks come in pairs, in which case the train may need to travel backwards for a considerable distance. A location on railways constructed by using a zig-zag alignment at which trains have to reverse direction in order to continue is a reversing station. One of the best examples is the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage site railway in India, that has six full zig zags and three spirals.  Advantages  Zig zags tend to be cheaper to construct because the grades required are discontinuous. Civil engineers can generally find a series of shorter segments going back and forth up the side of a hill more easily and with less grading than they can a continuous grade which has to contend with the larger scale geography of the hills to be surmounted.  Disadvantages  Zig zags suffer from a number of limitations: * The length of trains is limited to what will fit on the shortest stub track in the zig zag. For this reason, the Lithgow Zig Zag's stubs were extended at great expense in 1908. Even then, delays were such that the zig zag had eventually to be bypassed by a new route, opened two years later. * Reversing a locomotive-hauled train not purposely equipped for push-pull operation without first running the engine around to the rear of the train can be hazardous ‚Äì although operating the train with two locomotives, one at each end (a practice known as \\"topping-and-tailing\\"), can mitigate the dangers. * The need to stop the train after each segment, throw the switch, and then reverse means that progress through the zig zag is slow.  Hazards  If the wagons in a freight train are marshalled poorly, with a light vehicle located between heavier ones (particularly with buffer couplings), the move on the middle road of a zig zag can cause derailment of the light wagon.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1995, and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon. The son of Warder Franklin John Orchard and Muriel Bernice King, he was born in Miami, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He worked as a farmer after graduation, becoming active in the Miami Agricultural Society and the local Masonic organization. In 1969, he married Edna Jane Simpson. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, in the safe Conservative seat of Pembina. He was re-elected in this riding in the elections of 1981, 1986, 1988 and 1990, each time by a comfortable margin. The Progressive Conservatives won the 1977 election under Sterling Lyon, and Orchard was appointed Minister of Highways and Transport on November 15, 1979. He was also appointed Chairman of the Provisional Land Use Committee on January 1, 1980, and was given ministerial responsibility for Manitoba Data Services on January 16, 1981. The social-democratic New Democratic Party won the 1981 election, and Orchard resigned from cabinet on November 30, 1981. The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in 1988 under Gary Filmon, and Orchard was appointed Minister of Health on May 9 of that year (despite the fact that he attempted to remove Filmon as party leader in 1986). He held this portfolio until September 10, 1993, when he was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for the Manitoba Hydro Act. He did not seek re-election in 1995, and resigned from cabinet on March 20 of that year. As Health Minister, Orchard banned Medicare coverage from Henry Morgentaler's private abortion clinic. This decision provoked criticism from both sides of the abortion debate; some wanted the clinic closed entirely, while others wanted full funding. Orchard was a rural populist, on the right-wing of the Progressive Conservative Party. In 2003, he supported cooperation between the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the Portage‚ÄîLisgar riding, before the two parties were formally merged.

It is named for Marine Major General \\"Red Mike\\" Edson, \\"a World War II Medal of Honor recipient and a distinguished small arms marksman proponent.\\" This rifle- qualification complex is home to four of the largest firing ranges on the base. The range became operational on August 21, 1964, the same day that Camp Calvin B. Matthews, in La Jolla, Calif., was closed and turned over to the University of California. Camp Matthews had previously been used for rifle training. While located at Camp Pendleton, Edson Range is organized as an annex of the MCRD (Marine Corps Recruit Depot), in San Diego and serves as the rifle qualification range where Marine recruits receive field and rifle training during boot camp. Two weeks of marksmanship training followed by one week of infantry field skills take place at Edson Range, which is known as \\"up north\\" by recruits and drill instructors alike (the Recruit Depot in San Diego being \\"down south\\"). The Crucible, a three- to four-day combat simulation with little food or sleep, also takes place here. Edson Range is also home to the \\"Swift Intruders\\", the U.S. Navy's Assault Craft Unit 5 who operate the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and train on the Edson Range beaches and the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Recruit live fire training Marine recruits undertake two different courses of fire while learning how to use the M16 series rifle. During their first week of weapons training (known as Grass Week), recruits learn in a classroom setting with instruction coming from a PMI (Primary Marksmanship Instructor). On the second week (known as Firing Week), recruits will go to one of the three KD (known distance) ranges to fire Table 1A, their first course of fire. The three live fire ranges aboard Edson Range where Table 1 is fired are the \\"world famous\\" Bravo Range, Charlie Range, and Delta Range. The week after qualifying on Table 1 is spent on Alpha Range where the recruits will fire Table 2, which is the introduction to the Marine Corps' Combat Marksmanship Program. See also *Camp Calvin B.

The name comes from the addressable graph model XDI uses: every node in the XDI graph is its own RDF graph that is uniquely addressable. Background The main features of XDI are: the ability to link and nest RDF graphs to provide context; full addressability of all nodes in the graph at any level of context; representation of XDI operations as graph statements so authorization can be built into the graph; a standard JSON serialization format; and a simple ontology language for defining shared semantics using XDI dictionary services. The XDI protocol is based on an exchange of XDI messages which themselves are XDI graphs. Since the semantics of each message is fully contained within the XDI graph of that message, the XDI protocol can be bound to multiple transport protocols. The XDI TC is defining bindings to HTTP and HTTPS, however it is also exploring bindings to XMPP and potentially directly to TCP/IP. XDI also provides a standardized portable authorization format called XDI link contracts. Link contracts are XDI subgraphs that express the permissions that one XDI actor (person, organization, or thing) grants to another for access to and usage of an XDI data graph. XDI link contracts enable these permissions to be expressed in a standard machine-readable format understood by any XDI endpoint. This approach to globally distributed data sharing models the real-world mechanisms of social contracts and legal contracts that bind civilized people and organizations in the world today. Thus XDI can be a key enabler of a distributed Social Web. It has also been cited as a mechanism to support a new legal concept, Virtual Rights , which are based on a new legal entity, the \\"virtual identity\\", and a new fundamental right: \\"to have or not to have virtual identities\\". Public services based on the OASIS XDI specification are under development by an international non- profit organization, XDI.org.

In 2018 the Press Freedom Index ranked Australia 19th out of 180 countries, although by 2020 Australia's ranking had somewhat declined to 26th out of 180 countries. Mass media is delivered in a variety of formats including radio, television, paper, internet and IPTV. Varieties include local, regional, state, federal and international sources of media, reporting on Australian news, opinion, policy, issues and culture.  Television  = Free-to-air TV = : New South Wales and Victoria were introduced to television in 1956, with the other states and territories following suit up to 1971 (the Northern Territory). Colour television was introduced in 1975. In addition to the public broadcasters which are available to almost all of Australia's population, there are three major commercial television networks: the Nine Network, the Seven Network and Network Ten. Most of Australia's heavily populated cities are serviced by all three networks. Some rural or regional areas may receive a more limited selection, often with some of the channels available showing programming from more than one of the major networks. An example of such a \\"shared\\" regional network is Imparja. Digital free-to-air broadcasts commenced on 1 January 2001. Analogue broadcasts were originally intended to be phased out by 2008, however analogue phaseout was not achieved until 2013. After heated debate in the early 2000s over a Bill that would have removed the foreign ownership restrictions of broadcasting TV licences, the Australian government chose to retain the foreign-ownership restrictions in its 1992 Broadcasting Act. The Howard Government was set to remove this law sometime in 2007, having gained parliamentary approval to change the legislation in 2006. In 2007, with Helen Coonan as communications minister, there were two significant changes. Foreign ownership limits were scrapped, government changed the cross-media ownership rules to allow ownership of two out of three media types. = Pay TV = Approximately 25% of Australian households had access to pay television services by the end of 2005. The main provider is Foxtel in both metropolitan, regional and rural areas offering nearly all Australian channels via cable & satellite TV in capital cities, and mostly the same channels are offered by Foxtel via satellite TV (predominantly) in regional areas with the recent merger with Austar in 2012. In mid-2016 the number of Australians with access to some form of Pay TV outstripped those with without. At the end of 2019 14.5 million Australians had access to some form of Pay TV or Subscription TV, with the combined audience of these platforms equalling almost 70% of the population. Netflix remains the market leader, although Foxtel and Stan have gained continual growth since entering the market. There are several smaller competitors offer a subset of channels ‚Äì with Fetch TV entering the market in 2010 with a subscription service over a few ADSL2+ networks, and TransACT offering TV via its own VDSL, VDSL2 and FTTP/FTTH networks in Canberra and its Neighbourhood Cable network in parts of Victoria. Other providers of Internet television in Australia offer free content or PPV, but don't offer a subscription product. UBI World TV offers a number of ethnic satellite TV and Radio channels nationwide, and other small companies offer some channels via satellite, especially foreign services or free-to-air channels, and some channels are available over the Internet.  Newspapers and news websites  There are 2 national and 10 state/territory daily newspapers, 37 regional dailies and 470 other regional and suburban newspapers. Nearly all major newspapers are owned either by News Corp Australia (formerly News Limited) or Nine Entertainment Co (formerly Fairfax Media). The national daily newspaper of record is The Australian. Also with nationwide circulation is The Australian Financial Review, the most prominent financial newspaper. Other notable newspapers and news websites are: news.com.au, ABC News Online, The Age, Seven News Online, SBS News Online, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Daily Telegraph, the Herald Sun, Nine News, the Guardian Australia, The Saturday Paper and The Spectator.  Radio  Australia's first regular radio broadcasts began on 13 November 1923 with station 2SB (later to become 2BL) in Sydney. The ABC began broadcasting in 1932. Talkback radio was first broadcast with 2UE in Sydney, just after midnight on 17 April 1967. ABC began experimenting with FM stations in the 1960s, but it wasn't until July 1980 that the first FM station commenced full operations. Melbourne-based 3EON (now known as 3MMM) was the first to air. In 2009, there were 274 operational commercial stations (funded by advertising) and 341 community (publicly funded) radio stations.Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Updated: 3/5/10 National news radio broadcasters include the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which operates 4 national radio news networks (including ABC News Radio and ABC Radio National), 53 local news stations through ABC Local Radio and several digital radio stations; and the Special Broadcasting Service which also delivers multilingual Australian- produced news content.  Regulation  Regulation of the media is principally assured by the Australian Government through its power to make laws governing telecommunications. The Australian states and territories also have important roles in this area, notably in the area of defamation law, although their laws may not conflict with a valid federal law. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is the broadcasting regulator for radio and television in Australia, and also the co-regulatory Online Content Scheme. Consumers who have complaints about programs on television and radio or certain types of content on the Internet can apply to the ACMA. The Commercial Television Code of Practice is a set of regulatory guidelines, registered with the ACMA, with which commercial television broadcasters should comply. The Australian Press Council is the self-regulatory body of the print media. The Council deals with complaints from the public about editorial material in newspapers and magazines published in Australia, and aims to maintain the freedom of the press.  Media ownership  Controls over media ownership in Australia are laid down in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, administered by the ACMA. Even with laws in place Australia has a high concentration of media ownership compared to other western countries. Ownership of national and the newspapers of each capital city are dominated by two corporations, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, (which was founded in Adelaide but is now based from the United States) and Nine Entertainment ‚Äì Murdoch-owned titles account for nearly two-thirds (64.2 per cent) of metropolitan circulationCalculated from circulation figures of metropolitan newspapers quoted in Wikipedia. and Nine-owned papers account for a further quarter (26.4 per cent). News Corp, Nine and Seven West Media co-own Australian Associated Press (AAP) which distributes the news and then sells it on to other outlets such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Although much of the everyday mainstream news is drawn from the AAP, all the privately owned media outlets still compete with each other for exclusive pop culture news. Rural and regional media is dominated by Australian Community Media (formerly Rural Press), with significant holdings in all states and territories. Rural Press received a takeover offer from John Fairfax Holdings in late 2006, and completed the merger on 8 May 2007.Rural Press, Fairfax officially merged, The Age, 9 May 2007. There are rules governing foreign ownership of Australian media and these rules were loosened by Helen Coonan under the Howard Government via Act No. 129 of 2006 which allowed for changes to the cross-media and foreign ownership laws with the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006 . These changes came into effect in 2007 and are still in Force. The changes relaxed restrictions against cross-media ownership & control by a single company. According to Reporters Without Borders in 2006, Australia was in 35th position on a list of countries ranked by Press Freedom; well behind New Zealand (19th) and United Kingdom (27th) (but well ahead of the US, ranked 53rd). This ranking was primarily due to the restrictions imposed by the recent anti-terrorism laws. The problem, and the concentration of media ownership, was one of many mentioned on the television show Media Watch, broadcast on the government funded ABC. As of 2018 these rankings have changed with Australia moving up to 19th, New Zealand moving up to 8th and the United Kingdom falling to 40th.https://rsf.org/en/ranking#  Media freedom  On 4 June 2019 the Australian Federal Police conducted a raid on the home of News Corp journalist, Annika Smethurst's home looking for information connected to a story she had written a years earlier about new laws that would give the security forces new powers for surveillance over Australian citizens. Radio host, Ben Fordham also claimed that he was under investigation for some of his reporting. The next day the police raided the ABC over a story about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The search warrant allowed the police to \\"add, copy, delete or alter\\" any files they found on the computers. The incidents caused an outcry of condemnation, even from the Reporters Without Borders, BBC and The New York Times.https://www.sbs.com.au/news/world-media-condemns-australian-federal- police-raids-targeting-journalists In Australia itself, newspaper outlets normally driven by partisanship and advertising exhibited a surprisingly united show of protest on 21 October as they published front pages with the appearance of documents having been blacked out by government censors. The protest demanded journalists gain access to sensitive government material. Most of the larger media outlets formed a coalition, Right To Know, to represent the protest and demand six changes in legislation. The demands are, for the ability to contest any search warrant of a journalist or news entity while the search warrant is under request, reform of whistleblower protection, new limitations on which documents may be classified as secret, changes in freedom of information, exemption from national security laws enacted over the previous seven years, and reforms of defamation laws.  Netflix  Netflix was released in Australia and New Zealand 24 March 2015. This was long- awaited, the company being established in the US state of California in 1997. As of December 2019, 11.9 million Australians (57% of the population) had a Netflix subscription in their household, up 15% on a year before that. Compared to usage in the United States, Netflix in Australia is quite prominent. The US has an estimated 60 million Netflix subscribers as of 2020. That comes down to an estimated 28% of US adults currently subscribing to Netflix. It may be worthwhile to note, however, that Netflix now combines the US and Canada into its regional subscriber count totals. The conundrum of Netflix In Australia is that it's a highly popular service that contributes little to the domestic economy. Since the companies Netflix disrupts in Australia - pay TV provider Foxtel and the free to air TV networks - all face local content requirements, there is speculation a federal government review might recommend something similar for the streaming platform. While Australians were once able to enjoy 30 days of free Netflix that's no longer the case. Netflix removed the free trial in March 2020. However, China and the United States are still eligible. Netflix costs $9.99 AUD for the basic package, and $13.99 for the Standard package. Resolution differs from SD to HD for the two. For the basic package, only one simultaneous stream is allowed, verses two for the standard package.

Hongisto (December 16, 1936, Bovey, Minnesota ‚Äì November 4, 2004, San Francisco, California) was a businessman, politician, sheriff and police chief of San Francisco, California, and Cleveland, Ohio. Early life and education Hongisto was the son of Gladys Longrie and Raymond Hongisto. In 1942, Dick moved to San Francisco with his parents and brother Don. Dick grew up in the Sunset District, where he graduated from George Washington High School. He later attended San Francisco City College. While completing a bachelor's degree at San Francisco State University, Hongisto became an officer of the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). Career =Early career= As a police officer, Hongisto earned a reputation for activism, fighting discrimination within the police force and against police brutality. He was a co-founder of Officers for Justice, an organization of officers who were primarily racial minorities or gay. Hongisto's activism made him controversial among the ranks of the SFPD, but at the same time he was a popular public figure. He ran for sheriff in 1971, and was elected ‚Äî an event that shocked the San Francisco political establishment. The incumbent, Matthew Carberry, had been a four-term sheriff, was well-connected politically, and had been considered a shoo-in for a return to the job. Hongisto's election had been orchestrated methodically by computer analyst Les Morgan, using the then- new idea of precinct analysis of voting trends. Hongisto was considered the first candidate for public office in San Francisco to be elected largely by outsiders: gay, Latino, and other minority voters who had a strong voting presence, but who had been ignored by the political establishment. He was the first sheriff to hire gay and lesbian deputies, and later became embroiled in controversy when he deliberately delayed the eviction of residents from the International Hotel, a residential hotel in Manilatown. International Hotel manager Joe Diones looks out at protesters protecting the hotel during an anti-eviction rally January 1977. After a long period where he refused to order the eviction, which included time spent in the San Mateo County jail on contempt of court charges, Hongisto eventually carried out the mass eviction, which earned him the enmity of some of the very people he tried to protect. =Cleveland= After serving as the sheriff in San Francisco, Hongisto briefly moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1977, where he served as police chief under Mayor Dennis Kucinich. His penchant for controversy, and conflicts with Kucinich, eventually led to his being fired by the mayor on live local television. In Cleveland his firing sparked a recall drive to remove Kucinich from office. =New York State= The Governor of the State of New York then invited Hongisto to manage that state's prison system. Hongisto accepted the challenge of reforming a system that had been plagued by riots and unrest within several of its facilities. Permanent appointment to this position required confirmation by the state senate, which was not forthcoming. Hongisto therefore returned to San Francisco to run for Supervisor in 1980. =Return to San Francisco= Upon his return to San Francisco, Hongisto was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where he helped to place Proposition M, a measure which would limit construction of high rise commercial buildings, on the public ballot. The measure passed overwhelmingly, and has to this day continued to impact the development of San Francisco's skyline. With the endorsement of then-Mayor Art Agnos, Hongisto later ran for the office of Assessor. In 1991, he ran for mayor but did not make the run-off, coming in fourth. After declining to endorse Agnos for re-election as mayor, in a race won by police chief Frank Jordan, Hongisto was appointed in 1992 by Jordan to be San Francisco's police chief. Hongisto's tenure as police chief lasted only six weeks, and was punctuated by controversy over his handling of demonstrations and riots which occurred in the wake of the Rodney King police brutality trial in Los Angeles. Hongisto cordoned off an entire neighborhood in the Mission district on a Saturday afternoon, establishing a net that saw the arrests of all people on the street, demonstrators and ordinary citizens alike. Hongisto had rented city buses to transport the arrested citizens, and they were processed at a warehouse on San Francisco's wharfs. Instead of merely citing and releasing those arrested, Hongisto ordered that they be arrested and processed at the Santa Rita jail in Dublin (Alameda County), rather than in San Francisco County, thus ensuring that they would not be able to avail themselves of their civil rights and return to San Francisco. This enraged progressive activists and civil libertarians as well as the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which ordered Hongisto to release the citizens he had arrested. On the following Saturday, Hongisto ordered police to disrupt another demonstration and arrested demonstrators with no order to disperse. Both incidences were later the targets of class action suits against the city of San Francisco, although the former, undertaken by the Lawyer's Guild, would not be resolved for nearly a decade. Soon thereafter, a gay and lesbian community newspaper, the San Francisco Bay Times, published a cover graphic of Hongisto's head pasted on the body of a lesbian activist. The activist, dressed in a police uniform, held a giant baton with one end protruding from the groin area as if it were an erect penis. The headline screamed, \\"Dick's Cool New Tool: Martial Law\\", in reference to the police actions. What happened afterwards is subject to dispute. Hongisto claimed that he had asked members of the police union to gather copies of the paper to show members of the rank and file what he was enduring in the activist press, in reaction to their criticism of his supposedly failing to properly defend their conduct of the arrests during the King riots. Around 2,000 copies of the free papers were taken from news racks by three officers and later found stored at the Mission District police station. Hongisto was publicly accused of ordering the confiscation of the papers in attempt at censorship, a charge he continued to deny up to his death. After a hearing, which many considered to be highly politicized, the San Francisco Police Commission found him culpable, and Mayor Jordan dismissed him. One of those three officers, Gary Delagnes, is now president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Later years Hongisto left public life to become a full-time businessman and real estate investor, apart from an unsuccessful run for County Supervisor in 2000. Hongisto died of a heart attack on November 4, 2004, at the age of 67, leaving behind a son and daughter. He married four times, and was living with a 31-year-old girlfriend at the time of his death.

The \\"Autonomy\\" covered the area of eight raions (the present-day Brasovsky, Dmitriyevsky, Dmitrovsky, Komarichsky, Navlinsky, Sevsky, Suzemsky and Zheleznogorsky districts) now divided between Bryansk, Oryol and Kursk Oblasts.Cf.

History = Foundation = In October 1941, the Nazi German military advanced into the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, reached the Lokot area near the city of Bryansk, and it was captured by the Germans on October 6, 1941. In November 1941 Bronislav Kaminski (an engineer at a local distillery) and Konstantin Voskoboinik (a local technical school teacher) were approached by the German military administration with proposals to assist them in establishing a civil administration and local police. Voskoboinik was designated by Germans as starosta of the \\"Lokot volost\\". Kaminski became Voskoboinik's deputy. Other deputies appointed were Stepan Mosin and Roman Ivanin (the head of the local militia), both former prisoners.–ï—Ä–º–æ–ª–æ–≤ –ò., –î—Ä–æ–±—è–∑–∫–æ –°. –ê–Ω—Ç–∏–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞. ‚Äì –ú., 2001 1. –û–∫–∫—É–ø–∞—Ü–∏—è –û—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –õ–æ–∫–æ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–º–æ—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è = Militia = Initially the militia headed by Voskoboinik numbered no more than 200 men.

During a partisan attack headed by Alexander Saburov on January 8, 1942, Voskoboinik was fatally wounded. After his death, Kaminski took over the command and further expanded the militia. In cooperation with German forces, the militia commenced security operations, and by spring of 1942, the militia had 1,400 armed personnel. The number of Soviet partisans in this area was estimated at 20,000 men ‚Äì they controlled almost the entire rear of the Army Group Centre's area of operations.Edgar Howell: The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941-1944, p. 99 In March 1942 Kaminski's representative to the German 2nd Panzer Army in Oryol gave assurances that Kaminski's unit was \\"ready to actively fight the guerrillas\\" and to carry on a propaganda campaign against \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\" and Soviet partisans. Soon thereafter the commander of 2nd Army Generaloberst Rudolf Schmidt appointed Kaminski as the mayor of the Kor√ºck 532 centered in the township of Lokot. On 19 July 1942, after the Commander of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge gave an official approval, the Lokot administration received some degree of autonomy and nominal self-rule under the supervision of major von Veltheim and colonel R√ºbsam. Kaminsky was appointed the oberburgomeister of the Autonomous Administration of Lokot (comprising eight raions) and the brigadier of the local militia. From June 1942, Kaminski's militia took part in a major security operation code-named Operation Vogelsang, as part of General Werner von Gilsa's Kampfgruppe (battle group) Gilsa II. Germans did not interfere in the affairs of the Lokot Autonomy as long as their transports were kept safe and the republic delivered the required food quotas to the Wehrmacht. Collective farms were abolished, and a large degree of free enterprise was permitted. Kaminski established the Autonomy's own court, jails and newspapers. Kaminski's speeches published in the newspapers of the region emphasised that the aims of Nazi Germany and Russia \\"are the same\\". The schools (closed after the German invasion) were reopened, and a radio station along with theater groups were established in Lokot, Dmitrovsk and Sevsk –ï—Ä–º–æ–ª–æ–≤ –ò., –î—Ä–æ–±—è–∑–∫–æ –°. –ê–Ω—Ç–∏–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞. ‚Äì –ú., 2001. Newspapers published in the Lokot Autonomy were typical of all newspapers published on Nazi-occupied Russian territories, featuring articles exposing Judeo-Bolshevik crimes along with Nazi propaganda which included the usual heavy dose of antisemitism.

Streets in other townships of the Autonomy were also renamed. In the autumn of 1942, Kaminski ordered the compulsory draft into militia of all able-bodied men. Its units were reinforced with the \\"volunteers\\" drafted from Soviet POWs at the nearest Nazi concentration camps. Kaminski ordered the gathering of Soviet tanks and armored cars abandoned in 1941 due to the lack of fuel or minor mechanical failures ‚Äì by November 1942 his unit has in possession at least two BT-7 tanks and one 76 mm artillery gun. Due to the lack of uniforms and boots (some units were barefoot) the Germans provided Kaminski's brigade with used uniforms: these were sufficient for only four battalions. By late 1942, the militia of the Lokot Autonomy had expanded to the size of a 14-battalion brigade with close to 8,000 men under arms called the Russian National Liberation Army (RONA). From November 19, 1942, to December 1942, Lokot was inspected by the order of the Alfred Rosenberg. In January 1943, the brigade numbered 9,828 people; the armored unit of brigade had (in total 11 vehicles): * one heavy KV-2, * two medium T-34, * three BT-7, * two BT-5 light tanks, * three armored cars (BA-10, two BA-20). In the spring of 1943, the brigade's structure was reorganized ‚Äì there were five regiments created with three battalions in each, anti-aircraft battalion (three AA guns and four heavy machine guns), armored unit. A separate \\"guard\\" battalion was created; brigade strength was estimated to be 12,000 men in total. Prior to Operation Citadel, the massive offensive to destroy the Kursk salient, in May‚ÄìJune 1943 the brigade took part in Operation Zigeunerbaron (\\"Gypsy Baron\\") together with other German units. This operation was followed by similar operations, such as Freisch√ºtz and Tannh√§user, in which the brigade together with other units under German command was involved in action against partisans and also took part in reprisal operations against the civilian population. In the summer of 1943, the brigade began to suffer major desertions, due in part to the recent Soviet victories and in part to the efforts of the partisans to \\"turn\\" as many of Kaminski's troops as possible. As a part of these efforts, several attempts on Kaminski's life were carried out. Each time, Kaminski narrowly avoided death and punished the conspirators with execution. Several German officers passing through Lokot reported seeing bodies hanging from gallows outside Kaminski's headquarters. Fearing a breakdown in command, a German liaison staff was attached to Kaminski's HQ to restructure the brigade and return stability to the unit. After the German failure of Citadel, the Soviet counteroffensives forced the brigade, along with their families, to flee with the retreating Germans. On the 29th of July, 1943 Kaminski issued an order for evacuation of property and families of RONA brigade and Lokot authorities. Up to 30 thousand persons (10-11,000 of them were brigade members) were transferred by Germans to the Lepel area of Vitebsk in Belarus by end of August 1943. By September 1943, the force had 10,000 men, divided into: * 5 infantry regiments, each of 3 battalions, * one artillery battalion (36 field guns), * and an armour unit of 24 captured Soviet tanks and armoured vehicles, * in addition to engineer, signal and medical units. According to possibly unreliable post-war Soviet estimates up to 10,000 civilians were killed during the existence of the Kaminski \\"Autonomy\\". Armed Forces RONA shoulder patches The republic had its own armed forces: the Russian National Liberation Army, RONA (not to be confused with the Russian Liberation Army, ROA). \\"Lepel republic\\" From the end of August 1943 Kaminski tried to set up a new \\"Lepel Republic\\" in the Lepel area, which met with strong opposition from the local population. This area was overrun by partisans, and the brigade was involved in heavy combat in this area for the rest of the year. During the retreat, desertions from the brigade increased greatly, and the entire formation seemed close to disintegration. When the commander of the 2nd Regiment, Major Tarasov, decided to join the partisans with all of his regiment (he was offered amnesty if his entire regiment joined the partisans), Kaminski flew to his headquarters and according to one account, strangled him and eight others in front of his men. Despite this up to 200 people deserted within two days. By the beginning of October 1943 the brigade lost 2/3 of its previous personnel number. On January 27, 1944, Heinrich Himmler decorated Kaminski with the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Iron Cross 1st Class on the same day. On February 15, 1944, Kaminski issued an order to relocate the brigade and Lokot administration further west to the Dyatlovo area in West Belarus. War crimes The Jewish population of the area was completely massacred by the auxiliary police.

After the war After the end of World War II in Europe some of the former RONA and Lokot personnel were repatriated by the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. At the end of 1946 the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced Yury Frolov, Stepan Mosin and several others to death. In the 1950s and 1960s several other former officials of the Autonomy were apprehended by the KGB; some of them were also sentenced to death, most notably the Lokot Autonomy's executioner Antonina Makarova- Ginzburg, found in 1978 and sentenced to death.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–Ω—ã –ú–∞–∫–∞—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π- –ì–∏–Ω–∑–±—É—Ä–≥ Cultural references Anatoli Ivanov portrayed the Lokot Republic in his novel Eternal Call () and the corresponding TV sequel, which was popular in the Soviet Union.

History The company was established in 1946 as the Kasuga Radio Co. Ltd. in Komagane City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. In 1960, the company was renamed Trio Corporation. In 1963, the first overseas office was founded in Los Angeles County, California, USA.Kenwood Corporation / Company History In the early 1960s, Trio's products were rebranded by the Lafayette Radio Company, with a focus on citizens' band radio. An importer of Japanese-made electronics RadioShack was A&A; Trading Co., and a bilingual Japanese-speaking manager from there, William \\"Bill\\" Kasuga partnered with George Aratani and Yoichi Nakase to establish a company that would be the exclusive importer of Trio products.\\"Entrepreneur Bill Kasuga Courage Helped Him Bring Music To The Public's Ears\\", by Patrick Seitz, Investor's Business Daily, 3/21/2011 (alternate link: ) The name Kenwood was invented by Kasuga as being the combination of \\"Ken\\", a name common to Japan and North America that had been tested and proven acceptable to American consumers in the name of Kenmore appliances, and \\"Wood\\", referring to the durable substance as well as suggesting a relation to Hollywood, California. The brand recognition of Kenwood eventually surpassed that of Trio, and in 1986 Trio bought Kenwood and renamed itself Kenwood. George Aratani was the first chairman of Kenwood USA Corporation and succeeded by Kasuga. In October 2008, Kenwood merged with JVC to form new holding company, named as JVCKenwood.

In 2007, Kenwood discontinued its line of consumer audio receivers, home theater systems and other home electronics. Today, products marketed by the company to consumer and commercial audiences fall within the home audio, car audio aftermarket and OEM, in car entertainment, amateur radio, professional two-way radio and DECT wireless intercom sectors. Products  =Amateur radio transceivers= Kenwood has offered lines of HF, VHF/UHF, and portable amateur radio models, including some with built-in digital data modes (Automatic Packet Reporting System, built on AX.25 packet radio) and modems needed to send and receive these protocols. =KA Series hi-fi systems= Kenwood's series of \\"Integrated Amplifier\\" stereo power amplifiers, launched in 1977 and produced through the mid-1980s. The design for most of these items features a true dual-mono path for stereo output (in other words, no electrical components are shared between left- and right-channel amplification). Front plates were typically made in brushed aluminum with aluminum knobs and switches, glass covers, and in some cases analog VU meters. Amplifiers in this series included (in no particular order) * KA-1000 (11/1980) * KA-2000 * KA-2002 (09/1970) * KA-2200 (10/1982) * KA-3100 * KA-6100 (1977) * KA-7002 (1971) * KA-7100 (10/1976) * KA-7300 (10/1975) * KA-8100 / KA-8150 (06/1977) * KA-8300 (with analog meters vs. 8100) * KA-9100 * KA-900 (11/1980) * KA-907 / KA-9900 (10/1978) * KA-9100 / KA-9150 (1977) * KA-6100 / (1978/9) =NV Series hi-fi systems= These were a series of mini hi-fi systems launched in 2000, featuring a new design aesthetic. ;NV-301/701 The NV-301 and NV-701 both shared a three-layered half- mirrored design with the main difference lying in the specification of the two systems. The NV-301 was the basic model with two speakers and with a phono input (marked for MiniDisc and DVD players) while the NV-701 was a 5.1 Dolby surround sound model with A/V inputs. Both featured a three-disc carousel, a cassette player with Dolby B noise reduction, a natural display, intelligent features and the ability to save up to 40 radio stations, utilising microcomputers to reduce the size of the unit. =Communications equipment= Kenwood is a brand of JVCKENWOOD Corporation making two-way radios including wireless DECT intercom systems, PMR446, dPMR446, dPMR, P25, DMR and NXDN.

The preceding Johnson solid, the snub disphenoid also fits constructionally as ss{2,4}, but one has to retain two degenerate digonal faces (drawn in red) in the digonal antiprism. { class=wikitable + Snub antiprisms - !Symmetry !D2d, [2+,4], (2*2) !D3d, [2+,6], (2*3) !D4d, [2+,8], (2*4) !D5d, [2+,10], (2*5) - align=center !Antiprisms 70px s{2,4} A2 (v:4; e:8; f:6) 80px s{2,6} A3 (v:6; e:12; f:8) 80px s{2,8} A4 (v:8; e:16; f:10) 80px s{2,10} A5 (v:10; e:20; f:12) - align=center !Truncated antiprisms 80px ts{2,4} tA2 (v:16;e:24;f:10) 80px ts{2,6} tA3 (v:24; e:36; f:14) 80px ts{2,8} tA4 (v:32; e:48; f:18) 80px ts{2,10} tA5 (v:40; e:60; f:22) - !Symmetry !D2, [2,2]+, (222) !D3, [3,2]+, (322) !D4, [4,2]+, (422) !D5, [5,2]+, (522) - !rowspan=3Snub antiprisms !J84 !Icosahedron !J85 !Concave - align=center  sY3 = HtA3 sY4 = HtA4 sY5 = HtA5 - align=center 50px ss{2,4} (v:8; e:20; f:14) 80px ss{2,6} (v:12; e:30; f:20) 80px ss{2,8} (v:16; e:40; f:26) 80px ss{2,10} (v:20; e:50; f:32) } References External links * Category:Johnson solids ","title":"Snub square antiprism"},{"id":"1133927","text":"The BRDM-2 (Boyevaya Razvedyvatelnaya Dozornaya Mashina, –ë–æ–µ–≤–∞—è –†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥—ã–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –î–æ–∑–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞, literally \\"Combat Reconnaissance/Patrol Vehicle\\") is an amphibious armoured patrol car used by Russia and the former Soviet Union. It was also known under the designations BTR-40PB, BTR-40P-2 and GAZ 41-08. This vehicle, like many other Soviet designs, has been exported extensively and is in use in at least 38 countries. It was intended to replace the earlier BRDM-1, compared to which it had improved amphibious capabilities and better armament. History After a few years of use by the Soviet Army, the limitations and drawbacks of the BRDM-1 became obvious. The vehicle had no turret and to operate the armament the gunner had to open a hatch and expose himself to enemy fire. The vehicle was not fitted with an NBC protection system, and had no night vision equipment by default. The vehicle also lacked any kind of special sights, which undermined its usability as a reconnaissance vehicle. These drawbacks encouraged the design team to create a new vehicle which would suit the modern battlefield. Construction Polish BRDM-2 crossing a trench with the use of its belly wheels. Swimming Polish BRDM-2. Notice the raised trim board in the front of the vehicle and opened air inlets. Two Polish BRDM-2s on the move. Notice the shutters over the bulletproof windows and opened air inlets. The triangular cover for the water jet on the rear of this East German BRDM-2 has been opened to prepare for water jet propulsion. Polish BRDM-2. Notice the opened shutters, an IR spotlight, left hand side firing port, side TNP-A periscopes and a trim board in the front of the vehicle in its traveling position, as well as the small auxiliary wheels in their lowered position. These were intended to prevent the vehicle from becoming \\"high centered\\", or hung up on an obstacle, when traversing a trench or earthwork. The chain drive also turned the vehicle into an 8x8 after a fashion when crossing deep mud, providing more traction than the four main wheels alone could. The BRDM-2 has a crew of four: a driver, a co-driver, a commander, and a gunner. It has two pairs of chain-driven belly wheels lowered by the driver, which allow trench crossing just like its predecessor, and a centralized tire pressure regulation system, which can be used to adjust the tire pressure of all four tires or individual tires while the vehicle is in motion to suit to the ground conditions. Externally, it differs from the BRDM-1 by having a larger, box-like hull. It retains the boat-like bow of the BRDM-1. However, the crew compartment is now further forward and the new GAZ-41 gasoline V-8 engine is in the rear. Thanks to this, the engine is much better protected from enemy fire. The engine compartment is also separated from the crew compartment by an armoured barrier. The driver's and commander's stations are in the front of the vehicle, with the driver positioned on the left and commander on the right. Both of them sit in front of a bulletproof windscreen, which provides them with their primary view of the battlefield. When in combat, the windscreen can be additionally protected by twin armoured shutters. When the shutters are in their opened position, they protect the driver and commander from being blinded by the sunlight and ensure that the windscreen won't be blurred by rain or snow. The commander and driver have periscopes allowing both of them a more detailed view of the surrounding terrain. The commander has six TNP-A periscopes (five in the front and one on the side of the vehicle), a TPKU-2B day sight and a TKN-1 night sight(night-vision device). The driver has four TNP-A periscopes (all in the front), one of which can be replaced by a TWN-2B night-vision device. The gunner is in the turret during combat, but when traveling he is seated inside the hull. The crew mounts and dismounts the vehicle via two hatches over driver's and commander's stations. On either side of the hull adjacent to the crew position, there is a firing port. Immediately behind the firing port there are three TNP-A periscopes, which protrude from the outside of the hull, giving the crew some vision to the front and rear of the vehicle. The engine is larger than the BRDM's (it is a 140 hp V-8 instead of a 90 hp 6-cylinder). The BRDM-2 has an IR spotlight and four IR driving lights, as well as an over pressure collective NBC filter system. The IR spotlight is located on top of the commander's periscope. The vehicle also has an R-123 radio and an antenna on the right side of the hull next to the commander's hatch, for communication. There's also a winch mounted internally at the front hull that has a 30 m cable and a 4 tonne capacity. The winch is intended to be used, among others, for self-recovery when stuck in difficult terrain. A spare tire can be mounted on top of the turret. This was most often practiced by Polish crews. Like its predecessor, the BRDM-2 is amphibious. The GAZ-41 gasoline V-8 engine supplies power to the circular water-jet, equipped with a four-bladed propeller at the rear of the vehicle, which is covered with an armoured shutter while on land. This shutter must be removed before entering water. The water-jet allows amphibious travel with a speed of 10 km/h for 17 to 19 hours. A trim board, which is stowed under the nose of the hull when traveling, is erected at the front of the hull before entering the water to improve the vehicle's stability and displacement in the water and to prevent the water from flooding the bow of the BRDM-2. While in its traveling position, it serves as additional armour. =Armament= Polish BRDM-2 aiming its machine guns. Notice the shutters over the bulletproof windows and the trim board in the front of the vehicle in its traveling position. The armament is the same as the BTR-60PB armoured personnel carrier; a 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun with a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine gun as a secondary weapon, both in a small conical BPU-1 turret mounted on the hull in a central position above the belly wheels. The 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun has a practical rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute and a cyclic rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute. It has an effective range during daylight operations of 2,000 m. It can penetrate 20 mm of armour at a range of 1,000 m and 30 mm of armour at a range of 500 m. It can also fire at air targets, in which case the tactical range is 1,400 m. It uses the 14.5 mm API-T, 14.5 mm I-T, 14.5 mm HE-T, 14.5 mm and MDZ type ammunition. The 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun has an effective range during day time operations of 1,000 m while the vehicle is stationary and from 400 m to 500 m while the vehicle is on the move. It is fired in 2 to 10 round bursts and has a practical rate of fire of 250 rounds per minute and a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. During daylight operations, the gunner uses the PP-61AM sight, which has a field of view of 23 degrees and x2.6 magnification. The BPU-1 turret is unusual because it has no top hatch opening. Contrary to the popular belief, the BPU-1 turret was originally designed for the BRDM-2. The turret was later used in the Soviet BTR-60PB, the Polish SKOT-2A and the Czechoslovak OT-64A. The turret allows the armament to be elevated between ‚àí5 and +30 degrees. On the left side of the turret, there is an air inlet on the hull top. There are also two air-inlet louvers in the forward part of the engine compartment's roof and four smaller air-inlet louvers to the rear. Both sides have centrally placed vision blocks. The vehicle armor, which is composed of welded steel, protects it fully against small arms fire and small shell fragments; but doesn't protect it against big artillery fragments or .50-calibre machine gun fire, which can penetrate the BRDM-2's maximum armor of 14 mm. The BRDM-2-series tires are not protected by armour and are particularly vulnerable to puncture from fire of all kinds. There are three different production lots, which have different cooling vents on the engine deck. The late production version has mushroom-type vents. It also has slightly modified turret and can elevate its armament to +60 degrees. Final production BRDM-2s have additional turret periscopes and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus. =Variants= rightthumb200x200pxBRDM-2 Anti-tank version BRDM-2 has flaws that are also apparent in other Soviet vehicles. These include the poor ergonomic design, low level of crew protection and high fuel consumption. The ergonomics was addressed in the Polish BRDM-2M-96 modernization and its successors, the BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-96ik \\"Szakal\\", BRDM-2M-96ik \\"Szakal Plus\\", BRDM-2M-97 \\"≈ªbik-B\\", BRDM-2M-97C \\"≈ªbik-P\\" and BRDM-2M-98 \\"≈ªbik-A\\", which all had the belly wheels removed, thus providing more space for the crew or space for two soldiers. This was also carried out in Morozov's BRDM-2SMD. The BRDM-2 has a unique flaw. Because the only way in and out of the vehicle is via the front hatches, leaving the vehicle while in combat is almost impossible, as the exiting crew members would instantly enter the line of fire of both the enemy and its own vehicle, as hatches are positioned directly in front of the turret. This shortcoming was addressed in the Polish BRDM-2M-96 modernization and its successors, the BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-96ik \\"Szakal\\", BRDM-2M-96ik \\"Szakal Plus\\", BRDM-2M-97 \\"≈ªbik-B\\", BRDM-2M-97C \\"≈ªbik-P\\" and BRDM-2M-98 \\"≈ªbik-A\\", all of which have side hatches. This was also done in the Czech LOT-B and OKV-P as well as the Ukrainian BRDM-2SMD. The Polish BRDM-2M-97 \\"≈ªbik-B\\", BRDM-2M-97C \\"≈ªbik-P\\" and BRDM-2M-98 \\"≈ªbik-A\\" also have a hatch on the top of the turret, giving the crew another way out. The BRDM-2's predecessor, BRDM-1, did not have that issue as the BRDM-1 obr. 1957 had no roof and later models had a rear hatch that allowed the crew to exit the vehicle from behind. The fact that the BRDM-2 is missing such a hatch is a consequence of putting the engine in the rear, unlike in BRDM-1 where the engine is in the front. The BRDM-2 is sometimes confused with the Hungarian D-442 FUG and D-944 PSzH amphibious scout cars, which also have rear-mounted engines. What distinguishes them from the BRDM-2 is that they have twin waterjets, whereas the BRDM-2 has a single triangular water jet. Service history =Soviet Union and Russia= The BRDM-2 entered service with the Soviet Army in 1962. It was first publicly shown in 1966. It replaced the BRDM-1 in the Soviet and Warsaw Pact armies. Production started in 1962 and went on until 1989, with 7,200 vehicles produced (mostly for export). The BRDM-2 became famous for being the vehicle selected to pull the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's coffin during the funeral ceremony in the Red Square. =Poland= Two BRDM-2M-97 \\"≈ªbik-B\\" armoured scout cars on a military parade in Krak√≥w, 17 May 2008 Poland bought 450 BRDM-2 armoured scout cars, 418 9P133 \\"Malyutka\\" and 9P148 \\"Konkurs\\" tank destroyers and 32 BRDM-2RS NBC reconnaissance vehicles in 1965. Later, Poland obtained some 9P31 Surface-to- air missile launchers. In 2004, the Polish Army operated 600 BRDM-2 armoured scout cars and vehicles based on it. Currently, the Polish Army operates 200 BRDM-2s, 120 BRDM-2s modernized to BRDM-2M-96, BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-97 \\"≈ªbik-B\\" and BRDM-2M-98 \\"≈ªbik-A\\" level, 12 BRDM-2s modernized to BRDM-2M-96ik \\"Szakal\\" level, 100 9P133 \\"Malyutka\\" and 18 9P148 \\"Konkurs\\" tank destroyers, 12 BRDM-2RS NBC reconnaissance vehicles, an unknown number of 9K31 Strela-1 self-propelled surface-to-air missile launchers as well as BRDM-2 R-1A and BRDM-2 R-5 command vehicles.2 .

All modernizations, conversions and serious repairs of Polish BRDM-2s are done by WZM in Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie. Modernized BRDM-2 armoured scout cars will serve with the Polish Army for at least a couple of years. The 9P133 \\"Malyutka\\" and 9P148 \\"Konkurs\\" tank destroyers, which are the basic equipment of anti-tank subunits of motorized brigades, are considered obsolete and therefore are to be replaced with ATGM launchers based on lighter vehicles, like the HMMWV, or heavier vehicles like the KTO Ry≈õ APC or KTO Rosomak AMV.

However, these are now back in Poland, as are the 12 vehicles used in Iraq. =Estonia= Around 10 BRDM-2s were taken over from the Soviet Army in the early 1990s. They were mostly used during infantry training for posing as the enemy armour. Also, the Estonian police used a specially modified BRDM-2 (See the Estonia section in the Variants section). All BRDM-2s have now been withdrawn from both the military and police service. =Ukraine= In ongoing Insurgency in Eastern Ukraine BRDM-2 and its several variants were used by both sides. On the morning of 13 June 2014, during the heavy fighting for retaking Mariupol the Azov Battalion, Dnipro-1 Battalion and National Guard retook the city and key buildings occupied by insurgents killing five militants and destroying an insurgent BRDM-2 armoured vehicle.First Battle of Mariupol = Syria = Syria received hundreds of BRDM-2, as well as specialized variants, BRDM-2 RKh (radiological-chemical recce), 9P122, 9P148 (both anti-tank missile carriers) and 9K31 Strela-1 (SAM version). BRDM-2 and 9P122s saw widespread service against Israel during the 1973 Kippur War. Israel managed to capture enough of them to use them with its own forces. Therefore, during the 1982 Lebanon War, both Israelis and Syrians deployed BRDM-2s. The Syrian Armed Forces used the BRDM-2s for security patrols during the Lebanon Civil War, the light vehicles proving themselves very suitable for this kind of missions. At the beginning of the 2010s, the BRDM-2s, thought to be unsuitable to modern combat against Israeli forces, were retired from service. They were mostly used as riot control vehicle during the 2011 protests that led to the Syrian Civil War. During this war, the BRDM-2s or 9P148s were rarely seen in action, most of the usage being local initiatives of governmental or rebel units. A few were modified by the Islamic State into VBIEDs while the Kurdish YPG, lacking armor, used all the vehicles they could. =Other operators= Armenian 9P148 Konkurs based on BRDM-2 during military parade in Yerevan Like all Soviet equipment, the BRDM-2 was also sold to many Arab and African countries. It is used by 38 armies. The BRDM-2's enjoyed popularity on the export market because it was cheap, easy to operate and reliable. These factors made the BRDM-2 a more popular export reconnaissance vehicle than the BRM-1K, which was much more expensive and complicated to operate. Two BRDM-2s were sold to Grenada and were lost in the Invasion of Grenada. One was destroyed in an engagement with American M60 Pattons and the second was captured. When the Soviet forces left Afghanistan, they abandoned many BRDM-2s. These vehicles, together with some derelict ones restored back to working state, are now used by the Afghan National Army. The BRDM-2 also saw service with the Iraqi Army during the First Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Soviet Union began supplying the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) with BRDM-2s shortly after Angolan independence. At least one fell victim to a rebel Panhard AML-90 crewed by South African advisers during Operation Savannah. BRDM-2 armoured scout cars were used by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) during the Ten-Day War as well as the initial operations in Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence. The BRDM-2 was also used by the Yugoslav Army (VJ) against the KLA during the Kosovo war. BRDM-2 armoured scout cars are used by Polish, Ukrainian and Russian units of the Kosovo Force. The Sudanese Armed Forces used several BRDM-2s during the Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile and at least 2 were captured by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North in December 2012.

The conical turret, which mounts two machine guns (14.5 mm and 7.62 mm), is unusual in that it has no top hatch opening. This model carries a crew of four: the commander, the gunner, the driver, and the co-gunner. It also has a land navigation system that gives co- ordinate readings. Late Production version had mushroom-type vents on top of engine compartment. Final production model had two additional turret periscopes, one on top of turret and the other one on the left hand side of the turret and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus.

The pole/flag dispensers are located on the rear corners of the vehicle's hull. The dispensers are normally covered with canvas and when required are positioned vertically over the rear of the vehicle. The specialized equipment consist of an automatic gas detector GSA-12, a dosimeter DP-5V, a r√∂ntgenmeter DP-3B, decontamination apparatus DK-4K and semi-automatic detection devices PPKhR and VPKhR. The vehicle retains the original armament. The regimental chemical defence platoon and the divisional-level chemical defence company use it, as the does divisional reconnaissance battalion.

The machine retained the ability to swim across water obstacles. Cruising range of 1,500 kilometers. The new fire control system has a stabilized three-channel panoramic commandier sight that can spot the enemy up to 5 km during the day and up to 3,5 km at night. For the all- round view, six cameras are mounted, allowing round-the-clock monitoring of the terrain on four multifunctional panels. *BRDM-2MB \\"Bekas\\" - In June 2020, B-ARMS company presented a new modernization of the BRDM-2 under the name BRDM-2MB Bekas. In fact, \\"Bekas\\" has become a modified version of the BRDM-2MS. In the new improvement, the location of additional armored screens has been changed, which have become more compact and fit more closely to the armor. In addition, a new air conditioning system was added to the vehicle, the brake and fuel systems were improved. In the cabin, sprung seats were installed, in the design of which there are shock absorbers adjustable in terms of stiffness. In addition to comfort for the crew, these seats have the ability to damp an impulse when a mine is blown up under an armored car. Changes to the internal layout of the armored car made it possible to make the fighting compartment more spacious. The gearbox has received synchronization. During the past tests of the armored car, its smooth running was noted. The amphibious capabilities of the vehicle were preserved, but significantly decreased. Now the water travel is about 2 kilometers per hour. The bulkhead between the \\"habitable\\" compartment and the engine compartment is sealed. This prevents the vehicle from sinking in case of unsuccessful crossing of water obstacles completely and also protects the crew in the event of an engine fire. =Serbia= Serbian \\"Kurjak\\" * \\"Kurjak RCV\\" (Black Wolf) ‚Äì A Yugoimport SDPR upgrade package.

A spiral (sometimes called a spiral loop or just loop) is a technique employed by railways to ascend steep hills. A railway spiral rises on a steady curve until it has completed a loop, passing over itself as it gains height, allowing the railway to gain vertical elevation in a relatively short horizontal distance. It is an alternative to a zig-zag, and avoids the need for the trains to stop and reverse direction while ascending. If the train is longer than the length of each loop it may be possible to view it looping above itself. The term \\"loop\\" is also often used for a railway that curves sharply and goes back on itself: if the railway crosses itself, then it forms a spiral or helix; otherwise, it forms the much more common horseshoe curve or bend.

He was mainly active in Mantua, was well-connected with the Gonzaga and Medici families, and along with Bartolomeo Tromboncino, was well known as a composer of frottolas. Life Very little is known of his early life. By 1494 he was already employed by the Gonzaga court at Mantua, and he evidently stayed there, without interruption except for travel to sing in nearby cities, until his death. Among his duties were directing the singers both in the Cathedral of San Pietro (Mantua) and in the private estate of the Gonzaga family. As lovers and patrons of music, they employed numerous musicians, and Cara was chief among them: he wrote music for weddings, for state occasions, for intermedi, and for private entertainments, and in so doing created some of the most refined light music of the time. Along with Tromboncino, he was the most famous composer of frottole, and his compositions continued to be collected and published after his death. Most likely he died in 1525, since his widow remarried in early 1526, and there was at the time a legal requirement for a widow to wait nine months prior to remarriage. When he died he was a wealthy man, owning two houses in the city and two large country estates: evidently the Gonzaga family paid him well. Cara was famous not only as a composer, but as a singer and a lutenist. He sang at Mantua, for his employers, but also traveled throughout northern Italy, singing for the Medici, the Bembo family, the Bentivoglio family in Bologna, and other aristocrats in Verona, Venice, Padua, Pesaro, Cremona, as well as other cities. Baldassare Castiglione heard him sing, and wrote of him in his famous Book of the Courtier (Venice, 1528), in the same paragraph in which he praises Leonardo da Vinci: :And no lesse doeth our Marchetto Cara move in his singinge, but with a more softe harmonye, that by a delectable waye and full of mourninge swetnesse maketh tender and perceth the mind, and sweetly imprinteth in it a passion full of great delite (translated by Sir Thomas Hoby, 1561). Works Though predominantly a composer of frottolas, a light secular form and ancestor of the madrigal, he also wrote a few sacred pieces, including a three-voice Salve Regina (one of the Marian Antiphons) as well as seven laude spirituali. His frottolas are for the most part homophonic, with short passages of imitation only at the beginnings of phrases; they are catchy, singable, and often use dance-like rhythms. The poetry for most of his 100 frottolas is anonymous, though the authors of 16 poems have been identified. Most of the poems are in the form of the barzellette, but there are also strambotti, sonnets, capitoli and ode. Almost everything is in a verse-refrain format. One of Cara's best known frottolas, Io non compro pi√π speranza was composed in 1504 and published in the first book of Frottolas of Petrucci . Some of his later frottolas are more serious in character, and foreshadow the development of the madrigal, which took place in the late 1520s and 1530s, right after his death.

The company sold radio sets, Amateur radio (Ham) equipment, citizens band (CB) radios and related communications equipment, electronic components, and tools through their company owned and branded chain of retail outlets and by mail-order. History \\"Wholesale Radio Service\\" was established in the early 1920s by Abraham Pletman in New York City. Radios sold by the company were trademarked ‚ÄúLafayette‚Äù in July 1931. Following a Federal Trade Commission action in 1935, Wholesale Radio Service became \\"Radio Wire Television, Inc.\\". A 1939 company catalog bore the names Radio Wire Television Co. Inc. and \\"Lafayette Radio Corporation\\". In 1948, the company issued a catalog under the name ‚ÄúLafayette- Concord‚Äù and called itself the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs largest radio supply organization‚Äù. In 1952, a catalog was issued using only the Lafayette name. Lafayette Radio Electronics (LRE) soon became a thriving mail-order catalog business; the electronic components it sold were useful to amateur radio operators and electronic hobbyists in areas where such components were unavailable in local retail outlets. Lafayette's main competitors were Radio Shack, Allied Radio, Heathkit, and \\"mom and pop\\" (independent) radio dealers throughout the United States. Early Lafayette Radio stores were located in Jamaica, N.Y. and Manhattan in the mid-1950s. The electronics kits were produced in the Jamaica facility. Lafayette advertised heavily in major U.S. consumer electronics magazines of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly Audio, High Fidelity, Popular Electronics, Popular Mechanics, and Stereo Review. The company offered a free 400-page catalog filled with descriptions of vast quantities of electronic gear, including microphones, speakers, tape recorders, and other components. In 1981, Lafayette Radio entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sold its New York area stores to Circuit City. Retail stores Lafayette Radio Electronics, QSL card for use by headquarters staff amateur radio operators. Until the 1960s, many independent retailers in some markets became Lafayette Radio \\"Associate Stores\\", which were displaced when the company expanded. These stores were supported from headquarters at 111 Jericho Turnpike in Syosset, NY and a warehouse in Hauppauge, NY. A limited selection of product was stocked, with full access to a catalog with a wide variety of parts, tubes, cameras, musical instruments, kits, gadgets and branded gear that could be ordered and delivered through the local store. The company made major investments in what were called sound rooms to demonstrate hi-fi equipment, using custom switch panels and acoustic treatments in an attempt to duplicate a home listening environment and offer fair comparison with an assortment of branded hi-fi gear. Managers were rewarded for maximizing gross profit margins and inventory \\"turns\\", which led to frequent out-of-stock situations, often remedied by frequent cross-town inter-store transfers. Each store had a repair shop on site with a part-time technician. Some locations had multiple full-time service technicians. Others had service departments that operated independently of the store but under the same ownership. Stores ranged in size from 2,000 to . By the late 1970s, Lafayette expanded to major markets across the country, struggling to compete with Radio Shack, which was purchased by Tandy Leather Co. in 1963. Lafayette ran into major financial difficulty when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) expanded a new citizens band radio (\\"CB\\") spectrum to 40 channels in 1977. Lafayette's buyers had firm commitments to accept delivery of thousands of older design units capable of only 23 channels, and were not able to liquidate the inventory without taking a serious loss. Eventually, all of the old CB radios were sold for under $40. Lafayette 20-In-1 Electronic Project Kit, circa 1970. With fewer than 100 stores, far fewer than the aggressively expanding Radio Shack's thousands of local outlets, Lafayette Radio remained more of a dedicated enthusiasts' store than a mass marketer. The company was also hurt by the advent of electronics retailers relying on aggressive marketing techniques and competitive pricing in the late 1970s. Many experienced managers departed. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1981 and most Lafayette stores in the state of New York closed by the end of the year. Approximately two thirds of company-owned stores were closed immediately. According to one employee, they were \\"given 48 hours to tear the entire store down, get everything boxed that had a valid and current stock number, and get it on a truck to take it back to Syosset (Lafayette‚Äôs Long Island warehouse). Anything that wasn‚Äôt on the official inventory sheets was to be discarded\\". In 1981, Lafayette Radio entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Several Lafayette stores were purchased by Circuit City of Richmond, Virginia. Of the 150 stores that Lafayette had once owned, eight stores remained when Circuit City took over. In order to keep the Lafayette name, which was popular in New York, Circuit City changed the store names to \\"Lafayette-Circuit City\\". However, these store locations were much smaller than a standard Circuit City, and did not carry major appliances, which Circuit City carried at the time. The stores were eventually closed as Circuit City left the New York Market (only to return later). The Syosset repair center was kept open a year after the last store closing to handle warranty coverage. Lafayette-Circuit City used the phrase \\"no haggling\\" in its ad campaign, which featured celebrities such as Don King, in trying to demonstrate that the lowest price was always posted, unlike many competitors in where you would have to bargain with the sales person for a lower price. This approach, however, did not work, and Lafayette-Circuit City fell due to competition from other New York area electronic retailers such as Newmark and Lewis, Trader Horn, The Wiz, Crazy Eddie, and PC Richard. As of 2003, the Lafayette brand name was re-launched at the CES show that year. Their products are only offered through special dealers and limited retail stores. Products Lafayette's products ranged from individual resistors, capacitors and components to stereos and two-way radios for amateur radio, CBers, and shortwave listeners. Many were dedicated types with special functions, such as VHF receivers for police and fire channels built into a CB radio. The company's best selling products were often shortwave receivers, parts, and portable radios. In the 1960s, many Lafayette brand radios were rebranded Trio-Kenwood sets. A significant share of 1960s and 1970s vintage Lafayette hi-fi gear was manufactured by a Japanese subcontractor named \\"Planet Research\\". \\"Criterion\\" brand speakers were built by several offshore and some domestic assemblers. Science kits were popular, and Lafayette offered the \\"Novatraon\\", a \\"Miniature Atom Smasher\\" (van de Graaff generator), Model F-371. While the catalog heavily promoted their own branded products, Lafayette also carried models from many other hi-fi manufacturers of the era, including Marantz, Fisher, Pioneer, Sansui, AR, Dynaco, KLH, Wharfedale, Bozak, BIC, BSR McDonald, Garrard, Dual, TEAC, Akai, Shure, Empire, Pickering, Electro-Voice, JVC, Panasonic, Sony and others. The catalogs and advertising helped promote the concept of high-fidelity sound to customers, some of whom lived many miles away from major electronics stores, during a time when only the largest urban areas had dedicated \\"stereo\\" stores. Lafayette also offered TV vacuum tube testing, for customers who wanted to service their own televisions. Lafayette was quick to jump on industry trends, embracing first open reel tape recorders and later 8-track cartridge recorders and compact cassette recorders, along with an array of gimmicks, supplies, and accessories. During the mid-1970s, the company's stores were one of few places one could actually experience four channel (\\"quadraphonic\\") sound. However the lack of a single industry standard (Columbia SQ vs. JVC's CD-4 and Sansui's QS) dampened sales, and the experiment ended in 1976. Lafayette also sold a variety of electronic musical equipment made by different manufacturers. There were solid-body and hollow-body electric guitars, probably made by Teisco or Harmony. Microphones, amplifiers, and various electronic effects such as reverbs were available, many of which sported the Lafayette brand name, most notably the Echo Verb and Echo Verb II. Among the most famous guitar effects that Lafayette sold was the Roto-Vibe and Uni-Vibe, used by many musicians, most notably Jimi Hendrix. Robin Trower, Stevie Ray Vaughan and others later used the effect to emulate Hendrix's sounds and achieve new ones of their own.

The Horse's Mouth follows the adventures of Gulley Jimson, an artist who would exploit his friends and acquaintances to earn money, told from his point of view, just as the other books in the First Trilogy tell events from their central characters' different points of view. Cary's novel also uses Gulley's unique perspective to comment on the social and political events of the time. Plot Jimson's father, based on a real person known to Cary, was an Academy artist who is heart-broken when Impressionism drives his style from popular taste. Jimson has put aside any consideration of acceptance by either academy or public and paints in fits of creative ecstasy. Although his work is known to collectors and has become valuable, Jimson himself is forced to live from one scam or petty theft to the next. Cadging enough money to buy paints and supplies, he spends much of the novel seeking surfaces, such as walls, to serve as ground for his paintings. When the novel opens, Jimson has just been released from jail. He seeks money from Hickson, his sometime patron. Later in the book, he tracks down Sara Monday, his ex-wife, and tries to obtain an early painting from her that is worth a great deal. Sara is reluctant to give up the picture, which serves as a reminder of her youth. In the struggle that follows, Sara falls and suffers a fatal injury. Jimson is unsentimental about his life and work and sees himself as someone who has given over to a destructive passion. Yet he regrets nothing. At the novel's end, Jimson reflects on his life and the home and family that he has missed. But he recognizes that he himself made the decision to sacrifice those possibilities in order to pursue his art. It is only clear at the end that Jimson has suffered a paralysing stroke, and can no longer paint. As he is being taken to hospital, a nun who is nursing him remarks that he should be praying instead of laughing, \\"Same thing, Mother,\\" replies Jimson, his last words. Adaptation In 1956, a film adaptation, also titled The Horse's Mouth, was released, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay by actor Alec Guinness. The film was directed by Ronald Neame, and starred Guinness, Kay Walsh, Ren√©e Houston, Mike Morgan, and Robert Coote. It generally follows the book, except for deviating from the ending. It focuses on the Jimson character and what it means to be an artist, rather than the social and political themes. John Bratby painted the pictures attributed to Jimson in the film. Reviews * Philip Larkin described the book as \\"not superlative but managing to catch something of the indomitable soul of art.

From 1987 to 1995 he played in 39 Tests and 87 ODI, for New Zealand. At domestic level, he played for Central Districts, Otago, and Wellington. Schoolboy Career Andrew Jones attended Nelson College from 1972 to 1976, and was a member of the school's 1st XI cricket team for four years. He was awarded the Wood Cup for best all-round athlete at the college in 1975.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition International career It wasn't until the age of 27 that he made his Test debut for New Zealand, on 16 April 1987 against Sri Lanka. He became a solid No. 3 batsman, where he played all but 4 of his Test innings. New Zealand only won six of the 39 Tests in which he played. Jones's batting style was characterised by an unusual but effective jumping method against short deliveries. He was a batsman who was difficult to dismiss when set, he scored over 140 in five of his seven hundreds. He had a strong record against subcontinental sides, against India he scored 401 runs at 50.13 and made 625 runs at 62.50 against the Sri Lankans. It was against the Sri Lankans that he made his highest Test score of 186 in Wellington. With Martin Crowe, Jones made a partnership of 467 which became a Test record as the highest partnership by any side for any wicket. The innings came in a prolific period for Jones as he made 122 and an unbeaten 100 in his next two Test innings. Jones is currently the only New Zealand batsman to have ever scored 3 hundreds in consecutive innings. Despite maintaining an average of 35.69 in 87 ODI innings, he never scored a century in that format of the game. His highest score of 93 came in Sharjah against Bangladesh.

Introduced in 1954,http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/interpreter.html the machine was a synchronous system where brushes would glide over a hole in a punched card and contact a brass roller thereby setting up part of a character code. Features *Proof ‚Äì where the 557 verified, again through electrical mechanical means, that the information printed was correct *Multiple Stacker ‚Äì the printed card could be placed in a selected output stacker *Selective Line Print ‚Äì the standard 557 could only print on the top two horizontal lines (between the 12 and 11 rows and between the 11 and 0 rows) ‚Äì selective line print feature allowed printing on one of 26 lines *40 or 60 column card read ‚Äì Standard punched card was 80 columns, but there were exceptions *Master/detail printing ‚Äì text on a master card could be printed on following detail cards Maintenance The 557 was a maintenance headache. In reality it was 60 little printers. The sequence was as follows: #The punched card was fed from the card hopper and read by means of an electrical voltage placed onto a metal ‚ÄòContact Roll‚Äô, timing controlled by a ‚ÄòMaster Circuit Breaker, and 80 ‚ÄòRead Brushes‚Äô, one brush for each card column, and ‚ÄòWire Contact Relays‚Äô which decoded the data. #The punched card acted as an insulator and an electrical contact was only completed in the presence of a punched hole. A control panel controlled what function was to be performed by directing the impulse to a series of ‚Äòwire contact relays‚Äô with the impulses de-coded according to the Hollerith code. (Mark Sense could not provide the current needed to ‚Äòpick‚Äô a wire contact relay and so needed vacuum tubes to amplify the current). After the card was read, a ‚ÄòCard Gate‚Äô moved into the card path to stop the card for printing on the correct horizontal line. #As the card was being read and positioned for printing, a ‚Äòmechanical bail‚Äô driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‚Äòlifter bars‚Äô which engaged 60 ‚Äòracks‚Äô which engaged 60 ‚Äòintermediate gears‚Äô, which drove 60 ‚Äòprint wheels‚Äô. (You can see the maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‚Äòmechanical bail‚Äô in time with the reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‚Äòcontact roll‚Äô / ‚Äòcard brush‚Äô / ‚Äòwire contact relay‚Äô circuitry, a ‚Äòpush rod‚Äô would latch (stop) the individual ‚Äòlifter bar‚Äô on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‚Äòprint hammers‚Äô. An ‚Äòalignment bail‚Äô would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‚Äòprint wheels‚Äô to perform vertical alignment. #A ‚Äòcard shield‚Äô would grab the punched card to hold it in place and lower it a position almost touching the inked print ribbon and print wheel. At the correct time 60 ‚Äòhammers‚Äô, under spring tension and controlled by a cam, would ‚Äòfire‚Äô pressing the card / inked ribbon onto the print wheel and leaving an inked impression of the character on the surface of the punched card. There is a blank space on the print wheel for non-printing columns. #The printed card is then released by the ‚Äòprint shield‚Äô into the ‚Äòtransport belts‚Äô and moved to the stacker. The 557 was prone to jamming of the lifter bars and resulted in what the CEs called a \\"rack and wheel\\" job. This meant stripping the machine down to its base and rebuilding it, an eight-hour job.

The party contested the 2002 state election but failed to elect any candidates to the Parliament of South Australia. Ideology and policy SA First positioned itself as a pragmatic, centre-based political party which relied on policy initiatives drawn from the experience of its members and professionals. Its flagship was parliamentary reform, which advocated electoral reform, proportional representation, more sitting days and fewer political perks. It also formed a broad range of policy initiatives which were more or less moderate and liberal in their scope. Structure The structure of SA First consisted of local branches electing a governing State Conference, which in turn elected an administrative State Executive. The Party was notable for allowing each MP a conscience vote on each piece of legislation before Parliament. The annual State Conference consisted of delegates elected by the branches and was the governing body of the party, with the power to determine policy, preselect Upper House candidates and elect the State Executive. The State Executive was an 11-member body elected largely by the Conference. There were positions of President, Vice-President and State Secretary, elected by a preferential majority of Conference for a two-year term. It followed the Labor Party model of political power lying in the hands of the Secretary rather than the President; the President directed debate and the State Secretary directed the everyday operations of the Party. There were six General Members elected by proportional representation for a one-year term. The positions of Youth Representative and Parliamentary Leader were ex officio. The state was divided up into branches, based around one to nine electorates. Each branch was allocated delegates to State Conference based on one delegate per 10 members (with a cap of 7 delegates to help prevent branch stacking or undue influence by one branch). Branches had an equal say in the preselection of candidates, with a 50% weighting of the vote with State Conference. (cf. Australian Labor Party where the branches have only a 25% weighting, and the Liberal Party where the SEC/FEC preselection college has a 100% weighting). Youth Members (25 and under), in addition to being members of their local branch, were also automatically members of SA First Youth, which elected delegates to Conference based on its membership and elected a member of the State Executive directly. This 'double representation' helped youth membership and participation within the wider party immensely, with almost 1/3 of delegates from the youth wing of the party as well as 1/3 of the State Executive members. There were also standing committees such as the Policy Committee, which drafted policy under the direction of a Policy Convener appointed by State Conference. Party members At its height SA First had over 500 members which placed it as the third largest party in South Australia, behind the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party and on equal par with the Australian Democrats. It attracted members from both sides of the political divide who were looking for a new, moderate political party in which to participate, as well as people who had no prior political experience. Parliamentary involvement Together with fellow Labor-Turned-Independent MP Trevor Crothers, SA First shared the balance of power in the South Australian Legislative Council and made it easier for the Liberal Government to pass legislation; previously they had to convince either the Australian Democrats or the Labor Party to pass legislation. SA First MP Terry Cameron was renowned for asking numerous questions in parliament and for making extensive speeches, the longest clocking in at over three hours. 2002 election SA First ran 30 candidates in the House of Assembly and 2 in the Legislative Council at the 2002 election. They received between 0.6% and 7.5% of the primary vote in the various Lower House seats and 1% of the vote in the Legislative Council. Their average vote where they fielded a candidate was 2.8%. They failed to win a seat, however post-electoral analysis indicated the party missed out by only 2,000 votes. Post-electoral history On 31 December 2002, SA First was deregistered as a political party. Terry Cameron continued to sit as an Independent in the Legislative Council. Up for re-election, he was unsuccessful at the 2006 state election. His preferences were directed towards minor parties in the first instance, and then towards the Liberals ahead of Labor. Many members went on to join other political parties, primarily the Liberal Party.

Straight rail, sometimes called straight billiards, three-ball billiard, and the free game, is a discipline of carom billiards that is the most basic form of the game. The game is played on a unmarked billiard table, usually in size, and three billiard balls, one, usually white, that serves as the for the first player, a second cue ball for the second player (differentiated by a spot, or by being yellow), and a third object ball, usually red. The object of the game is to score points striking the player's assigned cue ball with a cue stick so it makes contact with both the opponent's cue ball and the object ball in the same , known as a . Games are played to a predetermined number of points. History Straight rail, from which other carom games derive, is thought to date to the 18th century, although no exact time of origin is known. The derivation of the name straight rail is not clear, though may be a reference to the pocketless table. An early mention appears in the March 23, 1881, edition of The New York Times, wherein it is referred to as \\"the straight rail game.\\"The New York Times (March 23, 1881). Carter Beats Gallagher.; the Toledo Player Gains the Lead Early and Retains it till the End. Retrieved December 27, 2006. In 1855, the first public stakes straight rail match in the U.S. took place in San Francisco. The contestants, Michael Phelan and a Monsieur Damon of Paris battled for seven hours, but the high run, set by Phelan, was just nine points. A technique soon developed, known as \\"crotching\\", referring to the space near the corner of a table where the rails meet. By moving the two object balls into the crotch, a player could endlessly score off of them, all the while keeping them immobilized in that corner. Crotching was quickly banned in 1862, and players are required to move the ball out of the corner after three points. Skill in the professional game increased mostly through the refinement of gather shots and the development of a variety of \\"nurse\\" techniques. A gather shot is one in which brings the cue ball and object balls together, ideally near a rail. A nurse shot involves careful manipulation of object balls once gathered, which results in both balls being touched by the cue ball, but with all three balls barely moving, or that result in a position that can be duplicated over and over. The most important of these is the rail nurse which involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail, keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again.Jim Loy (1998). The Rail Nurse . Retrieved December 30, 2006. At the U.S. straight rail professional tournament held in 1879, Jacob Schaefer Sr. scored 690 points in a single at the table. With the balls barely moving and repetitively hit, there was little for the fans to watch. Jacob Schaefer Sr. tobacco card, circa 1880s Although Schaefer was hailed as \\"the wizard\\", the repetitive nature of straight rail led to the development of balkline, where the table is divided by into where only a certain number of points can be scored before the balls must be driven away, and one-cushion billiards, where the cue ball must contact one of the as part of the shot. Today, straight rail play is relatively uncommon in the U.S. but retains popularity in Europe, where it is often played as a practice game for both balkline and three-cushion billiards, a development of one-cushion that has become the most prominent professional carom billiards game. Additionally, Europe hosts professional competitions known as pentathlons in which straight rail is featured as one of five carom billiards disciplines at which players compete, the other four being 47.1 balkline, one-cushion billiards, 71.2 balkline, and three-cushion billiards.

Early life Krabb√© was born into an artistic family in Amsterdam. Both his father, Maarten Krabb√©, and grandfather Hendrik Maarten Krabb√© were well-known painters, and his mother Margreet (n√©e Reiss; 1914‚Äì2002), was a film translator. His brother, Tim, is a writer and top-level chess player, and his half-brother, Mirko, is an artist. Only later in life did he learn that his mother was Jewish and that her family had been killed during the Holocaust. Career Jeroen Krabb√© in 1980 Krabb√© in 1992 Internationally, he first came to prominence in fellow Dutchman Paul Verhoeven's films, Soldier of Orange opposite Rutger Hauer and The Fourth Man with Ren√©e Soutendijk. His first big American film was the Whoopi Goldberg comedy, Jumpin' Jack Flash. However, it was his roles as villains in a string of international films from the late 1980s and early 1990s which brought him international stardom, with notable roles such as Losado in No Mercy (1986), General Georgi Koskov in the James Bond film The Living Daylights (1987), Gianni Franco in The Punisher (1989), Herbert Woodruff (Lowenstein's husband) in The Prince of Tides (1991), and the criminal Dr. Charles Nichols in The Fugitive (1993). He appeared in numerous TV productions, and as Satan in the TV production Jesus. He was both director and producer of a 1998 film about Orthodox Jews during the 1970s in Antwerp, Belgium, co-starring Isabella Rossellini and Maximilian Schell called Left Luggage, as well as the Harry Mulisch novel adapted into film The Discovery of Heaven. Left Luggage was entered into the 48th Berlin International Film Festival. The following year, he was a member of the jury at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. His television work included playing an uncanny psychic in the Midsomer Murders series 11 episode \\"Talking to the Dead\\". Krabb√© had an exhibition of his paintings in Museum de Fundatie (Zwolle), in 2008. He began working on documentaries for Dutch television about his favorite painters. In 2015 the first series were about Van Gogh, followed in 2017 by a series about Picasso, in 2018 by Gauguin and most recently, in 2020, about Chagall. Personal life Krabb√© married Herma van Gemert in 1964. Together they have three sons ‚Äì Martijn (who is a radio and television presenter), Jasper and Jacob. Apart from acting and directing, he is an accomplished artist (his paintings have appeared on Dutch postage stamps), and has co-authored a Dutch cookbook. In November 2004, he released the book Schilder, which is an overview of his paintings.

Trade was a conglomeration of Malay-Hindu-Chinese-Tagalog. Padre Morga wrote that Polillo originated from the Chinese word \\"Pulilu\\", which means beautiful island with plenty of food. When Juan de Salcedo, a Spanish conqueror came to Polillo in 1567, he saw a central government fully organized through the Balangay, with a datu who had a direct supervision and control over all the natives. The inhabitants lived in nipa huts. In 1571 the Spaniards took hold of the islands of Pu Li Lu. Through the leadership of Padre Domingo, a Spanish friar, a chapel was built, where the old Spanish church was later constructed. After one and a half years, the people, through forced labor built a concrete wall to protect the \\"pueblo\\" of Pu Li Lu from moro pirate invaders. Watchtowers called \\"castillos\\" were erected in the four corners of the pueblo. The church was constructed in 1577 . Boulders, gravel and sand were mixed with lime produced out of seashells and coral stones. Padre Domingo instigated the planting of sugar cane in San Isidro, San Antonio and San Francisco. Production of molasses was put into full swing. Spanish conquistadores were assigned to the \\"pueblo\\" of Pu Li Lu to promote church construction. The church tower was constructed with priority, so that in 1587, in the early summer of May, two huge bronze bells rang atop. Due to language problems, Padre Domingo changed Pu Li Lu to Polillo. In 1942, the occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Polillo. In 1945, the liberation by the Philippine Commonwealth troops of the 5th and 52nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army landed in Polillo we fought the battles against the Japanese forces in the Battle of Polillo Island during World War II.

It was at one time the center of Western monasticism. Mendicant orders are, primarily, certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, traveling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model. This model prescribed living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property at all, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. The term \\"mendicant\\" is also used with reference to some non-Christian religions to denote holy persons committed to an ascetic lifestyle, which may include members of religious orders and individual holy persons. Origins of the friars What is called the mendicant movement in Church history arose primarily in the 13th century in Western Europe. Until that time the monks of Europe worked at their trade in their monastery. Renouncing personal property, they owned all things in common as a community after the example of chapters 2 and 4 of the Acts of the Apostles.\\"Mendicant movement\\", Augnet With the rise of Western monasticism, monasteries attracted not only individuals aspiring to become monks and nuns, but also property, buildings and hence riches. In the view of some, the idea that Christ came down to earth poor and that the true Church must be the church of the poor clashed with this phenomenon. The desire for true Christian authenticity was thus seen by some to contrast to the empirical reality of the Church.Benedict XVI, \\"The Mendicant Orders\\", General Audience, 13 January 2010 The twelfth century saw great changes in western Europe. As commerce revived, urban centers arose and with them an urban middle class. New directions in spirituality were called for. Church reform became a major theme of the cultural revival of this era. In response to this, there emerged the new mendicant orders founded by Francis of Assisi (c. 1181‚Äì1226) and Dominic Guzman (c. 1170‚Äì1221). The mendicant friars were bound by a vow of poverty and dedicated to an ascetic way of life, renouncing property and travelling the world to preach. Their survival was dependent upon the good will and material support of their listeners. It was this way of life that gave them their name, \\"mendicant\\", derived from the Latin mendicare, meaning \\"to beg\\".Labatt, Annie, and Charlotte Appleyard. \\"Mendicant Orders in the Medieval World\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004) The mendicant movement had started in France and Italy and became popular in the poorer towns and cities of Europe at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The refusal of the mendicants to own property‚Äîand therefore to pay taxes‚Äîwas seen as threatening the stability of the established Church which was then planning a crusade, to be financed by tithes. For this and other reasons some mendicant orders were officially suppressed by Pope Gregory X at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274 and others were reformed, so as to be capable of contributing funds or men to support the war effort. =Dominicans= While on a visit to southern France, Saint Dominic met the Albigensians, a religious sect which had a great popularity partly because of the economic situation of the times. Dominic, who had begun as a secular canon, responded to a desperate need for informed preaching by founding the Order of Preachers and thus embarking on a new form of religious life, the life of the friar. Before this time, religious life had been monastic, but with Dominic the secluded monastery gave way to priories in the cities. By the time of his death in 1221, the Order had spread through Western Europe, hundreds of young men had joined, and the presence of the Order of Preachers was felt at the major universities of the time.The sequence followed in listing the different orders follows the official precedence recognized by the Holy See, cf. Annuario Pontificio 2014 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2014, pp. 1421‚Äì1425 =Franciscans= Francis came to this manner of life through a period of personal conversion. The Franciscans spread far and wide the devotion to the humanity of Christ, with the commitment to imitate the Lord. Many of them were priests and men of learning whose contributions were notable in the rapid evolution and contemporary relevance of the movement. Notable Franciscans include Anthony of Padua, who were inspirations to the formation of Christian mendicant traditions. Characteristics Published in London. Image of Carmelite Friar. The Franciscans and Dominicans put into practice a pastoral strategy suited to the social changes. The emergence of urban centers meant concentrated numbers of the homeless and the sick. This created problems for the parish churches who found themselves unable to address these issues.\\"The Mendicant Orders\\", University of Saint Thomas‚ÄìSaint Paul, Minnesota, 2003 Since many people were moving from the countryside to the cities, they no longer built their convents in rural districts but rather in urban zones. In another innovation, the mendicant orders relinquished their principle of stability, a classical principle of ancient monasticism, opting for a different approach. Unlike the Benedictine monks, the mendicants were not permanently attached to any one particular convent and to its abbot. Because the orders' primary aim was the evangelization of the masses, the church granted them freedom from the jurisdiction of the bishops and they traveled about to convert or reinforce faith. The freedom of mendicancy allowed Franciscans and Dominicans mobility. Since they were not tied to monasteries or territorial parishes, they were free to take the gospel into the streets, to preach, hear confessions and minister to people wherever they were. Friars Minor and Preachers traveled with missionary zeal from one place to another. Consequently, they organized themselves differently in comparison with the majority of monastic orders. Instead of the traditional autonomy that every monastery enjoyed, they gave greater importance to the order as such and to the Superior General, as well as to the structure of the order Provinces. Their flexibility enabled them to send out the most suitable friars on specific missions, and the mendicant orders reached North Africa, the Middle East and Northern Europe. As students and professors, Friars Minor and Friars Preacher, Franciscans and Dominicans, entered the leading universities of the time, set up study centers, produced texts of great value and were protagonists of scholastic theology in its best period and had an important effect on the development of thought. The great thinkers, St Thomas Aquinas and St Bonaventure, were mendicants. In all the great cities of western Europe, friaries were established, and in the universities theological chairs were held by Dominicans and Franciscans. Later in the 13th century they were joined by the mendicant orders of Carmelites, Augustinian Hermits, and Servites. They attracted a significant level of patronage, as much from townsfolk as aristocrats. Their focus of operation rapidly centered on towns where population growth historically outstripped the provision of rural parishes. Most medieval towns in Western Europe of any size came to possess houses of one or more of the major orders of friars. Some of their churches came to be built on grand scale with large spaces devoted to preaching, something of a specialty among the mendicant orders. Early mendicant orders Despite conforming to a recognizable model, the mendicant orders of friars had origins that were generally very different. The original mendicant orders of friars in the Church in the Middle Ages were the *Dominicans ‚Äì Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars, founded 1215. *Franciscans ‚Äì who in modern times include the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.); the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), who are commonly known as the Grey Friars; the Capuchins (Order of Friars Minor Capuchin) (O.F.M. Cap.), founded 1209; and the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, whose origins lie in the 15th century. *Augustinians ‚Äì Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars, various loosely organized groups of hermits who accepted the Augustinian rule 1244‚Äì1256, in order to fall under the provisions of the decree \\"Ne nimium\\" of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. In modern times two reform groups, the Augustinian Recollects and the Discalced Augustinians, exist as separate orders. *Carmelites ‚Äì Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars, a group of hermits on Mount Carmel in the Crusader states, who adopted a rule sometime between 1206 and 1214, before they began migrating to Western Europe around 1238\\"Origins of the Carmelite Order\\", The British Province of Carmelite Friars In modern times a reform group, the Discalced Carmelites, founded 1593, exists as a separate order. The Second Council of Lyons (1274) recognized these as the four \\"major\\" mendicant orders, and suppressed certain others. The Council of Trent loosened the restrictions on their owning property. Afterwards, except for the Franciscans and their offshoot the Capuchins, members of the orders were permitted to own property collectively as do monks. Other mendicant orders The other mendicant orders recognized by the Holy See today are the *Trinitarians ‚Äì Order of the Most Blessed Trinity, sometimes called the Red Friars, founded 1193. *Mercedarians ‚Äì Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, founded 1218; and after a reform Discalced Mercedarians. *Servites ‚Äì Order of Servants of Mary, founded 1233 by the Seven Holy Men of Florence, Italy. The order was suppressed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1272, on the basis of the restrictions in the decree \\"Ne nimium\\" of 1215; the suppression was not fully enforced and was subsequently overturned by Pope Benedict XI in his Bull, \\"Dum levamus\\", of 11 February 1304.Griffin, Patrick. \\"Order of Servites\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 19 Aug. 2013 *Minims ‚Äì Hermits of St. Francis of Paola, founded 1436. *Hospitaller Order of the Brothers of Saint John of God ‚Äì founded in 1572 by Saint John of God for the care of the sick. *Order of Bethlehemite Brothers, founded in Guatemala in 1653 and suppressed in 1820. They were refounded in 1984.Giancarlo Rocca (dir.), Dizionario degli Istituti di Perfezione, Edizioni Paoline, Roma, vol. V, 1978, col. 1185. Like the monastic orders, many of the mendicant orders, especially the larger ones, underwent splits and reform efforts, forming offshoots, permanent or otherwise, some of which are mentioned in the lists given above. Former mendicant orders Mendicant orders that formerly existed but are now extinct, and orders which for a time were classed as mendicant orders but now no longer are. =Extinct mendicant orders= *Ambrosians or Fratres sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus, existed before 1378, suppressed by Pope Innocent X in 1650. *Fraticelli of Monte Malbe, founded at Monte Malbe near Perugia in Italy in the 14th century, by the end of the century they had dispersed. *Hospitallers of San Hip√≥lito (Saint Hippolytus) or Brothers of Charity of de San Hip√≥lito were founded in Mexico and approved by Rome as a mendicant order in 1700. In the 18th century they were absorbed by the Brothers Hospitaller of Saint John of God. *Jesuati, or Clerici apostolici Sancti Hieronymim, Apostolic Clerics of Saint Jerome, founded in 1360, suppressed by Pope Clement IX in 1668. *Saccati or Friars of the Sack (Fratres Saccati), known also variously as Brothers of Penitence and perhaps identical with the Boni Homines, Bonshommes or Bones-homes, whose history is obscure. *Crutched Friars or Fratres Cruciferi (cross-bearing friars) or Crossed Friars, Crouched Friars or Croziers, named after the staff they carried which was surmounted by a crucifix, existed by 1100, suppressed by Pope Alexander VII in 1656. *Scalzetti, founded in the 18th century, suppressed by Pope Pius XI in 1935. =Orders no longer mendicant= *Jesuits or Society of Jesus, founded in 1540, and for a time considered a mendicant order, before being classed instead as an Order of Clerks Regular.

In 1996 he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting from the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Mumbai.\\"Jitish Kallat - Artist Bio\\", Aicon Gallery, Retrieved 16 September 2014. Career Having received his BFA in painting in 1996, Kallat had his debut solo exhibition titled \\"PTO\\" at Chemould Prescott Road. His large-format paintings and drawings already had in them the themes that would recur throughout his work until today. With the self at the centre of an unfolding narrative, these paintings were connected to ideas of time, death, cycles of life, references to the celestial, and familial ancestry. It was only in the next three or four years that an image of the city, otherwise seen at the margins of his paintings, began to take centre stage. In those days Kallat referred to the city street as his university, often carrying within it pointers to the perennial themes of life that have remained a subtext to his work that have taken form in diverse media. \\"Other indigenous painters before him had flirted with international styles such as Pop (most notably Jyothi Bhatt and Bhupen Khakhar ) and the mix and match of Postmodernism (namely Gulammohammed Sheikh and Atul Dodiya), but no one had turned the textures and surfaces of urban India into the fracture of painting quite so successfully,\\" noted artist, gallerist, and co-director of Nature Morte, Peter Nagy in an essay titled \\"Jitish Kallat: 21st Century Boy\\". \\"Parts of Kallat's canvases appear as if they had been left outdoors during the monsoon season, other sections seem blistered and scorched by the unrelenting sun. The works usually appear much older than they actually are, aged as soon as they are born, not unlike all manner of objects and people through the subcontinent. The distressed and tortured surfaces create a field in which to submerge images while the images themselves are processed and mutilated in a variety of ways. All of which combine to create works that both participate intimately with the artist's mise en scene and comment upon the unique idiosyncrasies of his home. Degradation, bastardisation, the destruction and retrieval of culture and history became Kallat's subjects through the astute handling of both subject matter and technique.\\"Jitish Kallat, Universal Recipient, published by Haunch of Venison, 2008, Zurich Kallat‚Äôs work has also developed in response to museum collections in the case of projects such as \\"Field Notes, (Tomorrow was here yesterday) (2011)\\" at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai, for which he was shortlisted for The Skoda Prize in 2012,\\"The Skoda Prize 2012\\", Skoda, Retrieved 16 September 2014. or \\"Circa,\\" at the Ian Potter Museum in Melbourne. Both these projects had several of his recurring preoccupations find their form and structure in conversation with the museum viewed both as an infrastructure of signs but equally a field of stimuli and meaning. Often works which begin with a private narrative or an autobiographical impulse might be materialized in a form where the self remains invisible within the space of the artwork and could often be traced back by observing several bodies of work alongside each other. The theme of time, for instance, could be rendered as date in works such as Public Notice 3, where two historical moments are overlaid like a palimpsest or in works such as Epilogue, every moon that his father saw in his lifetime becomes a labyrinth of fullness and emptiness with the image of the moon morphing with the form of a meal. Kallat is known for working with a variety of media, including painting, large-scale sculpture installations, photography, and video art. He employs a bold and vivid visual language that references both Asian and European artistic traditions, along with popular advertising imagery that fuels urban consumerism. Kallat regularly exploits images and materials chanced upon around Mumbai's sprawling metropolis, affording his works an inherent spontaneity and a handcrafted aesthetic. He unites these various media through themes that endure within Kallat's work, such as the relationship between the individual and the masses. He references his own personal experiences and those of Mumbai's other inhabitants. His work speaks of both the self and the collective, fluctuating between intimacy and monumentality, and characterized by contrasting themes of pain, hope and survival. Kallat's paintings address the problem of painting in an age dominated by mass media, writes art dealer and collector, Amrita Jhaveri, in A Guide to 101 Modern & Contemporary Indian Artists. \\"Using images from newspapers and magazines, advertising billboards, wallpaper and graffiti, his works are richly layered and replete with metaphor. Kallat has reinvented the painted surface to mimic the appearance of a television still or a computer monitor, complete with its surface striations and auras.Page 118, A Guide to Modern & Contemporary Indian Artists, Amrita Jhaveri, India Book House, 2005, Mumbai, India, \\" Work Artwork ‚ÄûHere After Here After Here‚Äú in Stockerau, Austria Much of Kallat‚Äôs work has been based on his encounters with the multi-sensory environment of Bombay/Mumbai, as well as the economic, political and historical events that have contributed to its making, wrote art historian Chaitanya Sambrani. \\"His practice as painter has frequently highlighted a concern he shares with the founders of Indian modernism in visual and literary art. Kallat has couched his references to the ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù in a hyper-pop language in order to signal the ironies that attend the lives of migrant workers and menial labourers in India‚Äôs megacities: people met on ‚Äúsecond class‚Äù train compartments, people whose labour continues to keep afloat the nation‚Äôs aspirations. In his installation and video practice, he has often revisited archival texts and museum displays with a view to probing the production and dissemination of knowledge.\\" In her essay, \\"The Mumbai Syndrome,\\" Patricia Ellis vouches for Kallat's engagement with painting as a subversively radical activity. \\"His approach has little to do with representation, abstraction, or formalism, but rather a total mimesis of concept,\\" His paintings are \\"not localised images constrained within borders, complications of space and perception, or even platitudes of self-defined invention. They're conceived as liminal gaps: peripheral mediations, metaphysical platforms of interconnection.\\" Jitish Kallat, Universal Recipient, Haunch of Venison, Zurich, 2008 Public Notice For the first in what would be termed as his Public Notice series, Kallat revisited the famous speech made by Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru before the stroke of midnight on 14 August 1947, to commemorate India's Independence against the British. Often recalled as the \\"Tryst with Destiny\\" speech, the historic address spoke of India's awakening into freedom after centuries of colonialism. Kallat hand-rendered the iconic text using rubber adhesive on five large acrylic mirrors before setting them aflame, thereby incinerating the words and producing mangled reflections that changed in relation to the viewer's position against the burnt glass. The 2003 piece was a political statement Kallat was making against the carnage of the Godhra Riots in February 2002. \\"The words are cremated... much as the content of the speech itself was distorted by the way the nation has conducted itself in the last six decades,\\" Kallat has said about the work.From Vivekananda to Kallat, Madhuvanti Ghose, from Public Notice 3 published by The Art Institute of Chicago, April 2011 Public Notice 2 Created in 2007, Kallat's Public Notice 2 is a large-scale display of letters formed out of 4,479 pieces of fibreglass bones installed on shelves against a background of saturated turmeric yellow reproducing the 1000-word speech given by Mahatma Gandhi on 11 March 1930 at the Sabarmati Ashram by the banks of the River Sabarmati in Ahmedabad a day before he along with 78 of his followers began the historic Dandi March to protest against the British-imposed tax on salt during which the virtues of Non-Violence were repeatedly insisted on by Gandhi. \\"The act of rehearsing a text from modern history and meditating on its relevance today is charged with a revisionary historicism: Kallat simultaneously places the text within its particular historical moment and reinvigorates it for present purposes,\\" art historian Chaitanya Sambrani wrote in an essay titled Of Bones and Salt: Jitish Kallat's Public Notice 2. \\"The first activity, that of historical situation, locates the text securely in the past; the second asks us to reconsider it so as to glean an insight into present exigences and possibilities for the future.\\" The work, according to Sambrani, represents \\"evidence of the past, scientifically gathered, enumerated, classified and sorted into significant units.\\"Jitish Kallat, Public Notice 2, published by Art Gallery of New South Wales and Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, 2015 Public Notice 3 In 2010 the artist installed his large-scale site-specific LED installation, Public Notice 3, at the Art Institute of Chicago.\\"Public Notice 3\\", The Art Institute of Chicago, Retrieved 16 September 2014. This installation was Kallat's first major exhibition at a US institution.\\"Jitish Kallat: Public Notice 3\\", The Art Institute of Chicago, Retrieved 16 September 2014. The artwork links two disparate yet connected historical events, the First World Parliaments of Religions, held in September 1893, and the much later terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, in September 2001. Kallat's 2004 piece Detergent could be seen as the prototype for Public Notice 3, a text-based work in which Swami Vivekananda's speech was rendered in the same way as in Public Notice. According to Madhuvanti Ghose, \\"Finally, Kallat's Detergent came 'home' when as Public Notice 3 it opened on September 11, 2010, at the Art Institute of Chicago. Swami Vivekananda's evocative words calling for universal toleration and the end of bigotry and religious fanaticism were presented on the Woman's Board Grand Staircase, a space approximating the stages of the two temporary halls in which he originally spoke: the Hall of Columbus, where his opening address had been delivered; and the Hall of Washington-an area now largely occupied by the museum's Ryerson Library-where Vivekananda spok on other occasions during the World's Parliament of Religions.'From Vivekananda to Kallat, Madhuvanti Ghose, from Public Notice 3 published by The Art Institute of Chicago, April 2011\\" References Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century Indian painters Category:Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art alumni Category:Artists from Mumbai Category:Indian contemporary painters Category:Indian male painters Category:Painters from Maharashtra Category:Indian contemporary artists ","title":"Jitish Kallat"},{"id":"1134060","text":"BFA may refer to: Art and entertainment * Bibles for America, an organization distributing free copies of the Bible and Christian books * British Fantasy Award  Education * Bachelor of Fine Arts, undergraduate degree for students in the United States and Canada seeking a professional education in the visual or performing arts * Beijing Film Academy, a coeducational state-run higher education institution in Beijing, China * Bellows Free Academy, St. Albans, a high school in the USA * Black Forest Academy, a private, coeducational boarding school in southwestern Germany Sport =Football (soccer)= * Bahamas Football Association * Beirut Football Academy * Botswana Football Association * Baltijos Futbolo Akademija =Other sports= * Baseball Federation of Asia * British Fencing Association * British Freediving Association Other uses * Boao Forum for Asia, an organization hosting forums discussing economic matters in Asia * Banco Financiero y de Ahorros, the parent company of Bankia * Blank-firing adaptor or blank-firing attachment, a device for using blank ammunition in automatic firearms * Books for Africa, a charity * British Florist Association * Battle for Azeroth, the 8th edition of World of Warcraft * British Franchise Association * Banana Framework Agreement ","title":"BFA"},{"id":"1134064","text":"Sleepy Township was an indie pop band which was formed in Perth in 1994 as a side project by Guy Blackman (guitar, electric organ, vocals), Mia Schoen (ex- Molasses) (guitar, electric organ, vocals), and Paul Williams (ex-Molasses) (drums, vocals).

Initially, no-one doubted the historicity of Lestek. In the second half of the nineteenth century, however, his existence began to be questioned. The issue was basically settled thanks to an article written by Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, Dynastia Piast√≥w we wczesnym ≈õredniowieczu (The Piast Dynasty in the Early Middle Ages), in which he came out in favor of the credibility of Gallus Anonymus's account, and thus in favor of the historicity of the three direct Mieszko's predecessors. This view is dominant in the Polish historiography. The origin of his name is not known, it can be derived from the old Polish word l≈õcie which means \\"crafty\\". It is believed this is a diminutive of the Slavic name L≈õcimir or L≈õcis≈Çaw. Lestek's wife (or wives or consorts) is unknown. A theory by Stanis≈Çaw Zakrzewski claims Lestek (or Lestko) could have been married to a Moravian princess. Another theory (inferred from the descriptions of a Belgian chronicler from the 14th century) is that a Saxon princess could have been Lestek's wife and that they had a son, Ewraker, later the Bishop of Leodium. Lestko's son, Siemomys≈Ç, was the next ruler of the Polish state.

The consciousness of the individual soul and the soul of God are the same. This knowledge, while normally acquired under the direction of a guru or teacher, is not taught in the traditional sense, but is experienced directly by the prepared student, by the process of insight alone, who performs the vicƒÅra.  In Vedanta  Vedanta is a form of monism or advaita (non-dualism), which sees the world as being all part of a single whole. One of the earliest teachers of Vedanta was Adi Shankaracharya, who wrote commentaries which helped organize and explain the subtle concepts of the Upanishads. Shankara taught that the reason why we suffer in life is because we are seeking happiness, fulfillment, and completeness in the external world of forms, in the form of kama (sense- pleasure), artha (security), and dharma (civic duty). As one reaches the last two stages of life, one realizes that none of these things brought lasting happiness and a sense of completeness. Shankara taught that the source of our suffering is a form of ignorance. Therefore, no action will cure this affliction. The lasting remedy is in the form of knowledge alone, and this is the knowledge of the true nature of Self. Once this knowledge is attained, by direct experience, it is said that one attains a kind of lasting happiness, and this prepares one for transition out of the world of name and form, i.e., death of the body.

Plot Leading Chief Petty Officer \\"Windy\\" Riker is a veteran aerial gunner of a Navy Helldiver dive bomber and the leading chief of Fighting Squadron One, about to go to Panama aboard the aircraft carrier. He loses his five-year title of \\"champion machine gunner\\" after young C.P.O. Steve Nelson joins the squadron. Windy, notorious for using his fists to enforce discipline, is charged by local police with wrecking a Turkish bath. Windy is saved from arrest, however, when Lieutenant Commander Jack Griffin, skipper of the squadron, intervenes on his behalf. Griffin and his second-in-command, Lieutenant \\"Duke\\" Johnson, agree that Nelson is the best candidate to replace Windy as he ponders retirement. The chiefs engage in friendly rivalry until the squadron practices a new dive-bombing technique and Steve becomes a hero, saving the base from being accidentally bombed by climbing out on the wing of his dive bomber to hold in place a bomb that failed to release. Feelings turn bitter when Steve contradicts Windy's explanation of the accident and Windy punches him in resentment. Windy is dressed down by Duke when the officer sees the punch. When Steve's sweetheart, Ann Mitchell, visits him, he proposes marriage to her, but Windy uses a practical joke to get even with Steve. Unaware that Ann is Steve's fiancee and not simply a girl he is trying to impress, Windy bribes an old acquaintance, Lulu, to pretend to be Steve's outraged lover. Ann leaves upset and will not listen to Steve's denials. Griffin loses an arm following a mid-air collision at night. The accident occurs when the aircraft are returning from delivering the admiral to his flagship the Saratoga before the squadron embarks. Griffin is retired and replaced in command of Fighting One by Duke Johnson. Windy becomes Johnson's gunner when the squadron flies to the ship. During a bombing exercise off Panama, Windy misplaces his code book and delays the takeoff of the squadron. As punishment, he is assigned to supervise a work party when the ship docks, missing liberty and keeping him from seeing Mame Kelsey (Rambeau), the woman in Panama he wants to settle down with after retirement. Lobby card Steve, who knows Mame, encounters her on the dock and shares her carriage, but Windy hears about it and sneaks into town. Mame tries to convince Steve to patch up his differences with Windy, then promotes peace between them when Windy shows up at her hotel. Having a drink together in the bar, however, Windy starts a brawl. Steve tries to help him avoid the local police but Windy is thrown in jail. As the Saratoga passes through the Panama Canal, Mame bails Windy out of jail and he catches up to it by stealing a boat. For his transgressions, the captain of the Saratoga reduces Windy one rate from chief. Windy is disciplined at \\"Captain's Mast\\" and reduced to Aviation Machinist's Mate 1st Class for leaving his post without authorization, absent without leave, and missing ship. Steve reluctantly becomes leading chief. During a mock battle, Steve's aircraft crashes near a rocky island, killing the pilot and leaving Steve with a broken leg. Duke and Windy land to rescue Steve, but Duke suffers a head injury and Windy has to save both. They have only a radio receiver and cannot be found in the fog. Steve and Windy become friends while waiting for rescue. Windy writes Ann a note confessing what he did with Lulu. After four days, Duke's condition worsens, Steve develops blood poisoning, and they hear on the radio that the Saratoga is leaving. Windy tries to save them by flying them out in Duke's dive bomber, with Duke in the rear cockpit and Steve riding on the wing. Despite the fog, they find the aircraft carrier, but crash on landing and Windy is fatally injured. By his last request, Windy is buried at sea as a missing man formation flies overhead.

Van Ronk's work ranged from old English ballads to blues, gospel, rock, New Orleans jazz, and swing. He was also known for performing instrumental ragtime guitar music, especially his transcription of \\"St. Louis Tickle\\" and Scott Joplin's \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". Van Ronk was a widely admired avuncular figure in \\"the Village\\", presiding over the coffeehouse folk culture and acting as a friend to many up-and-coming artists by inspiring, assisting, and promoting them. Folk performers he befriended include Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Patrick Sky, Phil Ochs, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and Joni Mitchell.

Life and career Van Ronk was born in Brooklyn to a family that was \\"mostly Irish, despite the Dutch name\\".Rock of Ages: The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll. p. 255, Pearson: 1987; He moved from Brooklyn to Queens around 1945 and began attending Holy Child Jesus Catholic School, whose students were mainly of Irish descent. He had been performing in a barbershop quartet since 1949, but left before finishing high school, and spent the next few years bumming around lower Manhattan and twice shipping out with the Merchant Marine. His first professional gigs playing tenor banjola were with various traditional jazz bands around New York, of which he later observed: \\"We wanted to play traditional jazz in the worst way ... and we did!\\" But the trad jazz revival had already passed its prime, and Van Ronk turned to performing blues he had stumbled across while shopping for jazz 78s, by artists like Furry Lewis and Mississippi John Hurt. By about 1958, he was firmly committed to the folk-blues style, accompanying himself with his own acoustic guitar. He performed blues, jazz and folk music, occasionally writing his own songs but generally arranging the work of earlier artists and his folk revival peers. He became noted both for his large physical stature and his expansive charisma, which bespoke an intellectual, cultured gentleman of many talents. Among his many interests were cooking, science fiction (he was active for some time in science fiction fandom, referring to it as \\"mind rot\\", and contributed to fanzines), world history, and politics. During the 1960s he supported radical left-wing political causes and was a member of the Libertarian League and the Trotskyist American Committee for the Fourth International (ACFI, later renamed the Workers League ). In 1974, he appeared at \\"An Evening For Salvador Allende\\", a concert organized by Phil Ochs, alongside such other performers as his old friend Bob Dylan, to protest the overthrow of the democratic socialist government of Chile and to aid refugees from the U.S.-backed military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. After Ochs's suicide in 1976, Van Ronk joined the many performers who played at his memorial concert in the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden, playing his bluesy version of the traditional folk ballad \\"He Was A Friend Of Mine\\". Although Van Ronk was less politically active in later years, he remained committed to anarchist and socialist ideals and was a dues-paying member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) almost until his death. Van Ronk was among 13 people arrested at the Stonewall Inn June 28, 1969‚Äîthe night of the Stonewall Riots, which is widely credited as the start of the gay rights movement. Van Ronk had been dining at a neighboring restaurant, joined the riot against the Stonewall's police occupation, and was dragged from the crowd into the building by police deputy inspector Seymour Pine. page scans The police slapped and punched Van Ronk to the point of near unconsciousness, handcuffed him to a radiator near the doorway, and decided to charge him for assault. Recalling the expanding riot, Van Ronk said, \\"There were more people out there [outside the building] when I came out than when I went in. Things were still flying through the air, cacophony‚ÄîI mean, just screaming and yelling, sirens, strobe lights, the whole spaghetti.\\" The next day, he was arrested and later released on his own recognizance for having thrown a heavy object at a police officer.Eskow, Dennis. \\"4 Policemen Hurt in 'Village' Raid: Melee Near Sheridan Square Follows Action at Bar\\", The New York Times, June 29, 1969, p. 33.

In 2000, he performed at Blind Willie's in Atlanta, clothed in garish Hawaiian garb, speaking fondly of his impending return to Greenwich Village. He reminisced over tunes like \\"You've Been a Good Old Wagon,\\" a song teasing a worn-out lover, which he ruefully remarked had seemed humorous to him back in 1962.

He continued to perform for four decades and gave his last concert just a few months before his death. Van Ronk died before completing work on his memoirs, which were finished by his collaborator, Elijah Wald, and published in 2005 as The Mayor Of MacDougal Street. In 2004, a section of Sheridan Square, where Barrow Street meets Washington Place, was renamed Dave Van Ronk Street in his memory.Dave Van Ronk street naming ceremony & pictures by Otto Bost. Retrieved July 9, 2008. Van Ronk was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously by the World Folk Music Association in 2004. Cultural impact Van Ronk has been described as an irreverent and incomparable guitar artist and interpreter of black blues and folk, with an uncannily precise gift for impersonation. Joni Mitchell often said that his rendition of her song \\"Both Sides Now\\" (which he called \\"Clouds\\") was the finest ever. His guitar work, for which he credits Tom Paley as fingerpicking teacher, is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision. It shows similarities to Mississippi John Hurt's, but Van Ronk's main influence was the Reverend Gary Davis, who conceived the guitar as \\"a piano around his neck\\". Van Ronk took this pianistic approach and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington. He ranks high in bringing blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, as well as introducing the folk world to the complex harmonies of Kurt Weill in his many Brecht-Weill interpretations, and was one of a very few hardcore traditional revivalists to move with the times, bringing old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell and Leonard Cohen. During this crucial period, he performed with Dylan and similar artists and spent many years teaching guitar in Greenwich Village, including to Christine Lavin, David Massengill, Terre Roche and Suzzy Roche. He influenced his prot√©g√© Danny Kalb and the Blues Project. The Japanese singer Masato Tomobe, American pop-folk singer Geoff Thais and the musician and writer Elijah Wald learned from him as well. He once said, \\"Painting is all about space, and music is all about time.\\" In his autobiography, Dylan writes, \\"I'd heard Van Ronk back in the Midwest on records and thought he was pretty great, copied some of his recordings phrase for phrase. [...] Van Ronk could howl and whisper, turn blues into ballads and ballads into blues. I loved his style. He was what the city was all about. In Greenwich Village, Van Ronk was king of the street, he reigned supreme.\\" Thanks to what he had learned from Davis, Van Ronk was among the first to adapt traditional jazz and ragtime to the solo acoustic guitar. His guitar arrangements of such ragtime hits as \\"St. Louis Tickle\\", \\"The Entertainer\\", \\"The Pearls\\" and \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" continue to frustrate and challenge aspiring guitar players. He also wrote compositions of his own in the classic styles, such as \\"Antelope Rag\\". His song \\"Last Call\\" is the source of the title of Lawrence Block's book When the Sacred Ginmill Closes. The Coen brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis follows a folk singer similar to Van Ronk, and incorporates anecdotes based on Van Ronk's life. Van Ronk was mentioned among the dead musicians and recording artists in the song \\"Mirror Door\\" by the Who in 2006 on the album Endless Wire. Personal characteristics Van Ronk refused for many years to fly and never learned to drive (he took trains or buses or, when possible, recruited a girlfriend or young musician as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village for any extended period of time (having stayed in California for a short time in the 1960s).Van Ronk & Wald (2005). pp. 113-114. Van Ronk's trademark stoneware jug of Tullamore Dew was frequently seen on stage next to him in his early days. Critic Robert Shelton described Van Ronk as \\"the musical mayor of MacDougal Street\\": > [A] tall, garrulous hairy man of three quarters, or, more accurately, three > fifths Irish descent. Topped by light brownish hair and a leonine beard, > which he smoothed down several times a minute, he resembled an unmade bed > strewn with books, record jackets, pipes, empty whiskey bottles, lines from > obscure poets, finger picks, and broken guitar strings.

The university has a tradition of service-oriented learning and an affiliation with the United Church of Christ. The university changed its name from Elmhurst College on July 1, 2020.  History  = From proseminary to university = In 1871, Jennie and Thomas Bryan gave land in Elmhurst to the German Evangelical Synod of the Northwest. This land was given for the purpose of establishing a school to prepare young men for the theological seminary and to train teachers for parochial schools, and was named the Elmhurst Proseminary. The first students, who were all male, studied Latin, Greek, English, German, music, history, geography, mathematics, science, and religion. All classes were taught in German. It wasn't until 1917 that the catalog was published in English. In 1919, the name was changed to the Elmhurst Academy and Junior College, and the expanded curriculum included courses in public speaking, physical education, economics, psychology, and the history of education. In 1924, the school was renamed Elmhurst College and became a four-year college for men. The college seal was designed in the 1920s by Robert Leonhardt, first registrar of the college, who also served as coach of the football team. Women first enrolled in 1930, and four years later, the college was accredited. The college began its graduate programs in 1998, and in 2012 the School for Professional Studies (SPS) was established to offer a wide range of online programs, including undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees and certificate programs. On June 15, 2019 the Elmhurst College Board of Trustees approved a name change to Elmhurst University, which took place July 1st, 2020. The Old Main building at Elmhurst College The campus is in Elmhurst, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. It is a certified Level 2 Arboretum and a member of Tree Campus USA, with more than 950 different species from around the globe. = Academic buildings and facilities = * The Frick Center houses lounges, two dining facilities, the Game Room, the Central Printing and Mail Room, conference rooms, the university radio station WRSE-FM (88.7mHz) as well as The Niebuhr Center for Engagement and Reflection, whose mission is to provide engaging experiences and meaningful reflection for the community to cultivate a sense of purpose in life. The offices of the Student Government Association, Union Board, the Elms Yearbook, Student Affairs and Student Activities are also in the Frick Center. Built in 1964 and formerly known as the College Union Building, it was renamed in 1994 to honor the university's eleventh president, Dr. Ivan E. Frick and his wife Ruth Hudson Frick. The Frick Center also houses the Blume Board Room, named in honor of former board of trustees member and graduate Allen C. Blume (1955) and his wife Phyllis, as well as the Brune Patio, named in honor of graduate and benefactor Joan Brune (1951) as a gift to the university from her husband, graduate and benefactor Lester H. Brune (1948). * The Barbara A. Kieft Accelerator ArtSpace houses a 750,000-volt Cockcroft-Walton particle accelerator. Originally built by Dr. Sam Allison, professor of physics at University of Chicago, it was moved to Elmhurst in the late 1960s and became operational in 1973. The accelerator was deactivated when the building began its new life as an art exhibition space in 2004. * The A.C. Buehler Library, named in honor of the former president of the Victor Comptometer Corporation and board of trustees member, is home to over 237,000 volumes and a highly regarded collection of Chicago Imagists art. It opened in 1971 and was renovated in 1993 and again in 2002, due to a donation from the estate of graduate Gladys (1940) and Ray Robinson. The library now has almost a hundred computers for general use and thousands of audio-visual materials. The library is also home for the Learning Center (tutoring and study skills assistance for students), the Center for Professional Excellence, which provides career guidance, resume assistance, internships, networking, mentoring and job shadowing opportunities for all students, as well as the Rudolf G. Schade Archives and Special Collections and the Honors Program student lounge. * Daniels Hall, renamed in 2008 in honor of former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and current Elmhurst University faculty member Lee A. Daniels, is home to the computer laboratories, the departments of Mathematics, Computer Science and Information Systems, World Languages, Literatures & Cultures, Intercultural Studies, and Geography and Geosciences. It opened in 1988 as the Computer Science and Technology Center. Daniels Hall is also home to the Graduate Admission office, as well as general classrooms, the Gretsch Recording Studio (named in honor of benefactor and graduate Fred Gretsch (1971) and his family), and specialized computer laboratories, including the Computer Gaming Club's computer room. * Constructed in 1911 as a dormitory and named for the fourth president, Daniel Irion, Irion Hall now houses the Music department. The building's 120-seat Buik Recital Hall (named in honor of The Buik family, including former board of trustees member Donald W. Buik and his wife Betty, as well as the John J. Roche family) is used for concerts, recitals and lectures. Buik was renovated in 2013 due to a donation from graduate and benefactor Lori Julian (2008). Irion Hall housed the college's first official library from 1912 to 1922. The building was fully renovated in 1979 and has its own recording studio as well as a choir room, rehearsal hall, percussion room, listening room, two music classrooms, extensive music libraries and individual practice rooms. * Kranz Forum is the site of a statue of Reinhold Niebuhr, a preeminent 20th-century theologian and 1910 graduate of the Elmhurst Proseminary, and the former site of Kranz Hall, constructed in 1873 and the first building on campus. The Niebuhr statue was sculpted by Robert Berks. Kranz Hall was razed in 1981, and Kranz Forum dedicated in 1982. The plaque noting the location of Kranz Hall is mounted on a base built with stone blocks salvaged from the original building. * Memorial Hall houses the Deicke Center for Nursing Education. Formerly Memorial Library, the building was named in honor of the 900 young men of the Evangelical Synod who lost their lives in World War I. The original dedication plaques for those lost are still located in the main lobby, which remains as it was when the building opened in 1922. Memorial Library was renovated for its current use and renamed Memorial Hall when Buehler Library opened in 1971. In 2014, the Nursing Simulation Laboratory moved out of Memorial Hall and into its new facility at Elmhurst Memorial Hospital in a collaboration between the two institutions. * Built in 1878 as a dormitory, Old Main (also known as Hauptgebaude) is the oldest building on campus. It houses the departments of Art, Urban Studies, History, Religious Studies, Sociology & Criminal Justice, and Political Science, as well as art studios (including individual spaces for student artists) and general classrooms. Old Main is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was renovated in 1920 after a major fire, and again in 1976 and 1995. At one time or another, Old Main housed the science labs, the college cafeteria, a pipe organ, and a Fumatorium (smoking room) where students in the early 1900s smoked, talked and played chess. Along with Irion Hall, Old Main even served as the University library (in an unofficial capacity) before Memorial Library was built. * Mill Theater was acquired by the university in the early 1960s. Before becoming the primary theatrical space for the college, the single story building functioned as the molding mill for the Hammerschmidt lumber operations. (Legend has it that David Payne, Theater Technical Director who died in an accident in 1968, haunts the theater and Scene Shop.) The theater itself is a thrust space with seating for 180. With the donations from alumni, improvements were made in 2010 which included a new lighting system, sound system, ventilation, and stage. The summer of 2012 saw a renovation of the lobby, doubling its size, and included the addition of a new box office, public restrooms and renovated theater seating, due to alumna Meredith Wallenberg Morrison's (1972) donation through The Wollenberg Foundation. A \\"black box\\" style theater like those found in many cities and towns, Mill Theater gives students hands-on experience with all aspects of theater operations, including the opportunity to direct as well as have their own original stage plays workshopped and possibly premiered. * The Science Center, dedicated in 1966 and renamed the Arthur J. Schaible Science Center in 1994 in honor of an accomplished graduate (1929) and benefactor, houses the Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Psychology, and Physics departments, as well as general classrooms and 120-seat lecture room Illinois Hall. It also houses the Bates Observatory, which has a 14\\" computer- controlled Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope and is named in honor of benefactors Alben F. Bates, an Elmhurst attorney, and board of trustees member Joy P. Rasin. Renovation was completed on the physics labs in 2014, the two main biology labs were renovated in 2015, and in 2016, two chemistry labs were renovated. * Goebel Hall, which opened in 1928 as the university gymnasium, was renovated in 1978 and again in 1989, when it was converted into an administration building and renamed in honor of the university's third president, Peter Goebel. Offices for Academic Affairs, Advising, Student Financial Services, and Registration and Records can be found there. The lower level houses the Football locker rooms. The college bookstore is located on the ground level on the west side and is operated by Beck's Books. * The Physical Education Center opened in 1983, and was renamed R.A. Faganel Hall in 2000 in honor of graduate Robert A. Faganel(1952). Faganel Hall houses the Kinesiology Department, athletic coaching offices, two basketball courts (competition and practice), two racquetball courts, a dance studio, training rooms, equipment rooms and team locker rooms. The Tyrrell Fitness Center was added on the west side of the building in 2001 and provides weight training and physical fitness facilities for students, faculty and staff. The center is named in honor of former board of trustees chairperson and graduate Tom Tyrrell (1967) and his wife Diane Tyrrell, who donated the funds for its construction. Chapel, from Stanger Hall * Hammerschmidt Memorial Chapel, dedicated in 1959 and named in honor of benefactor Louis Hammerschmidt and family, serves as both a place of worship and for public lectures, musical events and other assemblies. The building served as a temporary library in 1993 when the A.C. Buehler library was being renovated, then underwent its own renovation and reopened 1994. It houses the English and Philosophy departments as well as general classrooms. The chapel has two pipe organs, a Moller Opus on the stage in the main auditorium and a smaller pipe organ in the Prayer Chapel. The main auditorium seats about 1,000. * Lehmann Hall opened in 1951 as a senior men's dormitory, and is named after the university's seventh president, Timothy Lehmann. In 1982, it was remodeled and houses the Office of the President as well as Communication and Public Affairs, Development and Alumni Relations, Office of Campus Security, and academic departments Communication Arts and Sciences, Economics, and Business. * Circle Hall was dedicated in 2004, and houses the Admission Office, as well as the Speech Clinic, the Communication Sciences & Disorders department, the Education department, and general classrooms. * The Lester Brune Tennis Courts, built in 2003, are named in honor of graduate and benefactor Lester H. Brune (1948) as a gift to the university from his wife, graduate and benefactor Joan Brune (1951). = Social justice history = In 1943‚Äì44, Elmhurst University admitted four new students from California‚ÄîAmerican citizens of Japanese descent, or Nisei‚Äîat a time when more than 110,000 people of Japanese descent had been sent to 10 government \\"relocation centers\\" in desolate regions of the American West. Elmhurst was one of a number of colleges and universities that attempted to right the wrong of the relocation camps by opening its doors to Japanese-American students during World War II. (The U.S. government agreed that the Nisei could enroll in participating schools, provided that they passed an FBI background check.) The Student Refugee Committee, a new campus organization, and President Timothy Lehmann paved the way for the students to enroll‚Äîover the vocal opposition of a small group of local residents, including members of the American Legion. The Elmhurst Press ran a front-page editorial with the headline, \\"No Room For Jap Students in this Town\\". However, support for the Nisei on campus was \\"practically 100 percent,\\" President Lehmann noted at the time. In the summer of 1966, the university brought Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the podium of Hammerschmidt Memorial Chapel during Dr. King‚Äôs historic, yearlong effort to racially desegregate city and suburban neighborhoods in the Chicago area. The university later established an annual Martin Luther King Jr. Guestship, which examines issues and ideas related to Dr. King‚Äôs work. The university has fourteen Social Action and Service Groups for students to join, among them Habitat for Humanity, Best Buddies, Active Minds, the Global Poverty Club, Relay for Life, Autism Speaks, Students Assisting Animal Shelters, the Greenjays (sustainability club), Alpha Phi Omega and others. In 2011, the university decided to include an optional question about prospective students‚Äô sexual orientation and gender identity in its admission application in order to better serve all Elmhurst University students. Academics Elmhurst University offers bachelor's degrees and master's degrees. Approximately 3,350 full-time and part-time students are enrolled in its 26 undergraduate academic departments, 15 certificate programs, and 17 master's programs, including a MBA. There are also 15 preprofessional programs, and accelerated Degree Completion Programs designed primarily for working adults. The college offers 63 majors and allows students the flexibility to create their own. The Elmhurst University Integrated Curriculum (EUIC) requires each student to take several courses from the Areas of Knowledge curriculum and the Skill and Value Development subjects, but there is a wide variety of classes that can be used to fulfill these requirements. The average class has 17 students, although lower class sizes exist primarily in courses tailored to fine arts majors. Traditional general educational classes range between 25-35 students per class. The student to faculty ratio is 13 to 1. The university has a 4-1-4 academic calendar (four month fall term, optional one month January term (J-term), and four month spring term) as well as two summer school sessions. The EUabroad program offers students short- and long-term opportunities to study in foreign countries, including bilateral foreign exchange programs with educational institutions around the world. The Elmhurst Learning and Success Academy (ELSA) is a four-year program that offers a full-time, post-secondary educational experience to young adults with developmental disabilities. Elmhurst Partners provides corporations and organizations with credit and non- credit workforce training and development as well as customized business consulting. In the U.S. News & World Report‚Äôs Best Colleges rankings for 2017, Elmhurst was ranked #4 in the Best Value Schools in the Midwest category, up from #9 last year. Student life =Athletics= Elmhurst University is a member of the NCAA Division III College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). In women's bowling, a sport with a single NCAA championship open to members of all three NCAA divisions, the school had been a member of the Division II Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association through the 2018‚Äì19 season, but has since become a charter member of the Central Intercollegiate Bowling Conference, a new Division III bowling league. The Elmhurst Bluejays compete in 20 varsity sports for men and women in bowling, cross country running, soccer, golf, tennis, volleyball, basketball, track and field, softball, football, lacrosse, wrestling, and baseball. Elmhurst was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1925 to 1941 and joined the CCIW in 1946. Langhorst field is named in honor of the late Oliver M. Langhorst, multi-sport coach, athletic director and graduate (1930). Elmhurst University competes in only one club sport, men's rugby. The school has won two NCAA National Championships, both in women's volleyball in 1983 and 1985. =Student organizations= Elmhurst University has over 100 non- athletic student-run organizations. The university's radio station is WRSE-FM and the student newspaper is The Leader. MiddleWestern Voice is the Elmhurst University student-run art, literature, and music journal. The student yearbook is The Elms. Both The Leader and MiddleWestern Voice have online and print editions. WRSE's 320 watt signal reaches most of DuPage County and parts of Cook County and Kane County, Illinois, about one million people. It is also streamed online. =Greek life and honor societies= Elmhurst University is home to six sororities: Alpha Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu, Sigma Gamma Rho, Sigma Kappa, and Sigma Lambda Gamma and four fraternities: Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, and Lambda Chi Alpha. Elmhurst University also has active chapters of the male music organization Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and female music organization Sigma Alpha Iota. Fraternities and sororities do not have houses on or off campus. There are also 23 honor and recognition societies across of wide range of majors for those students with superior academic and leadership achievements. =Residence halls= Students who live on campus reside in six residence halls: * Dinkmeyer Hall, built in 1956, is named for Henry W. Dinkmeyer, the eighth president of the University, and houses 121 students. It is also home for The Leader newspaper office. * Niebuhr Hall was dedicated in 1962 in honor of theologian Helmut Richard Niebuhr, the university's sixth president and 1912 graduate of the Elmhurst Proseminary, and his brother Reinhold Niebuhr, theologian and 1910 graduate of the Proseminary. Niebuhr Hall houses The Wellness Center in the lower level, which includes student health and counseling services, as well as the Chaplain's Office. Niebuhr houses 121 first-year students. * Cureton Hall opened in 1999 as North Hall and was rededicated in 2010 in honor Bryant L. Cureton, the university's 12th president. It also houses the Brinkmeier Vista Lounge, the Master of Occupational Therapy offices and classrooms, and the Lucks Conference Room, named in honor of benefactor and board of trustees chairperson Barbara Lucks. Cureton houses 112 students. * Schick Hall, built in 1922 and expanded in 1967 and again in 1970, is named for Herman J. Schick, the fifth president of the university. Schick houses 208 students. * Stanger Hall, built in 1968, is named for Robert C. Stanger, the ninth president of the university. Stanger houses 165 students. * West Hall, completed in 2008, is an all-suite residence hall for 170 upper-level students. Each suite contains 2‚Äì3 separate bedrooms, private bathrooms, multiple vanities, living rooms and storage space. It is also the location for the Office of Residence Life. West Hall was the first building in DuPage County to receive the U.S. Green Building Council Gold level LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification upon its completion. Senior students are able to reside in campus apartments which include the Elm Park apartments (with housing for 28) and the Prospect apartments (with housing for 32), though exceptions have been made. There are also thirteen university-owned houses adjacent to campus that house a total of 52 upper-class students. =Traditions= The hash bell is a large hand bell rung at Elmhurst ceremonies as a reminder of the long history of the institution. This is the bell that kept the school on schedule in its early years, and generations of alumni have recalled fondly the loud clanging that woke students in the morning, assembled them for classes and activities, and then called them from their chores to dinner in the evening. One of the earliest Elmhurst catalogs declares: \\"Life in the institution is regulated entirely by the stroke of the bell.\\" Why it came to be called \\"the hash bell\\" remains a mystery. The Victory Bell is a large bell located in the corner of Langhorst Field which is rung by every member of the football team after every home victory. The bell was originally located in the Old Main bell tower and moved to Langhorst Field in a new stone tower as a gift from the class of 1964. A wood stage in the game room (located in the Bluejays' Roost in the lower level of the Frick Center) is where occasional open mic sessions for students are held, including poetry slams, improv comedy, literary readings and musical performances, sometimes impromptu. The Elmhurst University Jazz Festival, now in its 53rd year and one of the oldest jazz festivals in the nation, has brought hundreds of high school and college jazz bands from throughout the country and dozens of notable judges and performers such as Dizzy Gillespie, Doc Severinsen, Bobby Shew, Dee Dee Bridgewater, the Count Basie Orchestra, Maynard Ferguson, Clark Terry, Cannonball Adderley, Diane Schuur, Marian McPartland, Frank Mantooth and many others to the stage at Hammerschmidt Chapel. Now in its 23rd year, the Elmhurst University Summer Extravaganza is a free jazz concert held in the College Mall on a Saturday in June. The Manhattan Transfer, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Doc Severinsen have been among the guest performers with the Elmhurst University Jazz Band. Student, faculty and staff signatures and dates can be seen inside the clock tower in Old Main, some dating back to the founding years of the university's history.

Schedler Honors College is an interdisciplinary program at the University of Central Arkansas. One of the first Honors Colleges (in contrast to numerous honors programs) in the country, the Schedler Honors College leads to the receipt of a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies. Successful completion of the minor requires a senior thesis or a supplemental senior project such as a performance, exhibit, or other creative work. History The college was founded in 1982 by professor of philosophy Dr. Norbert Schedler and was one of the first Honors Colleges in the United States. About the Honors College The first class in the spring of 1982 was composed of 60 students with an average ACT score of 26.8 and a very tight budget. Graduation requirements The Interdisciplinary Studies Minor is satisfied by the completion of a two-tiered system of courses. The first tier of Honors courses makes up the Honors Program. These four courses are considered the core classes and the credit from these classes is applied to the students' general education requirements. The typical sequence of class in the first tier is *Honors Core I *Honors Core II *Honors Core III *Honors Core IV During a student's sophomore year, the student must complete a sophomore lecture on a subject of their choice and meet certain GPA requirements in order to continue into the Honors college, the second tier of Honors course work. The 15 credit hours in the second tier satisfy the requirements for an Interdisciplinary Studies Minor. In satisfying the minor requirements, students develop their own curriculum by selecting from a variety of course offerings. For completion of the minor the minimum the student must complete: *2 Junior Seminars *1 Senior Seminar *1 Oxford Tutorial *1 Honors Thesis Upper level seminar courses are offered in subjects such as religion, gender studies, constitutional law, ecology, storytelling, the history of science and technology, and social movements. Co-curricular activities The Schedler Honors College offers a number of activities that supplement their standard course load they call these co-curricular events. These include Hightables, a series of lectures given by visiting academics; Soapboxes, a series of discussion groups led by Honors students or faculty; a weekly meditation group; and a Foreign Film Series. These events are usually and hour to two hours in length and happen regularly throughout the semester. The Schedler Honors College also hosts two special events on a bi-annual basis. The first of these is called Issues in the Public Square. It is a weeklong series of lectures and discussion groups concentrating on a single theme. Events are led by students, faculty, and visiting academics. The second of these special events is called Challenge Week; this event falls on alternating years from Issues in the Public Square. Historically Challenge Week was a weeklong event but in recent years it has been expanded to two weeks to accommodate the increased number of speakers that are invited. Each Challenge Week concentrates on a theme, recent topics include ecology, intelligent design, and the cultural conflict in America. A number of guest speakers are invited for each Challenge Week, these lecturers are expert in their field and are the core of the events schedule. Hightables, Soapboxes, and roundtable discussions on related topics supplement these speakers. Past guest lecturers have included George McGovern, Ralph Nader, Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, Manning Marable, Neil Gaiman, Chuck Klosterman and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. References Sources *Schedler, N.

Conley's career spanned fifty years, but she was best known for her performances in daytime television, and in particular, for her portrayal of larger-than-life fashion industrialist Sally Spectra on The Bold and the Beautiful. Conley played the role from 1989 until her death eighteen years later. Darlene's character Sally is the only soap opera character to be displayed at Madame Tussaud's wax figures galleries in Amsterdam and Las Vegas.  Life and career  Conley, an Irish American, was born south of Chicago in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the daughter of Melba (n√©e Manthey) and Raymond Conley.Darlene Conley Biography ((?)-) In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Conley was employed with the traveling theater group the Chicago Uptown Circuit Players and Playwrights Company. She earned a bit part in the movie The Birds, which was followed by similar small roles in movies like Valley of the Dolls and Lady Sings the Blues. Darlene also appeared in the first episode of the fifth season of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as a prison warden. Darlene appeared on Little House on the Prairie in 1981, in the episode entitled \\"A Wiser Heart.\\" = Daytime television = Darlene's performance as Rose DeVille on The Young and the Restless followed, with Conley playing many small roles on other soaps for most of the 1980s. She was the tough but basically decent prison warden Edith Hopkins on Days of Our Lives in 1983 during Liz Chandler's incarceration for Marie Horton's shooting. As Trixie on General Hospital from 1984 to 1988, she was an old hooker pal of Ruby's who worked at Kelly's. An encore as Rose De Ville inspired William J. Bell to cast her as flamboyant fashion maven Sally Spectra on his newer serial, The Bold and the Beautiful. She earned two Outstanding Supporting Actress Daytime Emmy nominations. She was friends with several actors who appeared on \\"B&B;\\", including Fabio, who has appeared on the show several times, usually under the guise of celebrating Sally's birthday. She was also friends with Phyllis Diller, who also appeared on the show as Sally's friend, Gladys Pope. = Illness and death = Conley became ill in 2004 due to a fall that broke several bones. She recovered from the fall and returned to work (although she was usually seated during her scenes). Reports surfaced in the media in the fall of 2006 that Conley had surgery and received treatment for stomach cancer. Conley died on January 14, 2007. B&B; featured a tribute to Conley; John McCook presented the tribute, which featured her memorable moments on the show. The show has kept the role of Sally Spectra alive. Sally's absence has been explained by having her son CJ tell his father, Clarke (and viewers), that Sally had taken a permanent vacation in St. Tropez. In late 2007, Sally decided to sell her fashion house. Nick Marone and Jackie Marone have bought Spectra and are running the company, under the guidance of Clarke Garrison. In late January 2017, the show revisited many of the storylines of Sally Spectra to introduce a new younger character, also named Sally, who is the niece of the original Sally Spectra. In addition the show brought back the original CJ to appear in several episodes. Despite Darlene Conley's death some 10 years ago, Sally Spectra was shown to be alive and well on the show.

The date 1912 is often identified as the time of the formation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a distinct party, and its history since then can roughly be divided into the following periods: * the early years of the Bolshevik Party in secrecy and exile * the period of the October Revolution of 1917 * consolidation of the party as the governing force of the Soviet Union * the Great Purge of the 1930s * the Khrushchev and Brezhnev periods (1953‚Äì1982) * the Gorbachev era of reform (1985‚Äì1991), which eventually led to the break-up of the party in 1991. The history of the regional and republican branches of the party does however differ from the all-Russian and all-Union party on several points.  Nomenclature  With its lineal predecessors and soi-disant heirs, the party used various names in succession: * 1898‚Äì1912: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ‚Äì RSDLP () * 1912-1918: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) ‚Äì RSDLP(b) () * 1918‚Äì1925: Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) () * 1925‚Äì1952: All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) () (often transliterated as VKP(b) or sometimes VCP(b)) * 1952‚Äì1991: Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) () * 1991‚Äì: various, including Communist Party of the Russian Federation ()  Formation of RSDLP(b)  In January 1912 the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party convened a 6th All-Russian Party Conference in Prague in the absence of their Menshevik adversaries. Over twenty Party organizations were represented. In the eyes of the Bolsheviks the conference had, therefore, the significance of a regular Party congress. In the statement of the conference which announced that the shattered central apparatus of the Party had been restored and a new Central Committee set up is the following statement: \\"Not only have the banner of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, its program and its revolutionary traditions survived, but so has its organization, which persecution may have undermined and weakened, but could never utterly destroy.\\" Moreover, the conference declared the Mensheviks expelled from the party. Thus the RSDLP effectively split, with the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks constituting separate political parties (Both groups would continue to use the name \\"RSDLP\\". The Bolshevik party added \\"bolshevik\\" to their name to differentiate themselves from the Mensheviks.) In its resolution on the reports presented by the local organizations, the conference noted that \\"energetic work is being conducted everywhere among the Social-Democratic workers with the object of strengthening the local illegal Social-Democratic organizations and groups\\". The conference noted that the most important rule of Bolshevik tactics in periods of retreat - to combine illegal work with legal work within the various legally existing workers' societies and unions - was being observed in all the localities. The Prague Conference elected a Bolshevik Central Committee of the Party, consisting of: * Vladimir Lenin * Joseph Stalin * Sergo Ordzhonikidze * Yakov Sverdlov * Suren Spandaryan * Filipp Goloshchyokin and others. Stalin and Sverdlov won election to the Central Committee despite their non-attendance at the conference, as they were in exile at the time. The elected alternate members of the Central Committee included Mikhail Kalinin. For the direction of revolutionary work in Russia a practical center (the Russian Bureau of the C.C.) was set up, with Stalin at its head and including Y. Sverdlov, Spandaryan, S. Ordzhonikidze, M. Kalinin and Goloshchekin. History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 138-139. Writing to Maxim Gorky at the beginning of 1912, on the results of the Prague Conference, Lenin said: > At last we have succeeded, in spite of the Liquidator scum, in restoring the > Party and its Central Committee. I hope you will rejoice with us over the > fact.Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXIX, p. 19. Speaking of the significance of the Prague Conference, Stalin said: > This conference was of the utmost importance in the history of our Party, > for it drew a boundary line between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks and > amalgamated the Bolshevik organizations all over the country into a united > Bolshevik Party.Verbatim Report of the Fifteenth Congress of the > C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. ed., pp.361‚Äì362. In the summer of 1912, Lenin moved from Paris to Galicia in order to be nearer to Russia. Here he presided over two conferences of members of the Central Committee and leading Party workers, one of which took place in Krak√≥w at the end of 1912, and the other in Poronino, a small town near Krak√≥w, in the autumn of 1913. These conferences adopted decisions on questions relating to the working-class movement, including: the rise in the revolutionary movement; the tasks of the Party in connection with the strikes; the strengthening of the illegal organizations; the Social-Democratic group in the Duma; the Party press; the labor insurance campaign; and more.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 148  Emergence of Pravda  An important instrument used by the Bolshevik Party to strengthen its organizations and to spread its influence among the masses was the Bolshevik daily newspaper Pravda (Truth), published in St. Petersburg. It was founded, according to Lenin's instructions, on the initiative of Stalin, Olminsky and Poletayev. Pravda was intended as a legal, mass working-class paper founded simultaneously with the new rise of the revolutionary movement. Its first issue appeared on .In remembrance of the founding of Pravda, May 5 was celebrated as 'Workers' Press Day' in the Soviet Union. Previous to the appearance of Pravda, the Bolsheviks already had a weekly newspaper called Zvezda, intended for advanced workers. Zvezda had played an important part at the time of the Lena events. It printed a number of political articles by Lenin and Stalin. But the Party felt that with the revolutionary upsurge, a weekly newspaper no longer met the requirements of the Bolshevik Party. According to the analysis of the Party leadership, a daily mass political newspaper designed for the broadest sections of the workers was needed. Thus Pravda was founded. The tsarist government suppressed Pravda eight times in the space of two and a half years; but each time, with the support of the workers, it reappeared under a new but similar name, e.g., Za Pravdu (For Truth), Put Pravdy (Path of Truth), Trudovaya Pravda (Labour Truth), etc.. Whilst the average circulation of Pravda was 40,000 copies per day, the circulation of Luch (Ray), the Menshevik daily, did not exceed 15,000 or 16,000.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 149 In Moscow, the party launched Nash Put as a workers newspaper in September 1913. It was banned after just a few editions were published.  Work in the Duma  Another legally functioning central organ of the Party was the Bolshevik group in the Fourth State Duma. In 1912 the government decreed elections to the Fourth Duma. The RSDLP(b) decided to participate in the elections. The RSDLP(b) acted independently, under its own slogans, in the Duma elections, simultaneously attacking both the government parties and the liberal bourgeoisie (Constitutional-Democrats). The slogans of the Bolsheviks in the election campaign were a democratic republic, an 8-hour day and the confiscation of the landed estates. The elections to the Fourth Duma were held in the autumn of 1912. At the beginning of October, the government, dissatisfied with the course of the elections in St. Petersburg, tried to encroach on the electoral rights of the workers in a number of the large factories. In reply, the St. Petersburg Committee of the RSDLP(b), on Stalin's proposal, called upon the workers of the large factories to declare a one-day strike. Placed in a difficult position, the government was forced to yield, and the workers were able at their meetings to elect whom they wanted. The vast majority of the workers voted for the 'Mandate (Nakaz) of the Workingmen of St. Petersburg to Their Labour Deputy' to their delegates and the deputy, which had been drawn up by Stalin. The Mandate declared that the future actions of the people should take the form of a struggle on two fronts‚Äîagainst the tsarist government and against the liberal bourgeoisie. In the end, RSDLP(b) candidate Badayev was elected to the Duma by the workers of St. Petersburg. The workers voted in the elections to the Duma separately from other sections of the population (this was known as the worker curia). Of the nine deputies elected from the worker curia, six were members of the RSDLP(b): Badayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, Samoilov, Shagov and Malinovsky (the latter subsequently turned out to be an agentprovocateur). The Bolshevik deputies were elected from the big industrial centres, in which not less than four- fifths of the working class were concentrated. After the election, the RSDLP(b) formed a joint Social-Democratic Duma group together with the Mensheviks (who had seven seats). In October 1913, after a series of controversies with the Mensheviks, the RSDLP(b) Duma members, on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, withdrew from the joint Social-Democratic group and formed an independent Bolshevik Duma group. In the Duma, the Bolsheviks introduced a bill providing for an 8-hour working day. It was voted down, but had a significant agitational value for the Bolsheviks.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 154-156  Outbreak of World War I  In July 1914 the Tsarist government called for general mobilization. Russia entered into war with Germany. The First World War had begun. The RSDLP(b) denounced the war as imperialist. Moreover, the party denounced the European Social Democratic parties, who supported the war efforts of their respective countries, as 'social- chauvinists'. From the very outbreak of the war Lenin began to muster forces for the creation of a new International, the Third International. In the manifesto against the war it issued in November 1914, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party already called for the formation of the Third International in place of the Second International. In February 1915, a conference of Socialists of the Entente countries was held in London. The RSDLP(b) delegate Litvinov, on Lenin's instructions, spoke at this conference demanding that the Socialists should resign from the national governments of Belgium and France, completely break with the imperialists and refuse to collaborate with them. He demanded that all Socialists should wage a determined struggle against their imperialist governments and condemn the voting of war credits. But no voice in support of Litvinov was raised at this conference. At the beginning of September 1915 the first conference of internationalists was held in Zimmerwald. Lenin called this conference the 'first step' in the development of an international movement against the war. At this conference Lenin formed the Zimmerwald Left group. But the Lenin felt that within the Zimmerwald Left group only the RSDLP(b) had taken a correct and thoroughly consistent stand against the war. The Zimmerwald Left group published a magazine in German called the Vorbote (Herald), to which Lenin contributed articles. In 1916 the internationalists succeeded in convening a second conference in the Swiss village of Kienthal. It is known as the Second Zimmerwald Conference. By this time groups of internationalists had been formed in nearly every European country and the cleavage between the internationalist elements and the 'social-chauvinists' had become more sharply defined. The manifesto drawn up by the Kienthal Conference was the result of an agreement between various conflicting groups; it was an advance on the Zimmerwald Manifesto. But like the Zimmerwald Conference, the Kienthal Conference did not accept the basic principles of the Bolshevik policy, namely, the conversion of the imperialist war into a civil war, the defeat of one's own imperialist government in the war, and the formation of the Third International. Nevertheless, the Kienthal Conference helped to crystallize the internationalist elements of whom the Communist Third International was subsequently formed.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 160-166. At the beginning of the war, in spite of persecution by the police, the Bolshevik members of the Duma‚Äì Badayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, Samoilov and Shagov‚Äì visited a number of organizations and addressed them on the policy of the Bolsheviks towards the war and revolution. In November 1914 a conference of the Bolshevik group in the State Duma was convened to discuss policy towards the war. On the third day of the conference all present were arrested. The court sentenced the Bolshevik members of the State Duma to forfeiture of civil rights and banishment to Eastern Siberia. The tsarist government charged them with high treason. At this point Lev Kamenev deviated from the party line. He declared in the court that he did not agree with the party on the question of the war, and to prove this he requested that the Menshevik Jordansky be summoned as witness. The Bolsheviks campaigned against the War Industry Committees set up to serve the needs of war, and advocated boycott of the elections of 'Workers Groups' of the Committee. The Bolsheviks also developed extensive activities in the army and navy. The party formed nuclei in the army and navy, at the front and in the rear, and distributed leaflets calling for a fight against the war. In Kronstadt, the Bolsheviks formed a 'Central Collective of the Kronstadt Military Organization' which had close connections with the Petrograd Committee of the Party. A military organization of the Petrograd Party Committee was set up for work among the garrison. In August 1916, the chief of the Petrograd Okhrana reported that 'in the Kronstadt Collective, things are very well organized, conspiratorially, and its members are all taciturn and cautious people. This Collective also has representatives on shore.' At the front, the party agitated for fraternization between the soldiers of the warring armies, claiming that the world bourgeoisie was the enemy, and that the war could be ended only by converting the imperialist war into a civil war and turning one's weapons against one's own bourgeoisie and its government. Cases of refusal of army units to take the offensive became more and more frequent. There were already such instances in 1915, and even more in 1916. Particularly extensive were the activities of the Bolsheviks in the armies on the Northern Front, in the Baltic provinces. At the beginning of 1917 General Nikolai Ruzsky, Commander of the Army on the Northern Front, informed Headquarters that the Bolsheviks had developed intense revolutionary activities on that front.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 168-172.  Bolsheviks during the 1917 Revolution  = February Revolution = The year 1917 was inaugurated by the strike of . In the course of this strike demonstrations were held in Petrograd, Moscow, Baku and Nizhni Novgorod. In Moscow about one-third of the workers took part in the strike of January 22. A demonstration of two thousand persons on Tverskoi Boulevard was dispersed by mounted police. A demonstration on the Vyborg Chauss√©e in Petrograd was joined by soldiers. \\"The idea of a general strike,\\" the Petrograd police reported, \\"is daily gaining new followers and is becoming as popular as it was in 1905.\\" On , a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in Petrograd. On the workers of most of the big factories were on strike. On International Women's Day, , at the call of the Petrograd Bolshevik Committee, working women came out in the streets to demonstrate against starvation, war and tsardom. The Petrograd workers supported the demonstration of the working women by a citywide strike movement. The political strike began to grow into a general political demonstration against the tsarist system. On the demonstration was resumed with even greater vigour. About 200,000 workers were already on strike. On large sections of working-class Petrograd had joined the revolutionary movement. The political strikes in the districts merged into a general political strike of the whole city. Demonstrations and clashes with the police took place everywhere. Slogans were raised like \\"Down with the tsar!\\", \\"Down with the war!\\", \\"We want bread!\\" On the morning of the political strike and demonstration began to assume the character of an uprising. The workers disarmed police and gendarmes and armed themselves. Nevertheless, the clashes with the police ended with the shooting down of a demonstration on Znamenskaya Square. General Khabalov, Commander of the Petrograd Military Area, announced that the workers must return to work by , otherwise they would be sent to the front. On the tsar gave orders to General Khabalov: \\"I command you to put a stop to the disorders in the capital not later than tomorrow.\\" But \\"to put a stop\\" to the revolution was no longer possible. On the 4th Company of the Reserve Battalion of the Pavlovsky Regiment opened fire, not on the workers, however, but on squads of mounted police who were engaged in a skirmish with the workers. A most energetic and persistent drive was made to win over the troops, especially by the working women, who addressed themselves directly to the soldiers, fraternized with them and called upon them to help the people to overthrow the tsarist autocracy. The practical work of the Bolshevik Party at that time was directed by the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party which had its quarters in Petrograd and was headed by Vyacheslav Molotov. On February 26 (March 11) the Bureau of the Central Committee issued a manifesto calling for the continuation of the armed struggle against tsardom and the formation of a Provisional Revolutionary Government. On the troops in Petrograd refused to fire on the workers and began to line up with the people in revolt. The number of soldiers who had joined the revolt by the morning of March 12 was still no more than 10,000, but by the evening it already exceeded 60,000. The workers and soldiers who had risen in revolt began to arrest tsarist ministers and generals and to free revolutionaries from jail. The released political prisoners joined the revolutionary struggle. In the streets, shots were still being exchanged with police and gendarmes posted with machine guns in the attics of houses. But the troops rapidly went over to the side of the workers, and this decided the fate of the tsarist autocracy. When the news of the victory of the revolution in Petrograd spread to other towns and to the front, the workers and soldiers everywhere began to depose the tsarist officials.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 174-176. On , the liberal members of the Fourth State Duma, as the result of a backstairs agreement with the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders, set up a Provisional Committee of the State Duma, headed by Rodzyanko, the President of the Duma, a landlord and a monarchist. And a few days later, the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, acting secretly from the Bolsheviks, came to an agreement to form a new provisional government of Russia, headed by Prince Lvov. The Provisional Government included Milyukov, the head of the Constitutional-Democrats, Guchkov, the head of the Octobrists and the Socialist-Revolutionary Kerensky amongst others. The Bolsheviks condemned the new provisional government as 'imperialist'. In the new political atmosphere after the Revolution, the party resumed publishing of legal journals. It resumed the publication of its legal periodicals. Pravda appeared in Petrograd five days after the February Revolution, and Sotsial- Demokrat in Moscow a few days later.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 177-180. = Return of Lenin = On April 3 (16), 1917, after a long period of exile, Lenin returned to Russia. On his arrival he presented his 'April Theses' to the party, formulating the political line for socialist revolution. Lenin proposed to replace the parliamentary republic by a Soviet republic as the most suitable form of political organization of society in the period of transition from capitalism to Socialism. Furthermore, Lenin suggested discarding the term 'Social Democrat' and replacing it with 'Communist'. He also repeated the call for a new, Third International. The Theses were presented at a party meeting in Petrograd, and subsequently at a meeting of both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in the same city. On April 14 a Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks was held. The conference approved Lenin's theses and made them the basis of its work. Within a short while the local organizations of the Party had also approved Lenin's theses. Opponents of Lenin's included Kamenev, Rykov and Pyatakov.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 183-187. = April manifestation = On April 20 the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b) called upon the masses to protest against the 'imperialist policy' of the Provisional Government. On April 20‚Äì21 (May 3‚Äì4), 1917, not less than 100,000 workers and soldiers took part in a demonstration. Their banners bore the demands: \\"Publish the secret treaties!\\", \\"Down with the war!\\", \\"All power to the Soviets!\\". The workers and soldiers marched from the outskirts of the city to the centre, where the Provisional Government was sitting. On the Nevsky Prospect and other places clashes with groups of bourgeois took place. The more outspoken counter-revolutionaries, like General Kornilov, demanded that fire be opened on the demonstrators, and even gave orders to that effect. But the troops refused to carry out the orders. During the demonstration, a small group of members of the Petrograd Party Committee (Bagdatyev and others) issued a slogan demanding the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. The Central Committee of the party sharply condemned the conduct this grouping as adventurists, considering this slogan untimely and incorrect, a slogan that hampered the Party in its efforts to win over a majority in the Soviets and ran counter to the party line of a peaceful development of the revolution.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 187. = 7th party conference = On April 24, 1917, the Seventh (April) Conference of the RSDLP(b) assembled. For the first time in the existence of the Party a Bolshevik Conference met openly. In the history of the Party this conference holds a place of importance equal to that of a Party Congress. The All-Russian April Conference showed that the Party was growing by leaps and bounds. The conference was attended by 133 delegates with vote and by 18 with voice but no vote. They represented 80,000 organized members of the Party. The conference discussed and laid down the Party line on all basic questions of the war and revolution: the current situation, the war, the Provisional Government, the Soviets, the agrarian question, the national question, etc. In his report, Lenin elaborated the principles he had already set forth in the April Theses. The task of the Party was to effect the transition from the first stage of the revolution, \\"which placed the power in the hands of the bourgeoisie . . . to the second stage, which must place the power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest strata of the peasantry\\" (Lenin). The course the Party should take was to prepare for the Socialist revolution. The immediate task of the Party was set forth by Lenin in the slogan: \\"All power to the Soviets!\\" The slogan, \\"All power to the Soviets!\\" meant that it was necessary to put an end to the dual power, that is, the division of power between the Provisional Government and the Soviets, to transfer the whole power to the Soviets, and to drive the representatives of the landlords and capitalists out of the organs of government. The conference resolved that the party should agitate towards the people that the Provisional Government represented the landlords and the bourgeoisie, as well as denouncing the policy of cooperation of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. The April Conference also discussed the agrarian and national questions. In connection with Lenin's report on the agrarian question, the conference adopted a resolution calling for the confiscation of the landed estates, which were to be placed at the disposal of the peasant committees, and for the nationalization of all the land. Regarding the national question, Lenin and Stalin declared that the party must support the national liberation movements of oppressed peoples against imperialism. Consequently, the party advocated the right of nations to self-determination even to the point of secession and formation of independent states. Kamenev and Rykov opposed Lenin at the Conference. Echoing the Mensheviks, they asserted that Russia was not ripe for a Socialist revolution, and that only a bourgeois republic was possible in Russia. They recommended the Party and the working class to confine themselves to 'controlling' the Provisional Government. Zinoviev, too, opposed Lenin at the conference; it was on the question whether the Bolshevik Party should remain within the Zimmerwald alliance, or break with it and form a new International. Lenin insisted that as the years of war had shown, while this alliance carried on propaganda for peace, it did not actually break with the bourgeois partisans of the war. Lenin therefore called for immediate withdrawal from this alliance and on the formation of a new, Communist International. Zinoviev proposed that the Party should have remained within the Zimmerwald alliance. Lenin condemned Zinoviev's proposal and called his tactics 'archopportunist and pernicious.'History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 188-190. = Work in the Soviets = On the basis of the decisions of the April Conference, the Party developed extensive activities in order to win over the masses, and to train and organize them for battle. The Party line in that period was to win a majority in the Soviets, by 'explaining the Bolshevik policy and exposing the compromising policy of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, to isolate these parties from the masses'. In addition to the work in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks carried on extensive activities in the trade unions and in the factory committees. Particularly extensive was the work of the Bolsheviks in the army. Military organizations began to arise everywhere. The Bolsheviks worked at the front and in the rear to organize the soldiers and sailors. A particularly important part in making the soldiers active revolutionaries was played at the front by the Bolshevik newspaper, Okopnaya Pravda (Trench Truth). A Petrograd Conference of Factory Committees was held from May 30 to June 3, 1917. At this conference three-quarters of the delegates already supported the Bolsheviks. Almost the entire Petrograd proletariat supported the Bolshevik slogan‚Äî\\"All power to the Soviets!\\" On June 3 (16), 1917, the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets met. The Bolsheviks were still in the minority in the Soviets; they had a little over 100 delegates at this congress, compared with 700 or 800 Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and others. At the First Congress of Soviets, the Bolsheviks insistently stressed the consequences of compromise with the bourgeoisie and exposed the imperialist character of the war. Lenin made a speech at the congress in which he declared that 'only a government of Soviets could give bread to the working people, land to the peasants, secure peace and lead the country out of chaos'. A mass campaign was being conducted at that time in the working-class districts of Petrograd for the organization of a demonstration and for the presentation of demands to the Congress of Soviets. However, the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet decided to call a demonstration for June 18 (July 1). The Mensheviks and Socialist- Revolutionaries expected that the demonstration would take place under anti- Bolshevik slogans. The Bolshevik Party began energetic preparations for this demonstration. Stalin wrote in Pravda that \\"...it is our task to make sure that the demonstration in Petrograd on June 18 takes place under our revolutionary slogans.\\" In the rally the Bolshevik slogans prevailed over Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary ones.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 191-193. = July Days = In early July, widespread discontent in St. Petersburg led to militant demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Following news of a failed offensive at the front, on July 3 (16) spontaneous demonstrations started in the Vyborg District of Petrograd. They continued all day. The separate demonstrations grew into a huge general armed demonstration demanding the transfer of power to the Soviets. The party was opposed to armed action at that time, for it considered that the revolutionary crisis had not yet matured, that the army and the provinces were not yet prepared to support an uprising in the capital, and that an isolated and premature rising might only make it easier for the counter-revolutionaries to crush the vanguard of the revolution. But when it became obviously impossible to keep the masses from demonstrating, the party resolved to participate in the demonstration. Hundreds of thousands of men and women marched to the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets, where they demanded that the Soviets take the power into their own hands, break with the bourgeoisie, and pursue an active peace policy. Notwithstanding the pacific character of the demonstration, units‚Äîdetachments of officers and cadets were brought out against it. Many were killed in the skirmishes.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 193-194. The ensuing crackdown resulted in the Kerensky government ordering the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership on July 19. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote State and Revolution, which outlined his ideas for a socialist government. = 6th Party Congress = The Sixth Congress of the RSDLP(b) sat in Petrograd from July 26 to August 3 (August 8‚Äì16), 1917, in semi-legal conditions. It was attended by 157 delegates voting and 110 delegates with voice but no vote, from 240,000 Party members. Lenin guided the congress from underground. He kept in touch with Petrograd through Bolsheviks assigned by the Central Committee who visited him at Razliv. Lenin's theses \\"The Political Situation\\", the article \\"On Slogans\\" and other items formed the basis for congress resolutions. While at Razliv, Lenin took part in drafting the most important resolutions of the congress. The congress unanimously elected Lenin its honorary chairman. The items on the congress agenda were: (1) Report by the Organising Bureau; (2) Report by the C.C. R.S.D.L.P.(B.); (3) Reports from Local Organisations; (4) Current Situation: (a) The War and the International Situation; (b) The Political and Economic Situation; (5) Revision of the Programme; (6) The Organisational Question; (7) Elections to the Constituent Assembly; (8) The International; (9) Unification of the Party; (10) The Trade Union Movement; (11) Elections; (12) Miscellaneous. The congress also discussed the question whether Lenin should appear in court. The congress heard the political report of the Central Committee and the report on the political situation, both of which were presented by Stalin on behalf of the Central Committee. The resolution on the political situation was based on Lenin's guiding recommendations. It appraised the political situation in the country following the July events, and set out the Party's political line at the new stage of the revolution. The congress declared that the peaceful development of the revolution was over and that power in the country had virtually passed into the hands of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. In keeping with Lenin's recommendations, it temporarily withdrew the slogan \\"All Power to the Soviets\\", because just then the Soviets, led by the Mensheviks and S.R.s, were an appendage to the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. This withdrawal did not imply renunciation of the Soviets as the political form of proletarian dictatorship. The congress advanced the slogan of fighting for the complete abolition of the dictatorship of the counter- revolutionary bourgeoisie and for the proletariat winning power in alliance with the peasant poor, through an armed uprising. The congress rejected the proposals put forward by Preohrazhensky, who contended that the socialist revolution could not win in Russia and that Russia could not take the socialist road unless a proletarian revolution was accomplished in the West. The congress also rebuffed Bukharin, who opposed the Party's course for the socialist revolution, saying that the peasants formed a bloc with the bourgeoisie and would refuse to follow the working class. The congress decisions laid special emphasis on Lenin's thesis of the alliance of the proletariat and the peasant poor as the paramount condition for the victory of the socialist revolution. \\"It is only the revolutionary proletariat,\\" said the resolution \\"The Political Situation\\", \\"that can accomplish this task‚Äîa task set by the new upswing-provided it is supported by the peasant poor\\"The C.P.S.LJ. in Resolutions, etc., Part I, 1954, p. 376 [in Russian]. The question whether Lenin should appear in court was one of the first items discussed by the congress. Stalin, who touched on it in replying to the debate on the Central Committee's political activity, declared in favour of Lenin appearing in court, on the understanding that Lenin's personal safety would be guaranteed and the trial conducted on democratic lines. Stalin moved a resolution to that effect. > It is not clear at the moment,\\" he said, \\"who is in power. There is no > guarantee that if they [Lenin and Zinoviev] are arrested they will not be > subjected to brute force. Things will be different if the trial is held on > democratic lines and it is guaranteed that they will not be torn to pieces. > When we asked the Central Executive Committee about this, they replied: 'We > do not know what may happen.' So long as the situation is not clear and a > covert struggle is going on between the nominal and the real authority, > there is no point in the comrades appearing before the authorities. If, > however, power is wielded by an authority which can safeguard our comrades > against violence and is fair-dealing at least to some extent ... they shall > appear.Minutes of the Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.), August 1917, > 1958, pp. 27 and 28 in Russian. V. Volodarsky, I. Bezrabotny (D. Z. Manuilsky) and M. Lashevich spoke in favour of Lenin appearing in court (provided his safety was guaranteed, the trial was public and representatives of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets attended it), and moved a resolution in that sense. G. K. Orjonikidze countered Stalin's position that a bourgeious court could give fair trial to a revolutionary leader of the working class. He stressed that Lenin must under no circumstances be delivered into the hands of the investigators. F. E. Dzerzhinsky, N. A. Skrypnik and others spoke against Lenin appearing in court. \\"We must say clearly and explicitly,\\" said Dzerzhinsky, \\"that those comrades who advised Lenin not to allow himself to be arrested did well. We must make clear to all comrades that we do not trust the Provisional Government and the bourgeoisie and will not deliver Lenin until justice triumphs, that is, until that disgraceful trial is called off.\\" After much debate, the Sixth Party Congress unanimously passed a resolution against Lenin appearing in court, expressed its \\"emphatic protest against the outrageous persecution of revolutionary proletarian leaders by the public prosecutor, spies and police\\", and sent Lenin a message of greeting. Y. M. Sverdlov reported on the Central Committee's organising activity. He pointed out that in the three months that had passed since the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference the Party membership had trebled, increasing from 80,000 to 240,000, and the number of Party organisations had grown from 78 to 162. The congress heard nineteen reports from local organisations. The speakers stressed the vast amount of work being carried on by local organisations and the steadily growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the working people. The congress discussed and approved the Party's economic platform, which envisaged nationalisation and centralisation of the banks, nationalisation of large-scale industry, confiscation of the landed estates and nationalisation of all the lands in the country, establishment of workers' control over production and distribution, organisation of proper exchange between town and country, and other revolutionary measures. The congress adopted the new Party Rules. The first clause of the Rules, dealing with membership, was supplemented with the stipulation that Party members should submit to all Party decisions. The new provision was introduced that persons seeking admission should present recommendations from two Party members and that their admission should be subject to approval by the general meeting of the organisation concerned. The Rules stressed that all Party organisations should be based on the principles of democratic centralism. Party congresses were to be convened once a year and plenary meetings of the Central Committee, not less than once in two months. The congress reaffirmed the decision of the Seventh Conference of the RSDLP(b) on the need to revise the Party Programme in the sense indicated by the conference. It found it necessary to call a congress before long for the express purpose of adopting a new Programme, and instructed the Central Committee and all Party organisations to begin discussing a revision of the Party Programme, preparatory to the congress. The congress resolution \\"Youth Leagues\\" said it was a pressing task to contribute to the formation of socialist class organisations of young workers, and obliged Party organisations to devote the greatest attention to this task. In discussing the item \\"The Trade Union Movement\\", the congress criticised the theory of trade union neutrality and pointed out that the trade unions had a vital interest in carrying the revolution through to a victorious end and that they could accomplish the tasks facing Russia's working class provided they remained militant class organisations recognising the political leadership of the Bolshevik Party. The congress made all its decisions subordinate to the chief objective, which was to train the working class and the peasant poor for an armed uprising to bring about the victory of the socialist revolution. In a manifesto addressed to all working people, all workers, soldiers and peasants of Russia, it called on them to gather strength and prepare, under the banners of the Bolshevik Party, for the decisive battle with the bourgeoisie. Among those the congress elected to the Central Committee were V. I. Lenin, Y. A. Berzin, A. S. Bubnov, F. E. Dzerzhinsky, A. M. Kollontai, V. P. Milyutin, M. K. Muranov, V. P. Nogin, F. A. Sergeyev (Artyom), S. G. Shahumyan, J. V. Stalin, Y. M. Sverdlov and M. S. Uritsky. At the congress the Inter-District Organisation of United Social-Democrats, a Menshevik dissident group to which Leon Trotsky belonged, joined the party. At the time of the merger the Inter- District Organisation of United Social-Democrats had 4000 members across Russia. = Dual power and debates of political action = The repression against the Bolsheviks ceased when the Kerensky government was threatened by a rebellion led by General Kornilov, and offered arms to those who would defend St. Petersburg against Kornilov. The Bolsheviks enlisted a 25,000 strong militia to defend St. Petersburg from attack, and reached out to Kornilov's troops, urging them not to attack. The troops stood down and the rebellion fizzled. Kornilov was taken into custody. However, the Bolsheviks did not return their arms, and Kerensky succeeded only in strengthening the Bolshevik position. During this period, the situation of dual power endured. While the legislature and provisional government were controlled by Kerensky in coalition with the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the workers' and soldiers' soviets were increasingly under the control of the Bolsheviks, who now had what amounted to their own private army. Factories, mills and military units held new elections and sent to the Soviets representatives of the RSDLP(b) in place of Mensheviks and Socialist- Revolutionaries. On August 31, the day following the victory over Kornilov, the Petrograd Soviet endorsed the Bolshevik policy. The old Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary Presidium of the Petrograd Soviet, headed by Chkheidze, resigned, thus clearing the way for the Bolsheviks. On September 5, the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies went over to the Bolsheviks. The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik Presidium of the Moscow Soviet also resigned and left the way clear for the Bolsheviks.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 202. Encouraged by the expansion of the influence within the Soviets the party, through its representatives with the Soviets, was able to call for a Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in the second half of October 1917.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 204. = Insurrection vs. Parliamentarism = The RSDLP(b) Central Committee spent September and October 1917 debating whether they should use parliamentary methods or whether they should seize power by force. With Lenin in hiding in Finland, the parliamentary line‚Äì advocated by Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and Rykov against Joseph StalinStalin, speaking at a meeting of the Bolshevik group of the All-Russian Democratic Conference, opposed participation in the Pre-parliament. He called the Pre- parliament a 'Kornilov abortion'. History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 204 and Leon Trotsky‚Äì at first prevailed. The Bolsheviks participated in the quasiparliamentary bodies convened by the Provisional Government, the All-Russian Democratic Conference and the smaller, more permanent Pre-Parliament. Lenin sent numerous letters to the Central Committee and to St. Petersburg party activists urging them to abandon the parliamentary path and overthrow the Provisional Government by means of an insurrection. In his articles and letters Lenin outlined a detailed plan for the uprising showing how the army units, the navy and the Red Guards would be used, what key positions in Petrograd would be seized in order to ensure the success of the uprising, and so forth. On October 7, Lenin secretly arrived in Petrograd from Finland. On the same day the balance of power within the Central Committee shifted in favor of the insurrection in early October, resulting in the party delegation withdrawing from the Pre-Parliament.See the excerpts from the Central Committee meeting minutes in V. I. Lenin. Toward the Seizure of Power: Part One, International Publishers, 1932 (Kessinger Publishing reprint) p.302 On October 10 the meeting of the Central Committee of the Party took place at which it was decided to launch the armed uprising within the next few days. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Party, drafted by Lenin, stated: Two members of the Central Committee, Zinoviev and Kamenev, spoke and voted against this decision. Although at this meeting Trotsky did not vote against the resolution directly, he moved an amendment proposing that the uprising should not be started before the Second Congress of Soviets met.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 204-205 = Preparing for the insurrection = The Central Committee of the party sent its representatives to the Donetz Basin, the Urals, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, the South-Western Front and other places to organize the uprising. Voroshilov, Molotov, Dzerzhinsky, Ordjonikidze, Kirov, Kaganovich, Kuibyshev, Frunze, Yaroslavsky and others were specially assigned by the party to direct the uprising in the provinces. Zhdanov carried on the work among the armed forces in Shadrinsk, in the Urals. Yezhov made preparations for an uprising of the soldiers on the Western Front, in Byelorussia. The representatives of the Central Committee acquainted the leading members of the Bolshevik organizations in the provinces with the plan of the uprising and mobilized them in readiness to support the uprising in Petrograd. On the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, a Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet was set up. This body became the legally functioning headquarters of the uprising. On October 16 an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Party was held. This meeting elected a Party Centre, headed by Stalin, to direct the uprising. This Party Centre was the leading core of the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and had practical direction of the whole uprising. At the meeting of the Central Committee Zinoviev and Kamenev again opposed the uprising. Meeting with a rebuff, they came out openly in the press against the uprising, against the Party. On October 18 the Menshevik newspaper, Novaya Zhizn, printed a statement by Kamenev and Zinoviev declaring that the Bolsheviks were making preparations for an uprising, and that they (Kamenev and Zinoviev) considered it an adventurous gamble. Lenin wrote in this connection: \\"Kamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed the decision of the Central Committee of their Party on the armed uprising to Rodzyanko and Kerensky.\\" Lenin put before the Central Committee the question of Zinoviev's and Kamenev's expulsion from the party for breaching party discipline, having disclosed the secret plans for an armed insurrection.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 206-207 On October 21 the party sent commissars of the Revolutionary Military Committee to all revolutionary army units. Throughout the remaining days before the uprising energetic preparations for action were made in the army units and in the mills and factories. Precise instructions were also issued to the warships Aurora and Zarya Svobody. Wary of a preemptive counterattack of the Kerensky government, the Central Committee of the party decided to initiate the uprising before the appointed time, and set its date for the day before the opening of the Second Congress of Soviets. = Insurrection in Petrograd = Kerensky began his attack on the early morning of October 24 (November 6) by ordering the suppression of the central organ of the party, Rabochy Put (Workers' Path), and the dispatch of armoured cars to its editorial premises and to the printing plant of the Bolsheviks. By 10 am, however, on the instructions of Stalin, Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers pressed back the armoured cars and placed a reinforced guard over the printing plant and the Rabochy Put editorial offices. Towards 11 am Rabochy Put came out with a call for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Simultaneously, on the instructions of the Party Centre of the uprising, detachments of revolutionary soldiers and Red Guards were rushed to the Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. Thus the uprising had begun. On the night of October 24 Lenin arrived at the Smolny Institute and assumed personal direction of the uprising. During that night revolutionary units of the army and detachments of the Red Guard kept arriving at the Smolny. The Bolsheviks directed them to the centre of the capital, to surround the Winter Palace, where the Provisional Government had entrenched itself. On October 25 (November 7), Red Guards and revolutionary troops occupied the railway stations, post office, telegraph office, the Ministries and the State Bank. The Pre-parliament was declared dissolved. The Smolny, the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and of the Bolshevik Central Committee, became the headquarters of the revolution, from which fighting orders emanated. The uprising also included the navy forces. The cruise ship Aurora turned its guns on the Winter Palace. On October 25 (November 7) the Bolsheviks issued a manifesto 'To the Citizens of Russia' announcing that the Provisional Government had been deposed and that state power had passed into the hands of the Soviets. The Provisional Government had taken refuge in the Winter Palace under the protection of cadets and shock battalions. On the night of October 25 the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace by storm and arrested the Provisional Government. At this point Petrograd was under the authority of the Bolshevik Party. = Second Congress of Soviets = The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened in the Smolny at 10:45 pm on October 25 (November 7), 1917, when the uprising in Petrograd was already in motion and the power in the capital had de facto passed into the hands of the Petrograd Soviet. The Bolsheviks secured an overwhelming majority at the congress. The Mensheviks, Bundists and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries left the congress, announcing that they refused to take any part in its labours. In a statement which was read at the Congress of Soviets they referred to the ongoing uprising as a 'military plot'. The congress then condemned the position of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The congress proclaimed that all power had passed to the Soviets: On the night of October 26 (November 8) the Second Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree on Peace. The congress called upon the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice for a period of not less than three months to permit negotiations for peace to put an end to the ongoing World War. While addressing itself to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent countries, the congress at the same time appealed to 'the class-conscious workers of the three most advanced nations of mankind and the largest states participating in the present war, namely, Great Britain, France and Germany.' It called upon these workers to help 'to bring to a successful conclusion the cause of peace, and at the same time the cause of the emancipation of the toiling and exploited masses of the population from all forms of slavery and all forms of exploitation.' That same night the Second Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree on Land, which proclaimed that 'Landed proprietorship is abolished forthwith without compensation.' The basis adopted for this agrarian law was a Mandate (Nakaz) of the peasantry, compiled from 242 mandates of peasants of various localities. In accordance with this Mandate private ownership of land was to be abolished forever and replaced by public, or state ownership of the land. The lands of the landlords, of the tsar's family and of the monasteries were to be turned over to all the toilers. By this decree the peasantry received over 400,000,000 acres (1,600,000 km¬≤) of land that had formerly belonged to the landlords, the bourgeoisie, the tsar's family, the monasteries and the churches. Moreover, the peasants were released from paying rent to the landlords, which had amounted to about 500,000,000 gold rubles annually. All mineral resources (oil, coal, ores, etc.), forests and waters were declared to be the property of the people.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 207-210 Lastly, Congress established a new government called the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom). Lenin became the Chairman of the new government, literally Premier, Trotsky became the first People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and other Bolshevik leaders took over other government ministries, which were known as \\"commissariats\\" until 1946. = Spread of the revolution = Soon the news of the uprising in Petrograd reached the other parts of the empire. For several days in Moscow the street were the scenes of street battles between Bolsheviks and opponents of the revolution.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 210 = Attempts of counter-revolution = The now deposed Kerensky attempted to retake Petrograd. On November 10, 1917, Kerensky, who during the uprising had fled from Petrograd to the Northern Front, mustered several Cossack units and dispatched them against Petrograd under the command of General Krasnov. On November 11, 1917, an organization calling itself the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland and the Revolution headed by Socialist-Revolutionaries, raised a mutiny of cadets in Petrograd. But the mutiny was suppressed by sailors and Red Guards without in evening of the same day, and on November 13 General Krasnov was routed near the Pulkovskiye Heights. Lenin personally directed the suppression of the anti-Soviet mutiny. In Moghilev, at the General Headquarters of the Army, General Dukhonin, the Commander-in-Chief, also attempted a mutiny. When the Soviet Government instructed him to start immediate negotiations for an armistice with the German Command, he refused to obey. Thereupon Dukhonin was dismissed by order of the Soviet Government. The General Headquarters was broken up and Dukhonin himself was killed by the soldiers, who had risen against him.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 210-211 = Debates of the line of the party = One sector of the party leadership, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov, Shlyapnikov and others, differed with Lenin over the political line of the party. They called for the formation of an 'all- Socialist government', which to include Mensheviks and Socialist- Revolutionaries. On November 15, 1917, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party adopted a resolution rejecting agreement with these parties, and proclaiming 'Kamenev and Zinoviev' strikebreakers of the revolution. On November 17, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Milyutin, disagreeing with the policy of the Party, announced their resignation from the Central Committee. That same day, November 17, Nogin, in his own name and in the names of Rykov, V. Milyutin, Teodorovich, A. Shlyapnikov, D. Ryazanov, Yurenev and Larin, members of the Council of People's Commissars, announced their disagreement with the policy of the Central Committee of the Party and their resignation from the Council of People's Commissars. The Central Committee of the party branded them as 'deserters' from the revolution and 'accomplices of the bourgeoisie'.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 211 = Relation to the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries = The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had a significant influence in the countryside, initially sided with the Bolsheviks. The Congress of Peasant Soviets which took place in November 1917 endorsed the Soviet Government. An agreement was reached between the RSDLP(b) and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and several of the Left SR leaders were given posts in the Council of People's Commissars (Kolegayev, Spiridonova, Proshyan and Steinberg). However, this agreement lasted only until the signing of the Peace of Brest-Litovsk and the formation of the Poor Peasants Committees, when a deep cleavage took place among the peasantry. At this point the Left SRs sided with the more affluent peasants and initiated a revolt against Soviet power. The revolt was suppressed by the Soviet Government. = Brest-Litovsk peace = However, Russia was still at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In the view of the Bolsheviks, the war had to be ended in order to consolidate Soviet power. The Soviet Government called upon 'all the belligerent peoples and their governments to start immediate negotiations for a just, democratic peace'. But the former allies of Russia‚ÄîGreat Britain and France‚Äîrefused to accept the proposal of the Soviet Government. In view of this refusal, the Soviet Government decided to start negotiations with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The negotiations began on December 3 in Brest-Litovsk. On December 5 an armistice was signed. Large sectors of the Russian political spectrum, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to the Whiteguards, opposed the negotiation policy of the Soviet Government. Moreover, a sector within the party had their doubts about the line of negotiations. Trotsky on one hand and the 'Left Communists' (led by Bukharin, a grouping also including Radek and Pyatakov) argued that the war should have been continued. On February 10, 1918, the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk were broken off. Although Lenin and Stalin had argued that peace be signed, Trotsky, who was chairman of the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, won the vote at the party's Executive Committee on 22 January 1918 and on 10 February 1918 promulgated his \\"no peace, no war\\" policy: the Soviet negotiators left the negotiations in the hope that pro-peace factions in the German Reichstag would ensure that Germany did not resume the conflict. Fighting resumed, and the German forces made rapid advances into Russian territory.Tooze, Adam (2014), The Deluge: The Great War and the Remaking of the Global Order, Penguin Books, , pp 132‚Äì133 At this juncture the RSDLP(b) and the Soviet Government issued the call‚Äì 'The Socialist fatherland is in danger!', urging the working class to join the Red Army. On February 18, 1918, the Central Committee of the party approved Lenin's proposal to send a telegram to the German government offering to conclude an immediate peace. However, the German offensive was maintained for a few days. The German government expressed its willingness to sign peace on February 22. Within the party, the debates continued. Bukharin and Trotsky, Lenin declared, \\"actually helped the German imperialists and hindered the growth and development of the revolution in Germany\\".Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXII, p. 307. On February 23, the Central Committee decided to accept the terms of the German Command and to sign the peace treaty. Large territories, including Estonia, Latvia and Poland, were passed over to German control, and Ukraine was converted into a separate state under German dominance. Moreover, the Soviet Government undertook to pay an indemnity to the Germans. The Moscow Regional Bureau of the party, of which the 'Left Communists' (Bukharin, Ossinsky, Yakovleva, Stukov and Mantsev) had temporarily seized control, passed a resolution of no-confidence in the Central Committee. The bureau declared that it considered 'a split in the Party in the very near future scarcely avoidable.' Moreover, the resolution declared that 'In the interests of the international revolution, we consider it expedient to consent to the possible loss of the Soviet power, which has now become purely formal.' Lenin branded this decision as 'strange and monstrous.' Later official Soviet history stated that this move on behalf of Trotsky, Bukharin and their followers had been part of a conspiracy to break the Brest-Litovsk agreement and to overthrow Lenin.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 215‚Äì218 = 7th Party Congress = The debate on the peace question was a major issue at the 7th party congress, inaugurated on March 6, 1918. This was the first congress held after the party had taken power. It was attended by 46 delegates with vote and 58 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 145,000 Party members. Actually, the membership of the Party at that time was not less than 270,000. The discrepancy was because, owing to the urgency with which the congress met, a large number of the organizations were unable to send delegates in time; and the organizations in the territories then occupied by the Germans were unable to send delegates at all. Reporting at this congress on the Brest-Litovsk Peace, Lenin said that '...the severe crisis which our Party is now experiencing, owing to the formation of a Left opposition within it, is one of the gravest crises the Russian revolution has experienced.'Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VII, pp. 293‚Äì94. The resolution submitted by Lenin on the subject of the Brest-Litovsk Peace was adopted by 30 votes against 12, with 4 abstentions. On the day following the adoption of this resolution, Lenin wrote an article entitled 'A Distressful Peace', in which he said: In its resolution, the congress declared that further military attacks on the Soviet Republic were inevitable, and that therefore the congress considered it the fundamental task of the Party to adopt the most resolute measures to organize the Red Army and to introduce universal military training. Moreover, the congress decided to change the name of the party to Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks), in order to differentiate it from the Mensheviks and other remaining factions originating from the RSDLP. At the congress a special commission, which included Lenin and Stalin, was elected to draw up a new Party program, Lenin's draft program having been accepted as a basis.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 218-220 = Invasion, Civil War and War Communism = The Soviet Republic soon found itself under military attack, both from a large number of foreign states as well as domestic opposition, the so-called Whites. In response to the military threats against the Soviet Republic the RCP(b) proclaimed the country an armed camp and placed its economic, cultural and political life on a war footing. The Soviet Government announced that 'the Socialist fatherland is in danger' and called mobilization into the Red Army. Lenin issued the slogan, 'All for the front!'. About half the membership of the party and of the Young Communist League went to the front. In the propaganda of the party it was a war for the fatherland, a war against the foreign invaders and against the revolts of the exploiting classes whom the revolution had overthrown. The Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defence, organized by Lenin, directed the work of supplying the front with reinforcements, food, clothing and arms. At this juncture the Socialist-Revolutionaries, began assassinating leading party members. They killed Uritsky and Volodarsky, and had made an attempt on the life of Lenin. Following this, the 'Red terror' was unleashed upon them and throughout Russia the Socialist-Revolutionaries were crushed. The party took active part in the military affairs, through the Political Commissars within the Red Army. The Political Commissats were responsible for political and ideological training with the army units. Faced with a situation of extreme material hardships, the Soviet Government introduced the policies of War Communism. It took under its control the middle-sized and small industries, in addition to large-scale industry, so as to accumulate goods for the supply of the army and the agricultural population. It introduced a state monopoly of the grain trade, prohibited private trading in grain and established the surplus-appropriation system, under which all surplus produce in the hands of the peasants was to be registered and acquired by the state at fixed prices, so as to accumulate stores of grain for the provisioning of the army and the workers. Lastly, it introduced universal labour service for all classes. In the viewpoint of the party, the principle of 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat' was put into practice.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 228-229 = Defeat of Germany = The First World War ended with the defeat of Germany and the overthrow of the German government. The Soviet Government now annulled its commitment to the Brest-Litovsk agreement and initiated a military and political struggle to reclaim Estonia, Latvia, Byelorussia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Transcaucasia.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 231 = Foundation of the Third International = Ever since the break with the Second International, the Bolsheviks had argued for the creation of a new Third, Communist International. In the new situation in Europe, with Soviet rule established in Russia and revolutionary uprisings taking place in Germany, Austria and Hungary, and with the traditional Social Democracy divided in many countries, a constitutive congress of the Communist International was held in March 1919.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 231-232 The RCP(b) was one of the founding parties of the new international, and its headquarters were in Moscow. = 8th Party Congress = The Eighth Congress of RCP(b) was held in March 1919. It assembled in the midst war. The congress was attended by 301 delegates with vote, representing 313,766 members of the Party, and 102 delegates with voice but no vote. In his inaugural speech, Lenin paid homage to the memory of Y. M. Sverdlov, who had died on the eve of the congress. RCP(b) Party Programme, adopted at the 8th Party Congress The congress adopted a new Party Program. This program included a description of capitalism and imperialism, and compared two systems of state‚Äì the bourgeois-democratic system and the Soviet system. It specified the specific tasks of the Party in the struggle for socialism: completion of the expropriation of the bourgeoisie; administration of the economic life of the country in accordance with a single socialist plan; participation of the trade unions in the organization of the national economy; socialist labour discipline; utilization of bourgeois experts in the economic field under the control of Soviet bodies; gradual and systematic enlistment of the middle peasantry in the work of socialist construction. The congress adopted Lenin's proposal to include in the program in addition to a definition of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism, the description of industrial capitalism and simple commodity production contained in the old program adopted at the Second Party Congress (of the RSDLP). Lenin considered it essential that the program should take account of the complexity of the economic system and note the existence of diverse economic formations in the country, including small commodity production, as represented by the middle peasants. Bukharin, however, proposed that the clauses dealing with capitalism, small commodity production, the economy of the middle peasantry, should have been left out of the program. Bukharin and Pyatakov differed with Lenin on the national question. Bukharin and Pyatakov argued against the inclusion in the program of a clause on the right of nations to self-determination; claiming that the slogan that would hinder the victory of the proletarian revolution and the union of the proletarians of different nationalities. Lenin refuted the standpoints of Bukharin and Pyatakov. An important place in the deliberations of the Eighth Congress was devoted to policy towards the middle peasants. The Decree on the Land had resulted in a steady growth in the number of middle peasants, who now comprised the majority of the peasant population. In the analysis of the party, the attitude and conduct of the middle peasantry was of momentous importance for the fate of the Civil War and Socialist construction. The analysis stipulated that the outcome of the Civil War would largely depended on which way the middle peasantry would swing, which group would win its allegiance. The new policy towards the middle peasant proclaimed by Lenin at the Eighth Congress required that the proletariat should rely on the poor peasant, maintain a stable alliance with the middle peasant and fight against the 'kulak' (rich peasant). The policy of the party before the Eighth Congress was in general one of neutralizing the middle peasant. This meant that the Party strove to prevent the middle peasant from siding with the kulak and with the bourgeoisie in general. But now this was not enough. The Eighth Congress passed from a policy of neutralization of the middle peasantry to a policy of stable alliance with them for the purpose of the struggle against the Whites and foreign intervention. The problems connected with the building up of the Red Army held a special place in the deliberations of the congress, where the so-called 'Military Opposition' appeared in the field. This 'Military Opposition' comprised a number of former members of the now shattered group of 'Left Communists'; but it also included some party cadres who had never participated in any oppositional activity, but were dissatisfied with the way Trotsky was conducting the affairs of the army. The 'Military Opposition' was hostile to Trotsky on the grounds that he relied on military experts of the old tsarist army, enemies in the eyes of the 'Military Opposition'. Lenin and Stalin condemned the 'Military Opposition', because it defended the survival of the guerrilla mode of operations and resisted the creation of a regular Red Army, the utilization of the military experts of the old army and the establishment of strict military discipline. In his response to the 'Military Opposition', Stalin said: A Military Commission was set up at the congress. The motivation behind this decision was to strengthen the Red Army and to bring it still closer to the party. The congress further discussed party and Soviet affairs and the guiding role of the party in the Soviets. During the debate on the latter question the congress repudiated the view of the Sapronov-Ossinsky group which held that the Party should not guide the work of the Soviets. Lastly, in view of the huge influx of new members into the Party, the congress outlined measures to improve the social composition of the party and decided to conduct a re-registration of its members. This initiated the first purge of the Party ranks.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 232-236 On March 25, 1919, the Central Committee elected by the 8th congress appointed a Politburo consisting of Kamenev, N. Krestinsky, Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky, and with Bukharin, Zinovyev and Kalinin as candidate members.–†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏: –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–±—é—Ä–æ –¶–ö: 1919‚Äì1920 ‚Äì –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏, —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è = 9th Party Congress = The 9th Party Congress met at the end of March 1920. It was attended by 554 delegates with vote, representing 611,978 Party members, and 162 delegates with voice but no vote. The congress defined the immediate tasks of the country in the sphere of transportation and industry. It particularly stressed the necessity of the trade unions taking part in the building up of the economic life. Special attention was devoted by the congress to a single economic plan for the restoration, in the first place, of the railways, the fuel industry and the iron and steel industry. The major item in this plan was a project for the electrification of the country, which Lenin advanced as 'a great program for the next ten or twenty years'. This formed the basis of the plan of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia (GOELRO). The congress rejected the views of a group which called itself the Group of Democratic Centralism and was opposed to one- man management and the undivided responsibility of industrial directors. It advocated unrestricted 'group management' under which nobody would be personally responsible for the administration of industry. The chief figures in this group were Sapronov, Ossinsky and Y. Smirnov. They were supported at the congress by Rykov and Tomsky.History of the CPSU(b). New York: International Publishers, 1939. p. 240 = In Baku = On February 20, 1920 the local cell of the party in Baku merged with the Hummat Party, the Adalat Party and the Ahrar Party of Iran, forming the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. = Merger of the Party of Revolutionary Communism = In 1920, after the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern had decided that there should be only one communist party in every country, the Party of Revolutionary Communism dissolved itself, and its members joined the RCP(b).V.I Lenin; Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder  Tenth Party Congress  The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the Tenth Party Congress of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the Workers' Opposition, and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party. In 1922 the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) (EKP) merged into the Yevsektsiya, the Jewish section of the party. This was one of two Poalei Zion (left zionists) groupings active in Russia at the time. The other, the Jewish Communist Labour Party (Poalei Zion), was prohibited in 1928.  Stalin's rise to power  The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. On Lenin's motion, Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party in April 1922. The next month Lenin suffered his first stroke and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deteriorated. Lenin's role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the Politburo ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924. As a result of Lenin's illness, the position of general secretary became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin's power grew. Following Lenin's third stroke a troika made up of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block Trotsky from taking power . Lenin, however, had become increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of Lenin's Testament and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus. Zinoviev and Bukharin became concerned about Stalin's increasing power and proposed that the Orgburo which Stalin, but no other members of the Politburo, be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin's role as general secretary. Stalin reacted furiously and the Orgburo was retained but Bukharin, Trotsky and Zinoviev were added to the body. Due to growing political differences with Trotsky and his Left Opposition in the fall of 1923, the troika of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev reunited. At the Twelfth Party Congress in 1923, Trotsky failed to use Lenin's Testament as a tool against Stalin for fear of endangering the stability of the party. Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the Central Committee but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin's objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament. Meanwhile, the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of People's Commissar of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay Lessons of October which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of permanent revolution which contradicted Stalin's position that socialism could be built in one country, Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned. With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with Bukharin and his allies on the right of the party who supported the New Economic Policy and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at the Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of Lenin's Testament which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like Molotov, Voroshilov and Mikhail Kalinin. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as \\"leader\\" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates. Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev formed a United Opposition against the policies of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence as a result of the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults and humiliations and in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself. Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky's criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new general line favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a Right Opposition. At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin's new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin's Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commisariats Stalin's control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.  Purge of the Old Bolsheviks  16th Congress poster In the 1930s other senior Communists, many of whom had been Stalin's allies were removed and many of them were executed or died in mysterious circumstances, including Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, Alexei Rykov and Nikolai Bukharin. Joseph Stalin instigated a series of purges against senior members of the party, culminating in the Great Purge of 1935 to 1938, with the key processes known as Moscow Trials. There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin's struggle for power. At the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) (February 1934) Sergei Kirov only received three negative votes in the election to the Politburo showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to Molotov's memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of General Secretary against Stalin. Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 \\"Congress of Victors\\", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police. Of 139 members of the Central Committee, 98 were arrested. Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov's murder. Zinoviev and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to show trials before being executed. The \\"investigation\\" continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into labor camps. Stalin claimed that Kirov's assassin, Leonid Nikolaev, was part of a larger conspiracy led by Zinoviev, Kamenev and ultimately Leon Trotsky against the Soviet government. Additional triggers for the purge may have been the refusal by the Politburo in 1932 to approve the execution of M. N. Riutin, an Old Bolshevik who had distributed a 200-pg pamphlet calling for the removal of Stalin and their refusal in 1933 to approve the execution of A.P. Smirnov, who had been a party member since 1896 and had also been found to be agitating for Stalin's removal. The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti- Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin's mind with Kirov's growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy's power over the party and the state. The Moscow Trials lasted until 1938 and were used to blame various former oppositionists (as well as numerous supporters of Stalin who were considered suspect for some reason or another) with the failure of Stalin's Five Year Plan to meet its goals as well as other problems in the Soviet Union. Numerous Bolshevik luminaries such as Bukharin, Radek, Rykov and Rakovsky were accused of plotting to overthrow Stalin or even conspiring with Hitler against the USSR and were tried and executed. The Great Purge saw the removal of 850,000 members from the Party, or 36% of its membership, between 1936 and 1938. Many of these individuals were executed or perished in prison camps. \\"Old Bolsheviks\\" who had been members of the Party in 1917 were especially targeted. At the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) held in 1939, only 2% of the delegates had also been delegates to the last congress held in 1934.  Stalinism  The labor camps were expanded into the infamous Gulag system under Stalin in his war against so-called \\"class enemies\\". Stalin also undertook massive resettlements of Kulaks, similarly to the Tsarist penal system of ssylka (resettlement in remote areas) which had been established to deal with political dissidents and common criminals without executing them. As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a cult of personality. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin's dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision. At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov and Mikoyan removed from the Politburo and diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium (plus eleven candidates) that was twice the old Politburo's size. However, an informal Bureau of the Presidium, comparable to the old Politburo, was established in order to make decision-making more manageable. This bureau consisted of Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Maksim Saburov, and Mikhail Pervukhin, with future decision-making limited in practice to the first four or five of these.  After Stalin  Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. Molotov had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between Beria (the feared leader of the NKVD), Malenkov and Khrushchev. At the meeting of the Presidium's inner bureau held immediately after Stalin's death, Beria proposed Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 ‚Äì the new Presidium had exactly the same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and Mikoyan were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the position of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party Secretariat on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles. Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless subordinates, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the Doctors' plot as a \\"fraud\\" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the gulags (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of Russification and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the Ulbricht regime in Germany to slow down the \\"construction of socialism\\" and institute liberal economic and political reforms. The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. Khrushchev was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the East German government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops (see Uprising of 1953 in East Germany). The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabilising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective putsch against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khrushchev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanoeuver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khrushchev won the support of Bulganin to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government. The 20th Congress of the CPSU held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev gave his famous Secret Speech denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of destalinisation which saw an end to the personality cult which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khrushchev but Georgy Zhukov the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev's demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called Anti-Party Group from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary. The execution of Beria also brought the NKVD and its successor, the KGB under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought an end to much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in Gulags that had marked the Stalin era. Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials. Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the Central Committee due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came to a halt under the new General Secretary, Leonid Brezhnev who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with Nikolai Podgorny to oust Khrushchev and then outmanoeuvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of Lavrentiy Beria in 1953. When Georgy Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich and other members of the so-called Anti-Party Group were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against Khrushchev they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to Mongolia in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khrushchev himself was deposed in 1964. Though initially, the USSR was again under a collective leadership, this time with Brezhnev as General Secretary, Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium and Alexei Kosygin as Premier of the Soviet Union. Brezhnev was able to consolidate power to become the leading figure, but he was never able to gather as much powers as Stalin and Khrushchev had done previously. At the 23rd Congress of the CPSU held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to pursue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry (see Kosygin reform), Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982. The aging Soviet leadership led to its being described as a gerontocracy. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a personality cult around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.  Gorbachev  Mikhail Gorbachev became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interregnum after Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 when the party was led first by Yuri Andropov and then by Konstantin Chernenko. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was the leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise stopgap candidate as Gorbachev ‚Äì Andropov's protege ‚Äì lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985. Gorbachev instituted policies of glasnost, perestroika, and acceleration. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the Russian Revolution, perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particularly the economic organisation of the country, while acceleration meant faster development of the economy. This period of liberalisation ultimately ended in the dissolution of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe. At the 27th Congress of the CPSU in 1986, Boris Yeltsin became a candidate member of the Politburo and offended party members in a speech that attacked the hidden privileges of the party elite. At the 1988 Party Conference Gorbachev launched reforms to reduce the party's control over the government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships. While Gorbachev was able to receive approval for his reforms from the party, the membership of the CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant to Gorbachev's policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservatism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies.  End of Communist rule  In 1989 Gorbachev allowed other political associations (de facto political parties) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its vanguard status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created post of President of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was elected to this post, which allowed him to remain head of state. From this point onward, Gorbachev's real power came from the presidency, though he remained general secretary. By the time of the 28th Congress of the CPSU in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society, the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the August Coup in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the New Union Treaty was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the \\"State Emergency Committee\\" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Vice President Gennady Yanayev was named acting president. The committee's eight members included Yanayev, KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, Internal Affairs Minister Boris Pugo, Defense Minister Dmitriy Yazov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov. The coup failed because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of Boris Yeltsin, who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. The KGB was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. The coup destroyed the CPSU politically. By nearly all accounts, the coup proved that the party was beyond reform. For all intents and purposes, Communist rule in the Soviet Union ended on August 24. That day, Gorbachev dissolved the Central Committee, resigned as general secretary and ordered all party units in the government dissolved. Vladimir Ivashko was chosen as acting general secretary later that day. However, actual political power lay in the positions of President of the Soviet Union (held by Gorbachev) and President of the Russian SFSR (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29, when the Supreme Soviet suspended all party activities on Soviet territory. On November 6, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all CPSU activities on Russian territory and confiscating all party property in Russia. On November 30, 1992; the Russian Constitutional Court not only upheld this decree, but barred the CPSU from ever being refounded. It accepted Yeltsin's argument that the CPSU was not a true party, but a criminal organisation that had ruled the Soviet Union as a dictatorship in violation of the Soviet Constitution. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia. Besides CPRF was founded during the Gorbachev era, several years before CPSU was abolished and was seen as a \\"Russian-nationalist\\" counterpart to CPSU. In other republics, communists established the Armenian Communist Party, Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan, Communist Party of Ukraine, Party of Communists of Belarus, Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Communist Party of Tajikistan. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the Union of Communist Parties ‚Äì Communist Party of the Soviet Union (SKP-KPSS). In Turkmenistan, the local party apparatus led by Saparmurat Niyazov was converted into the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan. In Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov converted the CPSU branch into the People's Democratic Party. In Georgia, the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the Communist Party of Georgia (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the United Communist Party of Georgia (SEKP). In Estonia, the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the Estonian Democratic Labour Party (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the Communist Party of Estonia. In Lithuania, the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. Branch of \\"progressive\\" communists led by Algirdas Brazauskas converted into the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, established in 1992. In Latvia, communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the Latvian Social Democratic Party. The remnants of CPSU became the Union of Communists of Latvia, which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the Socialist Party of Latvia.

He was one of the most prolific composers of frottola after Marchetto Cara and Bartolomeo Tromboncino. Biography Of his early life, almost nothing is known: the few sources we have range from attributing his birthplace to the Istrian peninsula to Lurano, which at the time was under the diocesis of Cremona, to Cremona itself. He appears in the records of Cividale del Friuli's Cathedral, near Udine, as a cleric. De Lurano spent time in Rome in the first decade of the 16th century, but the exact years are not known; he wrote music for a wedding of the niece of Pope Julius II in 1508. From 1512 to 1515 he was employed as maestro de cappella of Cividale Cathedral, and shortly afterwards moved to Aquileia, where he may have died. Works Most of his music is in the light secular form of the frottola, an ancestor of the madrigal. 35 of his frottole survive, along with two motets and a lauda. Stylistically they are typical of the time: homophonic texture predominates, with brief imitative passages at phrase beginnings; the melodies are memorable and easily singable. One of his frottola was evidently the favorite song of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, according to a manuscript source of the time. References and further reading *William F.

It is a fictionalised and sexually explicit treatment of an incident from 1930s Japan, that of Sada Abe. It generated great controversy during its release; while intended for mainstream wide release, it contains scenes of unsimulated sexual activity between the actors (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda, among others). Plot In 1936 Tokyo, Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) is a former prostitute who now works as a maid in a hotel. The hotel's owner, Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), molests her, and the two begin an intense affair that consists of sexual experiments and various self-indulgences. Ishida leaves his wife to pursue his affair with Sada. Sada becomes increasingly possessive and jealous of Ishida, and Ishida more eager to please her. Their mutual obsession escalates to the point where Ishida finds she is most excited by strangling him during lovemaking, and he is killed in this fashion. Sada then severs his penis. While she is shown next to him naked, it is mentioned that she will walk around with his penis inside her for several days. Words written with blood can be read on his chest: \\"Sada Kichi the two of us forever\\".

The French title was taken from Roland Barthes's book about Japan, L'Empire des signes (Empire of Signs, 1970). Censorship Strict censorship laws in Japan would not have allowed the film to be made according to ≈åshima's vision. This obstruction was bypassed by officially listing the production as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premi√®re in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored using reframing and blurring. In the United States, the film was initially banned upon its premi√®re at the 1976 New York Film Festival but later screened uncut, and a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. It was also banned because of a scene in which Kichi pushes an egg into Sada's vulva, forcing her to push it out of her vagina, with Kichi eating the egg. The film was not available on home video until 1990, although it was sometimes seen uncut in film clubs. At the time, the only European country in which the film was banned was Belgium, where it was originally banned for its explicit sex scenes. The ban was lifted in 1994, and the country has not censored a film of any kind since. At the time of its initial screening at the 1976 London Film Festival, the British Board of Film Censors recommended it be shown under private cinema club conditions to avoid the need for heavy cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems.Case Study: L'Empire des Sens (In The Realm Of The Senses) , Students' British Board of Film Classification page The film opened at the Gate Cinema Club in 1978. It was given an official countrywide cinema release in 1991, though the video release was delayed until 2000 when it was passed with an \\"18\\" certificate (suitable for adults only). All of the adult sexual activity was left intact, but a shot in which Sada yanks the penis of a prepubescent boy after he misbehaves was reframed, zooming in so that only the reaction of the boy was shown. In Australia, the film was originally banned because of obscenity; a censored version was made available in 1977. Only in 2000 did it finally become available in its complete cut. The pornographic content of the production also caused it to be banned in Israel in 1987. The film is available in uncut form in France, Germany, the United States (including The Criterion Collection), the Netherlands, Belgium and several other territories. In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec and British Columbia. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced. Controversy Due to its sexual themes and explicit scenes, the film was the cause of great controversy in Portugal in 1991 after it aired on RTP.What Culture#15; In the Realm of the Senses Some deemed it inappropriate even for the watershed slot, while others actually appreciated its airing. The film aired again on RTP2, almost unnoticed. Box office In France, the film sold 1,730,874 tickets, grossing approximately ($5,203,732). In Germany, where it released in 1978, the film sold 693,628 tickets, grossing approximately ($2,446,050). Combined, the film sold 2,424,502 tickets and grossed approximately in France and Germany. Popular culture Chaz Jankel of Ian Dury and the Blockheads fame, along with Kenny Young (Under the Boardwalk) made a pop song in 1980 called \\"Ai No Corrida\\" based on the movie's Japanese title. This song has since been recorded by many different artists, including Quincy Jones, whose version was a Top 20 hit in the UK. British Industrial band Clock DVA reference the movie on their song 'Blue Tone' from their 1981 album 'Thirst'.

The supporting cast features Thelma Ritter, Eli Wallach and Kevin McCarthy. The Misfits was the last completed film for both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. For Gable, the film was posthumously released, while Monroe died in 1962. The plot centers on a newly divorced woman (Monroe) and her time in Reno and Northern Nevada, spent with her friendly landlady Isabelle Steers (Ritter), an old school cowboy (Gable), the cowboy's tow truck-driving and plane-flying friend (Wallach) and their rodeo-riding, bronc-busting friend (Clift) in Dayton, Nevada, and in the western Nevada desert in 1960. The Misfits was a commercial failure at the time of its 1961 release but received critical acclaim for its script and performances. Plot In Reno, Nevada, 30-year-old Roslyn Tabor (Monroe) has filed for a quickie six-week Nevada divorce from her inattentive husband Raymond (McCarthy). As Tabor is entering the Washoe County Courthouse with her landlady Isabelle (Ritter), Roslyn ignores Raymond's attempts to talk to her and reconcile and stays with Isabelle. Isabelle is also a divorcee. After the divorce papers are filed, Isabelle takes Roslyn to a cocktail lounge at Harrah's Reno for drinks, to let the reality of her new divorce sink in. While at Harrah's, they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord 'Gay' Langland (Gable) and his tow truck driver best friend Guido (Wallach). After some good conversation, they invite Roslyn and Isabelle to Guido's old house in the Nevada country to help her forget about the divorce after Gay tells Roslyn that he is also divorced. The group arrives at the unfinished house Guido built for his late wife, who died several years earlier during childbirth. They all drink and dance. Roslyn has too much to drink, so Gay drives her home to Reno. Eventually, Roslyn and Gay move into Guido's half-finished house and start to work on it. One day after breakfast, Gay tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his own children, whom he has not seen for some years. Later that afternoon, Roslyn and Gay argue when Gay discovers a rabbit has been eating the lettuce in the garden. Gay states his intention to find and kill the rabbits which have been eating the vegetable garden they planted outside Guido's house. When Guido and Isabelle later show up at the house, Gay suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They then plan to go to a local rodeo in Dayton to look for and hire a third man for the job. In Dayton, they run into Perce Howland (Clift), a cowboy friend of Gay's, who is in Dayton to compete in the rodeo. Gay offers to pay for the broke Perce's $10 rodeo entry fee if he helps the group round up wild mustangs the next day. Isabelle sees her ex-husband Charles and his new wife Clara and decides to invite them to her Reno home instead of going to the rodeo with Gay, Guido, Perce, and Roslyn. Before the rodeo, Guido, Perce, Roslyn and Gaylord all drink at a Dayton bar, where wagers were made and won on Roslyn's ability to play a game of paddle ball. The group is nearly involved in a fistfight when a drunken patron at the bar spanks Roslyn's bottom as she plays paddle ball. At the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap. She then declares that all rodeos should be banned. Later in the rodeo, Perce is thrown by a bucking horse, and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, but he insists on riding a bull he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, resulting in a head injury. Later, after Roslyn dances with Perce, he passes out in a Dayton back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to. He tells her how his mother changed after his father died, giving his stepfather the ranch Perce's father wanted to leave to Perce. A drunken Gay then fetches Roslyn, telling her that he wants her to meet his kids, into whom he claims he unexpectedly ran. When Gay discovers his children have already left Dayton, he causes a public scene outside the bar in Dayton. Later on, during the drive home to Reno, a drunken Guido asks if Roslyn has left Gay, and offers to take his place. Back at Guido's house, Guido, intoxicated and sleepless, attempts to finish the patio he started. Perce awakens and nearly tears his bandages off, forgetting about his recent injury. Roslyn puts him to bed and sits down with Gay. He asks her if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue, and Gay goes to bed. The next day, Gay, Guido and Perce prepare to go after the wild mustangs, and Roslyn reluctantly tags along. After they catch a stallion and four mares, Rosalyn becomes upset when she learns that the mustangs will be sold and slaughtered for dog food. She then tells Gay she did not know she was falling in love with a killer. Gay tells Roslyn that he did things for her that he never did for any other woman, such as making the house a home and planting the garden. After the horses are captured, Roslyn begs Gay to release the horses. He considers doing it, but when she offers to pay him the $200 she won playing paddleball, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would let them go if she would leave Gay for him. She rebuffs him, telling him he only cares about himself. Perce also asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight. Perce frees the stallion anyway. After Gay chases down and subdues the horse all by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. They get into Gay's truck. As they are driving, Roslyn tells Gay that she will leave the next day. Gay stops the truck to pick up his dog and watches Roslyn joyfully untethering it. Gay and Roslyn realize that they still love each other, and drive off into the night. Cast Production Monroe and Gable The making of The Misfits was troublesome on several accounts, not the least of which was the sometimes 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) heat of the northern Nevada desert and the breakdown of Monroe's marriage to writer Arthur Miller. Miller revised the script throughout the shoot as the concepts of the film developed. Director John Huston gambled at night and drank, and sometimes took naps on the set. The production company is supposed to have helped cover some of his gambling losses. In a documentary about the making of The Misfits, actor Eli Wallach told a story of Huston's directing a scene in which Wallach was at a bar with Gable. Huston later told him that the most intoxicated he had ever been was the day before, even though he had seemed sober. Huston's lover, Marietta Peabody Tree, had an uncredited part. Huston got involved in other local Nevada activities outside gaming, including promoting the first annual Virginia City camel races‚Äîwhich have continued annually every September to this day. Huston's car overheated on the steep drive up to Virginia City via Hwy. 341 Geiger Grade, and Huston \\"executed\\" the car by reportedly firing a stunt gun blank into the radiator. Meanwhile, while her marriage to Arthur Miller had issues, Marilyn Monroe was drinking too much after work, and was using prescription drugs; according to Huston in a 1981 retrospective interview, he was \\"absolutely certain that she was doomed\\" a conclusion he reached while working on the film:\\"There was evidence right before me almost every day. She was incapable of rescuing herself or of being rescued by anyone else. And it sometimes affected her work. We had to stop the picture while she went to a hospital for two weeks.\\" Huston shut down production in August 1960 when Monroe went to a hospital for relaxation and depression treatment. Some close-ups after her hospital discharge were shot using limited soft focus. Monroe was nearly always late to the set, sometimes not showing up at all. She spent her nights learning newly written lines with her drama coach Paula Strasberg. Monroe's confidant and masseur, Ralph Roberts, was cast as an ambulance attendant in the film's rodeo scene. The other actors did not complain to Monroe about her lateness-they knew they needed her to finish the movie. Gable reminisced with Misfits author James Goode saying, \\"Long ago, if an actor was late, they were fired\\" Clark Gable insisted on doing some of his own stunts, but not including the scene of being dragged across the dry lake bed at more than . Director John Huston said after Gable's death he would never have allowed Gable to do the more dangerous stunts. Veteran Western actor Rex Bell (who was married to Clara Bow) made his final film appearance in a brief cameo as a cowboy. Bell was lieutenant governor of Nevada at the time. Thomas B. Allen was assigned to create drawings of the film as it was made. Magnum Photos had numerous staff photographers, including Ernst Haas , Inge Morath, and Eve Arnold, all were assigned to document the making of The Misfits. Inge Morath later married Miller, Monroe's former husband, a year after the film was released. During production, the cast's principals stayed at the now imploded Mapes Hotel in Reno. Film locations included the Washoe County Court House on Virginia Street, and Quail Canyon, near Pyramid Lake.Miller, 1995, p. 508 The bar scene wherein Monroe plays paddle ball and the rodeo scenes were filmed in Dayton, Nevada, east of Carson City. The final three weeks of The Misfits shooting, Miller and Monroe moved to the nearby Holiday Hotel and Casino, now the Renaissance Hotel, on Center Street in Reno. The Renaissance Hotel no longer has a casino. The climax of the film takes place during wrangling scenes on a Nevada dry lake 12 miles east of Dayton, near Stagecoach. The area today is known as \\"Misfits Flat\\". Filming was completed on November 4, 1960, 12 days before Clark Gable's death, and The Misfits was released on February 1, 1961, on what would have been Gable's 60th birthday. Reception There were high expectations, given the star power of the writer, director and actors. Producer Frank E. Taylor had heralded The Misfits as \\"the ultimate motion picture\\" before its release. =Box office= The Misfits failed to meet expectations at the box office and has been historically referred to as a \\"box office disaster\\" of its day. Despite being shot in black and white, the final cost was about $4 million, which was the estimated budget. The film grossed $4,100,000 in its initial USA release. It has brought more substantial profits to United Artists since its release on DVD. =Critical reception= Despite on-set difficulties, Gable, Monroe, Clift and Wallach delivered performances that modern critics consider superb.The Misfits - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes Many critics regard Gable's performance as his finest, and Gable, after seeing the rough cuts, agreed. Monroe received the 1961 Golden Globe Award as \\"World Film Favorite\\" in March 1962, five months before her death. Directors Guild of America nominated Huston as best director. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews and an average score of 7.97/10. In 2005, the film was nominated by the American Film Institute in the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores list. Aftermath Gable suffered a heart attack two days after filming ended and died ten days later on November 16, 1960. Monroe and Clift attended the premiere in New York in February 1961, while Arthur Miller attended with his two children. Monroe later said that she hated the film and her performance in it. Within a year and a half, she was dead of an apparent drug overdose. The Misfits was the last completed film for both Monroe and Gable, her childhood screen idol. As a child, Monroe had often claimed that Gable was her father. Monroe in The Misfits The documentary The Legend of Marilyn Monroe (1966) includes footage shot while The Misfits was being made. Miller's autobiography, Timebends (1987), described the making of the film. The 2001 PBS documentary, Making The Misfits, did the same. Primary sources such as The Making of the Misfits by James Goode, Conversations with Marilyn by W. J. Weatherby, and Miller's account, particularly his assertion that The Misfits script was a \\"valentine\\" for Monroe, inspired the docu-drama play Misfits by Alex Finlayson, which was commissioned by director Greg Hersov. Misfits premiered at The Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 1996, directed by Hersov and starring Lisa Eichhorn as Marilyn Monroe.Finlayson, Alex. Plays. Oberon Books. London, 1996. Arthur Miller's last play, Finishing the Picture (2004), although fiction, was primarily based on the events involved in the making of The Misfits. In 2005, Portland Magazine published \\"Maine's Misfits,\\" a story on Ever After Mustang Rescue, a farm in Biddeford, ME that rescues mustangs. Writer Stacey Chase refers to the 1961 film throughout the story. =Discovered scene= In August 2018, an un-released nude scene where Marilyn Monroe exposes herself while making love with Clark Gable, and which was thought to have been lost, was discovered. Home media The Misfits was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on May 8, 2012 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and on May 10, 2011 on Blu-ray.

Founded in 1907 as the Arkansas State Normal School, the university is one of the oldest in the U.S. state of Arkansas. As the state's only normal school at the time, UCA has historically been the primary source of teachers in Arkansas. UCA is noted for programs in nursing, education, physical therapy, business, performing arts, and psychology. The university comprises six colleges: the College of Fine Arts and Communication, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the College of Business, the College of Health and Behavioral Sciences, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Education. In addition to this UCA is home to five residential colleges and one commuter college, those being the HPaW Residential College, EDGE Residential College, The Stars Residential College, STEM Residential College, EPIC Residential College, and the Minton Commuter College. UCA has about 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the state. The university maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of approximately 17 to 1. Over 150 undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs are offered at the university. UCA occupies over 120 buildings within its . History Harding Plaza in front of Irby Hall. The Arkansas State Legislature created the Arkansas State Normal School, now known as the University of Central Arkansas, in 1907 by passage of Act 317 on May 14. The purpose of The Arkansas State Normal School was to properly train students to become professional teachers and centralize teacher training. Classes began September 21, 1908 with nine academic departments, one building on , 107 students and seven faculty members. Two faculty members taught in two departments and President Doyne taught pedagogy and Latin. In 1925, Arkansas State Normal School became Arkansas State Teachers College. The name change more accurately reflected the primary focus of instruction and mission of the institution. Flowers looking towards the south, central part of campus. By 1967, the mission of Arkansas State Teachers College had changed. Though teacher training was still an important part of the school's mission, other fields began to expand in liberal arts studies and in the emerging field of health care. To recognize the institution's existing academic diversity another name change was in order. In January 1967, Arkansas State Teachers College became the State College of Arkansas. President Silas Snow, who championed the name change in 1967, organized State College of Arkansas along university lines in preparation for still yet another name change. State College of Arkansas grew rapidly and offered an ever-widening range of degree programs. By January 1975, Snow‚Äôs efforts were realized as the State Department of Higher Education recommended State College of Arkansas be known as The University of Central Arkansas, or UCA. =Presidents= Torreyson Library, named after Burr Walter Torreyson. * John James Doyne (1908‚Äì1917) * Burr Walter Torreyson (1917‚Äì1930) * Heber L.

On Sunday, October 26, 2008, a shooting took place on the UCA campus shortly after 9:00pm CDT, outside of Arkansas Hall, a campus residence hall. Two students ‚Äì Ryan Henderson, 18, and Chavares Block, 19 ‚Äì were fatally shot. A third person, 19-year-old Martrevis Norman, a non-student visiting the campus, was shot in the leg and was treated at the nearby Conway Regional Medical Center. UCA Police Department arrested four suspects in the shooting. All four subsequently pleaded guilty and were sentenced to the Arkansas Department of Correction. Enrollment As of fall 2016, UCA has an enrollment of 11,487 students. Enrollment for 2015 was 11,754 and 11,698 for 2014. Retention for full-time, first-time undergraduates increased from 72.4 percent from fall 2014 to 72.9 percent from fall 2015. Graduate student enrollment is 1,872, while last year the number was 1,867 and the number of transfer students increased to 775 compared to 618 last year. Traditions Main Hall, the oldest building on campus. =Colors= The colors for UCA were decided the first year and according to an article in the November 24, 1908 edition of the Log Cabin Democrat, were said to be purple and silver. President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray. =Mascot= It wasn't until 1920 that the UCA athletic teams had a mascot. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920 the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, it wasn‚Äôt until April 7, 1921, that the teams were called the \\"Bears\\" in print. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas‚Äô nickname was the \\"Bear State\\". The women's teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006. =Main Hall= UCA's Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas. After the building was built it served a dual role as the administration building and as a classroom building. It continued to serve as the administration building until the 1960s. On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the National Register of Historic Places. =World War II Marker= UCA's World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003. The memorial contains the names and branch of service of forty-six UCA alumni who were killed during World War II. The memorial is a permanent reminder of those UCA alumni who gave their lives fighting for their country. =Senior Legacy Walk Brick Campaign= The Senior Walk is located in the courtyard in front of the Student Center. Each year, graduates will have the opportunity to purchase bricks as part of their class year. For $100, graduates can purchase a brick that will be inscribed with his/her name or the name of a graduate that a purchaser wants to honor. Academics Snow Fine Arts Center The University has 6 distinct colleges offering over 150 majors. These colleges are: The College of Business, the College of Education, the College of Fine Arts and Communications, the College of Health and Behavioral Sciences, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. In January 2010, UCA mass communication students launched The Fountain (now The Fountain Magazine), a daily source of news and information. The student-created website is named \\"The Fountain\\", after the historic landmark located on the university's campus. The Fountain merged with The Echo UCA's oldest student media outlet in January 2014 to combine print and online resources. The Fountain Magazine was created following the merger. Colleges The University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas, comprises six colleges. In addition to the programs offered at the colleges, it has a study abroad program. Students may, for example, study Literature in Italy and UK, healthcare in China or Sociology in Africa. Credits earned at several foreign universities may be credited towards a degree at UCA. UCA is also recognized as distinct by the Arkansas Department of Higher Education for being one of the nation's 20 Asian Studies Development Program's Regional Centers for Asian Studies, a joint program of the federally funded East West Center and University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Posterization occurs across the image, but is most obvious in areas of subtle variation in tone. Posterized photo of a hibiscus. Posterization or posterisation of an image entails the conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another. This was originally done with photographic processes to create posters. It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of color quantization. Cause The effect may be created deliberately, or happen accidentally. For artistic effect, most image editing programs provide a posterization feature, or photographic processes may be used. Unwanted posterization, also known as banding, may occur when the color depth, sometimes called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color ‚Äî hence the name. When discussing fixed pixel displays, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring. Additionally, compression in image formats such as JPEG can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an optical illusion, called the Mach band illusion, in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with dithering.  Photographic process  Posterization is a process in photograph development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing posterization from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density Separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.  Applications  Typically, posterization is used for tracing contour lines and vectorizing photo- realistic images. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and advances to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increases, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases. A visual artist, faced with line art that has been damaged through JPEG compression, may consider posterizing the image as a first step to remove artifacts on the edges of the image. Posterizing time  Temporal posterization is the visual effect of reducing the number of frames of video, while not reducing the total time it takes the video to play. This compares to regular posterization, where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not. The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light but without the contrast of bright and dark. Unlike a pulldown, the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the persistence of vision that video and motion pictures normally depend on). An animated GIF often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate. More formally, this is downsampling in the time dimension, as it is reducing the resolution (precision of the input), not the bit rate (precision of the output, as in posterization). The resulting stop-go motion is a temporal form of jaggies; formally, a form of aliasing. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use temporal anti-aliasing, which yields motion blur. Compare with time stretching, which adds frames. See also * Downsampling * Quantization error * Discretization error * Color quantization References * Langford, Michael. The Darkroom Handbook.

For example, if a web page has an i-number, and links to that page use the i-number, then those links will not break even if the page is renamed, the website containing the page is completely reorganized, or the page is moved to another website. Conceptually, an i-number is similar to an IP address, except i-numbers operate at a much higher level of abstraction in Internet addressing architecture. The other key difference is that i-numbers are persistent, i.e., once they are assigned to a resource, they are never reassigned. By contrast, IP addresses are constantly reassigned, e.g., your computer may have a different IP address every time it connects to the Internet. Technically, an i-number is one form of an extensible resource identifier (XRI) ‚Äî an abstract structured identifier standard developed at Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards for sharing resources and data across domains and applications. The other form is called an i-name. The i-number form of an XRI is designed to serve as an address that does not need to change no matter how often the location of a resource on (or off) the Internet changes. XRIs accomplish this by adding a third layer of abstract addressing over the existing layers: IP numbering (first layer) and DNS naming (second layer). The notion of a third layer for persistent addressing is not new ‚Äî Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and other persistent identifier architectures have been developed for this purposes. However the XRI layer is the first architecture that combines a uniform syntax and resolution protocol for both persistent and reassignable identifiers. At the XRI addressing layer, most resources will have both i-names and i-numbers. These different XRIs that all point to the same resource are called synonyms. I-name synonyms make it easy for humans to discover and address the resource, while i-number synonyms make it easy for machines to maintain a persistent identity for the resource. For example, if a company changes its name, it may register a new i-name and sell its old i-name to another company, however its i-number can remain the same ‚Äî and links to the company that use its i-number won't break. Furthermore, all of these forms of XRI synonyms can be resolved using the same http- or https- based resolution protocol. The results of XRI resolution are an XML document called an XRDS (Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence). XRDS documents are the basis for the Yadis identity service discovery protocol that is now part of OpenID. XRIs are also backwards compatible with the DNS and IP addressing systems, so it is possible for domain names and IP addresses to be used as i-names (or, in rare cases, as i-numbers). Like DNS names, XRIs can also be delegated, i.e., nested multiple levels deep, just like the directory names on a local computer file system. For example, a company can register a top-level (global) i-name and i-number for itself, and then assign second- or lower- level (community) i-names and i-numbers to its divisions, employees, etc.  Examples  The following examples conform to the i-number specifications published in the XDI.org Global Services Specifications.

Arrow was founded by Angus \\"Andy\\" Anderson, Karl Bacon, William Hardiman and Edgar Morgan. Originally located at 243 Moffett Boulevard, they relocated to a larger facility at 1555 Plymouth Street after Walt Disney Productions purchased one third of Arrow in 1960. They also had offices at 820 Huff Avenue. By 1956, then secretary Bill Hardiman,R. L. Polk Santa Clara County CA Directory, 1949-50 and Angus Anderson, then vice president,R. L.

Walter and his wife had been performing accounting services for several small companies in the Bay Area, including Duro-Bond Bearing, which is where he likely heard of Arrow. Schulze left Arrow after its sale to Rio Grande Industries. In 1979, Arrow listed over a dozen types of rides in their catalog including 15 corkscrews, five looping coasters, 12 runaway mine trains, 43 flumes and 77 automotive, for a total of more than 200 rides installed at nearly 100 locations around the world. Huss Trading Corporation purchased Arrow Development in 1981, but the combined Arrow-Huss would go bankrupt in 1984.

Andy, Bill, Ed and Karl met while working at the Hendy Iron Works in Sunnyvale, CA. The Hendy company had a contract with the US Navy to build torpedo launchers and marine steam engines. By 1942, Hendy was building hundreds of marine engines for Liberty ships. The number of employees increased to over 11,500 to meet demand. In June 1943, the union began enforcing a four-month ban on overtime, during which all machinists were to quit work after eight hours and refuse to work on Sundays. Hendy responded by announcing that all machinists who refused to work overtime would be discharged. Both Karl and Ed would recall later that being told to be on the picket line motivated them to start their own company. Neither Bacon nor Morgan saw active duty in the military, although Ed and his younger brother Eugene enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Ed was given a deferment based on his employment at Hendy. Eugene was killed in action in the South Pacific on December 16, 1944 while serving with the 868th Bombardment Squadron, flying special radar equipped B-24 Liberators designed for secret night bombing and escort missions.Interment Control Forms, 1928‚Äì1962.

By 1950, Arrow Development was known locally for its manufacture of carousels and other small amusement rides. =Contributions to Disneyland and Walt Disney World= Ed Morgan read a newspaper article about Disneyland and wrote to Disney about a small stern wheel paddle boat named ‚ÄúLil‚Äô Belle‚Äù, which Arrow had built in 1952. Disney wasn‚Äôt interested in the boat, but became interested in the vehicles that Arrow was creating for other amusement parks. Imagineer Bruce Bushman gave Ed Morgan a sketch of the \\"Mr. Toad\\" vehicle, and a prototype body was quickly fabricated. Morgan would later recall that Arrow landed their contract with Disney through the recommendation of Stanford Research Institute which did the site and population density research for Disneyland. Walt and Roy Disney had consulted with Harrison Price of SRI‚Äôs Los Angeles office on a proposal to build Disneyland in Burbank, California. Between 1953 and 1971 Arrow would be instrumental in designing and developing over a dozen ride systems and vehicles for Disney and were awarded multiple patents for their designs.US3006286, USD189828, US3113528, US3114332, US3167024, US3251595, US2404635, USD204282 Six of the opening day rides at Disneyland were built by Arrow; Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White's Scary Adventures.

The tram cars which carried guests from the parking lot to the park's entrance at Disneyland and Disney World were another Arrow Product. They also designed and built the ride systems for It's a Small World (1964/66), Pirates of the Caribbean, Adventure Through Inner Space (1967), and the Haunted Mansion (1969). Arrow has also been credited for improving the guidance system for the Submarine Voyage (1959) and prototyping a four-track version of Space Mountain for Walt Disney World in Orlando.Mouse Planet; WDW's Space Mountain by George McGinnis, July 6, 2005 Dana Morgan, the son of co- founder Ed Morgan, recalled that Arrow was involved in fourteen of the Walt Disney World attractions, including Dumbo the Flying Elephant and Peter Pan, Pirates of the Caribbean, the parking lot trams, Sky Buckets and the Prince Charming Carousel. The last ride system Arrow may have worked on for Walt Disney World would have been Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened November 15, 1980, two months before the merger with HUSS Maschinenfabrik which formed Arrow-Huss. =Non-Disney rides= The 1947 carousel at Alum Rock was later moved to the Happy Hollow Park & Zoo in 1964, where it still operates as the King Neptune's Carousel. Karl and Ed also set up a separate company called Easbey which won a contract with the city of Oakland, California to install rides at the Children's Fairyland at Lake Merritt, which was built in 1950. The Flecto Carousel was built by Arrow in 1950, although it was not installed at Fairyland until 2002. In 1955, Arrow built a demonstration children's park called Playtown, next to Palo Alto's Town and Country Village Shopping Center, where they demonstrated new rides including a miniature train, boat, \\"Arrow-plane,\\" and carousel. They also had a demonstration park across the bay near San Leandro and another in Los Altos. On August 21, 1960, a tragic accident occurred at Playtown involving the son of Frank Freidel, a visiting professor at Stanford, known for his extensive biography of Franklin Roosevelt. While Frank's wife Madeleine was buying tickets for the miniature train ride, their year old son Phillip wandered off, sat down on the tracks and was hit by the train, suffering massive head and leg injuries. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. Playtown closed soon after. Danny the Dragon guided train at Happy Hollow Park & Zoo, San Jose Arrow developed the Mystery Island Banana Train ride for Pacific Ocean Park, which was one of the opening-day rides in 1958. Arrow also developed an extensive Alice in Wonderland ride for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which opened in 1961. For the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, Arrow created the \\"Space Whirl\\", a teacup ride which simulated the feeling of being launched into space. For Freedomland U.S.A., located in New York City from 1960 to 1964, Arrow created four dark rides (Earthquake, Buccaneer, Tornado and Mine Cave), Spin-A-Top (similar to Disneyland's Mad Tea Party), horse- drawn street cars, antique cars (known as Horseless Carriage) and freeway cars for the Satellite City Turnpike. Arrow's contributions to the park are documented in Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History published by Theme Park Press (2019). Arrow also created the Danny the Dragon train ride (two trains) for Freedomland and Happy Hollow (1961), the Cave Train and vintage auto rides for the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Adventureland (New York), teacup (\\"snowball\\") and bobsled rides for Santa's Village in Scotts Valley, CA, Frontier Village's Antique Car Ride, the Timber Mountain Log and Hat Dance (\\"Sombrero\\") rides at Knott's Berry Farm, a suspended monorail and electric boat ride for the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys, CA and Florida and an omnimover type ride for Hershey's Chocolate World Great American Chocolate Tour. Arrow reinvented and improved on the flume ride which had been popular in the early 1900s. The first modern log flume ride being El Aserradero at Six Flags Over Texas which opened in 1963. The Runaway Mine Train (1966), designed by Ron Toomer, was both the first mine train roller coaster and the first roller coaster with an underwater tunnel. Arrow's second mine train ride opened at Six Flags over Georgia in 1967, followed by another at Cedar Point in 1969. Arrow Development would build 22 flume rides between 1970 and 1975. Toomer was promoted to Manager of Engineering at Arrow Development in 1971. Arrow's 1979 brochure listed 32 roller coasters, 12 Runaway Mine Trains, 43 Flume rides, 5 \\"Space Whirl\\" rides, 4 Rub-a-Dubs, 7 Dark Rides, 20 Special Systems, 49 Antique Car and 28 Sports Car ride installations. Arrow's 1979 product brochure also listed eight Merry-Go-Rounds, mostly installed in California, ranging from in diameter. =Post Disney era transition into Arrow Dynamics and S&S; Arrow= When Disney opened Central Shops in 1971, Dick Nunis, then Executive VP, told Arrow, ‚ÄúI have to admit that we could not have done this without you. But it‚Äôs over now. We built this big facility and we‚Äôre going to do everything ourselves.‚Äù Dana Morgan recalled, ‚ÄúThey made it very clear that it was a new era‚Äîthat they now had all this in-house capability built up, and they would now do everything themselves.‚Äù In 1972, Bacon, Morgan and Schulze decided to sell Arrow Development to Rio Grande Industries. Rio Grande had plans to build several theme parks, in addition to owning a coaster-building company. Carl and Ed acted as consultants to RGI for a few years. Walter Schultz sold all his RGI stock and retired shortly after the acquisition. All of the projects that were submitted during that time were rejected by RGI management, although they were often developed later by other companies. Ron Toomer stated that \\"building roller coasters really didn't fit into Rio Grande's scheme of things\\". In 1977, Arrow opened a manufacturing facility in the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah. By 1980, they were no longer operating in Mountain View.CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD, SAN FRANCISCO BAY REGION, ORDER NO. 01-010, January 24, 2001 On November 22, 1981, Huss Trading Corporation bought Arrow Development from RGI. The new company registered in Utah as Arrow-Huss, with design and administrative offices in Scott's Valley, CA. Edgar Morgan's son Dana, was President, Robert Peers was a Director and Secretary and Peter Joyce was Vice President and Treasurer. Arrow-Huss registered with the State of California as a Foreign Stock business on January 12, 1981, but its status as a valid company was eventually forfeited. Dana Morgan would be reported as President of Arrow Huss in 1982. Morgan left Arrow-Huss and started Morgan Manufacturing in 1983, nominally to build carousels, although their first contract was for a roller coaster. In 1984, Arrow-Huss' officers were reported as Bernard Peer Zwickau, President; Boyd Draeger Vice President; Robert Peers, Secretary; Gail E. Dyreng, Comptroller. Klaus Huss, Dr. Urs. Affolter and Robert Peers were reported as Directors. In 1985, Robert Larsen was the Director of Finance. Arrow-Huss filed for bankruptcy late in November 1984, two weeks after Ron Toomer had relocated his family to Utah. Thirteen of the company‚Äôs American officers, including Toomer, negotiated a buyout. Late in 1985 the takeover was approved by the court. By that time none of the original founders of Arrow Development had any financial or managerial interest in the company. On January 10, 1986, Arrow Dynamics was incorporated in Delaware, with offices in Clearfield, Utah and Norm Scott as President. Scott would die unexpectedly on July 1 of that same year and his wife would sue Arrow-Huss for control of the company. Around this time (mid-80's) Arrow partnered with Vekoma, a Dutch manufacturer of farming and mining equipment, in an effort to have a dealer in the European market. Initially, Arrow built ride vehicles and the more complex track sections in Utah and shipped them to Holland. Over a period of several months Arrow taught Vekoma to build all types of track sections for their European customers. Vekoma then began competing directly with Arrow in the United States. On January 6, 1986, restated articles of incorporation, changing the name of Arrow Huss to Arrow Dynamics, Inc. were filed in Delaware. On March 10, 1987, Ron Toomer, Otis S. Hughes and Brent H. Meikle would file an application for certification of authority for Arrow Dynamics, Inc., also in Delaware. On May 27, 1987 Toomer, Hughes and Meikle would draft articles of incorporation for Arrow Dynamics as a Utah corporation. Issued stock was valued at $12 million. On June 27, 1987, Arrow Dynamics, Inc. (Utah) and Arrow Dynamics, Inc. (Delaware) would merge, with the Delaware corporation surviving. On February 22, 1988, Arrow Dynamics, Inc. would be dissolved as a Delaware corporation. The April 11, 1988 notice also states that the former name of Arrow Dynamics was Arrow Huss, Inc. In a 1988 interview, Toomer would state that although Arrow Huss had been profitable, Huss \\"just kept taking money out of it\\". Ron Toomer served as President of Arrow Dynamics until 1993. In 1994, he brought in $3.5 million in international funding and was promoted to chairman. Allan Harris was brought in as president about 1995 and was CEO in 1998. Toomer would act as a Consulting Director until his retirement in 1998.Ripley's Legends of the Amusement Park Industry, by Tim O'Brien, pg 229. Arrow Dynamics' authority to operate in Utah would be revoked in October 1999 for failure to file their annual report, but be reinstated in November. Toomer retired in 2000. Arrow Dynamics declared bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, owing more than $2.2 million to its 20 largest unsecured creditors. As part of its reorganization plan, Arrow agreed that it would no longer build its own rides. The court set a $2.25 million minimum price for the purchase of all of Arrow Dynamics assets. On February 8, 2002, the Cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City was lit. The steel tower supporting the cauldron was designed by Arrow Dynamics. In 2002, S&S; Power was looking for opportunities to expand their business, citing acquisitions as the best method to do so. In October, S&S; founded S&S; Arrow, a limited liability company which purchased the assets of the bankrupt Arrow Dynamics. Despite the name and work of S&S; Arrow, legally it was not a successor to Arrow Dynamics. In November 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co. Ltd, acquired controlling interest in S&S; and renamed itself S&S; Sansei Technologies. Sansei obtained all the remaining Arrow assets and intellectual property. On a related note; Sansei provides Disney with Omnimover ride systems for the Buzz Lightyear attractions and Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure attractions. Arrow Development Properties The building at 243 Moffett in Mountain View, which was built in 1946 by the founders, was still standing in December 2013 and the site of an automotive body shop. The 820 Huff address appears on documents created by Arrow for the Walt Disney Company. It is roughly two blocks north of 1555 Plymouth. 1555 Plymouth was occupied by Arrow Development from April 1960 until November 1980. During that time, the property was one parcel with the address of 1555 Plymouth Street. South Bay Construction and Development Company (SBCDC) purchased the site in November 1982 and subdivided it into three parcels: 1555, 1615, and 1625 Plymouth Street. SBCDC constructed the building currently at 1555 Plymouth Street in 1983, which was used as storage for Norcal Tech, Inc. The property was sold to Sierra Greens in June 1985 and leased to Silicon Graphics, Inc. 1615 Plymouth - Interaction Chemical leased the 1615 Plymouth Street parcel from SBCDC beginning in December 1982. Interaction Chemical purchased the parcel in May 1983. In 1992, the assets of Interaction Chemical were purchased by Interaction Chromatography, who moved out of the building in May 1992. Fusion Medical Technologies began occupying the property in 1994. 1625 Plymouth - The property was also leased to Norcal from November 1982 to November 1989 and Symtron (who purchased Norcal) from November 1989 to November 1997. During this time, Norcal and Symtron manufactured printed circuit boards at the site. In November 1997, Sanmina Corporation acquired Symtron and subsequently purchased the property two years later in 1999. On June 25, 2013, Broadreach Capital Partners announced that it had acquired the site comprising 1615 and 1625 Plymouth, where it planned to develop, own and manage a state-of-the-art office project. Broadreach secured $150 million in financing and broke ground on the site in 2018. As of February 2020 the new building is 100% leased and occupied by Google.

It was only described as new to science as recently as 2001, although the initial specimens had been collected on Luzon in the 1960s, these were originally misidentified as Eurasian woodcock specimens. It was not until the bird was heard calling in 1993, and new specimens obtained on Mindanao in 1995, that it was realised that the species was new. It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. Description The Bukidnon woodcock is rich reddish-brown above, finely barred and vermiculated with black and broadly barred with blackish markings across the crown, the underparts are paler and buffer. The eye is placed high and far back on the head, and the beak is long with a flexible tip to extract worms and other invertebrates from the soil.Kennedy, Robert S.; Fisher, Timothy H.; Harrap, Simon C.B.; Diesmos, Arvin C: & Manamtam, Arturo S. (2001): A new species of woodcock from the Philippines and a re-evaluation of other Asian/Papuasian woodcock Forktail 17(1): 1-12. Distribution and habitat This species is restricted to mountain forests (over 1000 m above sea level) on the islands of Mindanao (four mountaintops) and Luzon (center and north) in the Philippines. Its habitat is extremely remote and rugged, and is unsuitable for either logging or agriculture. It is found in montane forest above 1000m on Luzon and Mindanao. Shy and secretive, it rests by day on the forest floor and is active at night. These birds fly in a wide circuit over the forest, giving a loud, metallic, rattling \`pip-pip-pip-pip-pip\` interspersed by very quiet grunts. Behaviour Little is known about the bird in the wild. It is described as having a \\"roding\\" display flight in January to March just before dawn, like other birds of the genus. Status The Bukidnon woodcock has a large range and it is relatively common within that range. Its population size has not been quantified but the IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\", believing that any decline in population is too slow as to justify placing the bird in a more threatened category.

The social web encompasses how websites and software are designed and developed in order to support and foster social interaction. These online social interactions form the basis of much online activity including online shopping, education, gaming and social networking websites. The social aspect of Web 2.0 communication has been to facilitate interaction between people with similar tastes. These tastes vary depending on who the target audience is, and what they are looking for. For individuals working in the public relation department, the job is consistently changing and the impact is coming from the social web. The influence, held by the social network is large and ever changing. As people's activities on the Web and communication increase, information about their social relationships become more available. Social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook, as well as the future Dataweb enable people and organizations to contact each other with persistent human- friendly names. Today hundreds of millions of Internet users are using thousands of social websites to stay connected with their friends, discover new \\"friends\\", and to share user-created content, such as photos, videos, social bookmarks, and blogs, even through mobile platform support for cell phones. By the second quarter in 2017, Facebook reported 1.86 billion members, and, in 2008, MySpace occupied 100 million users and YouTube had more than 100 million videos and 2.9 million user channels, and these numbers are consistently growing. The social Web is quickly reinventing itself, moving beyond simple web applications that connect individuals to live an entirely new way of life. History Like the telephone, the Internet was not created as a communication tool to interact socially, but evolved to become a part of everyday life. However, social interaction has been facilitated by the web for nearly the entire duration of its existence, as indicated by the continuing success of social software, which at its core centers around connecting individuals virtually with others whom they already have relationships with in the physical world. Email dates from the 1960s, and was one of the first social applications to connect multiple individuals through a network, enabling social interaction by allowing users to send messages to one or more people. This application, which some have argued may be the most successful social software ever, was actually used to help build the Internet. The web got its start as a large but simple Bulletin Board System (BBS) that allowed users to exchange software, information, news, data, and other messages with one another., p. 60 Ward Christensen invented the first public BBS in the late 1970s, and another (named \\"The WELL\\") in the late 80's and early '90s arose as a popular online community. The Usenet, a global discussion system similar to a BBS that enabled users to post public messages, was conceived in 1979; the system found tremendous popularity in the 1980s as individuals posted news and articles to categories called \\"newsgroups\\". By the late 1990s, personal web sites that allowed individuals to share information about their private lives with others were increasingly widespread. On this fertile period of the web's development, its creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote that: The term \\"social Web\\" was coined by Howard Rheingold for this network in 1996; Rheingold was quoted in an article for Time on his website \\"Electric Minds\\", described as a \\"virtual community center\\" that listed online communities for users interested in socializing through the Web, saying that \\"The idea is that we will lead the transformation of the Web into a social Web\\". The social Web developed in three stages from the beginning of the '90s up to the present day, transforming from simple one-way communication web pages to a network of truly social applications. During the \\"one-way conversation\\" era of online applications in the mid '90s, most of the nearly 18,000 web pages in existence were \\"read only\\", or \\"static web sites\\" with information flowing exclusively from the person or organization that ran the site; although the web was used socially at this time, communication was difficult, achieved only through individuals reacting to each other's posts on one web page by responding to them on their own personal web page. In the mid '90s, Amazon and other pioneers made great progress in advancing online social interaction by discovering how to link databases to their web sites in order to store information as well as to display it; in concert with other innovations, this led to the rise of read-write web applications, allowing for a \\"two-way conversation\\" between users and the individual or organization running the site. As these web applications became more sophisticated, people became more comfortable using and interacting with them, bandwidth increased, and access to the Internet became more prevalent, causing designers to begin implementing new features that allowed users to communicate not only with a site's publishers, but with others who visited that site as well. Despite being a small step forward technologically, it was a huge step socially, enabling group interaction for the first time, and it has been claimed that this social exchange between many individuals is what separates a web application from a social Web application. The first social networking sites, including Classmates.com (1995) and SixDegrees.com (1997), were introduced prior to social media sites. It has been argued that the transition towards social media sites began after the world's first online interactive diary community Open Diary was founded on December 19, 1998; currently still online after ten years, it has hosted over five million digital diaries.About Open Diary. Opendiary.com (1998-10-19). Retrieved on 2011-06-04. Open Diary successfully brought online diary writers together into one community as an early social networking site, and it was during this time that the term \\"weblog\\" was coined (later to be shortened to the ubiquitous \\"blog\\" after one blogger jokingly turned weblog into the sentence \\"we blog\\"). Some claim that this marked the beginning of the current era of social media, with \\"social media\\" being a term that entered into both common usage and prominence as high-speed Internet became increasingly available, growing in popularity as a concept and leading to the rise of social networking sites such as Myspace (2003) and Facebook (2004). It has been argued that this trend towards social media \\"can be seen as an evolution back to the Internet's roots, since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it was initially created for: a platform to facilitate information exchange between users.\\" Evolution The social Web is quickly becoming a way of life: many people visit social networking sites at least once per day, and in 2008 the average amount of time per visit to MySpace hovered around twenty-six minutes (the length of a sitcom). Furthermore, the astoundingly rapid growth of the social Web since the '90s is not projected to slow down anytime soon: with less than 20% of the world's population using the Internet, the social Web is felt by some to still be in its infancy. The line between social networking and social media is becoming increasingly blurred as sites such as Facebook and Twitter further incorporate photo, video, and other functionalities typical of social media sites into users' public profiles, just as social media sites have been integrating features characteristic of social networking sites into their own online frameworks. One notable change that has been brought about by the merging of social networking/media is the transformation of social web applications into egocentric software that put people at the center of applications. Although there had been discussion about a sense of community on the web prior to these innovations, modern social web software makes a wider set of social interactions available to the user, such as \\"friending\\" and \\"following\\" individuals, even sending them virtual gifts or kisses. Social Web applications are typically built using object oriented programming, utilizing combinations of several programming languages, such as Ruby, PHP, Python, ASP.NET and/or Java. Often APIs are utilized to tie non- social websites to social websites, one example being Campusfood.com. =Blogs and wikis= Both blogs and Wikis are prime examples of collaboration through the Internet, a feature of the group interaction that characterizes the social Web. Blogs are used as BBS for the 21st century on which people can post discussions, whereas Wikis are constructed and edited by anyone who is granted access to them. Members of both are able to see the recent discussions and changes made, although for many blogs and Wikis such as Wikipedia this is true even for non-members. Blogs and Wikis allow users to share information and educate one another, and these social interaction are focused on content and meaning. Blogs and Wikis are used by both those writing them and those who reference them as resources. Blogs allow members to share ideas and other members to comment on those ideas, while Wikis facilitate group collaboration: both of these tools open a gateway of communication in which social interaction allows the web to develop. These sites are used by teachers and students alike to accomplish the goal of sharing education, and working in a community with other scholars enables the users to see different interpretations of similar subjects as well as to share resources that might not be available to them otherwise.Wikipedia:School and university projects =Mobile connectivity support= The lives of social web users are increasingly interconnected with their online profiles and accounts, such to the extent that many social networking and social media sites now offer support for mobile devices and internet phone connectivity. Popular social web sites such Facebook Mobile, Orkut, Twitter, and YouTube have led the way for other sites to enable their users to post and share new content with others, update their statuses and receive their friends' updates and uploaded content via mobile platforms.The central aim for both sites offering these mobile services and for those who use them is for the user to maintain contact with their friends online at all times; it allows them to update their profiles and to communicate with each other even when they are away from a computer. It is predicted that this trend will continue in the future, not as other sites follow suit to offer similar services, but as they are extended to other mobile devices that social web users will carry with them in years to come. Social web mobile applications can also allow for augmented reality gaming and experiences; examples of such include SCVGR and Layar. =Social features added to non-social sites= Web sites that are not built around social interaction nevertheless add features that enable discussion and collaboration out of an interest in expanding their user bases‚Äîa trend that is projected to continue in the coming years. As early as 1995 electronic retailer Amazon had implemented such features, especially the customer review, to great success; Joshua Porter, author of Designing for the Social Web, writes: These customer reviews contribute valuable information that individuals seek out, and are written by users for free simply out of a desire to share their experiences with a product or service with others; the quality and value of each review is further determined by other users, who rate them based upon whether or not they found the feedback helpful, \\"weeding out the bad (by pushing them to the bottom [of the page]).\\" Non-retailer, special interest websites have also implemented social web features to broaden their appeal: one example is Allrecipes.com, a community of 10 million cooks that share ideas and recipes with one another. In addition to exchanging recipes with others through the website, users are able to rate and post reviews of recipes they have tried, and to provide suggestions as to how to improve or alter them; according to the website, \\"The ratings/reviews...are a valuable resource to our community because they show how the members and their families feel about a recipe. Does the recipe get raves‚Äîor does it never get made again? Your opinion counts\\". This feedback is used to evaluate and classify recipes based upon how successfully they passed through the site's \\"editorial process\\" and to what extent they were approved by site members, potentially resulting in receiving \\"Kitchen approved\\" status that is comparable to Wikipedia's \\"good article\\" nomination process. The site has also augmented its services by including social features such as user blogs and connecting with other social networking/media sites like Facebook to expand its presence on the social Web. The recipes found on this website become part of the social web as other members rank them, comment and provide feedback as to why the recipe was good or bad, or to share ways in which they would change it. The integration of \\"social\\" features has also begun to extend into non-Web media forms including print and broadcast. Increasingly prevalent mobile devices have offered a platform for media companies to create hybridised media forms which draw upon the social web, such as the Fango mobile app offered by Australian partnership Yahoo!7 which combines traditional TV programming with live online discussions and existing social networking channels. =Social art= Artists use the social Web to share their art, be it visual art on sites like deviantART, video art on YouTube, musical art on YouTube or iTunes, or physical art, such as posting and selling crafted items on Craigslist. Artists choose to post their art online so that they can gain critiques on their work, as well as just have the satisfaction of knowing others can experience and enjoy their work. With this social web generation, students spend more time using social tools like computers, video games, video cameras and cell phones. These tools allow the art to be shared easily, and aid in the discussion. =Collaborative efforts facilitated by the social web= Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing has become one of the ways in which the social Web can be used collaborative efforts, particularly in the last few years, with the dawn of the semantic web and Web 2.0. Modern web applications have the capabilities for crowdsourcing techniques, and consequently the term is now used exclusively for web-based activity. Examples include sites such as SurveyMonkey.com and SurveyU.com; for example, SurveyMonkey enables users to administer surveys to a list of contacts they manage, then collect and analyze response data using basic tools provided on the website itself and finally export these results once they are finished. Crowdsourcing is used by researchers in order to emulate a traditional focus group, but in a less expensive and less intimate atmosphere. Due to the nature of the social Web, people feel more open to express what their thoughts are on the topic of discussion without feeling as though they will be as heavy scrutinized by the rest of the group when compared to a traditional setting. The Internet serves as a screen, helping to evoke the purest feedback from the participants in the group, as it removes much of a mob mentality. Facebook has also been a mode in which crowdsourcing can occur, as users typically ask a question in their status message hoping those that see it on his or her news feed will answer the question, or users may opt to use the poll option now available to obtain information from those within their friends network. Community-based software projects Through the use of the social Web, many software developers opt to participate in community-based open-source software projects, as well as hacking projects for proprietary software, kernel (computing) modifications, and freeware ports of games and software. Linux iterations are perfect examples of how effective and efficient this sort of collaboration can be. Google's Android operating system is another example, as many coders work on modifying existing hardware kernels and ROMs to create customized forms of a released Android version. These collaborative efforts for Android take place typically through xda-developers and androidforums.com. =Mobile application development= Most of the modern mobile applications, and indeed even browser applications, come from released software development kits to developers. The developers create their applications and share them with users via \\"app markets\\". Users can comment on their experiences with the applications, allowing all users to view the comments of others, and thus have a greater understanding of what is to be expected from the application. Typically there is also a rating a system in addition to comments. Mobile social Web applications are built using various APIs. These APIs allow for the interaction and interconnection of data on one social database, be it Facebook, Twitter, or Google Account, thus creating a literal web of data connections. These applications then add to the user experience specific to the application itself. Examples include TweetDeck and Blogger. From the social web to real life The way in which individuals share intimate details, and perform tasks such as dating, shopping, and applying for jobs is very different from in previous generations. Now, one's preferences, opinions, and activities are routinely shared with a group of friends with whom they may or may not ever meet were it not for the social web. Many social websites use online social interaction to create a bridge to real life interaction. Relationships are formed between individuals via the internet and then become more personal through other forms of communication. An example of this type of interaction is found on eBay: with more than 94 million active users globally, eBay is the world's largest online marketplace, where anyone can buy and sell practically anything. This website allows individuals to sell items and other to bid on these items. At the end of the auction, the buyer pays the seller; the buyer then sends the purchased product to the winner of the auction. The relationship begins on the internet, but extends into real life interaction. Ways in eBay facilitates this interaction include Skype, a leading online communications service that enables people to communicate through voice or video online for free. eBay Inc. acquired Skype in 2005 and significantly expanded its customer base to more than 480 million registered users in nearly every country on earth. The end result of all eBay transactions is a seller providing the buyer with a product, most commonly via mail: web interaction ending in a real world exchange. The relationship that is formed with eBay users is similar to the users of Craigslist. Users place items that they want to sell on the website, and other users that are looking to purchase these items contact the seller. Craigslist is used to bring together individuals and organizations and connect them to the resources, tools, technology and ideas they need to effectively engage in community building and see the impact of their actions. This is done via email or over the telephone. The buyer and the seller form a meeting in which goods are exchanged for money. Without this type of website, the buyer would not know that the product was available by the seller. This type of website allows members of a physical community to network with the other members of their community to exchange goods and services. The transaction from web to real life is seen on a macro scale most recently on dating websites, which are used to search and match other users. These websites allow members with a common interest, to find others with this same interest. Academics who have studied the industry believe that it and other forms of electronic communication such as e-mail and social networks are starting to have a significant effect on the ways in which people find love. Users are able to interact with one another and find if they have common interests. Many sites have been developed that target many different interest groups, and relationships form and develop using the internet. If the users decide that they share a mutual bond, they are able to interact via the telephone, and eventually in person. The relationship begins on the internet, but can lead to real life dating and eventually even marriage.

Neo-Dada was a movement with audio, visual and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier Dada artwork. It sought to close the gap between art and daily life, and was a combination of playfulness, iconoclasm, and appropriation. In the United States the term was popularized by Barbara Rose in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, particularly in Japan and in Europe, serving as the foundation of Fluxus, Pop Art and Nouveau r√©alisme.Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503 Neo-Dada has been exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and absurdist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism and, taking a lead from the practice of Marcel Duchamp and Kurt Schwitters, denied traditional concepts of aesthetics.Craft, pp.10‚Äì11 Trends Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as Robert Motherwell's The Dada Painters and Poets (1951) and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed.Brill, p.101 However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against bourgeois aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.Alan Young, Dada and After: Extremist Modernism and English Literature, Manchester University 1983, pp.201‚Äì3 and Brill, pp.104‚Äì5 Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, Piero Manzoni's Consacrazione dell'arte dell'uovo sodo (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist's personal creation and art as commodity. A Jean Tingueley fountain in Basel An allied approach is found in the creation of collage and assemblage, as in the junk sculptures of the American Richard Stankiewicz, whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters' practice. These objects are \\"so treated that they become less discarded than found, objets trouv√©s.\\"Robert Goldwater in A Dictionary of Modern Sculpture, London 1962, pp.277‚Äì8 Jean Tinguely's fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing Homage to New York (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical. Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Robert Rauschenberg labeled as \\"combines\\" such works as \\"Bed\\" (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. Arman labeled as \\"accumulations\\" his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as \\"poubelles\\" the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. Daniel Spoerri created \\"snare pictures\\" (tableaux pi√®ge), of which the earliest was \\"Kichka's Breakfast\\" (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.Margherita d'Ayala-Valva, \\"Spoerri reads Rumohr\\", chapter 4 in The Taste of Art: Cooking, Food, and Counterculture in Contemporary Practices, University of Arkansas 2017, p.78 Poems In the Netherlands the poets associated with the 'magazine for texts', Barbarber (1958‚Äì71), particularly J. Bernlef and K. Schippers, extended the concept of the readymade into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet.Bertram Mourits, The Conceptual Poetic of K. Schippers: the aesthetic implications of literary readymades, Dutch Crossing 21.1, pp.119‚Äì34 Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine Gard Sivik and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager, Hans Verhagen and the artist Armando. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that \\"the poet's role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non- poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers.\\"Hugo Brems, Contemporary Poetry of the Low Countries, Flemish Netherlands Foundation, 1995, p.20 The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914‚Äì94), the theorist of the Dutch Nul group of artists, to which Armando also belonged: \\"Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero.\\"Translation in Dutch Interior: Postwar Poetry of the Netherlands and Flanders, Columbia University 1984, pp.36‚Äì7 This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau R√©aliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism. The beginnings of Concrete Poetry and text montage in the Wiener Gruppe have also been referred back to the example of Raoul Hausmann's letter poems.Anna Katharina Schaffner, \\"How the Letters Learned to Dance: on language dissection in Dadaist, Digital and Concrete Poetry\\", in Avant-garde/Neo-avant-garde, Amsterdam 2005, pp.149‚Äì165 Such techniques may also owe something to H.N.

It was the home of the Toronto City Council from 1899 to 1966 and remains one of the city's most prominent structures. The building is located at the corner of Queen and Bay Streets, across Bay Street from Nathan Phillips Square and the present City Hall in Downtown Toronto. The heritage landmark has a distinctive clock tower which heads the length of Bay Street from Front Street to Queen Street as a terminating vista. Old City Hall was designated a National Historic Site in 1984.Old Toronto City Hall and York County Court House, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada History Toronto's Old City Hall was one of the largest buildings in Toronto and the largest civic building in North America upon completion in 1899. It was the burgeoning city's third city hall.Toronto's First City Hall and The St.Lawence South Market It housed Toronto's municipal government and courts for York County and Toronto, taking over from the Adelaide Street Court House. York County offices were also located in Old City Hall from 1900 to 1953. With the establishment of Metropolitan Toronto, the county seat moved to Newmarket, Ontario (and to the Old Newmarket Town Hall and Courthouse). Designed by prominent Toronto architect Edward James Lennox, the building took more than a decade to build and cost more than $2.5 million (equals close to 53 million today). Work on the building began in 1889 and was built on the site of old York buildings including the Lennox hotel. It was constructed of sandstone from the Credit River valley, grey stone from the Orangeville, Ontario area, and brown stone from New Brunswick. Angry councillors, due to cost overruns and construction delays, refused E.J. Lennox a plaque proclaiming him as architect for the completed building in 1899. Not to be denied, Lennox had stonemasons \\"sign\\" his name in corbels beneath the upper floor eaves around the entire building: \\"EJ LENNOX ARCHITECT AD 1898\\". Lennox designed an annex, called Manning Chambers after former mayor Alexander Manning, at the northwest corner of Bay and Queen Street. Completed in 1900, the five-storey building was later demolished to make way for the current Toronto City Hall. An 1898 drawing of a proposed square in front of Old City Hall. The planners of Old City Hall planned for a public plaza at the south entrance of city hall known as Victoria Square. Planners proposed a public plaza at the south entrance of the city hall called Victoria Square. The space was to be an urban square with diagonal walkways meeting at a central statue of Queen Victoria, its proposed namesake. The plan was never executed and a smaller space was allocated in front of the building by Queen Street. The City Beautiful movement influenced Toronto planning as well in the early 20th century, and a plan was formulated for a grand thoroughfare from Queen Street at City Hall to Front Street that would have been called Federal Avenue. It, too, was never built, though the City Beautiful movement did influence the urban design principles of nearby University Avenue. At the foot of the steps on Queen Street is the Cenotaph, erected in 1925 to honour Torontonians who died in World War I fighting for Canada, and later also in honour of Torontonians who died in the Second World War, the Korean War, and Canadian peacekeeping operations during Remembrance Day ceremonies every November 11. Four gargoyles were part of the Clock Tower during the 1899 construction, but were removed due to the effects of the weather on the sandstone carvings in 1938. In 2002, bronze casts of the gargoyles were reinstalled. The replicas are not duplicates as the original designs were lost. The gargoyles are similar to those on the Peace Tower in Ottawa. Two grotesques and antique lampposts at the base of the grand staircase inside were removed in 1947 and sold. They were reclaimed by the City and reinstalled in the 1980s. Council Chambers of Old City Hall. The chambers have been used as a courtroom since the building became a dedicated courthouse. Despite its size, Old City Hall proved inadequate for Toronto's growing municipal government within a couple of decades of completion. Under Mayor Nathan Phillips, Toronto City Council launched an international design competition for a new city hall and public square across Bay Street and completed a striking Modernist city hall and public square in 1965. Soon after in the 1960s, plans were made to start construction of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The original plans called for Old City Hall to be demolished and replaced by a retail complex, and a number of skyscrapers around a large plaza, leaving only the cenotaph (or in one plan, the clock tower) in the front. Public outcry forced authorities to abandon these plans, and the Eaton Centre was constructed around the landmark civic building and the Church of the Holy Trinity (which was also slated for demolition). Old City Hall then became a dedicated courthouse. =Future plans= Currently the building is leased by the provincial government and is used as a court house for the Ontario Court of Justice. The City of Toronto has served notice on the province that its current lease at Old City Hall will not be renewed past December 31, 2016. The city spent $77 million on renovations completed in 2005 to restore the exterior and the 103.6 metre-high clock tower. Over the next two years, the city spent an additional $7.2-million on interior repairs completed in 2012. There was speculation that the building would house a museum for the city of Toronto. On September 21, 2015, the City of Toronto released an internal study that recommended leasing parts of the Old City Hall to retail tenants. However, in early October, the city said it would allow courts to remain until December 31, 2021, while a new courthouse is constructed. In lieu of converting the structure into retail space, the Government Management Committee voted to study housing a city museum in the historic structure. Architecture Architectural drawings of Old City Hall from Queen Street West from 1887. Old City Hall can be described as an enormous square quad with a courtyard in the middle. Situated at the front elevation, its clock tower was placed off centre to provide a terminating vista for Bay Street. In spite of this seeming asymmetry, the balance of the design is still existent throughout. Ultimately, even though the clock tower was off centre, balance was achieved through the repetition of the subtle details of measure and pattern. For example, to the right side of the main entrance a narrow circular tower rises 21.4 meters from grade. It is cut precisely in half by the roof line; it extends above the roof line by 10.7 meters and is also 10.7 meters from the roof line to the base of the main tower. Further on, the east and west pavilions, although quite different in their designs, are very similar in shape. The double-storied oriel of the east tower is exaggerated to counter the weight of the double tower of the west pavilion. The subtle balance is able to stand out at the main entrance of the building and prevent it from being overshadowed by the clock tower. The exterior rock-face wall was built in a series of courses, in variable sizes separated by carved bands. Grouped columns are repeatedly used to accent the windows. =Romanesque Revival style= Old City Hall was designed by architect E. J. Lennox in a variation of Romanesque Revival architecture known as Richardsonian Romanesque. Developed by Henry Hobson Richardson, this variation highlights bulk and massiveness as well as different sculptural features. The Romanesque style originated in Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries and had characteristics such as square towers, asymmetrical massing, stone carvings, round arches, and heavy stonework. During the mid-1800s, this style was revitalized in Western architecture. H.H. Richardson contributed dormers, circular towers with conical roofs, and the use of different-coloured stone for the revival style that bears his name. Carvings of humans and animals were also part of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Lennox was interested in and was influenced by Richardson's work and travelled to the United States while he was planning his design for Toronto's third city hall in the late 19th century. Carvings of animals and humans may be found throughout the exterior of the building. These influences can be seen at Old City Hall with many of its many arches and towers. Also, the use of different- coloured stone contributes towards the Romanesque style of design. The exterior and interiors of Old City Hall are crafted with great detail. On the clock tower, four stone gargoyles were placed near the top of the tower. Near the building's entrance, there are several grotesque faces carved in stone. Lennox included his own likeness next to the other carved faces which, tradition has it, represent city councillors. Lennox's own face is identified as one of the caricatures by his handlebar moustache. The entire building has ornamentation derived from ancient Roman art. There are structural decorations used by the different colours of stone. The stone carvers did not complete work until a year after opening day, as there were many decorative pieces. The stonework on the entrance was restored in 1999. Made primarily of sandstone, Old City Hall features a two-tone fa√ßade. One tone is made of light brown-grey sandstone from the former Beaumont Quarries (now known as Dorchester Sandstone Quarries located in Westmorland County, New Brunswick). This tone is accented with darker reddish-brown sandstone known as Sackville Sandstone (also located in the Westmorland County of New Brunswick). The transportation of the stone employed the use of over 1,360 rail-car loads, equivalent to a nine-mile-long (14.5 km) train, to bring the material to the site. In addition to the stone, 8,354 barrels of cement were used to hold everything together. Made primarily of sandstone, Old City Hall features a two-tone fa√ßade. What is interesting about the sandstone is not just the variations in colour, but also the textural characteristics of the stone. Observation of the building's profile shows it is cut stone with a rock-faced texture application. Despite the roughness of the sandstone, it is not perceived to be jagged, but rather heavily weathered. The raw state of the sandstone reinforces the natural state of the material and greatly heightens the overall sense of mass that the building exhibits. The scale of the stone pieces greatly contributes to the sense of mass as well, conveying the sense that the building was literally carved from the rock and placed where it currently resides. The building bears a resemblance to the city hall buildings in Cincinnati and Minneapolis. =Interior= Within the three large oak doorways of the main entrance are steps leading to a two-storey main hall. In the arcade upon entering the building from the main entrance on Queen Street, there are murals designed by George Agnew Reid detailing Toronto's pioneers and angels related to their experiences. On the far left is a mural of Mackenzie, Allan, Macdonnel, Ryerson and Scadding depicting farmers and workers. The spandrel portion of this arcade has four angels painted on it. The first is discovery saying ‚Äúhail to the pioneers,‚Äù the second is fame, saying ‚Äúto their names and deeds,‚Äù the third is fortune which says ‚Äúremembered and forgotten,‚Äù lastly is adventure saying ‚Äúwe honour here.‚Äù On the right side of the arcade is another mural depicting Galinee, Simcoe, Tecumseh, Brock, Osgoode, Baldwin, Laura Secord and Strachan depicting pioneers. stained-glass window directly across the grand staircase of the Old City Hall. Together these murals depict early history of Toronto with the angels representing the four achievements by these pioneers. Directly opposite are a grand staircase and an extraordinary stained-glass window designed by Robert McCausland, the renowned Toronto stained-glass artist. The monumental window entitled The Union of Commerce and Industry, depicts civic progress and the \\"upbuilding\\" of Toronto. It is organized in three arches and features 12 life-sized figures amidst scenes of the city's waterfront and a depiction of Toronto's second city hall on Front Street East. A marble war memorial is positioned below the window, dedicated to victims of the Second World War. Also in the vicinity is the 4.5 m-wide (15 ft.) divided stairway, leading to a landing branching east and west to what used to be the county and city divisions of the building. Stucco pillars were shaped by Italian craftsmen. Surviving original interior includes detailing in wood, plaster, iron, bronze and marble, including a mosaic floor laid by Jacomo Bespirt and family, columns with plaster capitals, faux-marble finishes, woodwork, wrought-iron grotesques and gas lamp standards, and door knobs bearing the city's old coat of arms. The main hall in its day was said to be the city's grandest indoor space, amazing visitors. Today, exhibit cabinets that display a collection of photographs and artifacts are found on the main floor of the entrance lobby. Also, when court is not in session, the former Council Chamber, with its spectator gallery above and late 19th-century ambiance, is open to the public. =Clock tower= The clock tower at Old City Hall is garnished by four stone gargoyles at the upper corners of the tower. Old City Hall features a large, 103.6 metre-tall (340 ft) clock tower that is a terminating vista for Bay Street south of Queen Street West and is also prominently visible from Queen Street and Nathan Phillips Square. The clock tower was the tallest structure in Canada for 18 years from 1899 until 1917. The clock was made in Croydon, England by Gillett & Johnston, for many years, A.G. Abernethy, clockmaker on Yonge Street was in charge with repairing and maintaining the clock. Four garnished stone gargoyles sat at the upper corners of the clock tower; these ornaments were removed due to the effects of the weather on the sandstone carvings in 1938, but bronze casts of the gargoyles were reinstalled in 2002. The clock functioned manually until the 1950s when it was automated. In 1992, the clock was stopped for the first time in more than a century to perform maintenance and repairs. The maintenance consisted of painting the metallic components of the clock: its bronze, brass, iron and steel. The room, at the top of the tower, enclosed on four sides by timepieces, houses the glass box in which the clock's mechanism sits. The room is accessible by stairs only; there are 280 steps to climb. The elevator that was built with the structure was taken out in the 1920s. The clock's face measures in diameter. = Bells = The clock room houses three large bells, two small quarter bells that strike every quarter hour and a bourdon bell which strikes every hour, the bourdon alone weighs 5443 kilograms. There is one small and unofficial inscription just below the coat of arms on the bell, which reads ‚ÄúJ.K.Oct.18, 1900‚Äù. The bourdon also rarely rings for special events like the Bells of Peace program in 2014, which commemorates 100 years since the end of the First World War. Appearances in cultural works Children pose by one of Kurt Perschke's Redball Project installations in the central arch of the Queen Street main entrance to Old City Hall in 2009. Artist William Armstrong painted a watercolour painting of Old City Hall prior to its completion. The building features prominently in the novel Old City Hall, by Robert Rotenberg. For the 2009 Luminato arts festival, artist Kurt Perschke brought Redball Project to Toronto and temporarily installed a giant red ball in locations around Toronto's downtown core, including inside the central arch of the main entrance to Old City Hall. In terms of popular culture, the building is sometimes used to film movies and television shows, such as This is Wonderland, Flashpoint, Street Legal, Covert Affairs, and Dirty Pictures. Interiors of the space can be seen in the trial scenes near the end of the 1999 film The Boondock Saints.

Admission to the air show is free; however, viewing from Exhibition Place requires paid admission to the CNE.CIAS FAQs There is no static display of aircraft.CIAS Show Information A photo tour at Pearson had been introduced in 1993 and a full static display in 1996. Although a success, the display was cancelled by the time of the 1998 air show. In 2020, both the air show and that summer's Canadian National Exhibition were cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. =Local opposition= The airshow is unpopular with some nearby residents who object to the noise created by the jet fighters participating in the show and others who object to the military participation. It has been noted that the noise of the jet fighter demonstrations specifically is similar to that experienced by persons in active war zones. In 2016, a Toronto Star columnist noted, \\"that in a city with a large population of refugee newcomers and people who have experienced the trauma of war it is insulting, invasive, and violent\\". Since 2012, during the airshow weekend, the Wikipedia article about the show has been repeatedly vandalized as a form of protest against the airshow, a phenomenon noted by the local Toronto media. According to the City of Toronto, the air show \\"complies with all regulations, including those published by Transport Canada relating to noise.\\" Performers The air show is typically a mix of Canadian and United States military aircraft, private aerobatic performers and civilian aircraft flypasts. The air show is often used by the Government of Canada to display new aircraft in the use of the government, such as search and rescue aircraft. On occasion, the air show has displayed unique civilian aircraft, such as the Concorde, and military aircraft of other nations. Flypasts have often included heritage military aircraft. The air show has included demonstrations of parachuting, aerial fire fighting and search and rescue missions. Regular performers include the Snowbirds, other Canadian Armed Forces aircraft, the United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Navy (USN).2007 Lineup 2008 Lineup 2009 Lineup Past performers have included the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association, Vintage Wings of Canada, as well as private aerobatics teams, and commercial airlines.

It was inaugurated in 1922 in the Coliseum, on the grounds of Exhibition Place. It has since been expanded to also take up the Enercare Centre and remains an important exhibit for livestock breeders. Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, is the fair's royal patron. Members of the Canadian Royal Family have also been guests of honour at the fair. It is the largest indoor agricultural fair in the world.https://www.newswire.ca/news- releases/the-95th-royal-agricultural-winter-fair-trots-into-toronto-this- november-650402113.html History The Coliseum in 1922. The building was erected at Exhibition Place to host the Royal. Following the First World War, a group of farmers led by W. A. Dryden, from Brooklin, Ontario, sought to create a national agricultural exhibition, partly to set national standards for the judging of domestic animals. Together, they formed the Agricultural Winter Fair Association of Canada and quickly received, in 1920, permission from King George V for use of the prefix royal. In 1920, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a new livestock arena on the Toronto Exhibition Grounds to house the new fair and other uses. Plans called for the first mounting of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair to take place in 1921, but this was delayed when a heating system for the new arena could not be installed in time. The first show thus opened on 22 November 1922, drawing to its livestock competitions 17,000 entries from several provinces and the United States. The fair then, save for the years when Canada was embroiled in the Second World War, consistently provided for farmers a forum to display equipment, discuss new trends, and showcase wares. In 1965, significant changes were introduced by the federal Department of Agriculture, which had been a longtime sponsor of the Royal. Both the number of livestock classes for each breed and the number of entries per breeder were reduced; new judging standards were set, emphasizing the utility of the breed; buildings were renovated, and the Winter Garden Show and Horse Show were given more prominence, the latter attracting some 75,000 viewers. For the fair's 75th anniversary in 1997 a commemorative stamp was issued by Canada Post. Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic it was announced on June 24, 2020, that the 2020 edition of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto scheduled for November 6 to 15 would be cancelled ‚Äî marking the first time that such event has been cancelled since World War II (as was the case for that summer's Canadian National Exhibition and the Canadian International Air Show, also held at Exhibition Place). Programme The Royal Horse Show has been a gala event at the Royal since its founding. Today, the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair as a whole sees over 320,000 visits including exhibitors, international and local guests. Over 6,000 animals arrive in Toronto each November, including over 4,900 head of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, and fancy bird, and over 900 horses and ponies, plus a display of crops and vegetables, educational exhibits, and feature attractions. The latter include the Burnbrae Food & Lifestyle Stage, which hosts local and international chef challenges, food sampling, and a wide variety of entertaining and decorating demonstrations during the day. Evening events include craft beer and cider competitions and Royal Champions Day, where guests can sample wine, cheese, and jams; the President's Choice Animal Theatre showcasing animals at work and play, including sheepherding, goats on the go, Spirit of the Horse, rabbit jumping, and President's Choice Superdogs; and the Royal Winter Gallery, which hosts top artists who demonstrate their different styles and techniques along with the opportunity for guests to learn to draw animals. The Royal Horse Show is a gala event that has been a cornerstone of the fair since its inception. Throughout the fair, guests are encouraged to feed and touch over 60 animals in the Pizza Pizza Petting Farm, discover the journey food takes from farm to home in the aMAZEing Food Journey, ask questions at one of 13 education centres‚Äîincluding beekeeping, alpaca and llama farms, dairy cow milking‚Äîand visit the barns to see animals and meet exhibitors.

For example, a personal i-name could be =Mary or =Mary.Jones. An organizational i-name could be @Acme or @Acme.Corporation. Persistence One problem XRIs are designed to solve is persistent addressing ‚Äî how to maintain an address that does not need to change no matter how often the contact details of a person or organization change. XRIs accomplish this by adding a new layer of abstraction over the existing IP numbering and DNS naming layers used on the Internet today (as well as over other type of addresses, such as phone numbers or instant messaging addresses). Such an abstraction layer is not new ‚Äî URNs (Uniform Resource Names) and other persistent identifier architectures have the same effect. What's different about the XRI layer is that it offers a single uniform syntax and resolution protocol for two different types of identifiers: =I-names= I-names are identifiers resembling domain names, designed for simplicity and ease of use. Though typically long-lived, i-names may, like domain names, be transferred or reassigned to another resource by their owners. For example, a company that changes its corporate name could sell its old i-name to another company, while both companies could retain their original i-numbers. What most differentiates i-names from domain names is that in practice they will have a synonymous (equivalent) persistent i-number (below). =I-numbers= I-numbers are machine readable identifiers (similar to IP addresses) that are assigned to a resource (for instance, a person, organization, application or file) and never reassigned. This means an i-number can always be used to address a network representation of the resource as long it remains available anywhere on the network. I-numbers, like IP addresses, are designed to be efficient for network routers to process and resolve. XRI syntax also allows i-names and i-numbers to be combined within the same XRI. So effectively the XRI layer supports both i-name and i-number synonyms for resources ‚Äî one that reflects real-world semantics and can change over time, and one that reflects the persistent identity of a resource no matter how often its attributes (including its i-names) may change. And the same HTTP-based XRI resolution protocol can be used to resolve either an i-name or an i-number to an XRDS document describing the target resource. XRIs are backward-compatible with the DNS and IP addressing systems, so it is possible for domain names and IP addresses to be used as i-names (or, in rare cases, as i-numbers). Like DNS names, XRIs can also be \\"delegated\\", i.e., nested multiple levels deep, just like the directory names on a local computer file system. For example, a company can register a top-level (global) i-name for itself and then assign second- or lower-level (community) i-names to its divisions, employees, etc. Examples: =Mary.Jones*Henry @Example.Corp*Ecuador*Quito i-names are called unified digital addresses because they can be resolved using the XRI resolution protocol into XRDS documents that expose various services for accessing the digital identity they represent. These services, such as OpenID, OAuth, or XDI can expose any other type of data under the control of this identity. Privacy is protected because the identity owner controls access. For example, the registrant of =Mary.Jones would not receive spam from this i-name because it is not an email address. To resolve =Mary.Jones into an email address would first require Mary's permission, and such requests can be verified by i-brokers to make sure they are legitimate. In addition to =names for people and @names for organizations, the third major type of i-names is +names for generic concepts. This is the XRI equivalent of a generic noun in the English language, for example, +flowers, +phone.number, or +table.of.contents. Generic +names are very useful in distributed data sharing because they can be used as XRI cross-references to specify the precise type of data to be shared. For example, =Mary.Jones/(+phone.number)/(+daytime) and @Acme/(+phone.number)/(+daytime) can be used to request Mary's and Acme's daytime phone numbers, respectively.

Born in Trento, he was admitted in 1691 to the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, where he studied theology. While in Rome, he also studied composition under the guidance of Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni and possibly (since this is unconfirmed) violin with Arcangelo Corelli. Moving back to Trento, he was ordained in 1695. Bonporti's musical work consists of twelve opera, published between 1696 and 1736. He influenced Johann Sebastian Bach in the development of the invention, and several of his works were mistakenly included in a set of Bach's inventions. In reality, Bach had transcribed for harpsichord four violin pieces from Bonporti's op. X (1712). He lived in Padua from 1740 until his death in 1749. Works This is a listing of his twelve opera, first the Italian original, generally by Giuseppe Sala in Venice, then the French edition as published by Estienne Roger in Amsterdam, and finally the English edition, by John Walsh in London.

It is now a business center whose commercial output runs parallel to that of downtown. A former terminus of the North Luzon Expressway, it is the most urban and most populous area in Mabalacat, home to roughly 23% of the city's population. San Francisco, the second largest barangay, along with San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Poblacion, Calumpang and other barangays are categorized as urban in view of their proximity to the city proper. Sapang Balen, with a population of 166 persons, is the smallest barangay. History Prior to 1712, Mabalacat was a barrio (barangay) of Bambang, now Bamban, Tarlac. It became a town in 1792, and was named after the abundant Balacat tree (Ziziphus talanai), a fourth class timber tree with bark that possess antimicrobial properties. Once a settlement of an Aeta tribe, the area was a virtual forest of balacat trees. \\"Ma-balacat\\" in the native Kapampangan language means \\"full of Balacats.\\" Mabalacat in Maranao is \\"Mababaapalaqat\\" (Palacat), which means \\"maiksing hagdan\\" in Tagalog. In 1853 Mabalacat had a population of 2,611 and four barangays, namely, Babangdapu, Duquit, Malabni, and Paglimbunan. By 1903 its population increased to 7,049 in 19 barangays. These were Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Dau, Dolores, Iba, Mabiga, Mamatitang, Mangalit, Matas, Mawaque, Paralayunan, Poblacion, Quitangil (later renamed to San Francisco), San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Santa Maria, Sapang Balen, and Sapang Biabas. In 1948, Mabalacat's barangays increased to 20 with the addition of Fort Stotsenburg. In 1860 a military command was established by authorities of the Spanish Governor-General due to the lawlessness and depredations perpetrated by the negritos (Aetas, or derogatorily called balugas). The Pampanga towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Magalang, Porac, and Floridablanca and Mabalacat were created into what was called a Commandancia Militar. However, in 1873 the Military Command returned Mabalacat together with the towns of Magalang, Floridablanca, and Porac to the parent province, Pampanga. Demographics Climate Economy Centre of Mabalacat Mabalacat has an average annual income of as of 2011 derived mostly from municipal license fees, land tax, Internal Revenue allotment, roads and bridges fund. In 1997, there were 2,447 business establishments registered in the Mabalacat City, consisting of 79 manufacturers mostly involved in sash factory, iron works, ceramics, bakery and 1,806 trading companies. The financial needs are served by eleven banks, mostly concentrated in Dau. Public utilities include the Mabalacat Water System, Pampanga Electric Corporation II (PELCO II), three telephone companies namely, Datelcom Corporation (DATELCOM), Smart Communications (SMART) and Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Incorporated (DIGITEL) and one cable television network (PRO-SAT) which runs solely for Mabalacat. The city is also a major transportation hub; a number of major road networks including the North Luzon Expressway, Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, and MacArthur Highway cut across the region. At the southern part of the city is the Dau Bus Terminal, which caters to passengers bound for Metro Manila and provinces in Northern Luzon such as Tarlac, Pangasinan, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Nueva Ecija, La Union, Bataan, and Zambales.  City Fiesta  Xevera Fountain Legend tells us that when the early settlers were clearing the forests, Cabezang Laureana's workers found, hidden among the bushes, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with baby Jesus sitting on her lap. On February 2, the statue was presented by Caragan as a gift to Padre Maximo Manuguid, the priest of the early Mabalacat Church that was made of sawali and cogon grass. From then on, the city fiesta was observed on the second of February. = Pastorella = The pastorella (Misa de Pastores in honor of the shepherds at the birth of Jesus Christ - a set of Latin hymns of the 9-day Christmas Masses) ceased in Pampanga towns for 40 years after Vatican II. In Mabalacat, however, at Our Lady of Divine Grace Parish and San Rafael Arkanghel Parish, pastorella lives on: In the 4:30 a.m. mass on Monday, the pastorella repertoire includes the Kyrie (Lord, Have Mercy), Gloria (Glory to God in the Highest), Credo (Nicene Creed), Sanctus (Holy) and Agnus Dei (Lamb of God). The hymns are in Latin, except for Kyrie, which is in Greek.\\" Inquirer.net, Latin hymns sung in masses in Pampanga Education There are 31 educational institutions in Mabalacat: one state college, one private college, one technical training school, two secondary public, two private high schools and 25 public elementary schools divided into two districts, Mabalacat North and Mabalacat South.

The museum's building is situated near the northwest of the University of Toronto's St. George campus, in downtown Toronto. The museum building was designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects, with Raymond Moriyama as the lead architect. The museum's collection of footwear originated from the personal collections of Sonja Bata, started in the mid-1940s. In 1979, Bata provided an endowment to create the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation, with the aim of having the collection professionally managed, and to establish a shoe museum to house, store, and exhibit the collection. The foundation exhibited the collection to the public for the first time in 1992, although it did not open a permanent facility for its museum until May 1995. The museum's permanent collection includes over 13,000 shoes, and other footwear related items dating back 4,500 years; providing the museum with the largest collection of footwear in the world. Items in the museum's collection are either held in storage, or placed on display in its permanent exhibition. The museum also hosts and organizes a number of temporary and travelling exhibitions, and outreach programs. History The museum's collection originated from the personal collections of Sonja Bata, which arose from her interest in the products produced by her spouse's company, the Bata shoe company. Sonja began collecting shoes shortly after her marriage to Thomas J. Bata in 1946, and their subsequent move to Toronto. The Bata family moved to Toronto in the 1940s in order to facilitate the company's expansion into Toronto and the Americas. In 1965, the company's headquarters was formally relocated from Zl√≠n to Toronto (the company's headquarters was later relocated to Lausanne in 2002). By the late 1970s, the personal collection had grown to 1,500 pairs of shoes, overcrowding the company's storerooms. At the suggestion of a friend and anthropologist, Sonja Bata provided an endowment to establish the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation in 1979; an organization that would fund research into footwear and professionally manage the collection. Although the organization shared the same name as the Bata company, the foundation was established as a non-profit entity, legally separate from the Bata company. The foundation operated as a privately funded organization, as Sonja Bata opposed the creation of an institution reliant on public funds. The foundation (and later museum) is primarily funded from a trust created by the Batas' personal wealth. Since its establishment, the foundation set out to find a building to house the collection, exhibit footwear, and house calceology research centres. Early proposals to build the museum near the Ontario Science Centre, or the Harbourfront neighbourhood of Toronto were suggested, but were both rejected. Bata initially made a bid to build the museum at Harbourfront, although it faced public protest. In a conciliatory gesture, the Metropolitan Toronto council proposed the foundation drop the name Bata from the name of the museum, although Sonja Bata refused and abandoned plans to build the museum at Harbourfront. The collection was first publicly displayed in Toronto in 1992 at the Colonnade retail complex. The foundation contracted Moriyama & Teshima Architects to design a museum to house the collection, which was opened to the public on 6 May 1995. The cost to construct the building was not disclosed by the Bata family or the foundation, although estimates reported to be C$8 million to C$12 million. In January 2006, a pair of jewel-encrusted Indian majori slippers used by Sikandar Jah, along with a gold anklet, and toe ring were stolen from the museum. In 2006, the slippers were valued at approximately C$160,000, whereas the gold anklet was valued at C$45,000, and the toe ring at C$11,000. The stolen items were recovered several weeks later by the museum. Building The museum is located in a at the southwest corner of St. George Street and Bloor Street West, near the northwest corner of the University of Toronto's St. George campus. Prior to the museum occupying the site, a gas station was situated on the property. St. George station is the closest Toronto subway station from the building. The building's glass entrance protrudes from the limestone facade The three-storey Deconstructivist-styled rectangular building was designed by Moriyama & Teshima Architects, with Raymond Moriyama as the project's lead. Moriyama was inspired to shape the building like the boxes used to store and protect the Batas' footwear collection when he viewed them in 1978. The three-storey building's roof is tilted, designed to appear as a lid sitting slightly askew atop a shoe box. The building utilizes most of the property's area, due to local zoning by-laws restricting the height of the building to . The building exterior is made out of smooth, angle canted limestone quarried from Lyons, France; and glass walls that protrude from the building's limestone facade, that serve as the entrance. The building's exterior also features windows above the ground. The interior of the structure is organized into three sections moving east to west, and spread across five floors. In addition to exhibit halls, the building also includes a gift shop, lecture theatre, and reception hall. The floors in the museum's lower levels are made of dark- coloured woods, shaped in diamond parquets, a trompe-l'≈ìil that draws visitors' eyes to their own feet. The building's main hall features a central stairwell ornate with bronze medallions cast by Dora de Pedery-Hunt; and circles cut into the stair risers to let in light from the windows above. The stairway spans five floors in total, including two below ground. A stained glass panel in shoe-like shapes sits atop the building's central staircase. The building's leather-clad reception desk is also designed to appear as a shoe from the stairway. Exhibitions Exhibits for the Out of the Box travelling exhibition, held in one of the museum's exhibition galleries in 2013 The museum building contains four exhibition galleries, used to exhibit the permanent, and temporary and travelling exhibitions. The museum presently operates only one permanent exhibition, All About Shoes: Footwear Through the Ages, with the other three galleries used to house temporary exhibitions. The museum's permanent exhibition is situated in the lower two levels in the building's east side, whereas specialized temporary exhibitions are situated in the galleries of the building's second and third levels. The exhibition galleries were designed as \\"neutral spaces,\\" enabling the museum to host a variety of exhibitions. In order to accommodate the exhibits of delicate and fragile objects, the museum's galleries were all designed with strict environmental controls, with little natural light entering the galleries. In addition to physical exhibitions held inside its building, the museum also operates online exhibitions, including an online component to the museum's All About Shoes permanent exhibition. The Virtual Museum of Canada has also hosted online exhibits created by the Museum. =Permanent exhibition= The museum's permanent exhibition, All About Shoes, provides a historical survey of footwear throughout history and includes interactive displays that highlight the social significance of shoes and their development from various cultures. The exhibition also features exhibits that examine the development of shoe- making technologies, with mini dioramas of shoe-making workshops throughout history with supplementary text and video. The lower level of the museum holds the museum's permanent exhibition, All About Shoes The exhibition is made up of three components, Behind the Scenes: A Glimpse into Artifact Storage, Fashion Afoot, and What's Their Line Fashion Afoot is an exhibition component that examines the development of fashion shoes during the 20th century, and the emergence of footwear as a major fashion accessory. What's Their Line? examines purpose-built, specialized footwear including French chestnut- crushing clogs, and sumo wrestler's geta The Behind the Scenes component of the exhibition is where shoes, and other items from the museum's collection are placed on display. The exhibits were devised by Montreal-based design firm Design+Communication Ltd., who designed the exhibits with the shoes placed close to the viewer, with monochromatic images of social life to provide context to the shoe's historical use. Larger architectural images intended to evoke the temporal cultural provenance of the shoes are also displayed behind these exhibits. Lighting in the exhibition is subdued, in an effort to protect the collection from deterioration. Shoes are typically displayed on a low- rising dais, typically built from blonde maple wood. The smallest shoes typically on display in the permanent exhibition are Chinese shoes made for women who had their foot bound. The exhibition also features a plaster cast of the first known human-like footprint, made from 3.7 million years old footprints found in Tanzania. =Temporary exhibitions= The museum has organized and hosted a number of temporary, and travelling exhibitions in its other exhibition galleries. The museum hosted its first three temporary exhibitions in May 1995. These included The Gentle Step, which focused on the changing status of women in the 19th century, and was reflected in the development of their footwear; One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, an exhibition that focused on footwear in literature; and Inuit Boots: A Woman's Art, which focused on Inuit mukluk making. The following is a sample of temporary exhibitions held at the museum: Nike LeBron 6 Stewie Griffin, on exhibit during the Out of the Box: The Rise of Sneaker Culture travelling exhibition * Inuit Boots: A Women's Art (1995‚Äì1996) * One, Two, Buckle My Shoe: Illustrations from Contemporary Children's Books about Shoes (1995‚Äì1996) * The Gentle Step ‚Äì The Ladies Realm of Fashion 1800‚Äì1900 (1995‚Äì1997) * Shoe Dreams: Designs by Andrea Pfister (1996‚Äì1997) * Tradition and Innovation: Northern Athapaskan Footwear (1996‚Äì1997) * Dance! ‚Äì Minuet to Disco (1997‚Äì1999) * Loose Tongues and Lost Soles: Shoes in Cartoon and Caricature (1997) * Dance!

The collection was initially intended to serve as a \\"working collection\\" for the Bata family, in which shoe making techniques could be learned. Techniques and designs from shoes collected were used to mimic traditional styles found in local markets. However, the scope was later expanded to be a historical and anthropological collection, when Sonja Bata began to collect shoes from local populations where Bata factories were displacing local footwear, in an attempt to preserve and document shoes that were being replaced. The museum presently acquires items for its collection through auction, donations from other collectors, field work, or private vendors. The museum acts to conserve but not restore shoes, preventing ongoing deterioration, but not removing signs of wear or replace missing parts. The following is a part of the museum's philosophy in which it sees worn footwear as having significant cultural meaning. The museum does not restore its older, or heavily damaged pieces it acquires, instead treating it to preserve their present condition, and to prevent further deterioration. The collection is organized into several cultural and geographic areas including Africa, China, India, Japan, Korea, Latin America, the Middle East, indigenous North American, and the circumpolar region. Footwear from First Nations, and northern Canada forms a major portion of the museum's collection. Approximately four per cent of the museum's collection is on display, with the remaining items kept in storage. Stored items are placed in one of two subterranean vaults. In addition to the vaults, the museum also places several \\"stored items\\" in cube cases situated in public areas of the museum, serving as a form of \\"visible storage\\". Silk-satin shoes worn by Queen Victoria on display The museum's oldest piece of footwear from Europe are a pair of sandals, worn by a shepherd from the Tyrolian Alps around 5200 BP. The museum's oldest pair of shoes from the Americas is believed to be an Anasazi made from yucca fibres. The museum also holds a collection of shoes worn by notable individuals, including Pierce Brosnan, Roger Federer, Terry Fox, Elton John, Karen Kain, John Lennon, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Napoleon, Elvis Presley, Robert Redford, Elizabeth Taylor, Pierre Trudeau, and Queen Victoria. Research and programs The Bata Shoe Museum conducts and sponsors research into understanding the role of footwear in cultural and social life. The Bata Shoe Museum Foundation has funded field trips to collect and research footwear in Asia, Europe, and circumpolar regions and cultures where traditions are changing rapid. The foundation has also produced academic publications. The museum is affiliated with Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network, North American Reciprocal Museums, Ontario Association of Art Galleries, and the Virtual Museum of Canada, The museum organizes lectures, performances, and social evenings, often with an ethnocultural focus or community partner. Events often illuminate a personal connection or a cultural context in which footwear was created. An annual lecture series, The Founder's Lecture is held each November and is a public event featuring an internationally recognized leading thinker engaged with the convergence of culture and society. The museum also hosts shoemakers from around the world to demonstrate shoe-making techniques to the public, in an attempt to counteract the displacement of local shoe-making forms. =Outreach= In 2018, nearly 9,000 students visited the museum for school related excursions. The museum has organized themed family activities. The museum holds an annual \\"Warm the Sole Sock Drive\\" fundraiser, which begins on World Kindness Day, to collect socks for donation to a local charity. The museum also operates the Step Ahead program, a program subsidized by the Bank of Montreal, providing at-risk children an opportunity to access the museum's interactive curriculum-based programs free of charge. In 2018, the museum saw 1,800 youths access its facilities through the Step Ahead program. Arms The arms of the Beta Shoe Museum Foundation were formally registered with the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada on 6 May 1995. The coat of arms uses the official colours of the institution, blue and gold, and features a triangular division placed along the position of the thongs found on most sandals. The boot featured on the arms represents all footwear, whereas the two keys is a common symbol in Canadian heraldry for museums. The crest of the arms is animal skin, defaced with a knife, representing two materials used for shoe-making. The museum's motto, One step at a time (or ), is featured on the museums arms. The motto is attributed to Robertson Davies, who suggested it when asked by Sonja Bata. The phrase has multiple meanings, suggesting the progression of the institution and its collection, the progression of research into footwear, and as a description for walking.

In education, recess is the American term (known as break or playtime in the UK), where students have a mid morning snack and play before having lunch after a few more lessons. Typically ten to thirty minutes, in elementary school where students are allowed to leave the school's interior to enter its adjacent outside park where they play on equipment such as slides and swings, play basketball, tetherball, study or talk. Many middle and high schools also offer a recess to provide students with a sufficient opportunity to consume quick snacks, communicate with their peers, visit the restroom, study, and various other activities.  Importance of play in child development  During recess, children play, and learning through play has been long known as a vital aspect of childhood development. Some of the earliest studies of play began with G. Stanley Hall, in the 1890s. These studies sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral tendencies of babies and children. Current research emphasizes recess as a place for children to ‚Äúrole-play essential social skills‚Äù and as an important time in the academic day that ‚Äúcounterbalances the sedentary life at school.‚Äù Play has also been associated with the healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental achievements that assist them in relating with others, and managing stress. Although no formal education exists during recess, sociologists and psychologists consider recess an integral portion of child development, to teach them the importance of social skills and physical education. Play is essential for children to develop not only their physical abilities, but also their intellectual, social, and moral capabilities. Via play, children can learn about the world around them. Some of the known benefits of recess are that students are more on task during academic activities, have improved memory, are more focused, develop a greater number of neural connections, and that it leads to more physical activity outside of the school setting. Psychomotor learning also gives children clues on how the world around them works as they can physically demonstrate such skills. Children need the freedom to play to learn skills necessary to become competent adults such as coping with stress and problem solving. Through the means of caregiver's observations of children's play, one can identify deficiencies in children's development.How much do we know about the importance of play in child development? Tsao, Ling-Ling. Childhood Education. Olney. Summer 2002. Vol. 78, Iss. 4; Pg 230 While there are many types of play children engage in that all contribute to development, it has been emphasized that free, spontaneous play‚Äîthe kind that occurs on playgrounds‚Äîis the most beneficial type of play. Recess is key in the development of children. Studies have shown that recess plays a large role in of how children develop their social skills. During recess, children usually play games involving teamwork. On the playground, children use many leadership skills ‚Äì they educate other children about games to play, take turns, and learn to resolve conflicts while playing these games. The leadership skills promoted throughout recess are how children are able to continue to play the games. Along with developing social skills, recess helps with the development of children's brains. Recess gives the children's brains a chance to ‚Äúregroup‚Äù after a long day of class. Also, the physical activity actually leads to the development of the brain. Brain research has shown a relationship between physical activity and the development of the human brain.Jarrett, O., Waite-Stupiansky, S. (September 2009). Play, Policy, and Practice Interest Forum. Another study supports these findings from the brain research. A school system that dedicated one third of their school day to nonacademic activities such as recess, physical education, etc., led to improved attitudes and fitness, and improved test scores despite spending less time in the classroom. =Social development= Problem solving is an integral part in child development and free play allows for children to learn to problem solve on their own. Teachers and caregivers can scaffold problem solving through modeling or assisting when a confrontation occurs. Although play should involve adults, adults or caregivers should not control the play because when adults control the play, the children can lose their creativity, leadership, and group skills. Adults should let children create and follow agreed upon rules and only intervene if a serious conflict arises. Problem solving encourages children to compromise and cooperate with each other. The conflict resolution process helps children to attain a vast range of social and emotional skills such as empathy, flexibility, self-awareness, and self-regulation. This vast range or capabilities is often referred to as \\"emotional intelligence\\" and is essential to building and maintaining relationships in adult life. Teachers can also view recess as a time to observe children's social and cognitive development skills and be able to develop different activities in the classroom that reflect the children's interests and development. Recess at its core is a social experience for children and as such, plays a significant part in the development of language. Children's intentionality with language during recess is tied closely to navigating the social landscape of the playground. Even as early as preschool, children use language to make group decisions and establish authority or a standing in the social setting of the playground. One researcher states that children use language to ‚Äúinvoke play ideas as their own possessions to manage and control the unfolding play,‚Äù which engages a bidding war for group leadership. When viewing recess through a language perspective, the individual experience of the playground can vary depending on a willingness to follow other's ideas, and the development of language to modify play as it unfolds. Indoor recess Depending on the weather (rain, large amounts of snow, and sometimes in extreme heat), recess may be held indoors. Therefore should include creative activities that promote movement of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, whether in a gym or a classroom. Allowing the students to finish work, play board games or other activities that take more than one to play; this helps encourage group activity and some games are also educational. Or, they might play educational computer games or read books. It also may contribute to do something non-educational, to help unwind and de-stress from the daily workload. Sometimes, some classes might watch a movie. Recess data The debate surrounding recess has been around for decades and is still happening today. Some people believe that recess is important, while others argue that eliminating recess will lead to better academic achievement. Educators, parents, and experts are debating the importance of recess and play time in the school day. Data shows that recess has many benefits for students. These benefits include increased health, increased test scores, increased attention and social abilities, as well as better behavior. This is because during this physical activity, students produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and problem-solving. Also, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) advocates for unstructured play, including recess. NAEYC recommends play as a way for children to decrease stress and develop socially. But, about 40% of school districts in the United States are doing away with recess. Studies show that this lack of free and unstructured play during recess may contribute to the rise in childhood obesity, anxiety and depression among children, as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. =Childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes= Childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes are also a major concern as United States youth do not get the physical outlet needed not only for their cognitive development but for their physical health.Recess-It's Indispensable! Young Children. National Association for the Education of young children. September 2009 Vol. 64, No. 5; pg. 66. Statistics show that children are getting 50% less physical exploration and activity than decades before. Research has shown that spending 60 minutes a day doing physical activity can prevent childhood obesity. The U.S. Health and Human Services department also has a guideline for 60 minutes a day of physical activity. But, research has shown that only very few children actually meet this national guideline. Failure to meet this guideline and exercise daily is leading to harmful health issues for children. Recess can be an outlet for students to get some of this physical activity and aid in preventing childhood obesity and diabetes. = Timing of Recess = Another important aspect of recess to consider is what time of day it should be implemented. Traditionally schools have recess after lunch. But, in 2002, the Recess before Lunch (RBL) movement was founded. A health team in Montana created a study on four schools that made this schedule adjustment. After this study, many schools have started adapting the recess before lunch schedule. Research suggests that having recess before lunch can improve the nutrition and behavior of elementary students. =Effects on classroom behavior= According to the American Heart Association, the CDC reported that there is a link between physical activity and academic performance in 2010. Some benefits to recess include students being more attentive, better academic performance and better behavior. Many different studies show recess as being beneficial to students in the classroom. One of the goals of recess is to help students release excess energy and be refreshed focused upon return to the classroom. According to a 2009 study, children who received daily recess were reported to behave better within the classroom. After a long time in the classroom, students may become restless and disengaged. Studies show that after recess students become more attentive and engaged in classroom discussions. This is because recess gave students a necessary break from the rigorous classroom and learning setting. A 2017 study of fifth graders suggested that 25 minutes of recess could increase students time on task. Also, recess can reduce the risk of students falling asleep during learning time by its physical aspect allows students' bodies to oxygenate and stay awake. Restriction of recess as disciplinary action In many schools around the country recess is taken away from students as disciplinary action. In 2013, researchers form the University of Chicago Illinois found that 68 percent of school districts had no policy or law prohibiting educators to take away physical activity from students. Because of this, many educators and administrators take away recess as a punishment. A Gallup poll conducted in 2009 revealed that 77 percent of principals say that they have taken away recess from students. Oftentimes students serve punishments such as completing late work or talking to the principal regarding behavioral issues during their recess times. However, by taking away recess, student is unable to release the excess energy. Releasing this excess energy can lead to better behavior and academic performance. Although taking away recess as disciplinary action seems to be the decision in many schools, researchers are coming up with alternatives for the elimination of recess. Some of these alternatives include positive reinforcement which rewards children for positive behavior rather than taking away things for negative behavior. In this situation, every child is guaranteed recess. International recess In the United Kingdom and Ireland, high school (11‚Äì16 or 18) students traditionally do not have 'free periods' but do have 'break' which normally occurs just after their second lesson of the day (normally referred to as second period). This generally lasts for around 20 minutes. During break, snacks are sometimes sold in the canteen (U.S. cafeteria) and students normally use this time to socialize or finish off any homework or schoolwork that needs to be completed. Once break is finished, students go to their next class. Lunchtime commences one or two lessons later and usually lasts around 45‚Äì60 minutes. This system is more or less the same in junior schools (7‚Äì11) in the UK and Ireland and in high schools (14‚Äì18) in the U.S., but infant schools (4 or 5‚Äì7) normally add another break time towards the end of the day. In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada \\"recess\\" or playlunch is generally a break between morning and mid-morning classes. It is followed after mid-morning classes by a more lengthy break, lunchtime. Thus, the structure of the school-day consists of three lesson blocks, broken up by two intervals: recess and lunch respectively. There must be at least an hours worth of \\"recess\\" or \\"free period\\" a week. The average school day in Japan is eight hours but the time in the classroom is no different compared to the U.S.: time spent out of the classroom is what makes the day longer. A quarter of the day is spent in non-academic activities. A typical day contains the same amount of instructional time as children in the U.S. but a long enough lunch break to go home and eat with their family. This gives the students time to soak in their morning lesson and prepare for the afternoon session. Students who do not go home read for their pleasure or interact with other students. When the school day is over the majority of the students do not go home, but rather stay after school for clubs and other activities. The benefits of having a longer break and several non-academic clubs after school is that the students interact with one another and tend to have fewer physical symptoms related to stress, as well as better relationships with their classmates. Some schools in Beijing, China allow children to spend an hour or two to socialize or to step out of the classroom per day. Some schools do not have a dedicated recess period, instead allowing a ten-minute break per class session. For lunch, students either pack or buy from the school's lunch area. After lunch time there is a quiet period. During this period, children may read at their desks or play by themselves. Meanwhile, a few students are chosen to help clean up from lunch, which may be perceived as a coveted assignment. Schools implementing a no-recess policy may not even have a playground, while schools allowing recess may have multiple playgrounds or basketball courts. Finnish students rank near the top in terms of academic testing and knowledge, and there students receive over an hour of recess everyday, regardless of the weather. In Finland schools consider recess to be an essential part of the school day, and this element of their curriculum is attracting international attention. In Spain, all primary, middle and high schools allow a recess time for its students. In Wales, pupils are expected to do only one hour of PE per fourteen days.Physical education#cite note-20 = United States = In the United States, recess policies are largely dependent on the school district, and vary from state to state and from school to school. Most states do not have a recess policy. However, it is recommended that schools provide 150 minutes per week for physical activity in elementary schools and 225 minutes per week in middle and high school. The point where recess ends in a child's education is largely dependent on the school district, though by many standards it is removed when the child enters middle school. However, in college, students usually have free periods, which are similar in spirit, although usually one studies or talks with one's friends during such times rather than playing games, which are made difficult by the lack of a playground. = Common recess activities = Recess is a common part of the school day for children around the world, but it has not received much attention from scholars. The research that has been conducted occurred mostly in the United States and the UK. Of the fifty states in the United States, only fifteen have policies that recommend or require daily recess or a physical activity break, and one (Oklahoma) has no policy, but it is recommended by the State Board of Education. Certain activities have emerged as playground favorites, including: jump rope, Chinese jump rope, four square, hop scotch, basketball, soccer, hula hoops, chase, wall ball, and playing on the playground equipment. These activities have been classified into chase games, ball games, and jumping/verbal games. Other categories to consider would be general play and equipment related play. *Chase games: tag, chase, hide and go seek *Ball games: four square, basketball, wall ball, soccer, kick ball *Jumping/verbal games: jump rope, Chinese jump rope, hop scotch, hula hoops, chanting/clapping/rhyming games, Duck Duck Goose *General play: make believe or fantasy play, solitary play *Equipment related play: swings, slides, climbing, monkey bars, tetherball Games and play both occur on playgrounds, so it is important to differentiate between the two when discussing activities in which children engage at recess. One way to view their uniqueness is to look at the function of their rules. Games, such as basketball, have concrete rules that result in penalties when broken. Play rules, on the other hand, are flexible and can change at the discretion of the players. There are times though when kids will bend the concrete rules of some games to make new versions of these games that may or may not be remembered in future times of play. Recess activities run the gamut from simple to complex. Children's gender and age affects their recess recreation choices. The youngest children in elementary schools (kindergarten through second grade) prefer the simplest activities such as chase, kickball, jump rope, and unstructured games. As the school year progresses, it has been observed that chase games diminish and ball games increase. By the time children are in upper elementary school (grades three through five), they prefer sports and social sedentary behavior like talking.  Parliamentary procedure  In parliamentary procedure, a recess refers to a short intermission in a meeting of a deliberative assembly. The members may leave the meeting room, but are expected to remain nearby. A recess may be simply to allow a break (e.g. for lunch) or it may be related to the meeting (e.g. to allow time for vote- counting). Sometimes the line between a recess and an adjournment can be fine. A break for lunch can be more in the nature of a recess or an adjournment depending on the time and the extent of dispersion of the members required for them to be served. But at the resumption of business after a recess, there are never any \\"opening\\" proceedings such as reading of minutes; business picks up right where it left off. The distinction of whether the assembly recesses or adjourns has implications related to the admissibility of a motion to reconsider and enter on the minutes and the renewability of the motion to suspend the rules. Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, a motion to recess may not be called when another person has the floor, is not reconsiderable, and requires a second and a majority vote. When adopted, it has immediate effect. If made when business is pending, it is an undebatable, privileged motion. It can be modified only by amendment of the length of the break. = Stand at ease = Stand at ease is a brief pause without a recess in which the members remain in place but may converse while waiting for the meeting to resume. =Brazil= In the National Congress of Brazil, a recess is a break in congressional activities. During every year-long session, the congress has two scheduled recess periods: a mid-winter break between 17 July and 1 August, and a summer break between 22 December and 2 February of the following year. = United States Congress = In the United States Congress, a recess could mean a temporary interruption or it could mean a longer break, such as one for the holidays or for the summer.

It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service. Stop-loss was used immediately before and during the 1990‚Äì91 Persian Gulf War. Since then, it has been used during deployments to Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo and after the September 11 attacks and the subsequent campaign against terror. The policy has been legally challenged several times. However, federal courts have consistently found that military service members contractually agree that their term of service may be involuntarily extended until the end of their obligated service. Definition Stop-loss was created by the United States Congress after the Vietnam War. Its use is founded on Title 10, United States Code, Section 12305(a) which states in part: \\"... the President may suspend any provision of law relating to promotion, retirement, or separation applicable to any member of the armed forces who the President determines is essential to the national security of the United States\\" and Paragraph 10(c) of DD Form 4/1 (The Armed Forces Enlistment Contract) which states: \\"In the event of war, my enlistment in the Armed Forces continues until six (6) months after the war ends, unless the enlistment is ended sooner by the President of the United States.\\" Every person who enlists in a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces signs an initial contract with an eight (8) year service obligation. The enlistment contract for a person going on active duty generally stipulates an initial period of active duty from 2 to 5 years, followed by service in a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States for the remainder of the eight year obligation. Service members whose ETS, retirement, or end of service obligation date falls during a deployment may be involuntarily extended until the end of their unit's deployment. Controversy The controversy regarding stop-loss focuses mainly on the aspect involving \\"involuntary extension\\" of a service member's initial active duty service obligation. For service members opposed to involuntary extension, it represents implementation of a desultory clause in their contract which alters their expectation of an end of term of service date. It also exposes them to the risk of an additional or prolonged combat deployment. For opponents of a current armed conflict, the public perception of \\"involuntary extension\\" is contrary to the notion of voluntary service and undermines popular support for the conflict. In a campaign speech in 2004, then-presidential candidate John Kerry described stop-loss as a \\"backdoor draft.\\" The use of stop-loss has been criticized by activists and some politicians as an abuse of the spirit of the law, on the basis that Congress has not formally declared war. During August 2007, Iraq Veterans Against the War, an activist organization of former and current service members, announced a national \\"Stop the Stop-Loss\\" campaign at a press conference where they were holding a week-long vigil in a tower erected on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Other anti-Stop-Loss vigils have occurred in Bellingham, Washington, and Colorado Springs, Colorado. On March 10 and 11, 2008, a group of college students, from the organization Our Spring Break, supported by Code Pink and Iraq Veterans Against the War, as well as several other organizations, issued symbolic stop-loss \\"orders\\" to every member of both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in protest of both the practice of stop-lossing, and of the Iraq War. On March 12, 2008, the students \\"enforced\\" the orders by blocking off the exits to the parking garages of the Rayburn House Office Building and the Hart Senate Office Building.Stop-Loss Congress : Stop-Loss Congress =Legal challenges= The first known legal challenge in American history to the involuntary extension of a soldier's enlistment contract occurred during the American Civil War, when Private Edward A. Stevens filed suit against the federal government for extending his three-month enlistment. The prosecuting party for the government was Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War.This case is not reported in any of the usual reports, cannot be found on Lexis or WestLaw, but does appear in the Monthly Law Reporter, vol. 24, nr. 8 (Aug. 1861), page 205; http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mntylr24√∑=11&g;_sent=1&collection;=journals ; or http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101065403014;view=1up;seq=217 . Stevens lost the suit and was confined for \\"mutinous conduct\\" for a brief period of time. Apparently the first time a court decision mentioned the Pentagon's stop-loss policy was in the 1991 decision in the case of Craig L. Sherman.Sherman v. U.S. (M.D. Ga. 1991) 755 F.Supp. 385; https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6751877232381999196 . Sherman was a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force under an enlistment contract that explicitly limited his active duty service to four years. But, in 1990, at the commencement of Operation Desert Storm, President George H.W. Bush issued Executive Order 12722, declaring a national emergency, and Executive Order 12728, which delegated to the Secretary of Defense, who could redelegate further, the President's authority under 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 673c, authorizing the President to suspend any provision of law relating to military retirement or separation of anyone determined to be essential. It was pursuant to this provision and Executive Order that Craig was, after some confusion, ordered to Saudi Arabia. He filed a petition for habeas corpus, based on 50 App. U.S.C. ¬ß 454(c)(1), which forbids involuntary extensions of enlistments unless Congress (not merely the President) declares war or a national emergency. The Court noted that Craig was relying on 50 App. U.S.C. ¬ß 454(c)(1), while the government was relying on 10 U.S.C. ¬ß 673c, the two provisions apparently in conflict. The Court sided with the government, primarily on the ground that 10 U.S.C. 673c was enacted more recently than 50 App. U.S.C. ¬ß454(c)(1), based on the presumptions that Congress was aware of the earlier law when it enacted the later law, and that the later law effectively amended or repealed the earlier law notwithstanding the sections were in different locations in the codification. Further, the Court was reluctant, when the provisions were in evident conflict, to impair the President's ability to respond to a matter of national security. The first legal challenge to the contemporary stop-loss policy came in August 2004, with a lawsuit challenged by David Qualls, a National Guardsman in California. Qualls argued the military breached his enlistment contract by involuntarily extending his term of service. However, his arguments were rejected by Judge Royce C. Lamberth and the case was dismissed.Qualls v. Rumsfeld (DDC Jan. 24, 2006) 412 F.Supp.2d 40; https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=686774253783057933 . Qualls' case was not appealed. In October 2004, a \\"John Doe\\" lawsuit was filed by an anonymous National Guardsman facing stop-loss, challenging the validity of the law that authorized it. This suit was dismissed at trial by Judge Frank C. Damrell Doe v. Rumsfeld (E.D. Cal., Nov. 5, 2004) 2004 u.s.dist. LEXIS 23338, 2004 WL 2753125; https://casetext.com/case/doe-v-rumsfeld-5 . and the court's findings were upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Doe v. Rumsfeld (9th Cir. Jan. 12, 2006) 435 F.3d 980; https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=822752882965330847 . The Ninth Circuit also rejected another similar appeal in Santiago v. Rumsfeld in May, 2005.Santiago v. Rumsfeld (9th Cir. originally May 13, 2005, decision amended and reprinted Sept. 28, 2005) 425 F.3d 549; https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=545158683419738132 . =Government response= The former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, as one of his first acts in his position (he assumed the office December 18, 2006), penned a memo compelling commanders to \\"minimize\\" the stop-lossing of soldiers. The United States Army states that enlisted soldiers facing stop- loss can now voluntarily separate by request, under provision 3-12, but only after they complete an involuntary deployment of twelve to fifteen months and 90 days stabilization time (time allowed to \\"out-process\\" from the military) can they apply. This refers to an Army policy dated Sept. 5, 2002. It allowed enlisted soldiers under stop-loss to voluntarily separate on the first anniversary of their original expiration of service or ETS date (under twelve- month stop-loss); officers and warrant officers, not retirement eligible, to apply to leave one year from the end of their original service obligation date; officers and warrant officers without a service obligation to request separation 12 months after they were first affected by stop-loss; and retirement-eligible soldiers to apply for retirement one year from their original retirement eligibility date (defined as 20 years active federal service) or one year from when stop-loss took effect if the soldier was retirement eligible on the effective date of stop-loss. Despite Secretary Gates's order, by April 2008 use of stop-loss had increased by 43%. Soldiers affected by stop-loss were then serving, on average, an extra 6.6 months, and sergeants through sergeants first class made up 45% of these soldiers. From 2002 through April 2008, 58,300 soldiers were affected by stop-loss, or about 1% of active duty, Reserve, and National Guard troops. Reduction in the use of stop-loss In March 2009, Gates ordered a deep reduction in the number of personnel affected by the stop loss policy, announcing a goal \\"to reduce that number by 50 percent by June 2010 and to bring it down to scores or less by March 2011.\\" Ann Scott Tyson.

A film titled Stop-Loss, released March 2008, details the fictional story of a soldier (played by actor Ryan Phillippe) who goes absent without leave from the military after being notified he is being \\"stop-lossed.\\" September 2008 in the season 2 premier of the Canadian television series The Border, three fictional American soldiers desert to Canada by swimming the Niagara River, using \\"Stop-Loss\\" as their legal basis for refugee status.

In 2015, Stop-Loss was used as a plot device in an episode of The Last Ship. When 16 men wanted to get off the ship, one enlisted member's contracted enlistment was already 3 weeks overdue. If he had not been allowed to jump ship, he would have considered himself to have been \\"Stop-Lossed.\\" See also *Conscription in the United States *Felony waiver *Individual augmentee policy: term used by the Department of Defense for their program of selecting Air Force and Navy Personnel and deploying them to a combat zone. *Ready Reserve References  External links  * Eight soldiers plan to sue over stop-loss policy * \\"troops in Iraq... enlistment has been extended until December 24, 2031\\" - by Rolling Stone magazine, The Return of the Draft 2005 * Ed Stevens, The first soldier to legally challenge to involuntary extension. * 10 USC 12305 and Notes * DD Form 4/1 Category:United States military policies Category:Political controversies in the United States ","title":"Stop-loss policy"},{"id":"1134275","text":"Stop loss may refer to: * Stop-loss insurance, an insurance policy that goes into effect after a set amount is paid in claims * Stop-loss order, stock or commodity market order to close a position if/when losses reach a threshold * Stop-loss policy, US military requirement for soldiers to remain in service beyond their normal discharge date In media * Stop-Loss (film), a 2008 film about soldiers subject to the stop-loss policy * \\"Stop-Loss\\" (Dollhouse), an episode of the TV series Dollhouse  See also  *Escalation of commitment pl:Stop loss ","title":"Stop loss"},{"id":"1134280","text":"The municipal flag of Seattle is teal and white, featuring the Seattle city logo (a portrait of Chief Seattle surrounded by two lines), with the words \\"City of Goodwill\\" above and \\"Seattle\\" below.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. History =Bass Hotels= The origins of the business can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1875, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom. The company later changed its name and, in 1969, Bass Charrington, as it was known at the time, launched the Crest Hotel chain, marking its first entry into the lodging sector. In 1988, the British government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass's further investing in the expansion of its hotel business. This led to it purchasing Holiday Inn International from shareholders. =InterContinental= Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the American Intercontinental Hotels chain as a division of Pan Am and opened the first hotel in Bel√©m, Brazil in 1946. On 19 August 1981, Pan Am sold the holding company Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to the Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988. In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to the British brewery Bass. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the Belgian brewer Interbrew for ¬£2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents. In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets, while IHG focused on hotels and soft drinks. IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering. In April/May 2014, the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from a publicly unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood. In April 2017, the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and hackers had stolen credit card details.

As at 31 March 2019, IHG has 842,759 guest rooms and 5,656 hotels across nearly 100 countries. Criticism = International boycott = The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013, over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a \\"PR coup for the Chinese government\\". = Price fixing = In July 2012, the Office of Fair Trading alleged that IHG had broken competition law by preventing online travel agents from discounting the price of room-only hotel accommodation. In February 2014, IHG agreed to end the practice of price fixing. = Data breach = In February 2017, the hotel chain admitted to a data breach. They asserted that the compromise was minor, having impacted 12 properties. However, in April 2017 it raised the number to 1,200 hotels. The attackers had installed malware designed to access payment card data, which could be used to clone cards and make fraudulent payments. = VAT rules = In May 2012, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) warned IHG that it must not use adverts showing prices for hotel rooms excluding VAT. Because the ASA thought the adverts were likely to be viewed by consumers who must pay VAT, it had decided the adverts were misleading. It ordered IHG that the ads must not appear in their current form again. However, in August 2012, a report by Which? magazine showed that the hotel chain was still breaching VAT rules. = Living wage = In November 2017, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, accused the hotel chain of reneging on a commitment to pay the living wage. =Food poisoning= In July 2016 Intercontinental Adelaide was responsible for giving at least 70 diners salmonella food poisoning. Twenty-one of these people had to be treated at hospital. =Hygiene standards= In September 2017 a consumer rights group accused Intercontinental Beijing Sanlitun of substandard hygiene conditions.

It was written by California Representative Thomas J. Geary and was passed by Congress on . The law required all Chinese residents of the United States to carry a resident permit, a sort of internal passport. Failure to carry the permit at all times was punishable by deportation or a year of hard labor. In addition, Chinese were not allowed to bear witness in court, and could not receive bail in habeas corpus proceedings. The Geary Act was challenged in the courts but was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in an opinion by Justice Horace Gray, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 13 S. Ct. 1016. 37 L.Ed. 905 (1893), Justices David Josiah Brewer, Stephen J. Field, and Chief Justice Melville Fuller dissenting. The Chinese Exclusion Acts remained in force until partly modified by the Magnuson Act in 1943, which slightly opened up Chinese immigration and permitted naturalization. Background Chinese immigrants came to the U.S. in large numbers during the California Gold Rush and in the 1860s when the Central Pacific Railroad recruited labor to build its portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. Once gold became more scarce and labor more competitive, white hostility to the Chinese (as well as other foreign laborers) intensified in the West.The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present. Chicago: A.C. McClurg & Co.. pp. 283‚Äì296 This hostility eventually led to the passage of anti-Chinese immigration laws, such as the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The Act excluded Chinese \\"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation, as well as denying U.S. citizenship to Chinese immigrants.Chinese immigration to the United States, 1851‚Äì1900 at Library of Congress site The Act effectively began immigration enforcement at the border because prior to the passage of the Page Act and Chinese Exclusion Act, there existed no trained officials and interpreters, nor the bureaucratic machinery with which to enforce immigration restriction laws or an effort to document and track the movements and familial relationships of immigrants. These types of policies implemented in the Page and Chinese Exclusion Acts have largely been seen as due to what Erika Lee depicts as Government officials' deep \\"suspicion Chinese were attempting to enter the country under fraudulent pretenses\\".Lee, Erika. At America's Gates, pg. 41 The Act The original Exclusion Act of 1882 only excluded Chinese laborers for a period of 10 years. Following the Exclusion Act of 1882 and other amendments, such as the documentary requirement changing 1884 amendment, efforts were sought to crack down on illegal entry and residence of Chinese in the U.S. When the 1882 Act expired in 1892, Californian Democratic Senator Thomas Geary sponsored the Act's renewal and so the extension provision was named after him. The Geary Act, besides renewing the exclusion of Chinese laborers for another 10 years, also outlined provisions that required Chinese already in the U.S. to possess \\"certificates of residence\\" (as well as \\"certificates of identity\\" after the McCreary amendment was added) that served as proof that they entered the U.S. legally and had the right to remain in the country. The certificates of residence were to cost no more than $1($17.58 in today's money) and contained the name, age, local residence, occupation, and photograph of the applicant. The act placed the burden of proof of their right to be in the U.S. on the Chinese themselves, denied bail to Chinese in habeas corpus proceedings, made it the duty of all Chinese laborers in the U.S. to apply within one year for a certificate of residence, with a duplicate kept in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue, and suitable penalties were prescribed for any falsification of certificates. Another of the Act's provisions required two white witnesses to testify to a Chinese person's immigration status. If any Chinese laborer within the United States without this certificate of residence was \\"deemed and adjudged to be unlawfully in the United States\\", they could be arrested and forced to do hard labor, and be deported after a year.Geary Act (27 Stat. 25), sec. 7, and McCreary Amendment (28 Stat. 7), sec. 2 This was the first time ever illegal immigration to the U.S. was made punishable by such a harsh degree. Even though this Act seems to have granted no concessions to Chinese immigrants whatsoever, historians such as Elmer Clarence Sandmeyer have noted that many Californians were disappointed that the Act did not achieve total exclusion.Sandmeyer, Elmer Clarence. The Anti-Chinese Movement in California, pg 104 Although the Act stated that these certificates ‚Äì as well as similar \\"certificates of identity\\" later created by the then newly formed Bureau of Immigration to document all Chinese who were actually exempt from the Exclusion and subsequent Geary Acts (for example merchants, teachers, travelers, and students) ‚Äì were supposed to serve as \\"indubitable proof of legal entry\\", the documents did not function to protect legal immigrants and residents from government harassment. As Erika Lee describes, because the Act required all Chinese to possess the certificates, the entire Chinese community in the U.S. ‚Äì including immigrants and residents who were supposed to be exempt from the exclusionary laws ‚Äì was exposed to the same level of constraint and inquiry governing Chinese laborers.Lee, Erika. At America's Gates, pg. 42 This unprecedented level of inquiry was motivated by the prejudiced view that it was, as Senator Geary said, \\"impossible to identify [one] Chinaman [from another]\\". No other immigrant group were required to hold documents proving their lawful residence until 1928, when 'immigrant identification cards' were first issued to any new immigrant arriving for permanent residence. These were replaced by green cards, officially called Alien Registration Receipt Cards, after 1940.Alien Registration Act of 1940 Such \\"gatekeeping\\" in Lee's characterization was rooted in \\"a western American desire to sustain white supremacy in a multiracial West\\".Lee,Erika. At America's Gates, pg. 46 Reaction The Los Angeles Herald strongly supported the Act and its certification provision, stating in an editorial that \\"nearly all civilized nations have had until lately a very rigid system of passports in which a very exact personal description of the bearer formed a part.\\" Within a few months of the implementing the Act, Chinese in the U.S. began organizing to resist the enforcement of the law. The heads of the Six Companies, the San Francisco branch of The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, proclaimed that the Chinese in the U.S. ought not register, but rather contribute to a fund for hiring of lawyers to fight the law on the ground of unconstitutionality. The effort was overwhelmingly successful (only 3,169 of the estimated 110,000 Chinese in the country had registered by the April 1893 deadline),Pfaelzer, Jean. Driven Out, pg. 299 yet newspaper coverage of the protest reported Chinese as being slaves to doing whatever The Six Companies told them to do. Resistance came from outside the West of the country as well. The Chinese Equal Rights League in New York and Brooklyn pleaded that its members to help their fellow countrymen, and enrolled some 150 English-speaking Chinese merchants and professionals in New York. Its leaders argued that by making Chinese immigrants pay the \\"illegal costs and expenses\\" of enforcing the law, the bill imposed taxation without representation.Pfaelzer, Jean. Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans, pg. 293 The Chinese Equal Rights League was able to gain much support from whites on the East Coast, as on September 22, 1892, more than one thousand U.S. citizens joined some two hundred Chinese merchants and laborers at Cooper Union in Manhattan to protest the Geary Act. Several Chinese that refused to register for their certificate of residence brought suit that, upon appeal, was brought before the Supreme Court in Fong Yue Ting v. United States in 1893. Among some of the questions brought before the Court was whether the Act violated the 1868 Burlingame Treaty with China, whether hard labor and deportation constituted cruel and unusual punishment and thus violated the Eighth Amendment, whether the Act violated Fifth and Sixth Amendments protections by permitting imprisonment with hard labor without prior indictment or jury trial, whether the act violated the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition against the taking of property or liberty without due process, among other issues. The Court's 5 to 3 decision, delivered by Justice Horace Gray, ruled that the if the U.S. as a sovereign nation had the power to exclude any person or any race it wished, it also must be able to deport any person or race it wished, and thus upheld the Geary Act. The Geary Act provisions for imprisonment and forced labor were invalidated by Wong Wing v. United States in 1896. The Supreme Court ruled that with respect to criminal penalties non-citizens have rights to courts and due process under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. However the government could still detain people pending deportation. Upon hearing the decision, the Chinese Consulate, the Six Companies, and many Chinese in the U.S. stated that they refused to pay their way back to China if deported, thus leaving the U.S. government financially responsible. The Chinese Government also informed the U.S. that if it acted on the law, it would end all relations ‚Äì diplomatic and economic ‚Äì with the U.S. Additionally, since Congress did not write any provisions granting money to pay for, and thus enforce, deportations, the Act as was rendered moot until it was amended through the McCreary amendment (named after the senator who proposed it) to appease the Chinese government, but did so only by providing an additional six months for Chinese to register for the residency certificates. Even with the amendment, Congress only appropriated several hundred thousand dollars to the law's enforcement. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of the law, there were practical problems with implementation. Nationally, only 13,242 Chinese laborers registered, about 14 percent of those subject to the law.Lucy Salyer, Laws Harsh as Tigers: Chinese Immigrants and the Shaping of Modern Immigration Law, 46‚Äì48 The cost of arresting and deporting as many as 85,000 unregistered Chinese was estimated at more than $7 million, but Congress had authorized only $60,000 and failed to provide a mechanism for deportation within the Geary Act.Notes on Recent Decisions, Minnesota Law Journal vol. 1, no. 4 (August 1893), 86. When Ny Look, a Chinese Civil War veteran was arrested in New York for failure to register, Judge Emile Henry Lacombe of the U.S. Circuit Court in the Southern District of New York, ruled in In re Ny Look that there were no deportation provisions in the law and Look could not be detained indefinitely therefore he should be released.In re Ny Look, C.C.

These problems led to the passage of an amendment, known as the McCreary Amendment, which provided an additional six months for Chinese to register, as well as additional restrictions such as photographs on the registration certificates.Anna Pegler-Gordon, In Sight of America: Photography and the Development of U.S. Immigration Policy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009).

He is the longest-serving deputy premier and the third longest-serving treasurer in South Australian history. Early life Foley was raised in Port Adelaide and educated at Royal Park High School. He left school at the age of 16 and began working for Cadbury- Schweppes. He later worked variously for the Australian Trade Commission, Boral Limited and steel distribution company Australian National Industries. Immediately before entering Parliament, Foley worked as a senior advisor and chief of staff to former South Australian Premier Lynn Arnold. Political career Foley unsuccessfully contested seat of Semaphore at the 1989 election against Independent Labor MP Norm Peterson. However, he won the seat of Hart at the 1993 election before moving to the seat of Port Adelaide due to Hart's abolition at the 2002 election. Prior to the 2002 election, Foley did not serve in the position of Deputy Opposition Leader. However, as a result of previous Deputy Leader Annette Hurley failing to win a seat in Parliament at the 2002 election Foley was elected deputy leader and treasurer by the Labor Caucus. As treasurer, Foley was responsible for rebuilding the state's finances, culminating in the attainment of a AAA credit rating. He also played a leading role in securing a series of significant defence contracts, negotiating the Olympic Dam mine expansion and supporting many of the state's largest infrastructure projects, such as the Adelaide Oval redevelopment and the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. Whilst in Government, Foley served in a range of other cabinet positions, including Minister for Industry, Investment and Trade; Minister for Federal/State Relations; Minister Assisting the Premier in Economic Development; Minister for Police; Minister for Defence Industries; Minister for Emergency Services, Minister for Motor Sport; and Minister Assisting the Premier with the Olympic Dam Expansion Project. Foley was a member of the Defence SA Advisory Board from its establishment in 2007 until 2011. In 2011, Foley said that he thought Australia should embrace nuclear power. Foley announced his resignation from the roles of deputy premier and treasurer in February 2011, although he continued as a member of cabinet with the Defence, Police, Emergency Services and Motor Sports portfolios. In October 2011 he resigned from the cabinet, coinciding with Mike Rann's resignation as premier. Foley's parliamentary resignation took effect on 12 December 2011, creating a 2012 Port Adelaide by-election. Post-parliamentary career In February 2012, Foley established his own corporate advisory firm Foley Advisory,http://foleyadvisory.com.au/ and has a \\"strategic alignment\\" with the lobbyists Bespoke Approach.Former treasurer Kevin Foley and ex-Mike Rann deputy chief of staff Jill Bottrall register as lobbyists The Advertiser, 13 November 2012.

For his accomplishments, he received honorary doctorates from Wheaton and Houghton Colleges.  Early life  Tozer hailed from a tiny farming community in western La Jose, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christianity as a teenager in Akron, Ohio: while on his way home from work at a tire company, he overheard a street preacher say, \\"If you don't know how to be saved ... just call on God, saying, 'Lord, be merciful to me a sinner.'\\" Upon returning home, he climbed into the attic and heeded the preacher's advice.  Pastor  In 1919, five years after his conversion and without formal education in Christian theology, Tozer accepted an offer to serve as pastor of his first church. That began 44 years of ministry associated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA), a Protestant Evangelical denomination, 33 of them serving as a pastor in several different congregations (his first, a small storefront church in Nutter Fort, West Virginia). Later, and for thirty years (1928 to 1959), he was the pastor of Southside Alliance Church in Chicago; the final years of his life he spent as pastor of Avenue Road Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Observing contemporary Christian living, Tozer felt the church was on a dangerous course toward compromising with \\"worldly\\" concerns. Born into poverty, Tozer was self-educated and taught himself what he missed in high school and university.A. W. Tozer (Author of The Pursuit of God), www.goodreads.com. Accessed 2013-07-11.  Author  In May 1950, Tozer was elected the editor of Alliance Weekly magazine (now Alliance Life), a position he filled until his death in 1963. Alliance Life is the official publication of the C&MA; and is currently a bi-monthly magazine. The publication, begun by A. B. Simpson was originally named The Word, The Work, and The World, later renamed The Alliance Weekly, later renamed The Alliance Witness, later renamed to its present name Alliance Life. From his first editorial, titled Quality vs Quantity dated June 3, 1950, Tozer wrote, \\"It will cost something to walk slow in the parade of the ages, while excited men of time rush about confusing motion with progress. But it will pay in the long run and the true Christian is not much interested in anything short of that.\\" Among the more than 60 books that bear his name, most of which were compiled after his death from sermons he preached and articles he wrote, at least two are regarded as Christian classics: The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy. Many of his books impress on the reader the possibility and necessity for a deeper relationship with God. Death He spent his last years of ministry at Avenue Road Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he died from a heart attack. He was buried in Ellet Cemetery, Akron, Ohio, with a simple epitaph marking his grave: \\"A. W. Tozer - A Man of God.\\" History: A.W. Tozer, cmalliance.org. His last message, The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches, printed in the Alliance Weekly and dated May 15, 1963, was published 3 days after his death. His biographer James L. Snyder has suggested that \\"In a sense it was his valedictory, for it expressed the concern of his heart.\\" Tozer says here \\"Among the gospel churches Christ is in fact little more than a beloved symbol ... The Lordship of Jesus is not quite forgotten, but it has been mostly relegated to the hymnal where all responsibility toward it may be discharged in a glow of pleasant religious emotion.\\" Personal life Tozer had seven children, six sons and a daughter.Tancordo, and James Joshua. ‚ÄúA.

Living a simple and non-materialistic lifestyle, he and his wife, Ada Cecelia Pfautz, never owned a car, preferring bus and train travel. Even after becoming a well-known Christian author, Tozer signed away much of his royalties to those who were in need. Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. \\"His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life,\\" comments his biographer, James L. Snyder, in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A.W. Tozer. \\"He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them,\\" writes Snyder. Legacy Over the years, many have been inspired by the life and sermons of Tozer. In 1950, Tozer received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Wheaton College. In 1952, he received an honorary LL.D. degree from Houghton College. This issue of The Alliance Witness is subtitled Dr. A. W. Tozer Memorial Issue. In 2011, Christian music artist Lauren Barlow of BarlowGirl published a compilation of stories told by 59 artists, writers, and leaders about how A.W. Tozer inspired them.

Types Market liquidity ‚Äì An asset cannot be sold due to lack of liquidity in the market ‚Äì essentially a sub-set of market risk. This can be accounted for by: *Widening bid/offer spread *Making explicit liquidity reserves *Lengthening holding period for VaR calculations Funding liquidity ‚Äì Risk that liabilities: *Cannot be met when they fall due *Can only be met at an uneconomic price *Can be name-specific or systemic Causes Liquidity risk arises from situations in which a party interested in trading an asset cannot do it because nobody in the market wants to trade for that asset. Liquidity risk becomes particularly important to parties who are about to hold or currently hold an asset, since it affects their ability to trade. Manifestation of liquidity risk is very different from a drop of price to zero. In case of a drop of an asset's price to zero, the market is saying that the asset is worthless. However, if one party cannot find another party interested in trading the asset, this can potentially be only a problem of the market participants with finding each other. This is why liquidity risk is usually found to be higher in emerging markets or low-volume markets. Liquidity risk is financial risk due to uncertain liquidity. An institution might lose liquidity if its credit rating falls, it experiences sudden unexpected cash outflows, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid trading with or lending to the institution. A firm is also exposed to liquidity risk if markets on which it depends are subject to loss of liquidity. Market and funding liquidity risks compound each other as it is difficult to sell when other investors face funding problems and it is difficult to get funding when the collateral is hard to sell. Liquidity risk also tends to compound other risks. If a trading organization has a position in an illiquid asset, its limited ability to liquidate that position at short notice will compound its market risk. Suppose a firm has offsetting cash flows with two different counterparties on a given day. If the counterparty that owes it a payment defaults, the firm will have to raise cash from other sources to make its payment. Should it be unable to do so, it too will default. Here, liquidity risk is compounding credit risk. A position can be hedged against market risk but still entail liquidity risk. This is true in the above credit risk example‚Äîthe two payments are offsetting, so they entail credit risk but not market risk. Another example is the 1993 Metallgesellschaft debacle. Futures contracts were used to hedge an over-the- counter finance (OTC) obligation. It is debatable whether the hedge was effective from a market risk standpoint, but it was the liquidity crisis caused by staggering margin calls on the futures that forced Metallgesellschaft to unwind the positions. Accordingly, liquidity risk has to be managed in addition to market, credit and other risks. Because of its tendency to compound other risks, it is difficult or impossible to isolate liquidity risk. In all but the most simple of circumstances, comprehensive metrics of liquidity risk do not exist. Certain techniques of asset liability management can be applied to assessing liquidity risk. A simple test for liquidity risk is to look at future net cash flows on a day-by-day basis. Any day that has a sizeable negative net cash flow is of concern. Such an analysis can be supplemented with stress testing. Look at net cash flows on a day-to- day basis assuming that an important counterparty defaults. Analyses such as these cannot easily take into account contingent cash flows, such as cash flows from derivatives or mortgage-backed securities. If an organization's cash flows are largely contingent, liquidity risk may be assessed using some form of scenario analysis. A general approach using scenario analysis might entail the following high-level steps: *Construct multiple scenarios for market movements and defaults over a given period of time *Assess day-to-day cash flows under each scenario. Because balance sheets differ so significantly from one organization to the next, there is little standardization in how such analyses are implemented. Regulators are primarily concerned about systemic implications of liquidity risk.  Pricing  Risk-averse investors naturally require higher expected return as compensation for liquidity risk. The liquidity-adjusted CAPM pricing model therefore states that, the higher an asset's market-liquidity risk, the higher its required return. A common method for estimating the upper bound for a security illiquidity discount is by using a Lookback option, where the premia is equal to the difference between the maximum value of a security during a restricted trading period and its value at the end of the period. When the method is extended for corporate debt it is shown that liquidity risk increases with a bond credit risk. Measures of liquidity risk =Liquidity gap= Culp defines the liquidity gap as the net liquid assets of a firm. The excess value of the firm's liquid assets over its volatile liabilities. A company with a negative liquidity gap should focus on their cash balances and possible unexpected changes in their values. As a static measure of liquidity risk it gives no indication of how the gap would change with an increase in the firm's marginal funding cost. =Elasticity= Culp denotes the change of net of assets over funded liabilities that occurs when the liquidity premium on the bank's marginal funding cost rises by a small amount as the liquidity risk elasticity. For banks this would be measured as a spread over libor, for nonfinancials the LRE would be measured as a spread over commercial paper rates. Problems with the use of liquidity risk elasticity are that it assumes parallel changes in funding spread across all maturities and that it is only accurate for small changes in funding spreads. Measures of asset liquidity =Bid-offer spread= The bid-offer spread is used by market participants as an asset liquidity measure. To compare different products the ratio of the spread to the product's bid price can be used. The smaller the ratio the more liquid the asset is. This spread is composed of operational, administrative, and processing costs as well as the compensation required for the possibility of trading with a more informed trader. =Market depth= Hachmeister refers to market depth as the amount of an asset that can be bought and sold at various bid-ask spreads. Slippage is related to the concept of market depth. Knight and Satchell mention a flow trader needs to consider the effect of executing a large order on the market and to adjust the bid-ask spread accordingly. They calculate the liquidity cost as the difference of the execution price and the initial execution price. =Immediacy= Immediacy refers to the time needed to successfully trade a certain amount of an asset at a prescribed cost. =Resilience= Hachmeister identifies the fourth dimension of liquidity as the speed with which prices return to former levels after a large transaction. Unlike the other measures, resilience can only be determined over a period of time, i.e., resilience is the capacity to recover. Management =Liquidity-adjusted value at risk= Liquidity-adjusted VAR incorporates exogenous liquidity risk into Value at Risk. It can be defined at VAR + ELC (Exogenous Liquidity Cost). The ELC is the worst expected half-spread at a particular confidence level. Another adjustment, introduced in the 1970s with a regulatory precursor to today's VAR measures, is to consider VAR over the period of time needed to liquidate the portfolio. VAR can be calculated over this time period. The BIS mentions \\"... a number of institutions are exploring the use of liquidity adjusted-VAR, in which the holding periods in the risk assessment are adjusted by the length of time required to unwind positions.\\" =Liquidity at risk= Alan Greenspan (1999) discusses management of foreign exchange reserves and suggested a measure called Liquidity at risk. A country's liquidity position under a range of possible outcomes for relevant financial variables (exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads, etc.) is considered. It might be possible to express a standard in terms of the probabilities of different outcomes. For example, an acceptable debt structure could have an average maturity‚Äîaveraged over estimated distributions for relevant financial variables‚Äîin excess of a certain limit. In addition, countries could be expected to hold sufficient liquid reserves to ensure that they could avoid new borrowing for one year with a certain ex ante probability, such as 95 percent of the time. =Scenario analysis-based contingency plans= The FDIC discuss liquidity risk management and write \\"Contingency funding plans should incorporate events that could rapidly affect an institution‚Äôs liquidity, including a sudden inability to securitize assets, tightening of collateral requirements or other restrictive terms associated with secured borrowings, or the loss of a large depositor or counterparty.\\" Greenspan's liquidity at risk concept is an example of scenario based liquidity risk management. =Diversification of liquidity providers= If several liquidity providers are on call then if any of those providers increases its costs of supplying liquidity, the impact of this is reduced. The American Academy of Actuaries wrote \\"While a company is in good financial shape, it may wish to establish durable, ever-green (i.e., always available) liquidity lines of credit. The credit issuer should have an appropriately high credit rating to increase the chances that the resources will be there when needed.\\" =Derivatives= Bhaduri, Meissner and Youn discuss five derivatives created specifically for hedging liquidity risk.: * Withdrawal option: A put of the illiquid underlying at the market price. * Bermudan-style return put option: Right to put the option at a specified strike. * Return swap: Swap the underlying's return for LIBOR paid periodicially. * Return swaption: Option to enter into the return swap. * Liquidity option: \\"Knock-in\\" barrier option, where the barrier is a liquidity metric. Case studies =Amaranth Advisors LLC ‚Äì 2006= Amaranth Advisors lost roughly $6bn in the natural gas futures market in September 2006. Amaranth had taken a concentrated, leveraged, and undiversified position in its natural gas strategy. Amaranth's positions were staggeringly large, representing around 10% of the global market in natural gas futures. Chincarini notes that firms need to manage liquidity risk explicitly. The inability to sell a futures contract at or near the latest quoted price is related to one's concentration in the security. In Amaranth's case, the concentration was far too high and there were no natural counterparties when they needed to unwind the positions. Chincarini (2006) argues that part of the loss Amaranth incurred was due to asset illiquidity. Regression analysis on the 3 week return on natural gas future contracts from August 31, 2006 to September 21, 2006 against the excess open interest suggested that contracts whose open interest was much higher on August 31, 2006 than the historical normalized value, experienced larger negative returns. =Northern Rock ‚Äì 2007= Northern Rock suffered from funding liquidity risk in September 2007 following the subprime crisis. The firm suffered from liquidity issues despite being solvent at the time, because maturing loans and deposits could not be renewed in the short-term money markets. In response, the FSA now places greater supervisory focus on liquidity risk especially with regard to \\"high- impact retail firms\\". =LTCM ‚Äì 1998= Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was bailed out by a consortium of 14 banks in 1998 after being caught in a cash-flow crisis when economic shocks resulted in excessive mark-to-market losses and margin calls. The fund suffered from a combination of funding and asset liquidity issues. The asset liquidity issue arose from LTCM's failure to account for liquidity becoming more valuable, as it did following the crisis. Since much of its balance sheet was exposed to liquidity risk premium, its short positions would increase in price relative to its long positions. This was essentially a massive, unhedged exposure to a single risk factor. LTCM had been aware of funding liquidity risk. Indeed, they estimated that in times of severe stress, cuts on AAA-rated commercial mortgages would increase from 2% to 10%, and similarly for other securitiles. In response to this, LTCM had negotiated long-term financing with margins fixed for several weeks on many of their collateralized loans. Due to an escalating liquidity spiral, LTCM could ultimately not fund its positions in spite of its numerous measures to control funding risk.

This conception is based on a business perspective, recognizing that there are threats entailed in the business operating environment. The idea is that businesses do not operate in a vacuum and that, in the exploitation of opportunities and their engagement with other businesses, their activities tend to become subjects of legal liabilities and obligations. One of the primary reasons why legal risk is associated with operational risk involves fraud since it is recognized as the most significant category of operational loss events and considered to be a legal issue as well. These, however, do not mean that legal risk is only confined to this conceptualization because it is defined in more than way. For instance, there are specific sets of legal risks that are defined by the European Union (EU) Law. In 2005, the European Central Bank declared that it will develop its own legal risk definition to help \\"facilitate proper risk assessment and risk management, as well as ensure a consistent approach between EU credit institutions.\\"  Definitions  There is no standard definition, but there are at least two primary/secondary definition sets in circulation. Mcormick, R. 2004 Legal risk is the risk of loss to an institution which is primarily caused by: (a) a defective transaction; or (b) a claim (including a defense to a claim or a counterclaim) being made or some other event occurring which results in a liability for the institution or other loss (for example, as a result of the termination of a contract) or; (c) failing to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution; or (d) change in law.Roger McCormick. \\"Legal Risk in the Financial Markets\\", Oxford University Press Mcormick, R. 2004 Management of legal risk is not a precise science and subjective to the situation of the institution, and primarily caused by the lack of proper communication channel, undefined institutional objectives (such as the lack of policies and regulations), unclarified information flow between different personnel and department, lack of delegation of power to specify task on mitigation of risks.Roger McCormick. \\"The Management of Legal RIsk by Financial Institutions\\", RSM ;Johnson and Swanson. 2007 The expenses of litigation of a company. ;Whalley, M. 2016 Legal risk is the risk of financial or reputational loss that can result from lack of awareness or misunderstanding of, ambiguity in, or reckless indifference to, the way law and regulation apply to your business, its relationships, processes, products and services. ;Tsui TC. 2013 The cost and loss of income caused by legal uncertainty, multiplied by possibility of the individual event or legal environment as a whole.

Magnuson of Washington and signed into law on December 17, 1943 in the United States. It allowed Chinese immigration for the first time since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and permitted some Chinese immigrants already residing in the country to become naturalized citizens. However, the Magnuson Act provided for the continuation of the ban against the ownership of property and businesses by ethnic Chinese. In many states, Chinese Americans (including US citizens) were denied property-ownership rights either by law or de facto until the Magnuson Act itself was fully repealed in 1965. This act is the first legislation since 1870 which relaxed racial and national immigration barriers in the United States and started the way to the completely non-racial immigration legislation and policy of the late 1960s. The Magnuson Act was passed on December 17, 1943, two years after China became an official allied nation of the United States in World War II. Although considered a positive development by many, it was particularly restrictive of Chinese immigrants, limiting them to an annual quota of 105 new entry visas. The quota was supposedly determined by the Immigration Act of 1924, which set immigration from qualifying countries at 2% of the number of people who were already living in the United States in 1890 of that nationality. However, the arrived- at number of 105 per annum granted to the Chinese was disproportionately low. (The quota should have been 2,150 per annum, as official census figures place the population of ethnic Chinese living in the US in 1890 at 107,488 persons.) Regardless of the method of calculation, the number of Chinese immigrants allowed into the USA was disproportionately low in ratio to the sanctioned immigration of other nationalities and ethnicities. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers and later by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula.

The company has been serving the amusement industry for 30 years, through three operating divisions: Attractions Development; Content Licensing, Production & Distribution; and Technology/Engineering. SimEx Inc. is the parent company of SimEx-Iwerks Entertainment. The company is based in Toronto, Canada with additional locations in Baltimore, Maryland; and Santa Clarita, California. History Iwerks Entertainment Inc. is an American film studio founded in 1985 in Burbank, California, by Oscar winner and Disney Legend Don Iwerks and Stan Kinsey, both former Disney Executives. The company was named to honor Don's father, Ub Iwerks, who was Walt Disney's first business partner and co-creator of Mickey Mouse. Since the merger of SimEx Inc. and Iwerks Entertainment Inc. in 2002, the company traded under the name ‚ÄúSimEx-Iwerks Entertainment‚Äù with its head office in Toronto and Iwerks offices in Baltimore and Los Angeles. SimEx's origins lie with the creation by Michael Needham, Shiori Sudo and Moses Znaimer of Tour of the Universe (1984) at the CN Tower, Toronto. In the 1980s SimEx and Iwerks developed their own separate visions for motion ride attractions. Toronto based SimEx developed a series of attraction products using motion systems provided by Moog Inc. of East Aurora, New York. Moog's technology integrated novel electromechanical actuators with solid-state control systems to create a variety of attraction platforms. In 1996, SimEx launched SimEx Virtual Voyages, a 15-minute attraction that follows a 3-stage storyline: introduction (pre-show); plot development (story theater); and climax (the ride). Over 40 SimEx Virtual Voyages attractions were built worldwide. Los Angeles-based Iwerks developed innovative 8/70 projection technologies for Extreme Screen Theaters and two- seat motion systems (TurboRide). In 1998, Iwerks Co-founder Don Iwerks was awarded the Gordon E. Sawyer Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in recognition of his lifetime of contribution to the science and technology of motion pictures.http://www.iwerks.com/Default.asp?id=8&l;=1 In 2000, Iwerks launched its Iwerks Extreme Screen Bran. In the same year, the Iwerks 8/70 Linear Loop projection system was recognized for its industry leading technology with an Academy Award for Scientific and Technical Achievement. In 2001, SimEx acquired assets from the RideFilm Division of Imax Corporation and in 2002, SimEx merged with Iwerks Entertainment. In 2003, SimEx-Iwerks designed the first full-motion 4-D seat for Universal Studio's Shrek 4-D attractions in Hollywood, Orlando and Osaka. In late 1999, Iwerks Entertainment acquired the assets of McFadden Systems. In 1992, Warner Bros. Movie World approached McFadden to develop a motion simulator for Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride. Later motion systems were built for Star Trek: The Experience, London Trocadero. Academy Awards Iwerks Entertainment has received two Academy Awards by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Scientific and Technical Achievement. The first occurred in 1998 at the 70th Academy Awards show, where founder Don Iwerks was awarded the Gordon E.

Between 1846 and 1858 he undertook four major expeditions. He was the first Surveyor-General of Queensland. He was appointed a lifetime Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Early years Augustus Charles Gregory was born at Farnsfield, Nottingham, England. He was the second of five brothers born to Joshua Gregory and Frances Churchman. Among his brothers were Francis Thomas Gregory, who also became a noted explorer. #Joshua William Gregory, born 1815, died 20 September 1850 aged 35. #Augustus Charles Gregory, born 1 August 1819, died 1905 aged 86 #Francis (Frank) Thomas Gregory, born 1821. #Henry Churcham Gregory, born 1823, died London 29 July 1903 aged 79 yearsEngland & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1995 for Henry Churchman Gregory #Charles Frederick Gregory, born 1825. A. C. Gregory was educated privately by tutors and later by his mother. In 1829, the family emigrated to Western Australia on board the Lotus, arriving at the Swan River Colony only four months after its establishment. The Gregory family were initially granted land on the left bank of the Swan River, but the soil was poor, and they later obtained two further grants, one at Maylands and another in the Upper Swan district. For much of the 1830s, Augustus took jobs to supplement the family's income. For a while he worked for a chemist, and later in partnership with his brother Joshua William as a contract surveyor. In December 1841, he joined the Government Survey Office. Explorations Augustus Gregory ‚Äì Australian exploration routes Gregory's Tree above Victoria River, appr. 20 km west of Timber Creek. The date, 2 July 1856, was carved into it by Thomas Baines, the expedition's artist. In 1846, with his two brothers, F. T. Gregory and H. C. Gregory, he made his first exploration. With four horses and seven weeks' provisions they left T. N. Yule's station 60 miles northeast of Perth on 7 August 1846 and explored a considerable amount of the country to the north of Perth, returning after an absence of 47 days during which they had covered 953 miles (1534 km). Two years later, Gregory led an expedition to examine the course of the Gascoyne River and, in particular, to look for new pasture-land. The party left on 2 September 1848, crossing the Murchison River 25 September, but the country was very dry and it became difficult to water the horses. Gregory decided to turn south again in the beginning of October, and on 6 October decided to rest the horses by the Murchison River. The party returned to Perth on 12 November after having found good pastures. Despite water supply difficulties, about 1500 miles (2414 km) were covered in a period of 10 weeks. In 1854 while Assistant Surveyor of Western Australia, Gregory was asked to lead an expedition to the interior, from a rendezvous point at Moreton Bay near Brisbane. Gregory had his brother, H. C. Gregory, as second in command and Baron von Mueller as botanist. There were 19 men altogether, with 50 horses and 200 sheep. The party left Moreton Bay by sea on 12 August 1855, and Port Essington was sighted on 1 September. On the next day their vessel grounded on a reef and it was impossible to float off until 10 September. They proceeded to Pearce Point (Joseph Bonaparte Gulf), and at the end of the month the party reached the estuary of the Victoria River. The party split up, with one group going up the river in a schooner, while Gregory led the other over the range. It was on this trip that Gregory made contact with the Gurindji people, with his party their first ever contact with Europeans. They were reunited on 20 October, establishing a camp 20 km west of today's Timber Creek. Gregory led several forays up the Victoria River and traced Sturt's Creek for 300 miles (483 km) until it disappeared in the Tanami Desert. The core team returned to the base camp in the dry season of 1856. On 2 July 1856 Gregory left an inscription on a large boab tree (so-called Gregory's Tree), indicating where he left a letter in case the expedition team should get lost. Turning east, the party explored the Elsey, Roper and Macarthur Rivers, then travelled back to Brisbane by way of the Flinders, Burdekin, Fitzroy and Burnett Rivers. They reached Brisbane on 16 December 1856 having surveyed an extensive swath of land. In sixteen months the expedition had journeyed over 2000 miles (3219 km) by sea and 5000 (8047 km) by land. In September 1857 Gregory was hired by the government of New South Wales to search for traces of Ludwig Leichhardt, a fellow explorer who had disappeared on an earlier expedition. A party of nine was formed with Gregory in command and his brother, C. F. Gregory, as second in command. On 24 March 1858 the expedition left Juandah near the present town of Taroom. On 21 April a tree marked with an L was found in latitude 24 degrees 35 minutes and longitude 146 degrees 6 minutes. The Barcoo River was then followed to its junction with the Thomson. On 15 May the country was so dry the expedition turned south to save the horses. Cooper Creek was followed until it was close to the South Australian border, coming to Strzelecki Creek on 14 June. Continuing his course mostly to the south, on 26 June he decided to proceed to Adelaide, which was reached at the end of July 1858.

Plaque on Gregory's grave. In 1855 Gregory became a freemason in the Sydney Samaritan Lodge in New South Wales. Gregory was awarded the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1858. Gregory undertook no further explorations but was appointed Surveyor General of Queensland in 1859. He later clashed with William Alcock Tully (then under- secretary for public lands and chief commissioner of crown lands); in 1875 Tully became acting surveyor-general in place of Gregory. Gregory then became a geological surveyor. In 1862, he built by hand the now heritage-listed farmhouse Rainworth at Rosalie in Brisbane. He lived there until his death. He leased a home he had built on the Rainworth estate to surveying colleague, Walter C. Hume, which he and his family re-named \\"Fairseat\\". On 23 December 1862, Gregory was appointed Provincial Grand Master of the England masonic Lodge in Queensland. In 1865 Gregory, Maurice Charles O‚ÄôConnell and John Douglas applied for a special grant of land to erect a Masonic Hall in Brisbane. This was granted on 15 January 1865. On 28 February 1865 Gregory was made a Royal Arch Mason in the North Australia Royal Arch Chapter. From 1880 to his death in 1905, he served as a councillor of the Shire of Toowong and as an alderman of its successor, the Town of Toowong. He was shire president for 12 years, being 1881 to 1884, 1888 to 1890, 1895, 1898 to 1901 and town mayor in 1904. On 10 November 1882 Gregory was made a member of the Queensland Legislative Council (a lifetime appointment). By the late 1880s he had built a summer house in Southport. With his brother, F. T. Gregory, he published their Journals of Australian Exploration in 1884. He was interested in scientific research and was a trustee of the Queensland Museum. Early in 1895, Gregory was appointed Grand Superintendent of Royal Arch Masonry in Queensland. On 25 June 1895 he opened the District Grand Chapter. On 6 November 1903, Gregory was knighted, being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (Imperial) in recognition of his service as Surveyor-General and in the Queensland Legislative Council. Gregory died on 25 June 1905 at his residence Rainworth at Rosalie, Brisbane. His body lay in state at the Masonic Hall in Alice Street where many people came to pay their respects; it was estimated that 1,400 people visited on the morning of the funeral. His funeral took place at the hall in the afternoon of 29 June 1905, after which a funeral procession of several hundred people walked along Alice Street, William Street, North Quay and the River Road (now Coronation Drive) to the Toowong Cemetery where hundreds of people were already assembled at the cemetery. Grgegory was buried high on the northern slope of the hill below Governor Samuel Blackall's grave with Anglican rites conducted by his friend Rev. Thomas Jones of Indooroopilly. After his death, his home Rainworth was rented to a number of people, including Robert Philp. His farm land was eventually subdivided and, to facilitate this, the house Rainworth was relocated to another site, now 7 Barton Street in the suburb of Bardon. The house was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Bust of Augustus Charles Gregory sculpted by Oscar Fristrom in 1905 In late 1905 Brisbane artist Oscar Fristrom sculpted a bust of Gregory. In February 1906, Fristrom offered to sell the bust to the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland but the society decided not to buy it; however, they did display it at an event in June 1906. For many years the bust was displayed at Freemasons‚Äô Gregory Lodge in Cairns (Gregory being depicted wearing his Masonic regalia). In 2018, the Freemasons donated the bust to the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying in Brisbane. As at 10 March 2020, the bust is at the entrance of the museum.

It is the sixth-largest municipally owned park in the United States, and the largest in California. Description The park consists mostly of rugged canyons and hills, with both natural and developed recreation areas, including many beautiful flowers. It is the seventh-largest open space urban park in the United States, consisting of nearly . The highest point is Cowles Mountain, which is also the highest point in the city of San Diego. The San Diego River flows through the park. A one- way access road goes through the park, allowing hikers, bikers and pedestrians on one side and cars on the other. The park is open every day of the year. The park has sixty miles of hiking, mountain bike and equestrian trails, a rock climbing area, and the Kumeyaay Lake Campground with 46 camp sites adjacent to a small lake. There is also the Mission Trails Regional Park Visitor and Interpretive Center. It includes a number of exhibits, a library, and a 93-seat theater that includes a Blu-ray projection system with a large screen. The Visitor Center also includes an art gallery. The most popular trail of the park is the Cowles Mountain trail (pronounced Colz), which takes hundreds of people per day to the summit for a 360-degree panorama of San Diego County. Another popular stop is the Old Mission Dam, which was built to supply irrigation water to farm land that supplied food for the Mission San Diego de Alcala, the first of the chain of missions established by Jun√≠pero Serra in California. Another popular destination within the park is Lake Murray, a reservoir supplying water to San Diego neighborhoods. It has a surface area of approximately 168 acres. The lake is periodically stocked with trout and bass. On December 17, 2014, West Sycamore was officially opened to the public. This increased the size of the park by just over 1,100 acres and includes 6 miles of trails. West Sycamore is located adjacent to the Scripps Ranch community and is at the very east end of Stonebridge Parkway. It is north of the main area of MTRP. Special annual events at Mission Trails include the Amateur Photo Contest which begins in March and entries are due by the middle of April. Each year the park celebrates Explore Mission Trails Day (EMTD) on the third Saturday of May. All the activities for EMTD are free and take place at the Visitor and Interpretive Center and at the Equestrian Staging Area. Natural history The park is in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. It has coastal sage and chaparral and riparian habitats and plant communities of California native plants. 2003 Cedar Fire A significant portion of the park was burned by the Cedar Fire in 2003. As is typical of a chaparral ecology, within a few years the park had recovered and exhibited little evidence of recent fire damage.

(RDA) is a statute passed by the Australian Parliament during the prime ministership of Gough Whitlam. The RDA makes racial discrimination in certain contexts unlawful in Australia, and overrides States and Territory legislation to the extent of any inconsistency. The RDA is administered by the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC). The President of the Commission is responsible for investigating complaints. If a complaint is validated, the Commission will attempt to conciliate the matter. If the Commission cannot negotiate an agreement which is acceptable to the complainant, the complainant's only redress is through the Federal Court or through the Federal Circuit Court. The Commission also attempts to raise awareness about the obligations that individuals and organisations have under the RDA.  Constitutionality of the RDA  The source of the federal Parliament's power to pass the RDA is the \\"external affairs\\" power contained in section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution. Under that power, the federal Parliament implemented international obligations arising under the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which Australia ratified in September 1975. The High Court of Australia confirmed that the external affairs power was a valid source of power for the RDA in Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen,. and again in Mabo v Queensland (No 1).. While the AHRC maintains that the RDA provides an appropriate balance between freedom of speech and freedom from racial vilification, some legal academics have suggested that section 18C of the RDA (see below) may be unconstitutional, on the basis that it is inconsistent with the constitutional implied freedom of political communication. Scope of the Act = Prohibition of racial discrimination in certain contexts = Racial discrimination occurs under the RDA when someone is treated less fairly than someone else in a similar situation because of their race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Racial discrimination can also occur when a policy or rule appears to treat everyone in the same way but actually has an unfair effect on more people of a particular race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin than others. It is against the law to discriminate in areas such as: *Employment (section 15) - e.g. when seeking employment, training, promotion, equal pay or conditions of employment; *Land, housing or accommodation (section 12) - e.g. when buying a house or when renting; *Provision of goods and services (section 13) - e.g. when buying something, applying for credit, using banks, seeking assistance from government departments, lawyers, doctors and hospitals, or attending restaurants, pubs, entertainment venues; *Access to places and facilities for use by the public (section 11) - e.g. when trying to use parks, libraries, government offices, hotels, places of worship, entertainment centres, hire cars; *Advertising (section 16) - e.g. advertising for a job stating that people from a certain ethnic group cannot apply; *Joining a trade union (section 14). Cases In Bligh and Ors v State of Queensland [1996] HREOCA 28, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (precursor to the Australian Human Rights Commission) found in favour of a number of Aboriginal applicants who had worked on Great Palm Island Aboriginal reserve and were underpaid between 31 October 1975 (the RDA start date) and 31 May 1984. was awarded to each applicant, although the evidence suggested that the loss of income to . Following this case, the Queensland Government settled 5,729 claims with a single payment of under the Award Wages Process, established in May 1999, to Indigenous people employed by the government on Aboriginal reserves between 1975 and 1986 (the date their policy of paying below-award rates to Indigenous Australians officially ended). In Wotton v Queensland (No 5) police raids and behaviour following the 2004 Palm Island community riot, sparked by the death in custody of an Aboriginal man, were found to have breached the Racial Discrimination Act with $220,000 in damages awarded in 2016.. Police actions were described in the judgement as \\"unnecessary, disproportionate\\" with police having \\"acted in these ways because they were dealing with an Aboriginal community.\\" Dozens of police officers in riot gear wearing balaclavas with no identification and carrying large guns had marched into the community conducting early-morning raids on 27 November 2004. Residents reported officers kicking down doors, pointing guns at children's heads, and tasering residents. with one resident and his partner awarded $235,000 compensation for assault, battery and false imprisonment in a separate case. Subsequently, this led to a record class action settlement of $30 million and a formal apology issued by the Queensland State Government in May 2018. = Section 18C: Prohibition on offence, insult, humiliation or intimidation and Exemptions under Section 18D = Section 18C of the RDA makes it is unlawful for a person to do an act in public if it is reasonably likely to \\"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\\" a person of a certain race, colour or national or ethnic origin, and the act was done because of one or more of those characteristics... While some conservative politicians have claimed the bar for breaching 18C is too low, courts have consistently shown that this is not the case, and to fall within 18C the speech must have \\"... profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.\\" Exemptions are provided in section 18D, including acts relating to artistic works, genuine academic or scientific purposes, fair reporting, and fair comment on matters of public interest. Cases and determinations in relation to section 18C include the following: * In Bryant v Queensland Newspaper Pty Ltd [1997] HREOCA 23, the predecessor of the AHRC, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) dismissed a complaint by an English person against use of the words \\"Pom\\" and \\"Pommy\\" used in newspapers.. * Rugema v Gadsten Pty Ltd & Derkes [1997] HREOCA 34, the HREOC awarded $55,000 in damages to an African former refugee who had suffered racial abuse in the workplace.. * In Combined Housing Organisation Ltd, Ipswich Regional Atsic for Legal Services, Thompson and Fisher v Hanson [1997] HREOCA 58, the HREOC dismissed a complaint against politician Pauline Hanson over comments about Aboriginal welfare policy.. * In Mcglade v Lightfoot [1999] HREOCA 1, the HREOC dismissed a complaint against Senator Ross Lightfoot over comments he had made that Aboriginal people were the most primitive people on earth and that aspects of their culture were abhorrent, on the basis that he had apologised in the Senate and retracted his comments.. * In Jacobs v Fardig [1999] HREOCA 9, the HREOC found that a Councillor who had made comments about \\"shooting\\" Aboriginal people contravened section 18C.. * In Jones v Toben [2000] HREOCA 39 the HREOC found that a person had contravened section 18C when they referred to the treatment of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s as having been \\"mythologised\\".. Following orders made by the Federal Court of Australia to enforce the Commission's decision, in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia dismissed an appeal from those orders, in which the defendant challenged the constitutional validity of section 18C.. * In McMahon v Bowman [2000] FMCA 3, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia found that a person had contravened section 18C by calling his neighbour a \\"black bastard\\".. * In Wanjurri v Southern Cross Broadcasting (Aus) Ltd [2001] HREOCA 2, the HREOC found that Southern Cross Broadcasting and journalist Howard Sattler had contravened section 18C, and ordered each to pay the five complainants $10,000 in damages.. * In Eatock v Bolt [2011] FCA 1103, the Federal Court of Australia held that newspaper commentator Andrew Bolt had contravened section 18C for comments made in relation to fair-skinned Aboriginal persons. * In Prior v Queensland University of Technology & Others [2016] FCCA 2853, the Federal Circuit Court of Australia summarily dismissed a claim brought by an indigenous staff member at the Queensland University Technology against certain students for comments made on Facebook after one of them had been evicted from a computer room set aside for indigenous students, on the basis that the claim had no reasonable prospects of success.. = Complaint process and remedies = An aggrieved person may make a complaint of a contravention of the RDA to the Australian Human Rights Commission. If the complaint cannot be resolved, then an application alleging \\"unlawful discrimination\\" may be made to the Federal Court of Australia or to the Federal Circuit Court. When such allegations are upheld, the court may make orders, including for compensation.  Proposals for law reform  Section 18C of the RDA has been a topic of debate, especially in recent years. While some conservative politicians have claimed the bar for breaching 18C is too low, courts have consistently shown that this is not the case, and to fall within 18C the speech must have \\"... profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.\\" In 1995, left-wing ABC journalist Phillip Adams argued against the provision, saying that a better response to expressions of racial hatred was \\"public debate, not legal censure\\". In 2011, the Federal Court ruled that commentator Andrew Bolt had contravened section 18C of the RDA as he could not rely on the exemptions under Section 18D. Bolt said that the verdict was \\"a restriction on the freedom of all Australians to discuss multiculturalism and how people identify themselves\\". The political allegiance of the presiding judge to the Australian Labor Party has also been raised as an issue (Justice Bromberg had once stood for Labor pre-selection).Andrew Bolt race-case judge ‚Äòhad ALP links‚Äô; The Australian, Nov 16, 2016 In 2013, members of the Abbott Government proposed significant changes to section 18C in a draft bill put on public exhibition, which would have substantially limited the scope of the prohibition. The Attorney-General, George Brandis, defended the proposed changes, stating that people have \\"a right to be bigots\\". Trade Unionist Paul Howes argued that section 18C stretches out its fingers \\"into the realm of what Orwell might have called a Thought Crime\\". After public consultation and opposition by minority groups, the Government did not proceed with the proposed changes. More recently, members of the Turnbull Government have proposed less significant and narrower changes to section 18C, and the Attorney-General, George Brandis, has asked for the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights to conduct an inquiry on the appropriateness of section in its current form. In March 2016, the Australian Law Reform Commission called for review of section 18C, stating ‚ÄúIn particular, there are arguments that s18C lacks sufficient precision and clarity, and unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech by extending to speech that is reasonably likely to ‚Äòoffend‚Äô.\\" The ALRC noted that it had received \\"widely divergent views\\" on whether s 18C should be amended but found as follows: > \\"In the ALRC‚Äôs view, s 18C of the RDA would benefit from more thorough > review in relation to implications for freedom of speech. In particular, > there are arguments that s 18C lacks sufficient precision and clarity, and > unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech by extending to speech that > is reasonably likely to ‚Äòoffend‚Äô. In some respects, the provision is broader > than is required under international law, broader than similar laws in other > jurisdictions, and may be susceptible to constitutional challenge.\\" In 2016, > Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching, said she was \\"very surprised\\" when Justice > Bromberg decided to hear the Bolt case given, ‚ÄúHe was an active ALP person, > he was active enough that he was in a faction, he ran for preselection... > Obviously he would have had some views about [Andrew Bolt], and perhaps he > was not the best person to hear [the] case.‚Äù Bromberg had run unsuccessfully > for Labor preselection in Melbourne in 2001. In November, 2016, the President of the Human Rights Commission Gillian Triggs voiced support for changes to 18C, saying that removing the words \\"offend\\" and \\"insult\\" and inserting \\"vilify\\" would strengthen the laws. On March 30 2017, the Australian Senate voted down changes to 18C with 31 votes; Labor, Greens, Lambie, Xenophon voting against and 28 votes Liberal, Derryn Hinch, One Nation, and Liberal Democrat for.

At the time, Mysore was a key French ally in India, and the conflict between Britain against the French and Dutch in the American Revolutionary War sparked Anglo‚ÄìMysorean hostilities in India. The great majority of soldiers on the company side were raised, trained, paid and commanded by the company, not the British government. However, the company's operations were bolstered by Crown troops sent from Britain, and by troops sent from Hanover,Hanoverians, Germans, and Europeans: Colonial Identity in Early British India, Chen Tzoref-Ashkenazi, Central European History, Vol. 43, No. 2 (JUNE 2010), 222. which was also ruled by Britain's King George III. Following the British seizure of the French port of Mah√© in 1779, Mysorean ruler Hyder Ali opened hostilities against the British in 1780, with significant success in early campaigns. As the war progressed, the British recovered some territorial losses. Both France and Britain sent troops and naval squadrons from Europe to assist in the war effort, which widened later in 1780 when Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic. In 1783 news of a preliminary peace between France and Britain reached India, resulting in the withdrawal of French support from the Mysorean war effort. The British consequently also sought to end the conflict, and the British government ordered the Company to secure peace with Mysore. This resulted in the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore, restoring the status quo ante bellum under terms that company officials, such as Warren Hastings, found extremely unfavourable. Background Hyder Ali ruled Mysore (though he did not have the title of king). Stung by what he considered a British breach of faith during an earlier war against the Marathas, Hyder Ali committed himself to a French alliance to seek revenge against the British. Upon the French declaration of war against Britain in 1778, aided by the popularity of ambassador Benjamin Franklin, the British East India Company resolved to drive the French out of India by taking the few enclaves of French possessions left on the subcontinent.Barua (p.79) The company began by capturing Pondicherry and other French outposts in 1778. They then captured the French-controlled port at Mah√© on the Malabar coast in 1779. Mah√© was of great strategic importance to Hyder, who received French- supplied arms and munitions through the port, and Hyder had not only told the British that it was under his protection, he had also provided troops for its defence. Hyder set about forming a confederacy against the British, which, in addition to the French, included the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad. War First and the Second Anglo-Mysore Wars The Battle of Pollilur, where the forces of Hyder Ali effectively used Mysorean rockets and Rocket artillery against closely massed British forces. In July 1780 Hyder Ali invaded the Carnatic with an army of 80,000. He descended through the passes of the Eastern Ghats, burning villages as he went, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot. The British responded by sending a force of 5,000 to lift the sieges. From his camp at Arcot, Hyder Ali sent part of his army under the command of his eldest son, Tipu Sultan, to intercept a British force from Guntur, under the command of Colonel William Baillie, which had been sent to reinforce Colonel Hector Munro's army to the north at Madras. On the morning of 10 September 1780, Baillie's force came under heavy fire from Tipu's guns near Pollilur. Baillie formed his force into a long square formation and began to move slowly forward. However, Hyder Ali's cavalry broke through the formation's front, inflicting many casualties and forcing Baillie to surrender. Out of the British force of 3,820 men, 336 were killed. The defeat was considered to be the East India Company's most crushing loss in India up to that time. Munro reacted to the defeat by retreating to Madras, abandoning his baggage and dumping his cannons in the water tank at Kanchipuram, a small town some south of Madras.Barua (p.80) Naravane states in fact that it was a massacre with only 50 officers and 200 men taken prisoner, including Baille. Instead of following up the victory and pressing on for a decisive victory at Madras, Hyder Ali renewed the siege at Arcot, which he captured on 3 November. This decision gave the British time to shore up their defences in the south, and to despatch reinforcements under the command of Sir Eyre Coote to Madras. The British Army encamped below the rock of Sholingarh Coote, though repulsed at Chidambaram, defeated Hyder Ali three times in succession in the battles of Porto Novo, Pollilur and Sholinghur, while Tipu was forced to raise the siege of Wandiwash, and besieged Vellore instead. The arrival of Lord Macartney as governor of Madras in the summer of 1781 included news of war with the Dutch Republic. Macartney ordered the seizure of the Dutch outposts in India, and the British captured the main Dutch outpost at Negapatam after three weeks of siege in November 1781 against defenses that included 2,000 of Hyder Ali's men. This forced Hyder Ali to realize that he could never completely defeat a power that had command of the sea, since British naval support contributed to the victory. Tipu also defeated Colonel Braithwaite at Annagudi near Tanjore on 18 Feb 1782. This army consisted of 100 Europeans, 300 cavalry, 1400 sepoys and 10 field pieces. Tipu seized all the guns and took the entire detachment as prisoners. In December 1781 Tipu had seized Chittur from British hands. These operations gave Tipu valuable military experience. Both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan gained alliances with Ali Raja Bibi Junumabe II and the Muslim Mappila community and later met with Muslim Malay from Melacca under Dutch service. During the summer of 1782 company officials in Bombay sent additional troops to Tellicherry, from whence they began operations against Mysorean holdings in the Malabar. Hyder Ali sent Tipu and a strong force to counter this threat, and the latter had pinned this force at Panianee when he learned of Hyder Ali's sudden death due to cancer. Tipu's precipitate departure from the scene provided some relief to the British force, but Bombay officials sent further reinforcements under General Richard Matthews to the Malabar in late December to relieve before they learned of Hyder Ali's death. When they received this news, they immediately ordered Matthews to cross the Western Ghats to take Bednore, to the extent that he felt compelled to do so despite a lack of sound military footing for the effort. He entered Bednore, which surrendered after Matthews drove Mysorean force from the ghats. However, Matthews had so overextended his supply lines that he was soon thereafter besieged in Bednore by Tipu, and forced to capitulate. Matthews and seventeen other officers were taken to Seringapatam, and from there to the remote hilltop prison of Gopal Drooge (Kabbal Durga) where they were seemingly forced to imbibe a lethal poison.Tim Willasey-Wilsey 'In Search of Gopal Drooge and the Murder of Captain William Richardson, The Journal of the Families in British India Society, no 31 Spring 2014 pp. 16-15. On the east coast, an army led by General James Stuart marched from Madras to resupply besieged fortifications and to dispute Cuddalore, where French forces had arrived and joined with those of Mysore. Stuart besieged Cuddalore even though the forces were nearly equal in size. The French fleet of the Baillie de Suffren drove away the British fleet, and landed marines to assist in Cuddalore's defence. However, when word arrived of a preliminary peace between France and Britain, the siege was ended. General Stuart, who was engaged in disputes with Lord Macartney, was eventually recalled and sent back to England. The British captured Mangalore in March 1783, but Tipu brought his main army over, and after recapturing Bednore, besieged and eventually captured Mangalore. At the same time, troops from Stuart's army were joined with those of Colonel William Fullarton in the Tanjore region, where he captured the fortress at Palghautcherry in November, and then entered Coimbatore against little resistance.

Morret engraving, 1789. During this time, company officials received orders from company headquarters in London to bring an end to the war, and entered negotiations with Tipu. Pursuant to a preliminary cease fire, Colonel Fullarton was ordered to abandon all of his recent conquests. However, due to allegations that Tipu violated terms of the cease fire at Mangalore, Fullarton remained at Palghautcherry. On 30 January the garrison of Mangalore surrendered to Tipu, having lost half its number principally to starvation and scurvy. The war was ended on 11 March 1784 with the signing of the Treaty of Mangalore, at which both sides agreed to restore the others' lands to the status quo ante bellum. The treaty is an important document in the history of India, because it was the last occasion when an Indian power dictated terms to the Company. The great advantage to Tipu was the psychological impact of his victory with the British. The mode of conclusion was highly satisfactory to him. The march of the Commissioner all the way from Madras to Mangalore seeking peace made Munro remark that such indignities were throughout poured upon the British \\"that limited efforts seemed necessary to repudiate the Treaty at the earliest time.\\" Consequences It was the second of four Anglo‚ÄìMysore Wars, which ultimately ended with British control over most of southern India. Pursuant to the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore, the British did not participate in the conflict between Mysore and its neighbors, the Maratha Empire and the Nizam of Hyderabad, that began in 1785. In Parliament, the Pitt administration passed the Pitt's India Act that gave the government control of the East India Company in political matters.C. H. Philips, \\"The East India Company 'Interest' and the English Government, 1783-4.\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (Fourth Series) 20 (1937): 83-101. Battle Honour A battle honour, Carnatic was awarded for two periods: 1780-1784, during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, when Hyder Ali threatened Madras; and 1790-1792, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, up to the siege of Mysore. Originally awarded to three battalions of Bengal Native Infantry in 1829, it lapsed after their disbandment due to participation in the 1857 uprising. In 1889, it was awarded to twenty units of the Madras Presidency Army. The battle honour is considered repugnant, an official term of opprobrium used by the Government of India.

To fulfill these tasks, the department coordinates a portfolio of several agencies and corporations that operate in a similar area of interest. While the roles and responsibilities of the Department of Canadian Heritage have remained relatively constant over the years, the department and composition of its portfolio remain in flux due to continuing structural changes.  History  The Department of Canadian Heritage was initially created from parts of several other federal departments by Kim Campbell. Parks Canada was taken from Environment Canada in 1994, and the Department of Canadian Heritage also inherited activities that formerly belonged to the Department of Communications, the Department of Secretary of State, the Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, and the Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport during that same year. The Department of Canadian Heritage has gone through several structural and portfolio changes since then. In 2003, Parks Canada was returned to the jurisdiction of Environment Canada, and the Department of Canadian Heritage added the Public Service Staff Relations Board to its portfolio. The Public Service Staff Relations Board was removed from the portfolio in 2014, when the Public Service Labour Relations and Employment Board Act came into force. This established the Public Service Staff Relations Board as a quasi-judicial tribunal that operates at arm's length from the government. In late 2008, the multiculturalism section of the Department of Canadian Heritage was transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, then transferred back again in November, 2015. The Status of Women component of the department moved away from the Department of Canadian Heritage's umbrella to become its own department in 2018.  Department  Headquartered in the Jules L√©ger Building (South) (√âdifice Jules L√©ger (Sud)) in Terrasses de la Chaudi√®re, Gatineau, Quebec,\\"Contact Us .\\" Canadian Heritage. Retrieved on February 4, 2011. \\"Address: Canadian Heritage 15 Eddy Street Gatineau, Quebec K1A 0M5.\\" Address in French : \\"Address : Patrimoine canadien 15, rue Eddy Gatineau, Qu√©bec K1A 0M5\\" across the Ottawa River from the Canadian capital of Ottawa, the Department of Canadian Heritage was founded on June 25, 1993. It is an umbrella organization that has one of the largest portfolios in the Canadian federal government. The organizations in the portfolio support the Department of Canadian Heritage in the pursuit of its priorities while also striving to achieve their individual mandates. In addition to coordinating with the organizations in its portfolio, the Department of Canadian Heritage also partners with provincial and territorial governments to organize and oversee visits from the Queen of Canada and other members of the royal family. In 2018, the department had a budget of roughly $3.9 billion.  Officials and structure  The Department of Canadian Heritage is managed by a Deputy Minister, currently H√©l√®ne Laurendeau, with support from an Associate Deputy Minister, currently Isabelle Mondou. Activities at the department are overseen by several senior officials. At the top is the Minister of Heritage and Multiculturalism, currently Steven Guilbeault, who gets reports directly from the Department of Canadian Heritage. Activities related to official languages and the French television network, TV5, are handled by the Minister of Tourism, Official Languages and La Francophonie. This position is currently held by M√©lanie Joly. Matters related to Canadian sports and services are handled by the Minister of Science and Sport, who is currently Kristy Duncan. The department is divided into four different areas that each have their own Assistant Deputy Minister. The four sectors and their Assistant Deputy Ministers are: * Sports, Major Events and Commemorations, administered by the Assistant Deputy Minister, Andrew Campbell * Citizenship, Heritage and Regions, managed by Assistant Deputy Minister, Charles Slowey * Cultural Affairs, lead by Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Jean-St√©phane Pich√© * Strategic policy, Planning and Corporate Affairs, overseen by Assistant Deputy Minister, David Dendooven Portfolio organizations Terrasses de la Chaudi√®re, home of the head office of the Department of Canadian Heritage The portfolio of the Department of Canadian Heritage consists of two special operating agencies, four departmental agencies, twelve Crown corporations, and one administrative tribunal. They all report to Parliament through the same Minister. The Canadian Conservation Institute and the Canadian Heritage Information Network are the two special operating agencies in the portfolio. The four departmental agencies in the portfolio are Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Library and Archives Canada, the National Battlefields Commission, and the National Film Board of Canada. The following Crown corporations are also part of the portfolio: * Canada Council for the Arts * Canadian Science and Technology Museums Corporation * Canadian Broadcasting Corporation * Canadian Museum for Human Rights * Canadian Museum of History * Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 * Canadian Museum of Nature * Canadian Race Relations Foundation * National Arts Centre * National Capital Commission * National Gallery of Canada * Telefilm Canada The only administrative tribunal in the portfolio is called the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board.  Financial support activities  The Department of Canadian Heritage gives out roughly $1.2 billion in grants annually. Funding is available for programs that contribute to the objectives of the Department of Canadian Heritage. These departmental objectives include those that relate to supporting culture, history, heritage, sport and Canada's official languages. In 2019, it was reported that Canadian Heritage provided over $130,000 in public grant money to organizations with ties to United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party. The organizations published ads critical of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. The Department of Canadian Heritage requires that application forms be submitted by the deadlines that are specified under the specific funding program's application guidelines in order to be considered for financial support.

Christ also associated himself with the poor of the world and this is also called the Body of Christ. ‚ÄúIf we truly wish to encounter Christ, we have to touch his body in the suffering bodies of the poor, as a response to the sacramental communion bestowed in the Eucharist. \\"The Body of Christ, broken in the sacred liturgy, can be seen, through charity and sharing, in the faces and persons of the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters‚Äù, said Pope Francis on launching the World Day of the Poor. There are significant differences in how Christians understand the term as used by Christ at the Last Supper and as developed in Christian theology of the Eucharist. For some it may be symbolic, for others it becomes a more literal or mystical understanding. As used by Saint Paul in the Pauline epistles The Body of Christ refers to all individuals who \\"heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit\\" , \\"are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit\\" , are \\"joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love\\" . In Roman Catholic theology the use of the phrase \\"mystical body\\" distinguishes the mystical body of Christ, the Church, from the physical body of Christ, and from a \\"moral body\\" such as any club with a common purpose.Mystici corporis Christi, a papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, sections 60‚Äì62 The Eucharist and real presence A belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist is taught in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, the Moravian Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Methodism and Reformed Christianity, though each tradition teaches a unique view of the doctrine.Neal, Gregory S. (19 December 2014). Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life. WestBow Press. p. 111. . Efforts at mutual understanding of the range of beliefs by these Churches led in the 1980s to consultations on Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry by the World Council of Churches. =Catholicism= While teaching that in the bread consecrated in the Eucharist there is absolutely no change open to the senses or to scientific investigation, the Catholic Church supports the real presence, i.e. that the reality of the bread is changed into that of the body of Christ. The Church teachings refer to this change as one of the \\"substance\\" or \\"transubstantiation\\".Council of Trent, The Thirteenth Session It rejects the Lollard doctrine of \\"consubstantiation\\", which suggests that the substance or reality of the bread remains after the consecration, instead of being converted or changed into that of the body of Christ. At the same time, the Church holds that all that can be examined either directly or by scientific investigation what in Aristotelean philosophy are called the \\"accidents\\" (as opposed to the reality) remains quite unchanged. In the Roman Rite, the priest or other minister who gives the consecrated host to a communicant says: \\"The body of Christ\\", indicating what is held to be the reality of what is given. Since the consecrated bread is believed to be the body of Christ and sacred, what remains of the host after celebration of Mass is kept in the church tabernacle. This is primarily for the purpose of taking Communion to the sick, but also to serve as a focal point for private devotion and prayer. On appropriate occasions, there may be public Eucharistic adoration. =Eastern Orthodoxy= The Eastern Orthodox Church also believes that the Eucharistic elements of bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. It has authoritatively used the term \\"Transubstantiation\\" to describe this change, as in The Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church\\"The bread and wine are changed, or transubstantiated, into the very Body of Christ, and into the very Blood of Christ\\" (question 339). and in the decrees of the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem.\\"In the celebration (of the Eucharist) we believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be present, not typically, nor figuratively, nor by superabundant grace, as in the other Mysteries, nor by a bare presence, as some of the Fathers have said concerning Baptism, or by impanation, so that the Divinity of the Word is united to the set forth bread of the Eucharist hypostatically, as the followers of Luther most ignorantly and wretchedly suppose, but truly and really, so that after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, the bread is transmuted, transubstantiated, converted and transformed into the true Body Itself of the Lord, Which was born in Bethlehem of the ever-Virgin, was baptised in the Jordan, suffered, was buried, rose again, was received up, sitteth at the right hand of the God and Father, and is to come again in the clouds of Heaven; and the wine is converted and transubstantiated into the true Blood Itself of the Lord, Which as He hung upon the Cross, was poured out for the life of the world.\\" (Decree XVII ) =Lutheranism= Martin Luther reasoned that because divinity involves omnipresence, the body of Christ can be present in the Eucharist because of its participation in the divine nature.The Encyclopedia of Protestantism by Hans Joachim Hillerbrand 2003 page 676 In current Lutheran teachings, the Body of Christ is used in a somewhat similar form to the Catholic teachings, but the Lutherans reject the Catholic teaching of transubstantiation, instead teaching the doctrine of the sacramental union. For the Lutheran, the Body of Christ is the formal title of the sacramental bread in the Eucharist, as seen in the Lutheran Divine Service. =Moravianism= Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the \\"most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour.\\" The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the \\"sacramental presence\\", teaching that in the sacrament of Holy Communion: =Reformed Christianity= The Reformed Churches, which include the Continental Reformed, Reformed Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Reformed Baptist traditions, teach the pneumatic presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper--that Christ is really spiritually present in the sacrament of Holy Communion. The Congregationalist theologian Alfred Ernest Garvie explicated the Congregationalist belief regarding the pneumatic presence in The Holy Catholic Church from the Congregational Point of View: =Methodism= Methodists teach the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but maintain that the way He is made present to be a Holy Mystery. The Discipline of the Free Methodist Church thus teaches: The Church =Catholicism= 1 Corinthians, from the Douai Bible, 1749 The first meaning that Catholics attach to the expression \\"Body of Christ\\" is the Catholic Church. The Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes with approval, as \\"summing up the faith of the holy doctors and the good sense of the believer\\", the reply of Saint Joan of Arc to her judges: \\"About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 795 In the same passage, it also quotes Saint Augustine: \\"Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the whole man.... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. But what does 'head and members' mean? Christ and the Church.\\" In light of all this, the Catholic Church calls itself the \\"universal sacrament of salvation\\" for the whole world, as it dispenses the sacraments which give the grace of Christ to the recipient. Saint Paul the Apostle spoke of this unity of Christians with Christ, referred to in the New Testament also in images such as that of the vine and the branches, in terms of a single body that has Christ as its head in ,, and , and . According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \\"the comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted: the unity of all her members with each other as a result of their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church as bride of Christ.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 789 The Catechism spells out the significance of each of these three aspects. To distinguish the Body of Christ in this sense from his physical body, the term \\"Mystical Body of Christ\\" is often used. This term was used as the first words, and so as the title, of the encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi of Pope Pius XII. In that document, Pope Pius XII in 1943 states, \\"the mystical Body of Christ... is the Catholic Church.\\" But in 1964 the Catholic bishops gathered at the Second Vatican Council, while acknowledging that ‚Äúfull incorporation‚Äù in the Church required union with the Sovereign Pontiff, described various degrees of being ‚Äúconjoined‚Äù or ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to the Church including all persons of good will,Vatican II Decree on the Church which was not something new.Lumen Gentium, Chapter 2, Footnote 19. The Council's decree on Ecumenism stated that \\"all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body\\" (3). Following this understanding, Karl Rahner coined the term ‚Äúanonymous Christians‚Äù.Anonymous Christians =Eastern Orthodoxy= The Orthodox see the description of the Church (Ecclessia) as the \\"Body of Christ\\" as being inextricably connected to Holy Communion. According to Saint Ignatius (c. 35‚Äì107), the unity of the Church is expressed in Eucharistic terms. Just as there are many offerings made throughout the world on any given day, and yet all partake of one and the same Body of Christ, so the Church, though existing in many separate localities, is only one. =Protestantism= In modern teachings, the \\"Body of Christ\\" is used by other Protestants to collectively describe believers in Christ, as opposed to only those who are members of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Christians are members of the universal body of Christ not because of identification with the institution of the Church, but through identification with Christ directly through faith. This theology is based on several passages in the Bible, including ,, , and , and . Jesus Christ is seen as the \\"head\\" of the body, which is the church, while the \\"members\\" of the body are seen as members of the Church. In this way, Protestantism defines the \\"Body of Christ\\" in a much broader way than does the Catholic Church. This has allowed for a broad base within Christianity to call themselves part of the \\"Body of Christ.\\" See also * Christian Church * Eucharist * Sacramental bread * Blood of Christ * Bride of Christ * Mystici corporis Christi References Further reading *Kim, Yung Suk.

History Cruizer class brig-sloop HMS Pelorus aground at low water. Pelorus Sound is named after this ship. The local iwi (tribe) of the indigenous people of New Zealand is the NgƒÅti Kuia. According to NgƒÅti Kuia oral tradition, their founding father, a descendant of Kupe, came to the South Island in his waka Te Hoiere. In 1642, Abel Tasman sailed past D'Urville Island. French and Russian explorers followed and in the 1770s Captain James Cook arrived. In 1838, Philip Chetwode in command of the Cruizer class brig-sloop, HMS Pelorus, carried out the first survey of Pelorus Sound. The sound was named in honour of this survey. A pelorus was a navigational instrument used on sailing ships. The instrument, in turn, was named after the pilot for Hannibal, circa 203 BC. In 1864, gold was discovered in the Wakamarina Valley and, for a brief time, Havelock became a boom town as several thousand prospectors flooded the area.McLintock A. H. (1966) Marlborough Provence and Provincial District An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, updated 18-Sep-2007.Gold fields - Marlborough Press, 25 May 1864 In 1865, the first timber mill started at Mahikipawa, an upper arm of Pelorus Sound. More mills were established, and native timber was shipped around New Zealand and to Australia. By the start of the 20th century the timber camps had largely given way to dairy and sheep farms. In 1939 the last mill was closed. About 325 million feet of timber had been sawn over a period of sixty years, and only two small areas of native timber remained.Brownlee & Co. Sawmilling Industry - Havelock Museum. In 1888, a Risso‚Äôs dolphin appeared in the sounds. This dolphin became famous as Pelorus Jack and became the first dolphin in the world to receive the protection of the law. Pelorus Jack would accompany boats to and from the notorious French Pass. He would join boats bound for Nelson at the entrance to Pelorus Sound and for eight kilometres would ride their bow waves to Pelorus Sound. He did not go through the pass with them, but would met returning boats as they exited the pass. Pelorus Jack was last seen in April 1912. The lightkeeper at French Pass claimed he found the body of Pelorus Jack decomposing on the shore.Gerard Hutching.

Industry =Marine farming= A vessel moored up against a mussel long line Over 80 percent of New Zealand‚Äôs aquaculture exports - worth more than $NZ 200 million per annum - come from the Marlborough Sounds. Most of the marine farms are in Pelorus Sound. Most of the exports involve green-lipped mussels. A New Zealand sea sponge, Mycale hentscheli, which grows in Pelorus Sound, may hold the key to an anti-cancer drug. Scientists are working to see how peloruside, a substance produced by the sponges, might be used as a cancer-fighting drug. Marine farmers are helping Victoria University of Wellington and NIWA develop a method for growing the sponge on an existing mussel farm.Anti-cancer sponge: the race is on for aquaculture supply ‚Äì NIWA. Accessed 5 March 2009.Aquaculture in New Zealand ‚Äì aquaculture.govt.nz, p. 14. Trial mussel farms began in the Marlborough Sounds in the late 1960s. In the Pelorus Sound waters, mussel farms started in Kenepuru Sound and in Crail Bay. Subsequently, Pelorus has become the major mussel-producing area in New Zealand. Initially, the mussels were cultured on ropes suspended from rafts. It was a labour-intensive method which has since been replaced with a modified Japanese longline system, where mussel spat is packed into stockings and suspended from parallel rows of looped ropes, supported by buoys.Wassilieff, Maggy Aquaculture: Green-lipped mussels Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21 September 2007 In 1981 the first specially designed mussel-processing factory started operations at Havelock, at the head of the sounds. Havelock has become the main centre for landing harvested mussels, with other smaller processing plants at French Pass, Elaine Bay, Okiwi Bay and Rai Valley. People are needed to manage and work the farms, and to harvest and transport the mussels to the processing plants. As a result, the mussel-farming industry has become closely linked to several local communities.Baines J, McClintock EW and Taylor, N (2000)Resource Community Formation and Change: A Case Study of Havelock Taylor Baines & Associates. Working Paper No. 26. Heavy rain can result in high sediment- levels in rivers and land runoff, and can contain bacterial contamination from livestock. This can result in mussel-farming areas being closed to harvesting. Applications to increase mussel farms in Admiralty Bay have been successfully opposed on the grounds that the area is a special feeding site for the dusky dolphin. A claim has been made, and a studyDOC paper Lloyd 2003Markowitz et al. 2004: Dusky dolphin foraging habitat: overlap with aquaculture carried out in New Zealand, that marine farms may affect the feeding ability of Dusky dolphins which round up shoals of schooling fish such as pilchard. Group to fight mussel farms The Nelson Mail, 31 August 2005. The farming of Chinook Salmon also occurs in the outer Pelorus, with sites at Bulwer and the Waitata Reach. Salmon farming in the sounds is likely to expand in future years into the Cook Strait. =Pine forestry= Since the 1970s, large areas of exotic (pine) forest have been planted around the sounds. Bulk timber is exported from a deep-water berth in Shakespeare Bay to the west of Picton. MƒÅori The indigenous people of New Zealand are the MƒÅori. The local iwi, NgƒÅti Kuia, NgƒÅti Koata and NgƒÅti Toa have engaged in marine farming with the aim of supplying better employment for their people. They are concerned about protecting their sacred sites, and about the environmental effects of industrial scale marine farming. They have objected to some development projects, such as a mussel farm in an area where their people are starting to return to the land, and a proposed harbour development at Havelock, where the local dump was located near sites and a waterway sacred to Ngati Kuia. Maori groups are becoming better resourced through settlements and income from fisheries quotas. They are more active at looking after their interests. Community tensions have increased, with some interests feeling MƒÅori hold up development. Tides and currents Kenepuru Sound at sunset during an oceanographic voyage in 2008 There have been several hydrographic studies in Pelorus Sound. These show the importance of the large, variable freshwater input into Pelorus Sound. The Sound has 380 kilometres (240 mi) of shoreline and an area of . Average freshwater input is , of which the Pelorus and Kaituna Rivers at the head of the sound deliver respectively. Rain falling directly on the surface of the sound provides another , and the remainder drains from adjacent land via small streams.Heath, R.A. (1974) Physical oceanographic observations in Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 8(4), 691-708. This freshwater input corresponds to a depth of of water distributed over the area of the sound per year. The freshwater input is highly variable. In a typical year there are several events where the daily rainfall exceeds and the river flow exceeds . The freshwater inflow generates an estuarine circulation in the main channel, with low-salinity water moving outwards at the surface, and higher-salinity water flowing inwards below. The currents in the main channel associated with this circulation are typically , but immediately after a flood event they can be much larger. Fresh water layers have been observed to spread through the Sound at .Carter, L., Seston transport and deposition in Pelorus Sound, South Island, New Zealand, N.Z. Jour. Mar. Fresh. Res. 10, 263-282, 1976 After each flood event, the freshwater is slowly flushed out of the sound, with a flushing timeTomczak, M (2000) Oceanography Notes Ch. 15: The flushing time estimated to be 21 days.Heath, R.A. (1974) Physical oceanographic observations in Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand journal of marine and freshwater research, 8(4), 691-708. The tidal regime at the entrance to Pelorus Sound is typical of New Zealand coastal locations, i.e. there is a semi-diurnal tide modulated on a spring-neap cycle, generated by the superposition of M2 (lunar, semi- diurnal) and S2 (solar, semi-diurnal) tidal constituents. Other tidal constituents, notably N2 (semi-diurnal, generated by the ellipticity of the moon‚Äôs orbit), introduce further modulation, meaning that the spring-neap cycle is not exactly repeated. The tidal range varies between at neap and at spring. (These values are calculated from a sea level time series, July 1997 ‚Äì February 1998, at Pelorus Sound entrance.) The propagation of this tidal signal into Pelorus Sound has not been well described, but models and measurements both suggest that the tidal range within the sound is somewhat larger (by 10‚Äì20%) than at the entrance. Because the sound is long, and in places narrow, the tidal currents are fairly strong. A further factor affecting the hydrodynamics of Pelorus Sound is wind. Winds in the area are generally strong and are channelled by the steep topography. Wind stress acting on the surface generates currents, which have not been well described. The wind stress also generates turbulence, which causes the surface fresh water to be mixed down and results in a brackish layer typically thick. The interface, called a pycnocline, between the brackish near-surface water and the denser water below supports internal wave motion. Waves on the pycnocline, called internal waves, are ubiquitous in Pelorus Sound.Sutton, P. and M. Hadfield, 1997, Aspects of the hydrodynamics of Beatrix Bay and Pelorus Sound, New Zealand. N.Z. Jour. Mar. Fresh. Res. 31, 271-279.Stevens, C. 2003 Turbulence in an Estuarine Embayment: Observations from Beatrix Bay, New Zealand, Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 108(C2), 10.1029/2001JC001221. They propagate at and involve vertical displacements of the pycnocline through . They are often generated by the tide, in which case they are called internal tides. They play an important part in driving flow and horizontal exchange in bays off the main channel. For example, current meter records at the entrance to Beatrix Bay show a significant semi-diurnal component with velocities up to . This is not simple, uniform tidal flow in and out of the bay because its amplitude does not follow a spring-neap cycle and there is a phase difference of several hours between the surface and the bottom.

These very large paintings (quadroni), approximately five by six metres each, are displayed each November in the Milan Cathedral in honor of St. Charles' name day on November 4. They were also exhibited continuously from November 4, 1999 to November 4, 2000 in honor of the Catholic Jubilee celebrations. The first cycle was begun in 1602, 26 years after Charles' death, and is the larger of the two. It is known as I fatti della vita del beato Carlo (\\"The Facts of the Life of Blessed Charles\\"). It consists of 28 paintings depicting his life, concentrating upon his tenure as Archbishop of Milan. Work on this cycle continued into the late 18th century. The first twenty large paintings, all tempera on canvas, were painted by Il Cerano (4 paintings), Giovanni Mauro della Rovere (Il Fiammenghino) (3), Il Duchino (7), Procaccini (1), Carlo Buzzi (2), Domenico Pellegrini (1), and Morazzone. The second cycle, I miracoli di San Carlo (\\"The Miracles of St. Charles\\"), consists of 24 paintings of Charles' miraculous works and healings. These paintings are smaller than the first set, measuring about 2.4 by 4.4 metres. They were all painted between December 1609 and November 1, 1610, when St. Charles was canonized. These paintings were displayed together with the first cycle for the first time on November 4, 1610 in the Milan Cathedral; the paintings of his miracles could not be displayed until he had been declared a Saint.

The United States Navy contracted the development of the XPB2M-1 Mars in 1938 as a long-range ocean patrol flying boat, which later entered production as the JRM Mars long-range transport. Four of the surviving aircraft were later converted for civilian use to firefighting water bombers. Two of the aircraft still remain based at Sproat Lake just outside of Port Alberni, British Columbia, although neither are operational.

Retrieved: 13 November 2010. The XPB2M-1 was launched on 8 November 1941. After a delay caused by an engine fire during ground runs, the aircraft first flew on 23 June 1942. After flight tests with the XPB2M between 1942 and 1943, she was passed on to the Navy. The original patrol bomber concept was considered obsolete by this time, and the Mars was converted into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. The Navy was satisfied with the performance, and ordered 20 of the modified JRM-1 Mars. The first, named Hawaii Mars, was delivered in June 1945, but with the end of World War II the Navy scaled back their order, buying only the five aircraft which were then on the production line.Bridgeman 1946, pp. 244‚Äì245. Though the original Hawaii Mars was lost in an accident on Chesapeake Bay a few weeks after it first flew, the other five Mars were completed, and the last delivered in 1947.

The last production airplane (the Caroline Mars) was designated JRM-2, powered by Pratt & Whitney R-4360 engines, and featured a higher maximum weight and other improvements. On 4 March 1949, the Caroline Mars set a new world passenger load record by carrying 269 people from San Diego to Alameda, CA.Hills, Warring. \\"Caroline Mars Sets World Record 1949.\\" cv10navalaviator.wordpress.com, 25 February 2011. On 5 April 1950, the Marshall Mars was lost near Hawaii when an engine fire consumed the airplane after her crew had evacuated. The remaining \\"Big Four\\" flew record amounts of Naval cargo on the San Francisco-Honolulu route efficiently until 1956, when they were beached at NAS Alameda. =Civilian use= In 1959, the remaining Mars aircraft were to be sold for scrap, but a Canadian company, Forest Industries Flying Tankers (FIFT), was formed and bid for the four aircraft and a large spares inventory. The company represented a consortium of British Columbia forest companies, and the bid was accepted and the sale completed in December 1959. The four aircraft were flown to Fairey Aviation at Victoria, British Columbia, for conversion into water bombers. The conversion involved the installation of a plywood tank in the cargo bay with retractable pick-up scoops to allow uploading of water while the aircraft was taxiing. The scoops allowed 30 tons of water to be taken on board in 22 seconds. Later some of the hull fuel tanks were replaced with water tanks. The Marianas Mars crashed near Northwest Bay, British Columbia, on 23 June 1961 during firefighting operations; all four crew members were lost. Just over a year later, on 12 October 1962 while parked onshore at the Victoria airport, the Caroline Mars was damaged beyond repair by Typhoon Freda when she was blown 200 yards, breaking her back.http://www.fhabc.org/newsletter- archive/2002/66.pdf pg6 The Hawaii Mars and Philippine Mars had their conversion into water bombers advanced and entered service in 1963. They appeared at local airshows, demonstrating their water-dropping ability. Flying Tankers Inc. flew the water bombers to hot spots around the province when a need developed, such as in August 2003, when a large forest fire threatened the outskirts of Kelowna, British Columbia. On 10 November 2006, TimberWest Forest Ltd. announced they were looking for buyers of the Mars. A condition of sale was that the purchaser would have to donate one plane back to Port Alberni when they were retired, as a historic attraction.\\"TimberWest Seeks Buyers For Martin Mars Water Bombers.\\" TimberWest Forest Ltd., 12 November 2006.

Coulson also cautioned against any plans to open the aircraft as a tourist attraction because of the 2013 closure of the Flying Tankers Bomber Base Museum from poor attendance. In May 2015, the Hawaii Mars received a small contract to be used briefly for training Chinese pilots. This was done using the Martin Mars to evaluate against civil certification regulations by The International Test Pilot School, on how to handle such a large amphibious aircraft. These pilots will be involved with the Chinese state owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China as they get ready to launch their forthcoming AVIC TA-600 airplane. Subsequently, in July 2015, the airplane was put back in service after public outcry, being awarded a 30-day contract from the BC Government to help with a particularly bad fire season. In 2016, the Hawaii Mars made its first appearance at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in hopes of being sold or leased to a new home or business. One of the pilots on the way to Oshkosh was well-known Kermit Weeks. According to the Smithsonian Channel episode of Mighty Planes Martin Mars, only one Martin Mars is now flying.

The war was instigated in part by the machinations of Asaf Jah II, the Nizam of Hyderabad, who sought to divert the company's resources from attempts to gain control of the Northern Circars. Background The eighteenth century was a period of great turmoil in Indian subcontinent. Although the century opened with much of the subcontinent under the control of the Mughal Empire, the death in 1707 of Emperor Aurangzeb resulted in the fracturing of the empire, and a struggle among viceroys and other local rulers for territory.Bowring, pp. 19‚Äì23 In the 1740s and 1750s French and British colonial companies became more active in these local conflicts, and by the Third Carnatic War (1757‚Äì1763) the British had not only gained somewhat solid footholds at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, but they had also marginalised but not eliminated the influence of other colonial powers. Their eastern holdings at Madras were strongly influenced by treaties with the Nawab of Carnatic, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, whose territory surrounded Madras. The other major powers in the east were the Nizam of Hyderabad, formerly a viceroyalty of the Mughul Empire but declared independent in the 1720s, held in the 1760s by Asaf Jah II, and the Sultanate of Mysore, which occupied the high plains between the Eastern and Western Ghats, the mountain ranges separating the coastal plains of India from the interior. Nominally ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty, control of Mysore had in 1761 come into the hands of Hyder Ali, a Muslim military leader.Bowring, p. 33 Each of these powers intrigued with and against the others, and sought to draw the power of the French and British colonial companies to serve their objectives. The colonial powers sought to influence the local powers to gain either direct control of territory, or the revenues from territory nominally controlled by a local ruler beholden to them for financial and military support. Since European military training was significantly better than local practices, the latter was particularly important; small numbers of disciplined European or European-trained forces could defeat significantly larger Indian armies composed mainly of poorly trained infantry and cavalry.Duff, pp. 607‚Äì608 Causes of war The flag of the Sultanate of Mysore. The British East India Company, seeking an overland connection between its holdings at Madras and Bengal, sought to gain access to the Northern Circars, a series of coastal territories held by the French until 1758, when they were ousted with British military support. They had applied to the nizam, offering to pay rent well above that he was currently receiving from the nawab of Arcot; the nizam rejected their offers.Duff, p. 651 Lord Robert Clive next applied to Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, who in August 1765 issued a decree granting the company rights to that territory.Duff, p. 652 At the same time, the nizam was involved in an alliance with the Marathas. Both he and the Marathas' ruling peshwa, Madhavrao I were concerned over the expansionist threat posed by Hyder Ali. After assisting the Marathas in dealing with one of their confederates 1765, the allies began developing plans to invade Mysore. When the British began occupying the Northern Circars in March 1766, the nizam objected, issuing threatening letters to company authorities in Madras.Regani, p. 130 He considered going to war against the company, but his poor financial condition made this impossible.Regani, p. 131 Instead he negotiated a treaty with the company in November 1766. Under its terms the company received four of the five circar immediately (Guntur, the fifth, having been granted to the nizam's son as a jaghir, was to be delivered upon the son's death) in exchange for 7 lakh rupees or military support to the nizam in his endeavours. One historian describes the nizam's agreement to the treaty as one of financial necessity, and that he was \\"resentful\\" of English power.Regani, pp. 133‚Äì134 Pursuant to this treaty, the company provided two battalions of troops to the nizam. Under the treaty, there were no limits placed on the number of troops the nizam could request, nor were there checks on the uses (offensive or defensive) to which he could put them. Conflict involving Madras authorities, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and Hyder Ali, was also simmering. Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, allied to the British, whose territory his surrounded, was upset that Hyder was harbouring opponents of his, including his older brother Mahfuhz Khan, and Raja Saheb, the son of Chanda Saheb, a previous contender for the throne of the Carnatic. Hyder was annoyed that the British had established a fortified outpost at Vellore, and that the company had several times rebuffed his offers of alliance. An offer he made in late 1766 was rejected because the local company council viewed it as incompatible with the treaty signed with the nizam. The first Anglo mysore war saw Hyder ali gain some measures of success against the British, almost capturing madrasRegani, p. 129 Course of the war Krishnagiri fort was besieged in the first Anglo-Mysore war in 1768, and finally surrendered to the British, who held it briefly The war began in January 1767 when the Marathas, possibly anticipating movements by the nizam, invaded northern Mysore. They reached as far south as the Tunghabadhra River, before Haider entered into negotiations to end the invasion. In exchange for payments of 30 lakhs rupees the Marathas agreed to withdraw north of the Kistna River; by March, when the nizam began his invasion, they had already withdrawn. According to Mysore historian Mark Wilks, this action by the Marathas was a somewhat typical move to acquire wealth that might otherwise be claimed by other belligerents.Duff, p. 653 The nizam advanced as far as Bangalore, accompanied by two battalions of company troops under Colonel Joseph Smith. In May, Smith discovered that the Haider and the nizam were negotiating an alliance, and consequently withdrew most of his troops to the Carnatic frontier.Wilks, p. 306 The deal struck between the two powers called for them to join against the British. Haider was to pay 18 lakhs rupees for the invasion to end, and the nizam was to recognise Haider's son Tipu Sultan as Nawab of the Carnatic once that territory was conquered. Despite the agreement the two sides exhibited little trust for one another; Haider was known to place spies in the nizam's camp. This diplomatic manoeuvring resulted in an attack against a company outpost at Changama by the combined Mysore- Hyderabad army under Hyder's command.Wilks, p. 312 Despite significantly outnumbering the British force (British estimates place the allied army size at 70,000 to the British 7,000), the allies were repulsed with heavy losses. Haider moved on to capture Kaveripattinam after two days of siege, while Colonel Smith, who commanded at Changama, eventually retreated to Tiruvannamalai for supplies and reinforcements.Bowring, p. 49Wilks, p. 311 There Haider again attacked, and was decisively repulsed on 26 September 1767.Bowring, p. 50 With the onset of the monsoon season, Haider opted to continue campaigning rather than adopting the usual practice of suspending operations because of the difficult conditions the weather created for armies.Wilks, p. 322 After overrunning a few lesser outposts, he besieged Ambur in November 1767, forcing the British to resume campaigning.Wilks, p. 323 The British garrison commander refused large bribes offered by Haider in exchange for surrender, and the arrival of a relief column in early December forced Haider to lift the siege.Wilks, p. 324 He retreated northward, covering the movements of the nizam's forces, but was disheartened when an entire corps of European cavalry deserted to the British.Wilks, p. 326 The failures of this campaign, combined with successful British advances in the Northern Circars and secret negotiations between the British and the nizam, led to a split between Haider and the nizam. The latter withdrew back to Hyderabad and eventually negotiated a new treaty with the British company in 1768. Haider, apparently seeking an end to the conflict, made peace overtures to the British, but was rebuffed.Wilks, pp. 328‚Äì329 Asaf Jah II opposed the East India Company in 1766, and initially allied himself with Haider Ali during the First Anglo-Mysore War, particularly during the Battle of Chengam, but later abandoned Mysore's cause in 1768. In early 1768, company authorities in Bombay organised an expedition to Mysore's Malabar coast territories. Hyder had established a small fleet, based primarily in the port of Mangalore, in the mid-1760s. This fleet, which the British reported as numbering about ten ships, deserted en masse, apparently because the captains were unhappy with Lutf Ali Beg, a Mysorean cavalry officer, as fleet commander.Sen, pp. 147‚Äì148 Owing to a British deception, Lutf Ali Beg also withdrew much of the Mangalore garrison to move on what he perceived to be the British target, Onore. The British consequently occupied Mangalore against minimal opposition in February.Wilks, p. 331 This activity, combined with the loss of the nizam as an ally, prompted Hyder to withdraw from the Carnatic, and move with speed to the Malabar. Dispatching his son Tipu with an advance force, Haider followed, and eventually retook Mangalore and the other ports held by the over-extended British forces. He also levied additional taxes as punishment against rebellious Nair districts that had supported the British.Bowring, p. 51 During Haider's absence from the Carnatic, the British recovered many places that Hyder had taken and only weakly garrisoned, and advanced as far south as Dindigul.Bowring, p. 52 They also convinced the Marathas to enter the conflict, and a large force of theirs, under the command of Morari Rao, joined with Colonel Smith at Ooscota in early August 1768.Wilks, p. 340 This army then began preparations to besiege Bangalore, but Hyder returned to Bangalore from the Malabar on 9 August, in time to harass the allies before the siege could begin.Wilks, pp. 341‚Äì342 On 22 August Hyder attacked the Maratha camp at Ooscota, but was repulsed with heavy losses.Wilks, p. 342 Hyder was then foiled in an attempt to prevent the arrival of a second British column at the allied camp; the strength of these combined forces convinced him to retreat from Bangalore toward Gurramkonda, where he was reinforced by his brother in law.Bowring, p. 53 He also attempted diplomatic measures to prevent a siege of Bangalore, offering to pay ten lakhs rupees and grant other land concessions in exchange for peace. The British countered with an aggressive list of demands that included payments of tribute to the nizam and larger land concessions to the British East India Company. Hyder specifically refused to deal with Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, whose lands were where much of the fighting had taken place, and a man Hyder intensely disliked. The negotiations failed to reach common ground. On 3 October, Hyder, while moving his army from Guuramkonda back toward Bangalore, surprised a small garrison of Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah's men at a rock fort called Mulwagal, near Ooscota. British reinforcements were sent, and Colonel Wood was able to recover the lower fort but not the upper. The next day he went out with a few companies of men to investigate movements that might have been cover for enemy reinforcements. This small force, numbering four companies, was surrounded by Hyder's entire army.Wilks, p. 346 A stratagem by another officer, Colonel Brooks, prevented the loss of this detachment; Colonel Brooks and another two companies dragged two cannons to the top of a nearby rise, and Brooks called out \\"Smith! Smith!\\" while firing the cannons.Wilks, p. 347 Both sides interpreted this to mean that Colonel Smith was arriving in force, and Hyder's troops began to retreat. This enabled Colonel Wood to join with Brooks and other reinforcements from Mulwagal before Hyder realised he had been fooled. Hyder renewed his attack, but was eventually repulsed with heavy losses: he was estimated to lose 1,000 men while the British lost about 200.Wilks, p. 348 The severity of the conflict convinced Colonel Smith that he would be unable to effectively besiege Bangalore without first inflicting a major defeat on Hyder in open battle.Bowring, p. 54 Company officials blamed Smith for the failure to decisively defeat Hyder, and recalled him to Madras. Hyder took the opportunity to besiege Hosur, and Colonel Wood marched in relief of the town. As Wood approached, Hyder raised the siege, sneaked around Wood's column, and attacked his baggage train near Bagalur. Hyder successfully captured supplies and arms, and drove Wood in disgrace toward Venkatagiri.Bowring, p. 55 Wood was consequently recalled and replaced by Colonel Lang.Bowring, p. 56 Hyder then raised additional forces in Mysore and went on the offensive. In November 1768 he split his army into two, and crossed the ghats into the Carnatic, regaining control of many minor posts held by the British. En route to Erode Hyder overwhelmed one contingent of British, who were sent as prisoners to Seringapatam when it was established that one of its officers was fighting in violation of a parole agreement. After rapidly establishing control over much of the southern Carnatic, his march turned toward Madras. This prompted the British to send an envoy to discuss peace; because of Hyder's insistence that the nawab of the Carnatic be excluded from the negotiations, they went nowhere.

The film was written, directed, produced, edited and scored by Shane Carruth, who also stars with David Sullivan. Primer is of note for its extremely low budget, experimental plot structure, philosophical implications, and complex technical dialogue, which Carruth, a college graduate with a degree in mathematics and a former engineer, chose not to simplify for the sake of the audience. The film collected the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, before securing a limited release in the United States, and has since gained a cult following. Plot The operation of time travel in Primer. Two engineers, Aaron and Abe, supplement their day-jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects, working out of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect: objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A') in a continuously repeating sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point. Abe refines this proof-of-concept and builds a stable time-apparatus (\\"the box\\"), sized to accommodate a human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past‚Äîas part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, so as not to interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist. Abe and Aaron repeat Abe's six-hour experiment multiple times over multiple days, making profitable same-day stock trades armed with foreknowledge of the market's performance. The duo's divergent personalitiesAbe cautious and controlling, Aaron impulsive and meddlesomeput subtle strain on their collaboration and friendship. These tensions come to a head after a late-night encounter with Thomas Granger (father to Abe's girlfriend, Rachel), who appears inexplicably unshaven and exists in overlap with his original suburban self. Granger falls into a comatose state after being pursued by Aaron; Aaron theorizes that, at some unknown point in the future, Granger entered the \\"box\\", with timeline-altering consequences. Abe concludes that time travel is simply too dangerous, and enters a secret second box (the \\"failsafe box,\\" built before the experiment began and kept continuously running), traveling back four days to prevent the experiment's launch. Cumulative competing interference wreaks havoc upon the timeline. Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe (so he will never conduct the initial time travel experiment), and meets Original-Aaron at a park bench (so as to dissuade him), but finds that Future-Aaron has gotten there first (armed with pre-recordings of the past conversations, and an unobtrusive earpiece), having brought a disassembled \\"third failsafe box\\" four days back with his own body. Future-Abe faints at this revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue. The two men briefly and tentatively reconcile. They jointly travel back in time, experiencing and reshaping an event where Abe's girlfriend Rachel was nearly killed by a gun-wielding party crasher. After many repetitions, Aaron, forearmed with knowledge of the party's events, stops the gunman, becoming a local hero. Abe and Aaron ultimately part ways; Aaron considers a new life in foreign countries where he can tamper more broadly for personal gain, while Abe states his intent to remain in town and dissuade/sabotage the original \\"box\\" experiment. Abe warns Aaron to leave and never return. Multiple \\"box- aware\\" versions of Aaron circulateat least one Future-Aaron has shared his knowledge with Original-Aaron, via discussions, voice-recordings, and an unsuccessful physical altercation. Future-Abe watches over Original-Abe, going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware of the future. An Aaron directs French-speaking workers in the construction of a warehouse-sized box. Cast * Shane Carruth as Aaron * David Sullivan as Abe * Casey Gooden as Robert * Anand Upadhyaya as Phillip * Carrie Crawford as Kara * Samantha Thomson as Rachel Granger * Brandon Blagg as Will Carruth cast himself as Aaron after having trouble finding actors who could \\"break ... the habit of filling each line with so much drama\\". Most of the other actors are either friends or family members. Themes Although one of the more fantastic elements of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner. He notes that many of the greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident, in locations no more glamorous than Aaron's garage. > Whether it involved the history of the number zero or the invention of the > transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery that > turns out to be the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. > Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I > wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real > innovation takes place than I had seen on film before. Carruth has said he intended the central theme of the film to be the breakdown of Abe and Aaron's relationship, as a result of their inability to cope with the power afforded them by this technological advancement: > First thing, I saw these guys as scientifically accomplished but ethically, > morons. They never had any reasons before to have ethical questions. So when > they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they > do is make money with it. They're not talking about the ethics of altering > your former self. Physics and science In this Feynman diagram, an electron and positron annihilate producing a virtual photon that becomes a quark-antiquark pair. Then one radiates a gluon. * Aaron and Abe start the film by attempting to create a device to somehow counter the effects of gravity. They have plans for such a device from another development team, but wish to improve on the viability of the design. Their main approach to achieve this is to discard the coolant bath for the required superconductors. They instead increase the transition temperature of the superconductor to \\"something more usable\\", a room-temperature superconductor. The time machine makes use of the property of superconductors called the Meissner effect, which \\"knock[s] out the interior magnetic field\\". * Aaron and Abe require palladium to build their machine. This is the reason they take the catalytic converter containing a small amount of palladium from a car. * The principles of time travel in the film are inspired by Feynman diagrams. Carruth explained: \\"Richard Feynman has some interesting ideas about time. When you look at Feynman diagrams [which map the interaction of elementary particles], there's really no difference between watching an interaction happen forward and backward in time.\\" Production While writing the script, Carruth studied physics to help him make Abe and Aaron's technical dialogue sound authentic. He took the unusual step of eschewing contrived exposition, and tried instead to portray the shorthand phrases and jargon used by working scientists. This philosophy carried over into production design. The time machine itself is a plain gray box, with a distinctive electronic \\"hum\\" created by overlaying the sounds of a mechanical grinder and a car engine, rather than by using a processed digital effect. Carruth also set the story in unglamorous industrial parks and suburban tract homes. Carruth chose to deliberately obfuscate the film's plot to mirror the complexity and confusion created by time travel. As he said in a 2004 interview: \\"This machine and Abe and Aaron's experience are inherently complicated so it needed to be that way in order for the audience to be where Abe and Aaron are, which was always my hope.\\" =Filming= Principal photography took place over five weeks, on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas. The film was produced on a budget of only US$7,000, and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer. He also stars in the film as Aaron, and many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the Super 16mm filmstock: the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2:1. Every shot in the film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills. Carruth created a distinctive flat, overexposed look for the film by using fluorescent lighting, non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters. After shooting, Carruth took two years to fully post-produce Primer. He has since said that this experience was so arduous that he almost abandoned the film on several occasions. =Music= The entire film score was created by Carruth. On October 8, 2004, the Primer score was released on Amazon and iTunes. Release =Distribution= Carruth secured a North American distribution deal with THINKFilm after the company's head of theatrical distribution, Mark Urman, saw the film at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Although he and Carruth made a \\"handshake agreement\\" during the festival, Urman reported that the actual negotiation of the deal was the longest he had ever been involved with, in part due to Carruth's specific demands over how much control over the film he would retain. The film went on to take $545,436 at the box office.Box Office Mojo - Primer Domestic Total Gross Retrieved 2012-2-11 =Critical reception= Primer received positive reception from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 73% approval rating based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 6.61/10. The consensus reads, \\"Dense, obtuse, but stimulating, Primer is a film ready for viewers ready for a cerebral challenge.\\" The site also listed Primer as one of the best science fiction films \\"for the thinking man\\". On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Many reviewers were impressed by the film's originality. Dennis Lim of The Village Voice said that it was \\"the freshest thing the genre has seen since 2001, while in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that Carruth had \\"the skill, the guile and the seriousness to turn a creaky philosophical gimmick into a dense and troubling moral puzzle\\". Scott also enjoyed the film's realistic depiction of scientists at work, saying that Carruth had an \\"impressive feel for the odd, quiet rhythms of small-scale research and development\\". There was also praise for Carruth's ability to maintain high production values on a minuscule budget, with Roger Ebert declaring: \\"The movie never looks cheap, because every shot looks as it must look.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe commented that \\"aspects of Primer are so low-rent as to evoke guffaws\\", but added that \\"the homemade feel is part of the point\\". Similarly, Wired wrote, \\"Primer shuns big-budget special effects with director Shane Carruth opting for a low budget but high intensity film about two engineers, Aaron and Abe, who accidentally discover the secrets to time travel in their garage. When it was released Primer was noted for its originality ‚Äì the film takes on complex topics like quantum physics and doesn't dumb them down for the viewer, instead using real jargon and terms that real-life researchers would ‚Äì and for its commitment to a lo-fi aesthetic. Much of the film is set in garages and car parks, and then with the exception of the two lead roles, every other character is played by a friend or family member of the cast.\\" The film's experimental plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquire's Mike D'Angelo claimed that \\"anybody who claims he fully understands what's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar\\". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: \\"The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; were it not for the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible.\\" For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: \\"sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool\\". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer \\"nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture\\". \\"Primer is hopelessly confusing and grows more and more byzantine as it unravels,\\" Chuck Klosterman writes in an essay on time travel films five years later. \\"I've watched it seven or eight times and I still don't know what happened.\\" He nonetheless says it is \\"the finest movie about time travel I've ever seen\\" because of its realism: Ultimately, Klosterman says, the lesson of Primer regarding time travel is that \\"it's too important to use only for money, but too dangerous to use for anything else\\". The film has been selected to be part of The A.V. Club New Cult Canon. Donald Clarke, film critic with The Irish Times, included Primer at No. 20 on his list of the top twenty films of the decade (2000‚Äì2010). Science fiction author Greg Egan described it as \\"an ingenious, tautly constructed time-travel story\\". Awards * Grand Jury Prize, Sundance Film Festival in 2004. * Alfred P.

The Memorandum aimed to resume the implementation of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (Oslo II Accord). It was signed in the White House by Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, through negotiations led by U.S. President Bill Clinton, on 23 October 1998. On 17 November 1998 Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Memorandum by a vote of 75‚Äì19. The Memorandum determined that it would enter into force on 2 November 1998, ten days from the date of signature. On 18 December 1998, the Clinton administration and the EU declared their contentment about the implementation of the first phase of the Memorandum by both sides.US-EU Declaration on the Middle East Peace Process. US State Department, 18 December 1998 * We welcome implementation of the first phase of the Memorandum by both sides. We call on the parties to implement fully the remaining obligations ... Israel, however, had only implemented stage 1 of the further redeployment (F.R.D.), meaning that it had withdrawn from 2% of Area C instead of the required 13%.What Was the 1999 Sharm al-Sheikh Memorandum?. ProCon, 19 May 2008. Joel Beinin, MERIP, 26 March 1999. Both parties accused each other of not fulfilling its share of responsibilities under the Wye River Memorandum, and the further implementation of the agreement remained unfinished.  The summit  The summit was brokered by the United States at the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers near Wye Mills, Maryland, U.S. President Bill Clinton opened the summit at the secluded Wye River Conference Center on 15 October, and returned at least six times to the site to press Netanyahu and Arafat to finalize the deal. In the final push to get Netanyahu and Arafat to overcome remaining obstacles, Clinton invited King Hussein who had played a past role in easing tensions between the two men, to join the talks. On the final day of the negotiations, the agreement almost fell through. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked President Bill Clinton to release Jonathan Pollard, an American naval intelligence officer who has been serving a life sentence since 1985 for giving classified information to Israel. A bitter disagreement arose, with Netanyahu claiming that Clinton had promised to release Pollard, and Clinton saying he had only promised to \\"review\\" the case. It was reported that then-Director of the CIA George Tenet had threatened to resign should Pollard be released. The agreement was finally signed by Netanyahu and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat at the White House, with President Clinton playing a key role as the official witness. Background Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Davos in 1997. For the implementation of the Oslo II Accord and to facilitate the Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian Authorities signed a number of agreements and protocols. The documents contained the reciprocal responsibilities, including those relating to further redeployments and security. In 1994, the \\"Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO\\" was signed. In 1995, the \\"Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities\\" followed. The 1997 Hebron Protocol settled the withdrawal from 80% of Hebron and its division into two Areas. Redeployments The Further Redeployments (F.R.D.) in the Wye River Memorandum refer to the three phases in Appendix 1 of Annex I of the Oslo II Accord, which would follow the previous redeployment from populated areas in the West Bank. Only the phases 1 and 2 are specified. Phase 3 was delegated to a \\"Third further redeployment committee\\" which was to be started. =Phase one and two of the further redeployments= The Phases one and two, not specified in the Oslo II Accord, comprised the transfer to the Palestinians of 13% from Area C and shifts of parts of Area B to Area A.The Wye River Memorandum . Knesset website, 23 October 1998 The redeployment was divided into three stages, specified in the \\"Time line\\". *Stage 1 (November 1998): 2% from Area C to B; 7.1% from B to A *Stage 2 (December 1998): 5% from Area C to B *Stage 3 (January 1999): 5% from Area C to B; 1% from C to A; 7.1% from B to A In total, 13% would thus be transferred from Area C. Area B would increase with 13% and Area A with 14%. If the Memorandum had been implemented, Area C would theoretically have been reduced from circa 74% to 61%. Article I, however, determined that 3% of Area B would be designated as Nature Reserves with full Israeli control, meaning that the Palestinians would neither have free access to it, nor could build new constructions. This specification was a result of a misunderstanding regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's \\"bottom line\\" for Israeli territorial withdrawal. He told American negotiator Dennis Ross he could go as high as the \\"lowest teen\\" in percentage of territory, and Ross persuaded Chairman Arafat to accept the 13% figure. Later, Netanyahu insisted he had meant 11% withdrawal, so Ross surfaced the idea of using the nature reserves to bridge the 11% and 13% figures. Security In the provisions on security arrangements of the Interim Agreement, the Palestinian side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Israeli side, against individuals falling under the Israeli side's authority and against their property, just as the Israeli side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Palestinian side, against individuals falling under the Palestinian side's authority and against their property. The two sides also agreed to take legal measures against offenders within their jurisdiction and to prevent incitement against each other by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction. =A: Security actions= 1: Outlawing and combating terrorist organizations (a) The Palestinian side was to make known its policy of zero tolerance for terror and violence against both sides. (b) A work plan developed by the Palestinian side would be shared with the U.S. and thereafter implementation would begin immediately to ensure the systematic and effective combat of terrorist organizations and their infrastructure. (c) In addition to the bilateral Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian security cooperation, a U.S.‚ÄìPalestinian committee would meet biweekly to review the steps being taken to eliminate terrorists cells and the support structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets terror. (d) The Palestinian side would apprehend the specific individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and terror for the purpose of further investigation, and prosecution and punishment of all persons involved in acts of violence and terror. (e) A U.S.‚ÄìPalestinian committee would meet to review and evaluate information pertinent to the decisions on prosecution, punishment or other legal measures which affect the status of individuals suspected of abetting or perpetrating acts of violence and terror. 2: Prohibiting illegal weapons (a) The Palestinian side would ensure an effective legal framework is in place to criminalize, in conformity with the prior agreements, any importation, manufacturing or unlicensed sale, acquisition or possession of firearms, ammunition or weapons in areas under Palestinian jurisdiction. (b) In addition, the Palestinian side would establish and vigorously and continuously implement a systematic program for the collection and appropriate handling of all such illegal items it accordance with the prior agreements. The U.S. agreed to assist in carrying out the program. (c) A U.S.‚ÄìPalestinian‚ÄìIsraeli committee would be established to assist and enhance cooperation in preventing the smuggling or other unauthorized introduction of weapons or explosive materials into areas under Palestinian jurisdiction. 3: Prevention of incitement (a) The Palestinian side would issue a decree prohibiting all forms of incitement to violence or terror, and establishing mechanisms for acting systematically against all expressions or threats of violence or terror. This decree would be comparable to the existing Israeli legislation which deals with the same subject. (b) A U.S.‚ÄìPalestinian‚ÄìIsraeli committee would meet on a regular basis to monitor cases of possible incitement to violence or terror and to make recommendations and reports on how to prevent such incitement. The Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. sides would each appoint a media specialist, a law enforcement representative, an educational specialist and a current or former elected official to the committee. =B: Security cooperation= The two sides agreed that their security cooperation would be based on a spirit of partnership and would include, among other things, the following steps: 1: Bilateral cooperation There would be full bilateral security cooperation between the two sides which would be continuous, intensive and comprehensive. 2: Forensic cooperation There would be an exchange of forensic expertise, training, and other assistance. 3: Trilateral committee In addition to the bilateral Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian security cooperation, a high-ranking U.S.‚ÄìPalestinian‚ÄìIsraeli committee would meet as required and not less than biweekly to assess current threats to deal with any impediments to effective security cooperation and coordination and address the steps being taken to combat terror and terrorist organizations. =C: Other security issues= 1: Palestinian police force (a) The Palestinian side would provide a list of its policemen to the Israeli side in conformity with the prior agreements. (b) Should the Palestinian side request technical assistance, the U.S. indicated its willingness to help meet those needs in cooperation with other donors. (c) The Monitoring and Steering Committee would, as part of its functions, monitor the implementation of this provision and brief the U.S. 2: PLO charter The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Central Council should reaffirm the letter of 22 January 1998 from PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat to President Clinton concerning the nullification of the Palestinian National Charter provisions that were inconsistent with the letters exchanged between the PLO and the Government of Israel on 9‚Äì10 September 1993. 3: Legal assistance in criminal matters Among other forms of legal assistance in criminal matters, there were requests for the arrest and transfer of suspects and defendants. The United States had been requested by the sides to report on a regular basis on the steps being taken to respond to the above requests. 4: Human rights and the rule of law Accepted norms of human rights and the rule of law, and would be guided by the need to protect the public, respect human dignity, and avoid harassment. Economic issues #The Israeli and Palestinian sides reaffirmed their commitment to improve their relationship and agreed on the need to actively promote economic development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. #The Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed on arrangements which would permit the timely opening of the Gaza Industrial Estate. #Both sides should have renewed negotiations on Safe Passage immediately. Negotiations on the northern route would continue with the goal of reaching agreement as soon as possible. #The Israeli and Palestinian sides acknowledged the great importance of the Port of Gaza for the development of the Palestinian economy, and the expansion of Palestinian trade. #The two sides recognized that unresolved legal issues hurt the relationship between the two peoples. #The Israeli and Palestinian sides also should launch a strategic economic dialogue to enhance their economic relationship. #The two sides agreed on the importance of continued international donor assistance in helping both sides to implement agreements. Permanent status negotiations The two sides would immediately resume permanent status negotiations on an accelerated basis and will make a determined effort to achieve the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by 4 May 1999. Unilateral actions Recognizing the necessity to create a positive environment for the negotiations, neither side should initiate or take any step that would change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the Interim Agreement. Political impact in Israel The Wye agreement was broadly popular in Israel, with 74% of Israelis supporting the agreement according to early-November polling. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu sensed opposition within his Likud party and delayed a vote of cabinet approval while he sought public assurances from the Clinton administration about the implementation of Wye. Rather than join a national unity government with opposition leader Ehud Barak, Netanyahu tried to assuage Likud hardliners by stopping implementation of Wye in early December over confrontations between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers.Ross, The Missing Peace, pp. 461‚Äì479. Disapproval of Netanyahu's policies from Barak's Labor Party and the Likud right resulted in a vote of no confidence against his government that prompted general elections in May 1999; Barak was victorious and pledged to continue the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process.

The Northland Peninsula, called the North Auckland Peninsula in earlier times, is in the far north of the North Island of New Zealand. It is joined to the rest of the island by the Auckland isthmus, a narrow piece of land between the WaitematƒÅ Harbour and the Manukau Harbour in the middle of the Auckland metropolitan area. The peninsula is not conterminous with the local government area of Northland Region, which occupies the northern 80% of the peninsula. The southern section of the peninsula is administratively part of the Auckland Region. The peninsula stretches northwest for about 330 kilometres from the Auckland isthmus (or Tamaki isthmus), reaching a maximum width of 85 kilometres. It has a convoluted coastline, with many smaller peninsulas branching off it. The last 100 kilometres of its length is the Aupouri Peninsula ‚Äì a peninsula on a peninsula ‚Äì narrowing to only some 10 kilometres in width. At its northern end, the Aupouri Peninsula includes a number of capes: Cape Maria van Diemen, Cape Reinga, North Cape, and the Surville Cliffs, the northernmost point, at latitude 34¬∞ 23' 47\\" South. The Kaipara Harbour part way up the peninsula's western (Tasman Sea) shore is one of the largest harbours in the world, stretching some 65 kilometres from north to south. Further north is the smaller Hokianga harbour, which is of historic and cultural significance, especially to the MƒÅori people. Another historically significant site is Waitangi and the surrounding Bay of Islands. This was a major settlement in early colonial New Zealand, and was the site of the first signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, which is seen as the founding document of New Zealand's nationhood.

(Traditional Chinese: È¢®ËèØÂ∑¥Â£´ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) was one of the first Chinatown bus lines in the U.S., running bus service between Boston and New York City. It operated from 1996 to 2015, except for a brief period in 2014 when it was shut down for safety violations. Etymology The name Fung Wah came from the Cantonese pronunciation of the Chinese name È¢®ËèØ, which means \\"magnificent wind.\\" Route Fung Wah used a fleet of over two dozen buses to operate hourly scheduled service between South Station in Boston and Chinatown in Manhattan. It usually traveled over Interstate 95 on its route.Carrier Overview: Fung Wah\\", US Department of Transportation History Bus boarding in Boston Fung Wah was founded in New York City in 1996, as Fung Wah Transport Vans, Inc., by Pei Lin Liang, who had immigrated from Zhuhai, China in 1988. Before founding the company, Liang had worked as a driver for Four Seas, a local dollar van service that shuttled Chinese garment and restaurant workers from Sunset Park in Brooklyn to Chinatown in Manhattan.Farivar, Cyrus, \\"Murder and Vice on the Lower East Side: The Past, Present and Future of the 'Chinatown Buses'\\", Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, March 21, 2005 Fung Wah began as a direct competitor with Liang's former employer. The Chinese characters of the company's name were written in English as Fenghua Jieyun Gongsi and translated as Elegant Rapid Transit Company. Translations of \\"Fung Wah\\" from Cantonese included Chinese Wind. In 1997, Liang borrowed $60,000 and bought four vans at the request of customers who wanted to visit their children in college in Boston, and gradually grew to being a low cost intercity transit provider. As one of the first of the Chinatown bus lines, Fung Wah operated between designated curbside locations only., Aug. 16, 2006 By 2003, Fung Wah and competitors like Lucky Star Bus were competing fiercely, with low prices and allegations of crime connections at other competitors. While it originally operated curbside out of Boston's Chinatown, Fung Wah moved to the nearby Boston South Station bus terminal in 2004 due to traffic concerns from Boston city government. Between 1997 and 2007, Chinatown buses like Fung Wah took 60% of Greyhound Lines' market share in the northeast United States. On June 15, 2009, Fung Wah expanded service to Rhode Island at the Kennedy Plaza bus terminal in downtown Providence, but discontinued this route in 2010. In February 2013, an investigative report broadcast on WBZ-TV Boston found cracked frames on Fung Wah buses. Massachusetts authorities then ordered most of the Fung Wah fleet off the road. In March 2013, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration declared Fung Wah an \\"imminent hazard to public safety\\" and ordered it to cease all operations with its then-current fleet. On March 28, 2013, the US Department of Transportation ordered the company to immediately suspend all service. In September 2013, it was reported that both Fung Wah and Lucky Star lines (another \\"Chinatown bus\\" line) had done extensive work, training, and purchases hoping to get their bus lines operating again. There was to be a re- filing for their operating licenses and possible limited resumption of service in Fall 2013.Johnston, Katie, \\"Fung Wah, Lucky Star may be on the road again soon\\", The Boston Globe, September 27, 2013. On February 7, 2014, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration denied Fung Wah's request to resume operations, claiming the company \\"was not willing nor able to comply\\" with federal intercity bus safety standards. Fung Wah's law firm, the New York firm Freeman Lewis LLC, appealed the decision. On December 18, 2014, it was announced that the bus line would resume service in early 2015. Fung Wah spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to improve the safety of its buses between February 2013 and December 2014; in addition, it was revealed that inspections of the buses were flawed. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will monitor Fung Wah closely after operations resume.Newsham, Jack, \\"Fung Wah gets federal approval to return to the road\\", The Boston Globe, December 18, 2014 However, in July 2015, before resumption of service was slated to start, owner Peter Liang announced that the service would end permanently. The line reportedly shut down because it could not find a bus stop in Boston's South Station. Alternatives, such as Alewife station at the northern terminus of the Red Line subway in Cambridge, were reportedly given as an option but deemed too far away from its traditional operating locus near Chinatown in Boston. Controversy =\\"Fare wars\\"= With fares lower than other bus and rail carriers between New York City and Boston (as low as $10 during a fare war) Fung Wah had become popular with young people and other travelers on a budget. In early 2013, Massachusetts and federal authorities issued a series of safety citations, declared it to be an \\"imminent hazard to public safety\\", imposed operating restrictions, and ultimately ordered Fung Wah to cease all operations. =Safety-related incidents= The Fung Wah Bus crash of June 23, 2008 Fung Wah buses have been involved in several safety-related incidents. In 2005, the company was given a federal driver risk rating of 73 out of 100, 100 being the worst, with 75 considered at risk of being unsafe and subject to crashes. Ian Grossman of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (United States Department of Transportation) reported that Fung Wah drivers rated in the worst 2 percent of drivers nationwide based on regulatory violations, and nine out of 71 Fung Wah drivers were suspended after inspection between 2004 and 2006. Still, many travelers were not discouraged.Lewis, Sam, \\"Many Travelers Not Deterred by Deadly Bus Crashes\\" , WNYC news, New York City, Tuesday, March 15, 2011 *August 16, 2005: A New York-bound bus caught fire on Interstate 91 near Meriden, Connecticut. Though the passengers later criticized the driver for being unhelpful and untrained in evacuating the bus, all passengers were eventually evacuated and no injuries were reported. *September 6, 2006: A bus rolled over in Auburn, Massachusetts and caused minor injuries to 34 passengers. Excessive speed was cited as a factor and the bus company was fined. *January 3, 2007: In Framingham, Massachusetts, a New York-bound bus lost two of its rear wheels. No injuries were reported. *February 14, 2007: The driver of a New York-bound bus lost control in a winter storm and hit a guardrail on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) in Allston, Massachusetts. No injuries were reported. *March 23, 2007: A New York-bound bus got stuck on a concrete barrier in front of a tollbooth on the Massachusetts Turnpike at Route 128 in Weston, Massachusetts, when the bus drove up on a cement lane divider. The driver had entered an automobile-only lane and tried to change lanes. No one was injured in the incident, but the bus was taken out of service and passengers boarded another Fung Wah bus that arrived later. *June 23, 2008: A bus loading passengers was struck by an out of control dump truck at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street in New York‚Äôs Chinatown. The force of the impact pushed the bus onto the sidewalk and into a bank. As the result of the accident, a sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman; the woman later died as the result of a heart attack. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries.\\"One Dead, Four Injured When Bus Jumps Curb In Chinatown\\" , NY1 News, June 23, 2008 State Department of Transportation inspectors found the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues, including faulty brakes, which led to the accident. *There were no crash incidents involving Fung Wah reported to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (United States Department of Transportation) by states for 24 months prior to December 26, 2011.\\"Company Snapshot: FUNG WAH BUS TRANSPORTATION INC: USDOT Number: 954187\\", United States Department of Transportation. *February 25, 2013: The company pulled nearly its entire fleet off the road with 21 of 28 buses after inspectors from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities found multiple structural cracks in several buses. The company reduced their service from every half-hour to hourly, and used rental buses in place of the fleet. *February 26, 2013: As a result of the structural damage discovered the day before, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) ordered Fung Wah to \\"immediately cease passenger service\\" indefinitely and to park its remaining seven buses. *March 1, 2013: The FMCSA formally cancels the motor carrier docket (MC 405969, USDOT 954187) and operating authority of Fung Wah after Fung Wah blocked access to safety records. As such, Fung Wah cannot charter buses to meet service. =Discrimination lawsuit= In January 2004, due to the company's policy barring pets from buses, the Fung Wah Bus Company refused to sell tickets to a blind couple traveling with a guide dog, even when informed by the couple‚Äîand later by police responding to a disturbance call‚Äîthat the couple had the right to board the bus with a service animal. In conjunction with the Massachusetts Attorney General, the couple later filed a discrimination lawsuit against the company, which was allowable per the Attorney General's office: \\"Massachusetts law prohibits discrimination against blind persons and requires businesses to allow service animals in their establishments even when there is an existing ‚Äúno pet‚Äù policy, as long as the animal is controlled and does not otherwise pose an undue burden.\\" In July 2007, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination awarded the couple $60,000 in damages, assessed a $10,000 civil penalty payable to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and ordered the company to take several steps to prevent discrimination in the future.

Court ruling On November 4, 2004, two lesbian couples who had been denied marriage licences (Jacqueline Pottle and Noelle French, and Lisa Zigler and Theresa Walsh) filed a lawsuit against the federal and provincial governments, requesting that the Provincial Government be ordered to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. Newfoundland and Labrador thus became the eighth of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories to have such a lawsuit filed. The Federal Government had recently ceased to oppose such lawsuits. The Provincial Government also did not oppose the lawsuit;Same-sex marriage in Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador the provincial Attorney-General announced that his office will not oppose the suit. The case began on December 13, 2004, and was heard starting on December 20, 2004. Justice Derek Green took only one day to decide to follow the precedents from the other provinces and Yukon and ordered that same-sex couples in Newfoundland and Labrador be issued marriage licences, thus making same-sex marriage legal in Newfoundland and Labrador. Justice Minister Tom Marshall indicated that the Government would comply immediately. Ms. Pottle and Ms. French were married on December 23 by Andy Wells, Mayor of St. John's. However, some officiants, including Gander Mayor Claude Elliott, and Botwood Mayor Jerry Dean said that they would refuse to officiate at such ceremonies.Same-sex ultimatum given to commissioners The Provincial Government warned its civil marriage commissioners, such as mayors or justices of the peace, that they must perform these marriages or resign, as the marriages are now legal. This mirrored an earlier move by the Manitoba Provincial Government. Gordon Young, an evangelical pastor of the First Assembly Church of St. John's, asked the Newfoundland Supreme Court of Appeals to allow him to appeal the ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. His case did not proceed. Provincial legislation In April 2002, the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly approved amendments to the Adoption Act allowing same-sex couples to adopt children jointly.NEWFOUNDLAND OKS GAY ADOPTION In May 2009, the House of Assembly amended the Marriage Act by replacing the words \\"husband and wife\\" with \\"spouses\\".

In the early summer it produces small white flowers 6‚Äì10 mm diameter in dense terminal corymbs. Flowering peaks in June Heteromeles arbutifolia at iNaturalist The five petals are rounded. The fruit is a small pome, 5‚Äì10 mm across, bright red and berry-like, produced in large quantities, maturing in the fall and persisting well into the winter. Cultivation Toyon can be grown in domestic gardens in well-drained soil, and is cultivated as an ornamental plant as far north as Southern England. It can survive temperatures as low as -12 ¬∞C. In winter, the bright red pomes (which birds often eat voraciously) are showy. Like many other genera in the Rosaceae tribe Maleae, toyon includes some cultivars that are susceptible to fireblight.Austin Hagan, Edward Sikora, William Gazaway, Nancy Kokalis- Burelle, 2004. Fire Blight on Fruit Trees and Woody Ornamentals, Alabama A&M; and Auburn Universities It survives on little water, making it suitable for xeriscape gardening, and is less of a fire hazard than some chaparral plants.Dave's Garden They are visited by butterflies, and have a mild, hawthorn-like scent. The fruit are consumed by birds, including mockingbirds, American robins, cedar waxwings and hermit thrushes. Mammals including coyotes and bears also eat and disperse the pomes. Traditional use The pomes provided food for local Native American tribes, such as the Chumash, Tongva, and Tataviam. The pomes also can be made into a jelly. Native Americans also made a tea from the leaves as a stomach remedy. Most were dried and stored, then later cooked into porridge or pancakes. Later settlers added sugar to make custard and wine. The Tongva (who called the plant ashuwet) ate the berries fresh, boiled and left them in an earthen oven for 2 to 3 days, roasted them, or made them into a cider. Pulveurized flowers were steeped into hot water to make tea which could be used to ease gynecological ailments. For stomach pains, bark and leaves are steeped in hot water to make tea. The same tea can serve as a seasonal tonic and ease other body pains. Also, applying mashed ashuwet to sores eases pain. Infected wounds are washed using an infusion of bark and leaves.http://www.runajambi.net/tongva/californiaholly.htm Toxicity Toyon pomes are acidic and astringent, and contain a small amount of cyanogenic glycosides, which break down into hydrocyanic acid on digestion. This is removed by mild cooking. Most fruits from plants in the family Rosaceae, including apples, apricots, peaches, cherries, and plums, contain cyanide. Some pomes, though mealy, astringent and acid when raw, were eaten fresh, or mashed into water to make a beverage. A 2016 study found 5g of the dried berries (used as a treatment for Alzheimer's) to be safe. The study also found no cyanogenic compounds in the plant. Legislation In the 1920s, collecting toyon branches for Christmas became so popular in Los Angeles that the State of California passed a law forbidding collecting on public land or on any land not owned by the person picking any plant without the landowner's written permission (CA Penal Code ¬ß 384a).California Penal Code Section 384a Toyon was adopted as the official native plant of the city of Los Angeles by the LA City Council on April 17, 2012. Taxonomy The genera Photinia, Aronia, Pourthiaea, and Stranvaesia have historically been variously combined by different taxonomists. The genus Heteromeles as originally published by Max Joseph Roemer was monospecific, including Photinia arbutifolia Lindl. (1820), as H. arbutifolia (Lindl.) M. Roem, but the name was illegitimate (superfluous) because it included the type of the genus Photinia. This has since been corrected by conservation, and the name is therefore often written as Heteromeles M. Roem. nom. cons. (1847). Phytochemistry The plant has been used as a treatment for Alzheimer's by indigenous people of California and recent research has found a number of active compounds that are potentially beneficial to Alzheimer's treatment. These include icaricide compounds, which protect the blood-brain barrier and prevent infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain.

It was recorded in March‚ÄìApril 1985 and released later that year by Beggars Banquet Records. It was produced by John Cale, marking their first studio collaboration since The End... in 1974. It was Nico's final studio album before her death three years later.  Recording  Nico's vocal style on Camera Obscura is somewhat different from her prior records, with some songs bearing similarities to Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard. The jazz standard \\"My Funny Valentine\\", by contrast, has a more standard legato vocal style, despite her very deep contralto. Many of the tracks offer a refined version of the new wave gothic rock of her previous album Drama of Exile. The album is dedicated to her then-manager, Alan Wise. Sonically, the album follows on from Drama of Exile in that Nico's core songs are given full band arrangements. Whereas Drama of Exile carried a strong North African influence and exotic, new wave-inspired instrumentation, Camera Obscura makes use of synthesizers. = Composition = The album's oldest composition, \\"K√∂nig\\", was originally recorded for Desertshore and re-recorded some fifteen years later for Camera Obscura. A version was included in the Philippe Garrel film La Cicatrice Int√©rieure (1972). John Cale reportedly wanted to produce the song with a more percussive, synth-based arrangement in keeping with the rest of the material, but Nico insisted it should be kept as a solo harmonium piece. Another early song re-imagined for the recording sessions was \\"Tananore\\", which Nico had performed at a Cale concert in Marseille on April 12, 1975, and kept in her set ever since. Nico had incorporated \\"My Funny Valentine\\" into her set since February 1982, and previously at her earliest live performances (at the Blue Angel nightclub in New York City). \\"My Heart Is Empty\\" and \\"Fearfully in Danger\\", meanwhile, had been set mainstays since her Library Theatre appearance in Manchester on June 16, 1983. \\"Das Lied vom einsamen M√§dchen\\" (\\"The song about the lonely girl\\") originally derives from the 1952 film Alraune.  Release  Camera Obsura was released in 1985 by Beggars Banquet Records. The album received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic gave the album two-and-a-half out of five, whereas Trouser Press received the album in a favorable light. A music video was filmed for \\"My Heart Is Empty\\" at the Fridge in Brixton. Nico performed songs from Camera Obscura up until her death, although there are no known performances of the opening instrumental \\"Camera Obscura\\" or the song \\"Into the Arena\\".

He is best known in the United States for his million-selling remake of Andr√© Popp's \\"Love is Blue\\", which was #1 for 5 weeks in 1968. Other recordings for which he is known include \\"El Bimbo\\", \\"Toccata\\", \\"Love in Every Room/M√™me si tu revenais\\", and \\"Penelope\\". Biography = 1925‚Äì1956: Early life and career = In 1925, Mauriat was born and raised in Marseille, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, France His father was a postal inspector who loved to play classical piano and violin. Mauriat began playing music at age four. In 1935, at the age of 10, he enrolled in the Conservatoire in Marseille to study classical music, but by the time he was 17, he had fallen in love with jazz and popular music. As a young adult Mauriat started his own dance band and toured concert halls throughout Europe throughout the 1940s. In the 1950s, Mauriat became the musical director for at least two well-known French singers, Charles Aznavour and Maurice Chevalier, touring with both of them. = 1957‚Äì1962: First studio recordings = In 1957, Mauriat released his first EP, Paul Mauriat, a four track RGM release. One of his first songs, Rendez-vous au Lavandou, co-written with Andr√© Pascal, was awarded the 1958 le Coq d'or de la Chanson Fran√ßaise. Between 1959‚Äì1964, Mauriat recorded several albums on the Bel-Air record label under the name Paul Mauriat et Son Orchestre, as well as using the various pseudonyms of Richard Audrey, Nico Papadopoulos, Eduardo Ruo, and Willy Twist, to better reflect the international flavor of his recordings. During this period, Mauriat also released several recordings with Les Satellites, where he creatively arranged vocal backing harmony for such albums as Slow Rock and Twist (1961), A Malypense (1962), and Les Satellites Chantent Noel (1964). Mauriat composed the music for several French movie soundtracks (also released on Bel-Air), including Un Taxi Pour Tobrouk (1961), Horace 62 (1962), and Faites Sauter La Banque (1964). = 1963‚Äì1997: International acclaim and later career = Using the pseudonym of Del Roma, Mauriat was to have his first international hit with Chariot, which he wrote in collaboration with friends Franck Pourcel (co-composer), Jacques Plante (French lyrics) and Raymond Lef√®vre (orchestrator). In the United States, the song was recorded as \\"I Will Follow Him\\" by Little Peggy March and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963. In 1992, the song was featured prominently in the film Sister Act starring Whoopi Goldberg. More recently, Eminem sampled it in his song \\"Guilty Conscience\\". Between 1967 and 1972, he wrote numerous songs with Andr√© Pascal for Mireille Mathieu; Mon Cr√©do (1,335,000 copies sold), Viens dans ma rue, La premi√®re √©toile, G√©ant, etc.‚Äîto name but a few‚Äîand contributed 130 song arrangements for Charles Aznavour. In 1968, his late 1967 cover of the Andr√© Popp/Pierre Cour tune \\"L'amour est bleu\\" (\\"Love Is Blue\\") became a number 1 hit in the US. The song spent five weeks at the top of the charts. Two other Mauriat singles also made the charts in the US ‚Äî \\"Love in Every Room\\"/\\"M√™me si tu revenais\\" (recorded in 1965; charted in 1968) and the title theme from the movie \\"Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang\\". \\"Love Is Blue\\" was the first instrumental to hit number 1 on the Billboard charts since the Tornados hit with \\"Telstar\\" in 1962 and the only American number-one single to be recorded in France. The success of the song and the album on which it appeared, Blooming Hits, established Mauriat as an international recording star. In 1969, Mauriat started his first world tour with his Grand Orchestra, visiting countries like the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and other Latin American countries. In 1970s and 1980s, Mauriat released the entire albums that paid homage to his musical roots. \\"Paul Mauriat joue Chopin\\", \\"Classics in the Air\\" (volumes 1,2,3) features classical music, like Chopin's \\"Grande valse brillante\\", Bach's ‚ÄúToccata and Fugue in D Minor‚Äù, and Pachelbel's ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù, given the ‚ÄúMauriat‚Äù spin. El Condor Pasa peaked at number 34 in Australia in 1971 Paul Mauriat's phenomenon in Japan started in the early 1970s. He is the only international artist who played two sold-out shows in one day at the famous arena Nippon Budokan in Tokyo. In the early to mid-1980s, Paul Mauriat appeared in several Japanese coffee and wine television commercials, which featured music from his orchestra. For several decades, some of Mauriat's compositions served as musical tracks for Soviet television programmes and short movies, such as the 1977 animated Polygon (film), \\"In the world of animals\\" (V mire zhivotnykh) and \\"Kinopanorama\\", among others. = 1998‚Äì2006: Retirement and death = Mauriat retired from performing in 1998. He gave his final performance in the Sayonara Concert, recorded live in Osaka, Japan, but his orchestra continued to tour around the world before his death in 2006. Mauriat's former lead pianist, Gilles Gambus, became the orchestra's conductor in 2000 and led successful tours of Japan, China, and Russia. Gambus had worked with Mauriat for more than 25 years. In 2005, classical French Horn instrumentalist, Jean-Jacques Justafr√© conducted the orchestra during a tour of Japan and Korea. On 3 November 2006, Paul Mauriat died in Perpignan, Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, France, at the age of 81. After his death, The Paul Mauriat Grand Orchestra also ceased to exist. Mauriat is buried at the Perpignan South Cemetery in Columbarium.  Recordings  Relative to his peers, Paul Mauriat has one of the largest recording catalogs, featuring more than 1,000 titles just from his Polygram era (1965‚Äì1993). Both Mauriat's single recording \\"Love is Blue\\" (1967) and the album Blooming Hits each sold over one million copies. The single was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America in March 1968. In 1965, Mauriat established Le Grand Orchestre de Paul Mauriat, and released hundreds of recordings and compilations through the Philips label for the next 28 years. In 1994, he signed with Japanese record company Pony Canyon, where he re-recorded some of his greatest hits and wrote new compositions. Mauriat recorded many of these albums in both Paris and London, utilising several English classical musicians in these recordings.  Recognition  He was awarded the Grand Prix (Grand Prize) from the French recording industry, a MIDEM trophy, and in 1997 won the prestigious distinction of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. He sold over 40 million albums worldwide and held 28 tours in Japan from 1969 to 1998. In 2002, Serge Elhaik published an authorised biography, Paul Mauriat: une vie en bleu. A line of saxophones and trumpets are named for Paul Mauriat, under the brand P. Mauriat, reflecting his popularity in their country of origin, Taiwan.

Maurice Godelier (born February 28, 1934) is a French anthropologist who works as the Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. He is one of the most influential French anthropologists and is best known as one of the earliest advocates of Marxism's incorporation into anthropology. He is also known for his field work among the Baruya in Papua New Guinea from the 1960s to the 1980s.Niko Besnier and Alan Howard. (April 1997) . Newsletter of the Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania.  Early life and education  Godelier was born to a poor family in provincial France in the commune Cambrai. In 1955, Godelier received an associate degree in philosophy, a degree in psychology, and a degree in modern literature. During his early education, he was especially interested in the works of Husserl. He attended the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint-Cloud from 1955 to 1959 and received an agr√©gation in philosophy. Godelier developed a specific interest in Marxist theory and politics; influenced by Claude L√©vi-Strauss, he chose to pursue the field of anthropology. In 1981, he received an honorary degree from the Universit√© catholique de Louvain.  Career  In 1963, Godelier initiated the first program on economic anthropology in France at College de France. In this program he focused on refining the Marxist ideas of base and superstructure and modes of production. From 1966 to 1969, Godelier conducted his first major anthropological field study on the Baruya in Papua New Guinea. His research provided significant contributions to the limited understanding of New Guinea cultures. In 1982, he used his research to write an ethnography on the Baruya. The book, entitled The Making of Great Men, discusses sex- and gender-based inequality and provided insight into the systems of power in Melanesia. His analysis of the systems of power was further developed in Big Men and Great Men, published in 1991, which he co-edited with Marilyn Strathern. In the late 1990s, Godelier addressed the future of peripheral societies under the effects of world capitalism and a new analysis of kinship theory focusing on gender inequality and sexuality. In 1995, he founded the Center for Research and Documentation on Oceania, which he directed until 1999.https://web.archive.org/web/20130508175836/http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/fr/pres/compress/GodelierMedailleOr2001.htm From 2000 to 2003, Godelier served on various organizations related to research in social sciences in Europe and his anthropological work in Oceania. He is currently (2013‚Äì2015) president of the Soci√©t√© des oc√©anistes.

It is a symptom of several eye diseases. Night blindness may exist from birth, or be caused by injury or malnutrition (for example, vitamin A deficiency). It can be described as insufficient adaptation to darkness. The most common cause of nyctalopia is retinitis pigmentosa, a disorder in which the rod cells in the retina gradually lose their ability to respond to the light. Patients suffering from this genetic condition have progressive nyctalopia and eventually, their daytime vision may also be affected. In X-linked congenital stationary night blindness, from birth the rods either do not work at all, or work very little, but the condition doesn't get worse. Another cause of night blindness is a deficiency of retinol, or vitamin A, found in fish oils, liver and dairy products. The opposite problem, the inability to see in bright light, is known as hemeralopia and is much rarer. Since the outer area of the retina is made up of more rods than cones, loss of peripheral vision often results in night blindness. Individuals suffering from night blindness not only see poorly at night but also require extra time for their eyes to adjust from brightly lit areas to dim ones. Contrast vision may also be greatly reduced. Rods contain a receptor-protein called rhodopsin. When light falls on rhodopsin, it undergoes a series of conformational changes ultimately generating electrical signals which are carried to the brain via the optic nerve. In the absence of light, rhodopsin is regenerated. The body synthesizes rhodopsin from vitamin A, which is why a deficiency in vitamin A causes poor night vision. Refractive \\"vision correction\\" surgery (especially PRK with the complication of \\"haze\\") may rarely cause a reduction in best night-time acuity due to the impairment of contrast sensitivity function (CSF) which is induced by intraocular light-scatter resulting from surgical intervention in the natural structural integrity of the cornea.  Causes  *Retinitis pigmentosa *Retinal detachment *Certain medications, such as phenothiazines *Oguchi disease *Pathological myopia *Cataract (peripheral cortical) *Refractive surgery (LASIK, photorefractive keratectomy, radial keratotomy) *Sorsby's Fundus Dystrophy (Macular degeneration) *Vitamin A deficiency *Choroideremia *Glaucoma  Historical usage  Aulus Cornelius Celsus, writing ca. 30 AD, described night blindness and recommended an effective dietary supplement, liver being a good source of vitamin A: \\"There is besides a weakness of the eyes, owing to which people see well enough indeed in the daytime but not at all at night; in women whose menstruation is regular this does not happen. But success sufferers should anoint their eyeballs with the stuff dripping from a liver whilst roasting, preferably of a he-goat, or failing that of a she-goat; and as well they should eat some of the liver itself.\\" Historically, nyctalopia, also known as moonblink, was a temporary night blindness believed to be caused by sleeping in moonlight in the tropics.The Sailor's Word-Book, Admiral W.H. Smyth, p. 483; Conway Maritime Press, UK, 1991. In the French language, and have inverse meanings, the first naming the ability to see in the dark as well as in plain light, and the second the inability to do so. It is thought that this inversion from Latin happened during the 2nd century AD,Dimitrios Brouzas et al., Nyctalopia in antiquity: a review of the ancient Greek, Latin, and Byzantine literature., Ophthalmology, 108(10):1917-21, 2001. even though the ancient greek ŒΩœÖŒ∫œÑŒ¨Œªœâœà (nukt√°l≈çps) has been used in both senses. Night blindness, sometimes referred to as gravel, was occasionally documented during the American Civil War, particularly within the Confederate States of America. Like rheumatism, night blindness was viewed as a condition that could be easily faked or exaggerated, and initially, sufferers were regarded with some suspicion. Some soldiers who reported symptoms of nyctalopia also presented with symptoms of scurvy, suggesting a fundamental cause of poor nutrition.  Nyctalopia with animals  Congenital stationary night blindness is also an ophthalmologic disorder in horses with leopard spotting patterns, such as the Appaloosa. It is present at birth (congenital), not sex-linked, non-progressive and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). In horses, CSNB has been linked with the leopard complex color pattern since the 1970s.Witzel CA, Joyce JR, Smith EL. Electroretinography of congenital night blindness in an Appaloosa filly. Journal of Equine Medicine and Surgery 1977; 1: 226‚Äì229. A 2008 study theorizes that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to the TRPM1 gene. The region on horse chromosome 1 to which the Lp gene has now been localized also encodes a protein that channels calcium ions, a key factor in the transmission of nerve impulses. This protein, found in the retina and the skin, exists in fractional percentages of the normal levels found in homozygous Lp/Lp horses and so compromises the basic chemical reaction for nerve impulse transmission.

A. Cuddon, The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms(London: Penguin Books, 1999), p.515. The critic/poet C. H. Sisson observed in his essay Poetry and Sincerity that \\"Modernity has been going on for a long time. Not within living memory has there ever been a day when young writers were not coming up, in a threat of iconoclasm.\\"Press Ltd, Manchester, 1990 Background It is usually said to have begun with the French Symbolist movement and it artificially ends with the Second World War, the beginning and ending of the modernist period are of course arbitrary. Poets like W. B. Yeats (1865‚Äì1939) and Rainer Maria Rilke (1875‚Äì1926) started in a post-Romantic, Symbolist vein and modernised their poetic idiom after being affected by political and literary developments. Imagism proved radical and important, marking a new point of departure for poetry.Schmidt, Michael, (ed) The Great Modern Poets, Quercus Poetry 2012 Some consider that it began in the works of Hardy and Pound, Eliot and Yeats, Williams and Stevens.Schmidt, Michael, Lives of the Poets Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1998 English-language poets, like T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, Basil Bunting ('a born modernist'), Wallace Stevens, and E. E. Cummings also went on to produce work after World War II. Nature of modernism Modernism emerged with its insistent breaks with the immediate past, its different inventions, 'making it new' with elements from cultures remote in time and space. The questions of impersonality and objectivity seem to be crucial to Modernist poetry. Modernism developed out of a tradition of lyrical expression, emphasising the personal imagination, culture, emotions, and memories of the poet. For the modernists, it was essential to move away from the merely personal towards an intellectual statement that poetry could make about the world. Even when they reverted to the personal, like T. S. Eliot in the Four Quartets and Ezra Pound in The Cantos, they distilled the personal into a poetic texture that claimed universal human significance. Herbert Read said of it, \\"The modern poet has no essential alliance with regular schemes of any sorts. He/She reserves the right to adapt his/her rhythm to his/her mood, to modulate his/her metre as he progresses. Far from seeking freedom and irresponsibility (implied by the unfortunate term free verse) he/she seeks a stricter discipline of exact concord of thought and feeling.\\"Read, Herbert, Collected Essays in Literary Criticism (1938) After World War II, a new generation of poets sought to revoke the effort of their predecessors towards impersonality and objectivity. In the English language modernism ends with the turn towards confessional poetry in the work of Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath, among others.

It is part of the Capricorn Coast of Central Queensland. The island is the largest of the eighteen islands in the Keppel Group, and covers an area of 1308 hectares . It is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region). The tropical climate and numerous beaches attract tourists from all points, and a number of accommodation villages and houses cater for tourists including Air BnB Houses. There are 17 white sandy beaches with some of the highest cover of hard coral reefs on the Great Barrier Reef. The coral diversity of these reefs matches that of the Whitsundays with clear waters most of the year around.Alison M. Jones, Ray Berkelmans & Wayne Houston (19 July 2011). Species Richness and Community Structure on a High Latitude Reef: Implications for Conservation and Management . Retrieved on 28 February 2012. The island is served by ferries and aircraft. History The islands were named by Captain James Cook in April 1770 after the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Admiral Augustus Keppel. Prior to European settlement, the island was home to an estimated 60-80 Woppaburra and Ganumi people of the Darumbal nation, with centuries old middens testifying to the quantity of seafood found in the surrounding waters. It is believed that they occupied Wop-pa for around 5,000 years. European settlers killed or removed most of the indigenous population by the end of the 19th century. The first recorded visit to the island was conducted by naturalist John MacGillivray aboard HMS Rattlesnake in 1847. In 1866, Robert Ross obtained a lease over Great Keppel \\"from year to year and not exceeding five years\\" in partnership with C.E Beddome and Sir Arthur Palmer (Rowland, 2007) and so began the pastoral era on the islands. In 1882 the lease on Great Keppel Island drew interest and competition. Shaddock (1981) describes how the Lands Department held a public auction for six square miles with the successful applicant being Robert Lyons of Rockhampton. In its early European history, the island was used to raise sheep. William T Wyndham, became the first permanent European inhabitant on Great Keppel, having been appointed by Lyons as stock-keeper. Wyndham developed good relationships with the Woppaburra and was just in his treatment of them. Wyndham has both the highest peak on the island and a cove on the east coast named in his honour. Wyndham left the island after witnessing the mistreatment of the Woppaburra people by the lessee who forcibly removed 30 people following the killing of some sheep. The remaining people were forced to work for the lessee in squalid conditions and over the next 20 years their numbers dwindled until the final forced removed of the last 18 Woppaburra people in 1902. The island was effectively vacant from 1903 to 1918. At that point, Michael and Lizzie O'Neill took over the grazing lease and ran sheep, also building a new homestead in the central part of the island. Michael O'Neill died in 1923 but Lizzie remained on the island, remarrying a young fisherman, Ralph Leeke in 1924. The homestead is now known as Leeke's Homestead and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Leeke's Beach and Estuary are also named after Ralph and Lizzie. The marriage did not last and Ralph left the island but Lizzie remained running the sheep by herself until the early 1940s. After World War II, the island increasingly became a tourist destination.. Prior to this a local oysterman, James Morris was in the habit of bringing fishing parties to this island with accommodation in bush shelters. The first two huts were built by his sons Con and Cres in 1935 at Fisherman's Beach. In 1957, Charles Tompson finished constructing a house and seven cabins at Fisherman's Beach and so began the first rudimentary 'resort'. Ill health saw Tompson sell the buildings to Con, Cres and Alan Morris who called the resort 'Silver Sands' and ran it until 1966. It was then purchased by Graham Roberts and Tom Green who built a large new building and the first swimming pool. This was also when Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) built the airstrip to service the resort. Roberts and Green sold to a Sydney-based consortium in 1971 which also acquired the grazing lease thus changing the future use of the island. TAA increased its interests in the resort taking over full ownership in 1975. The resort continued to expand over the next 15 years eventually reaching a size able to accommodate 350 visitors and 130 staff. It is most famously known for the highly successful \\"Get Wrecked on Great Keppel\\" advertising campaign. Qantas took over TAA and the resort in 1992 but sold it to two Queensland businessmen, Bevan Whittaker and Ron Hancock in 1998. Under this ownership it was operated firstly by Contiki and then by Mercure. A further sale followed in 2006 with Sydney-based developer Tower Holdings taking ownership. Tower only ran the resort for a short time before closing it down in February 2008 announcing its plans for a major redevelopment involving a large hotel, hundreds of apartments and condominiums, a marina, a Greg Norman designed golf course and a larger sized airstrip capable of landing small jet aircraft. After 12 years of ownership the only major accomplishment by Tower Holdings was the completion of an Environmental Impact Study which lead to the approval by all three levels of government for the redevelopment proposal. Tower Holdings demolished a number of the old resort buildings in April 2018 and then put the remains of the resort and its leases on the market in the middle of the year. Heritage listings Great Keppel Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Leeke Homestead Resorts Ferry service from Yeppoon deposit passengers directly to the island's main beach. The first resort on the island was operating in 1967. There are no high-rise resorts on the island. The resort is now closed however there is still accommodation on Great Keppel Island which ranges from tents and cabins or even a private beach house on the water's edge. Ferries depart everyday to Great Keppel Island from Keppel Bay Marina & Pier One, Rosslyn Bay. A number of charters, and full day cruises, sailing adventures, and extended tour options are also available from Keppel Bay Marina. Great Keppel Island once boasted a resort owned by Contiki, dedicated to making it a \\"backpackers' island\\", though has recently been taken over by Mercure Resort, making it more of a family resort. After purchasing the lease for the resort and that of Lot 21 which covers 74% of the island, GKI Resort Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the privately owned Australian company Tower Holdings, closed the facility in 2008. They then unveiled a $1.15 billion revitalisation plan for the island. The plan, which has been declared a \\"significant project\\" by the Queensland Government, includes a 300-room resort hotel, 300 resort apartments, 1,700 villas, a 560-berth marina and ferry terminal, a championship golf course, yacht club, sporting ovals, childcare facilities, chapel and cultural centre. The plan includes 1,300 acres (545 hectares) of environmental parkland on Lot 21 which is currently public land for recreation purposes. This land has already been recommended for a conservation park by the Department of Environment and Resource Management. Tower chairman Terry Agnew did not have the support of the residents of Central Queensland or the Environment Department. The proposal was rejected by the Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett in October 2009 on the grounds that there would be 'unacceptable' impacts to the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef values of the island.Ari Sharp (30 October 2009).

The village is situated south west of Maidstone at a point where the Rivers Teise and Beult join the River Medway. At the 2001 census, the parish, which includes the villages of Benover and Laddingford, had a population of 2,236. increasing to 2,418 at the 2011 Census. The Twyford Bridge. Yalding lies where the Greensand Way and Medway Valley Walk cross, of Maidstone, at the confluence of the rivers Medway, Teise and Beult. There are three bridges in the village; the Twyford Bridge (meaning twin ford, where there was originally a double crossing of the two rivers) is one of the finest medieval bridges in the south-east of England. Yalding was one of the principal shipment points on the River Medway for cannon, from villages of the Wealden iron industry. One iron master was John Browne from Horsmonden. The wharf was later used for transporting fruit from the many orchards in the area. History The Saxon village was called Twyford and was close to the bridge. But the name was recorded in the Domesday Book as the Saxon manor of Hallinges seized by William the Conquerer and given to his half brother Odo of Bayeux', Yalding was derived from the Olde English pre 7th century \\"Ealdingas\\" and translates as the place of the Ealda people a tribe who were widespread until the 9 the century (the old village). It was recorded in the \\"Domesday\\" as \\"Hallinges\\" by a Norman-French cleric who had little knowledge of the area. In 1212 it is recorded more correctly as \\"Ealding\\" (ref; www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Yalden.ref; www.britannica.com Encyclopaedia- Britannica William 1st King of England. ref; Yalding surname meaning and statistics https://forebears.io ref anglo-saxon settlement of Britain. Wikipedia. Phonological history of English diphthongs. Wikipedia) By 1642 this had mutated to Yaldinge. The medieval records from Yalding are so complete that it was used in a History Case Study for Secondary Schools, called The Yalding Project. During the English Civil War in 1643, a battle took place at Town Bridge between the Roundheads and Cavaliers. The Cavaliers had advanced from Aylesford towards Tonbridge, but the Parliamentarian soldiers had marched to block their movements, bombarded them and forced their surrender, with the result that 300 were captured and 300 escaped. Yalding was a favourite of Edith Nesbit, author of The Railway Children, who wrote in the 1920s: \\"The Medway just above the Anchor (at Yalding, Kent) is a river of dreams...If you go to Yalding you may stay at the George and be comfortable in a little village that owns a haunted churchyard, a fine church, and one of the most beautiful bridges in Europe.\\" The village was home to a chemicals manufacturing works from 1912 to 2003. In the early years it manufactured soap, then progressed to crop protection products. It was run by Syngenta at the time of closure. Garden Organic, previously known as the Henry Doubleday Research Association, the UK's leading organic growing charity, created a demonstration garden near the village. This was closed in 2007 but was leased and reopened by the business Maro Foods, in 2008. The gardens are now known as the Yalding Gardens. Buildings St Peter's and St Paul's church is a Grade I listed building. It is built from ragstone, and is judged to be from the 13th century.

Rivers Twyford Bridge crosses the River Medway. It is just downstream of the automatic sluice where the river drops from +11.2m to +7.41m above mean sea level, the navigation bears left through the Hampstead Rd Canal, and the Hampstead Lock, the main stream drops over the weir and sluice and is joined here by the River Teise (Lesser Teise) and both pass under Twyford Bridge. The river then flows in a loop towards the village where it is joined by the River Beult which has passed under Town Bridge. However the main stream of the River Teise flowed into the Beult near Benover, 3 km upstream of Town Bridge. Twyford Bridge is not navigable.

However, the village is home to many children who attend grammar schools in the neighbouring town of Maidstone. Leisure Yalding has a cricket club, Yalding Cricket Club, that has existed since 1798 (first recorded game). The cricket pitch was once beside the River Medway on the Lees (Village Common). They currently play on the Kintons ground. The Greensand Way long-distance footpath crosses the Medway at Twyford Bridge, and follows up the High Street, passes through Blunden Lane, and leaves the village by an ancient byway by Bustom Farm Cottages. The Medway Valley Walk follows the river from Tonbridge to the sluice on the east bank, then the Hampstead Lane Canal, and the river to Maidstone on the west bank. Yalding Organic Garden has a display of fourteen individual gardens, demonstrating gardening through the last 800 years. The plants have been carefully chosen to make sure that they are accurate to their historical period. Yalding has a popular annual contemporary music festival called 'The Vicar's Picnic', set on the edge of the village. Taking place every July it attracts up to 4000 visitors who camp in adjoining fields. Notable acts that have recently performed include The Fun Lovin' Criminals, Starsailor, Reef, Norman Jay MBE, Seb Fontaine, Bruce Foxton, Nightmares on Wax, 90's Indie Britpop band Cast, Canterbury folk-hiphop act, 'Coco & the Butterfields' and The Bluetones lead vocalist Mark Morriss. The festival is taking a break in 2019, returning in 2020.

Helgi appears in Volsunga saga and in two lays in the Poetic Edda named Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I and Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana II. The Poetic Edda relates that Helgi and his mistress Sigr√∫n were Helgi Hj√∂rvar√∞sson and Sv√°va of the Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar reborn. They were once again reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati and K√°ra whose story survives as a part of the Hr√≥mundar saga Gripssonar. Earning his name and meeting a Valkyrie Helgi appears to be the son of Sigmund and Borghild, and only fifteen years old he avenges his father by slaying Hunding, the king of the Saxons. This gives him the cognomen Hunding's bane. He continues with his warlike feats and one day, as he stands aboard his longship, he is visited by a valkyrie named Sigr√∫n, who can ride through the air and over the sea and who knows well about his feats. She embraces him and kisses him, and he immediately falls in love with her. Battle right However, her father king H√∂gne of √ñsterg√∂tland has promised her to Hothbrodd, the son of king Granmar of S√∂dermanland. Helgi collects a force at Brandey (probably modern Br√§ndholmen/Br√§nd√∂, , at the estuary of the bay of Br√•viken, until 1813 named Brand√∂, the modern Swedish form of Brandey) and goes to Granmarr's kingdom. It is retold in detail about the gathering of the forces and of how, in a great battle, Helgi and his brother Sinfj√∂tli fight with H√∂gne, his son Dag, Granmar and all of Granmar's sons Hothbrodd, Starkad and Gudmund. Everyone dies but Helgi, Sinfj√∂tli and H√∂gne's youngest son Dag. Sigr√∫n bids an angry farewell to the dying Hothbrodd and cries with happiness when she learns that her whole family is dead but Dag, who swears allegiance to Helgi. Death Sigr√∫n and Helgi marry and they have several sons. Dag is, however, tormented by the fact that honour demands that he avenge his father. Dag sacrifices to Odin in return for vengeance. Odin lends him a spear, and he dutifully pierces Helgi with it. Then he goes to Sigr√∫n to give his condolences, which makes her curse him: :The wind would stop every time he entered a ship. :The fastest horse would not carry him if he is hunted. :His sword would wound no one but himself. She tells Dag to flee into the woods and to thenceforth live on carrion. Then she buries Helgi in a barrow, but Helgi's soul is already in Valhalla, where Odin tells him to make himself comfortable. Helgi gladly obeys and orders Hunding to feed the pigs, to wash the einherjars' feet and to do other menial chores. Burial mound reunion Sigrun waiting by Helgi's barrow One evening, someone says that he has seen Helgi ride with a large retinue into his own barrow, and so Sigr√∫n goes to the barrow in order to see Helgi. His hair is covered with frost, his body is sullied with blood and his hands are wet. He explains that this is because every tear she has shed has fallen wet and cold on him. In spite of this, she prepares the bed in his mound and they spend a comfortable and wonderful night together. Before day breaks, Helgi has to return to Valhalla. Sigr√∫n returns home and spends the rest of her life waiting in vain for Helgi to return to his barrow one more time. Comments In the second verse of Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana Ihttp://heimskringla.no/wiki/Helgakvi%C3%B0a_Hundingsbana_I we learn that the norns weave the destiny of Helgi, son of Borghild, called Great in Love (Hugumst√≥ra), that he will become the best of the Budlungs, the clan who bore Attila the Hun (Atl√≠) and Brunhild. Apart from this, Helgi is attributed to two different genealogies in the sagas. He is described as an Ylfing (the Wylfings of Beowulf) in several places, but also as a V√∂lsung since he is described as the son of Sigmund and Borghild and the brother of Sinfjotle and Sigurd. This is probably due to a merger between the legend of the V√∂lsungs and an earlier legend of Helgi Hundingsbane. Both H√∂gne and Helgi are described as kings of East G√∂taland, which may seem to be a contradiction. However, in the Heimskringla we learn that H√∂gne was the father-in-law of the Ylfing Hj√∂rvard. Since both are Ylfings or married into the clan, the battle between Helgi and H√∂gne was apparently a civil war. The existence of a civil war may explain why Hj√∂rvard was a sea-king, a man without roof, despite being described by S√∂gubrot as a former ruler of East G√∂taland. If so, the legends may be based on a civil war where H√∂gne had usurped the throne from Hj√∂rvard, but was killed by Hj√∂rvard's kinsman Helgi. Correction.... H√∂gne was the father-in-law of Granmer who married his daughter Hilda. Hj√∂rvard was married to Hildagunn daughter of Granmer. Thus Granmer was Hj√∂rvard father in law and Hogne his grandfather-in-law. The V√∂lsung origin is most likely a later addition, since the legends of Sigurd describe events in the 5th century and those of Helgi describe events in the 7th century. Moreover, in the 7th or 8th century poem Beowulf, the legends of Sigmund were already known. Note: Bragi, Dagr and Sigrun are possibly H√∂gni's grandchildren instead of his children. This would make the betrothal between H√∂√∞brodd and Sigr√∫n one between cousins, which is more likely than H√∂√∞brodd marrying his aunt. Comments: There were four family branches: 1.House of Hogne (Ylfing) (Main branch) 2.House of Hj√∂rvard (Ylfing) (Married Granmars daughter and granddaughter of H√∂gni) 3.House of Helgi (Ylfing) (Married daughter or granddaughter of H√∂gni) 4.House of Granmar (Yngling) (Married daughter of H√∂gni) Granmar is listed as a Yngling sub-king who was invited by the Ingjald the Ill-ruler as it is also stated that Sweden was divided between Erik and Alrik. The descendants of these two kings had spread, cleared land and settled new territories, until there were several petty kings. Ingjald killed all these kings and only Granmar remained. Granmar seems to have had an agenda in uniting the branches of the Ylfings, as he was distrustful of his kinsman Ingild Ill-ruler, who killed all the other kings of Yngling kin. He married his daughter to Hjorvard. Later Granmar and his son-in-law Hj√∂rvard of the Ylfings was ambushed in one of their halls and burned to death by Ingild. Since Helgi supposedly killed Granmar and H√∂gni, he may have been allied with Ingold Ill- ruler. Something also reported done by Injald. This is if he exited at all. As Helgi the Ylfing and Helgi the Volsung are two merged legends. If Helgi the Ylfing existed it has been argued he was a relative of Hjorvard who claimed the throne after Hjorvards death. Dagr was banished by Sigr√∫n for killing Helgi. He henceforth lived on carrion in the woods. Helgi's sons most likely ruled until Harold Hildetand arrived to claim his Kingdom. Hj√∂rmund was later given the kingdom of his father Hj√∂rvard by Harold Hildetand, thus ending all internal strife. According to sources he was a great grandson of Hogne, grandson of Granmar and son of Hjorvard/ Locations Scholarship about the localisation of the Helgi sagas is divided between a Swedish and a Danish school of thought: =The Swedish school= \\"Helgi and Sigrun\\" (1901) by Johannes Gehrts. In Gesta Danorum, which was written to glorify the past of the Danish nation, Helgi Saxo appears to have mixed Helgi Hundingbane with the Danish king Halga, as he claims that Helgi killed a Saxon king named Hunding. Hothbrodd was made a Swedish king and given Ohthere's position in the line. Because of this the Norwegian scholar Bugge tried, in 1896, to connect him to the Skj√∂ldung Helgi. Due to this modification, Helgi's residence Hringsta√∞ir is occasionally interpreted as the Danish Ringsted. Others have remarked that, in the Norse sagas the Ylfings are never called Danish, and the only territory that they are said to have ruled is East G√∂taland. In the first poem (Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I), Sinfjotle has his residence on the Bravellir (the plain west of Br√•viken in East G√∂taland, see Battle of Br√•valla) and Helgi resides at Hringsta√∞ir (probably modern Ringstad, an old royal estate on the same plain existing well before, and during, the 7th century). Moreover, in the Heimskringla, their enemy Granmar (the father of Hothbrodd) was the king of S√∂dermanland, which is adjacent to East G√∂taland, and not of Sweden. =The Danish school= The route the Danish invasion fleet took, according to Sophus Bugge. The Norwegian scholar Sophus Bugge argued for a Danish origin of the underlying story. He noted the similarity between the name of the primary antagonist H√∂√∞brodd, and antagonists of the Beowulf epic, the Hea√∞obards. The latter are noted for fighting against the Danish Scylding Helgi, comparable to H√∂√∞brodd's fight against Helgi. Bugge furthermore points to a number of (semi-)identifiable places in Denmark and northern Germany: * Hringsta√∞ is elsewhere attested as the Old Norse name for Ringsted. * He√∞insey is elsewhere attested as the Old Norse name for Hiddensee. * Varinsfir√∞i may point to a place near where the Warnabi or Varini used to live. Bugge identifies it with the mouth of the river Warnow. * Svarinshaug may be connected to the Suarines and hence be nearby modern Schwerin. * √ñrvasund may either be the √òresund, or a translation of Slavic Stralsund, i.e. arrow-sound. * M√≥insheim may be connected to the Danish isle of M√∂n. * Adams-Bellows points out H√°t√∫n may be the village of Tune. * Bugge connects the Sigarsvellir with the Danish town of Sigersted near Ringsted. * Hl√©sey may be the Danish island of L√¶s√∏. Bugge therefore argues the war between Helgi and H√∂√∞brodd is a rendition of an ancient war between the Danes and Hea√∞obards, as a family feud. In the Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I, it is said of H√∂√∞brodd's army that Indeed, M√∂n would be a logical place for a battle between Danes and an invading Hea√∞obard army. Sometime after this battle, the Danes responded by sending their own invasion fleet. They assembled their fleet in the Stralsund. From there, they moved west: Westwards from the Stralsund is indeed the mouth of the river Warnow, and the town of Schwerin.

In spite of this, Tian continued to practice diving with a provincial team. He maintained his diving standard and won a medal at the following National Games of China. Although there was great public interest in him rejoining the national team, it did not happen. Tian has since then split his schedule between diving training and public activities.

It constitutes one of the Helgi lays, together with Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana II and Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar. The locations in the poem have been fervently debated with a Danish school maintaining Danish origins and locationsSee Bellow's commentaries and references to Sophus Bugge. and a Swedish one pointing out that locations (e.g. Br√°vellir and Brandey) and characters (Ylfings, H√∂gni and Granmarr) place the events in √ñsterg√∂tland and S√∂dermanland.Nerman, B. Det svenska rikets uppkomst. Stockholm, 1925. The poem is also ambiguous in attributing Helgi to the Ylfing, Yngling and V√∂lsung clans, which suggests a merging of originally unrelated traditions. In the Edda, the poem is a sequel to Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar whose heroes Helgi Hj√∂rvar√∞sson and Sv√°fa are reborn as Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigr√∫n. However, in Codex Regius, it is actually followed by Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar. The poem begins in a location called Br√°lund with the birth of Helgi Hundingbane, the son of Sigmund and Borghild. Norns arrived at the dwelling to shape his future as a hero. When Helgi was but fifteen years old, he slew a man named Hunding.There is no mention here of Hunding's battles with Helgi's father Sigmund. This caused Hunding's sons Eyj√≥lfr, √Ålfr, Hj√∂rvar√∞r and H√°var√∞r to approach Helgi asking for wergild and the return of the booty Helgi had taken from their father. When Helgi refused them this, Hunding's sons declared war and in the ensuing battle, Helgi killed all of Hunding's sons.In the V√∂lsunga saga, Hunding's sons kill Sigmund and his father-in-law Eylimi, whereupon Sigurd takes revenge. Helgi met the Valkyrie Sigr√∫n who informed him that her father H√∂gni has betrothed her to H√∂√∞broddr, the unworthy son of king Granmarr of the Hniflung clan. Helgi promised to take on H√∂√∞broddr and to claim her as his own. Helgi then assembled a mighty host and departed to wage war on H√∂√∞brodd's family. When they had arrived at Granmar's kingdom, the poem deals with a flyting between Helgi's half-brother Sinfj√∂tli and H√∂√∞brodd's brother Gu√∞mundr. Then, the armies clashed at Frekastein and Helgi was victorious winning Sigr√∫n as his bride.

It constitutes one of the Helgi lays together with Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I and Helgakvi√∞a Hj√∂rvar√∞ssonar. Henry Adams Bellows maintains in his commentaries that it is a patchwork of various poems that do not fit well together, but stanzas 28-37 and 39-50 are held to be among the finest in Old Norse poetry. The feud with Hunding and his sons The first section (containing stanzas 1 to 4) introduces Helgi as the son of Sigmund, of the Ylfing and the V√∂lsung clan, and Borghild. They resided at Br√°lund and they named their son after Helgi Hj√∂rvar√∞sson. Their clan was in a bloody feud with Hunding and his many sons. Helgi disguised himself and visited the home of Hunding's family where the only man present was Hunding's son H√¶mingr (unknown in any other source). Hunding sent men to Helgi's foster-father Hagal to search for Helgi but Helgi hid by dressing as a female servant working with the mill. Helgi managed to escape to a warship after which he killed Hunding and l.earned his name Hundingsbane.k. Helgi meets Sigr√∫n In the second section (containing stanzas 5 to 12), Helgi lay with his war party at Brunarvagar and had slaughtered some rustled cattle on the beach and were eating the meat raw. Then Sigr√∫n, who was Sv√°fa reborn appeared, and introduced herself as the daughter of king H√∂gne. Helgi has to challenge Hothbrodd In the third section (containing stanzas 13 to 20), which is called the Old V√∂lsung Lay, Sigr√∫n's father had promised her to Hothbrodd, the son of king Granmarr. Sigr√∫n opposed the marriage and sought out Helgi, who was exhausted from a battle in which he had killed Hunding's sons Eyj√≥lfr, √Ålfr, Hj√∂rvar√∞r and H√°var√∞r. The Valkyrie embraced him and kissed him, and Helgi promised her to fight against Granmarr and his sons. Helgi assembled an army and invaded Granmar's kingdom together with his brother Sinfj√∂tli. They won the battle and Helgi could take Sigr√∫n as his wife with whom he had sons. Sinfj√∂tli's and Guthmund's flyting A fifth section (stanzas 22 to 27) consists of a misplaced version of the flyting between Sinfj√∂tli (Helgi's half-brother) and Guthmundr, which probably is older than the one found in Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I. Dagr kills Helgi and is cursed by Sigr√∫n In the seventh section (containing stanzas 28-37) Sigr√∫n's brother Dagr, who had been spared by vowing allegiance to Helgi, sacrificed to Odin in the hope of getting revenge for Helgi's slaying of his father and brothers. Odin gave Dagr a spear with which Dagr pierced Helgi at a location called Fj√∂turlundr.The name means \\"grove of fetters\\" and the only place which has any connection with this name is a sacred grove of the Semnones which could only be entered by people who were bound. Dagr then returned to tell his sister of Helgi's death: Sigr√∫n avenged her husband by placing on her brother the most horrible curse: Dagr was banished to live on carrion in the woods and Helgi was buried in a barrow. When Helgi had entered Valhalla Odin asked Helgi to rule over the Einherjar together with himself. There is a stanza which Bellows interprets as a misplaced stanza on the conflict between Helgi and Hunding, but othersE.g. by Alf Henrikson in Den stora mytologiska uppslagsboken (1998). interpret as Helgi oppressing Hunding in Valhalla: Helgi's last visit Sigr√∫n waiting by Helgi's barrow An eighth section (containing stanzas 39-50) deals with a short visit by Helgi from Valhalla and his meeting with Sigr√∫n in his barrow. One evening, a maiden told Sigr√∫n that she has seen Helgi ride with a large retinue into his own barrow, and so Sigr√∫n went to the barrow in order to see Helgi. His hair were covered with frost, his body is sullied with blood and his hands were wet. He explained that it was because every tear she had shed had fallen wet and cold on him. In spite of this, she prepared the bed in his mound and they spent a night together. Before day broke, Helgi had to return to Valhalla. Sigr√∫n returned home and spent the rest of her life waiting in vain for Helgi to return to his barrow one more time. She died early from the sorrow, but she would meet him in the next life when she was the Valkyrie K√°ra and he was Helgi Haddingjaskati.

History  The Ol≈°any Cemeteries were created in 1680 to accommodate plague victims who died en masse in Prague and needed to be buried quickly. In 1787, when the plague again struck the city, Emperor Joseph II banned the burial of bodies within Prague city limits and Ol≈°any Cemeteries were declared the central graveyard for hygiene purposes. The Ol≈°any necropolis consists of twelve cemeteries, including, i.a., an Orthodox and a tiny Muslim section, the largest Jewish cemetery in the Czech Republic and military burial grounds. Among the thousands of military personnel buried at Ol≈°any, there are Russian soldiers and officers from the Napoleonic Wars, members of the Czechoslovak Legion, Czechoslovak soldiers, officers and pilots who fought at the Eastern and Western Front and in North Africa during the Second World War as well as male and female members of the Soviet and Commonwealth (including British, Canadian, South African, Greek and Turkish Cypriot and Polish) armed forces who died for the freedom of Czechoslovakia in 1944-1945, including POWs. Based on a bilateral agreement, Czech authorities are responsible for the protection of Russian and Soviet military graves at the Czech territory (as the Russian Federation is responsible for protecting Czechoslovak war graves from both World Wars in Russia). The Commonwealth Prague War Cemetery, including 256 graves, was established under the terms of the 1949 War Graves Agreement between the UK and Czechoslovakia and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. There are two ceremonial halls assigned to bid farewell to the deceased; the newer one is located in a building of the Prague's first crematorium. New to the scene is the \\"Ol≈°any Cemeteries Learning Trail\\" which is so far mapping the history of three of the oldest sections, also sketching the life stories of some celebrities buried here.

In the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours, as celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church, it is one of the two major hours. Name The name is derived from the three last psalms of the psalter (148, 149, 150), the Laudate psalms, which in former versions of the Lauds of the Roman Rite occurred every day, and in all of which the word laudate is repeated frequently. At first, the word \\"Lauds\\" designated only the end, that is to say, these three psalms. Little by little the title Lauds was applied to the whole office, and supplanted the name of Matins, which in turn was reserved to the night office and replaced the name \\"Vigil\\".  History  Lauds, or the Morning Office or Office of Aurora, is one of the most ancient Offices and can be traced back to Apostolic times. The earliest evidence of Lauds appears in the second and third centuries in the Canons of Hippolytus and in writings by St. Cyprian, and the Apostolic Fathers. Descriptions during the fourth and fifth centuries appear in writings by John Cassian, St. Melania the Younger, St. Hilary, Eusebius, and in the Peregrinatio √Ütheriae by St. John Chrysostom. During the 6th century St. Benedict gave a detailed description of them in his Rule. Gregory of Tours also made several allusions to this office, which he calls Matutini hymni. According to John T. Hedrick, in Introduction to the Roman Breviary, Lauds were not originally a distinct canonical hour but Matins and Lauds formed a single office, the Night Office terminating only at dawn. The monks prayed Matins during the night and said Lauds in the early dawn.Parsch, Pius. \\"The Canonical Hours\\", Commentaries on the Breviary In the 5th and 6th century the Lauds were called Matutinum. By the Middle Ages, the midnight office was referred to as \\"Nocturns\\", and the morning office as \\"Matins\\". The lengthy midnight office became \\"Matins\\" and was divided into two or three \\"nocturns\\"; the morning office became \\"Lauds\\".Billett, Jesse D., The Divine Office in Anglo-Saxon England, 597-C.1000, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2014 After St. Pius X‚Äôs reform, Lauds was reduced to four psalms or portions of psalms and an Old Testament canticle, putting an end to the custom of adding the last three psalms of the Psalter (148-150) at the end of Lauds every day. With the reforms of Vatican II, Lauds is now called \\"Morning Prayer\\". = Symbolism and significance = This is the Office of daybreak and hence its symbolism is of Christ's resurrection. According to Dom Cabrol, \\"Lauds remains the true morning prayer, which hails in the rising sun, the image of Christ triumphant‚Äîconsecrates to Him the opening day.\\"Cabrol, Fernand. The Day Hours of the Church, London, 1910 The Office of Lauds reminds the Christian that the first act of the day should be praise, and that one's thoughts should be of God before facing the cares of the day. =Liturgia horarum (1970)= In the edition of the Roman breviary of 1970 which was revised according to the mandate of the Second Vatican Council, Lauds (Latin Laudes matutinae, pl.) has the following structure: *A short introductory verse (unless it is being prayed immediately after the Invitatory or Office of Readings) *A hymn, which is optional when combining with the Office of Readings *A morning psalm, an Old Testament canticle, and a psalm of praise. These are opened and closed by antiphons. *A short reading with a responsorial verse *The Benedictus, with its antiphon *Intercessions *The Lord's Prayer *Concluding prayer *Blessing and dismissal (if prayed in community) All psalms and canticles are concluded with the doxology, \\"Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and will be forever. Amen.\\" (The current translation of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, given here, differs from the traditional English translation used in other countries.) The psalms and readings are distributed in a four-week cycle, which forms the heart of the prayer. Variations On feast days, the various parts of the hour may be taken from the office of the saint being celebrated or from common texts for the saints. If the feast has the rank of \\"memorial\\", any parts specifically provided for the saint (the \\"proper\\" parts) are used, while the other parts come from the weekday, with exception of the hymn (which may be optionally taken from the common texts), the antiphon for the Benedictus (which must be taken from the proper or the common), the intercession (which may be optionally taken from the common texts), and the closing prayer (which should be proper, or if missing, common). For a \\"feast\\" or solemnity, all texts are taken from the proper, or if some part is missing, from the common. On these days, the morning psalm is always Psalm 63, verses 2-9, the canticle is the \\"Song of the Three Holy Children\\" (Daniel 3:57-88 and 56), and the psalm of praise is Psalm 149. On Corpus Christi, the hymn O Salutaris Hostia is sung. In the important seasons of the Church year, such as Lent or Easter, many of the prayers are proper for each day of the season. In Lent, Christmas, Holy Week, Easter Week, and the last eight days of Advent, celebration of feast days is somewhat restricted. On some of these days, a memorial may be celebrated as a \\"commemoration\\", adding an extra prayer at the end of the hour, while on others the memorial is completely removed from the calendar. =Other rites of the Western Church= In the Ambrosian Office, and also in the Mozarabic, Lauds retained a few of the principal elements of the Roman Lauds: the Benedictus, canticles from the Old Testament, and the laudate psalms, arranged, however, in a different order (cf. Germain Morin, op. cit. in bibliography). In the Benedictine Liturgy, the Office of Lauds resembles the Roman Lauds very closely, not only in its use of the canticles but also in its general construction. Armenian liturgy The Armenian Morning (or Early) Hour (Armenian: ‘±’º’°÷Ç’°÷Ç’ø’•’°’∂ ‘∫’°’¥ a·πõawotean zham) corresponds to the office of Lauds in the Roman Liturgy, both in its position in the daily cycle and in its importance. This is the most complex of all Armenian church services in terms of the variations in the order and text of the service depending on the day of the week, liturgical tone, commemoration of the day, and liturgical season. Many manuscripts and printed editions of the Armenian Book of Hours (Armenian: ‘∫’°’¥’°’£’´÷Ä÷Ñ Zhamagirk\`) state that the Morning Hour commemorates the Son of God, with some manuscripts adding, \\"at the time he was seized by the Jews.\\" This is in reference to the story of the arrest and interrogation of Jesus found in the New Testament Gospels. =Outline of the Morning Service= In the Morning Hour for Sundays and Festal Days there are seven slots into which hymnody may be inserted which reflects the theme of the day. Each of these seven slots is associated with a Psalm or Canticle from the Old or New Testaments. Eastern Christianity Among the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the office comparable to the Lauds of the Roman Rite is the Orthros. It also contains the three Laudate psalms (148-150), with which it traditionally closes. Lutheran and Anglican traditions Like the other canonical hours, Lauds is observed by Christians in other denominations, notably those of the Lutheran Churches. In the Anglican Communion, elements of the office have been folded into the service of Morning Prayer as celebrated according to the Book of Common Prayer, and the hour itself is observed by many Anglican religious orders.

History The site of the village, used from approximately 1200 CE until 1776 when the Acjachemen were moved to Mission San Juan Capistrano, is variously described as an ancient/pre-historic village and as a gravesite. The site, when an open field, was used until recently as a sacred site by the Juane√±os. For many years, rodeos and circuses were held at that location. Present day The property is currently occupied by the gymnasium, athletic fields and performing arts complex of Jun√≠pero Serra High School.

History  In 1863, a cutter carrying a load of cedar logs ran aground on what would become Sawtell Beach. A Coffs Harbour farmer named Walter Harvey assembled a team of workers to salvage the logs, and a small settlement developed near the site of the wreck. Forty years later, the land around Sawtell Beach was purchased and subdivided by Oswald Sawtell for housing and farmland. Sawtell railway station, post office, school and hotel followed soon thereafter and by the 1930s Sawtell had become a thriving coastal village. The original inhabitants of the land were Aborigines of the Gumbaynggirr clan. The Aboriginal name for the land where the town now stands was Bongil Bongil.

It is served by the North Coast railway line with six New South Wales XPT services daily, three heading north and three south. Sawtell station is an optional stop for all of them. Coffs Harbour Airport is located just to the north of Sawtell with the runway ending just to the north of the town. It is serviced daily by Virgin Australia, Tiger Airlines and QantasLink. Demographics Sawtell has a population of 3,490 people. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people make up 3.78% of the population. Sawtell, Toormina and Boambee (all with postcode 2452) have a combined population of 19,477 people, 5.5% of whom are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Sawtell Beach Sawtell beach extends north from Sawtell Headland and the sheltered Sailors Bay swimming area to Murray's beach. The beach is patrolled by the local Surf Lifesavers who run Sawtell Surf Club half way along the beach. Due to the dunes there are no true beach front properties on Sawtell Beach. Some properties look over Bonville Creek and some over Murray's Beach. The beach has singing sand when walked on in dry conditions. Sports and events  Sawtell has numerous sporting clubs and facilities. The Sawtell Panthers junior and senior Rugby League clubs play out of Rex Hardaker Oval, Toormina - along with Coffs Rugby, and the pigeon racing club. The Sawtell Scorpions are the local soccer club, based at Toormina Oval. The Sawtell Saints are the Australian Rules Football club, based at Richardson Park along with the Sawtell Cricket Club. Sawtell also has a number of recreation sporting clubs, most notably, Sawtell Golf Club, Sawtell Bowling Club, Sawtell Swimming Club, Sawtell Surf Lifesaving Club and Sawtell Tennis Club. A number of annual events have been organised by the local Sawtell Chamber of Commerce, which is chaired by Clive Greenway who runs the antique store on the high street Bellacosa as well as a local building firm. The annual Chilli Festival features over 100 stalls of local and national vendors serving chilli-based food and products. The Festival is one of Sawtell's major annual events and is family oriented. The New Year's Super Fun Day involves family entertainment, including wood chopping, a fun run, tug of war competitions, and live entertainment on new years day. The Ben Woods Cricket Tournament, held between Sawtell and Coffs Harbour, takes place during the Christmas Period. A surfing competition, held at Sawtell Beach, raises money for those living with spinal injuries. Surfers from all over NSW and Queensland come to compete in the event. Tourism and entertainment Sawtell has a thriving modern cafe and restaurant scene. Food and drinks are available throughout the day from 7am to late at the cafes, restaurants, local pub and RSL. Boambee creek offers safe swimming and a walking path around the headland. Sawtell Headland is popular for whale watching. The Cinema has been recently renovated and offers two screens. The usual amenities, bakeries, post office, hotels, motels, laundromat are all available. Sawtell has excellent surf breaks to suit all levels and wind directions. Sydney Morning Herald Review of Sawtell Property and investment Sawtell is an ever popular place to live, work and holiday and recent property prices have been booming. The attractions of the amazing beach and restaurants are making it increasingly popular with families and also new residents from major cities looking to relocate to a beach side area. All Sawtell properties are within walking distance of the attractions. Very few properties have a sea view due to the beach side dunes but some are available. There are fantastic creek views available over the Bongil Bengal National Park and Boambee Creek from properties situated to Lyons Road.

Typecast as a femme fatale in European arthouse and genre films, she is best regarded for her performances as Eva Kant in Mario Bava's critically re-assessed Danger: Diabolik (1968), and the dual role of Susan Dumurrier/Monica Weston in Lucio Fulci's giallo One on Top of the Other (1969). After garnering popularity by appearing in such films as Venusberg (1963), French Dressing (1964), Masquerade (1965), Casanova 70 (1965) and Secret Agent Super Dragon (1966), Mell's attempt to launch a Broadway and Hollywood career ended with the failure of her debut musical Mata Hari. She settled in Italy, where her high profile love life and long association with Pier Luigi Torri, a playboy who later became one of the world's most-wanted fugitives, made her familiar to readers of tabloid press stories about the European jet set and elite Roman nightclubs. Her other notable films during this period include Anyone Can Play (1968), Marta (1971), Ben and Charlie (1972), Seven Blood-Stained Orchids (1972), Gang War in Milan (1973), Mahogany (1975), Casanova & Co. (1977) and Mad Dog Killer (1977). Despite her typically resilient onscreen persona, Mell was privately a vulnerable figure who suffered from bad luck, ill-judged personal choices, and drug use. By the late 1980s, these factors had eroded the qualities that had earned her initial stardom, and she was forced to spend the remainder of her life in Austria, where she subsisted in straitened circumstances. Career Mell left her home city of Graz to attend the Max Reinhardt drama school where her fellow students briefly included Senta Berger. After four years in stage work, she began to appear in starring roles in European films. In 1963, she was involved in a serious automobile accident in France. For six hours, she lay unconscious, unaware that she nearly lost her right eye. The disfigurement extended to her lip as well. She spent the next two years undergoing plastic surgery, and no damage remained in her face except for a distinctive curl of her upper lip. After the Eurospy film Secret Agent Super Dragon (1966), she secured the title role in the \\"utterly calamitous\\" musical Mata Hari alongside Pernell Roberts. A preview performance in Washington, D.C. became infamous for its numerous technical problems, and producer David Merrick decided to close the production. For the rest of her life, Mell had difficulty acknowledging the failure, which may have played a part in her moving to Italy where her stories of a successful Broadway run were not challenged. She said she had turned down a lucrative seven-year Hollywood contract because \\"the contract was a whole book. I think that even to go to the toilet I would have needed a permission.\\" In 1968, Mell had her best-known film role as Eva Kant in Danger: Diabolik (1968), which initially was poorly received but has been championed by later film critics. At this time, Mell was appearing in what were by Italian standards major productions, which got American releases, such as Lucio Fulci's early giallo One on Top of the Other (1969). She suffered the death of a prematurely born daughter in 1969, and never had another child. Mell's name had been romantically linked with number of European and Hollywood male stars, but in Italy she was often the center of paparazzi stories along with Pier Luigi Torri, her aristocratic, nightclub-owing boyfriend. In 1971, he got into a series of legal difficulties over cocaine being supplied to his nightclub's clients, and fled the country on his yacht. After being arrested in London over a $300 million dollar gold mine and bank scam, and in an ironic echo of Danger: Diabolik, Torri got out the cell, made a daring and acrobatic rooftop escape, and evaded a huge search by infuriated English police; he eventually was recaptured in America after 18 months at large. As one of the more recognizable beauties in Italian film, Mell continued to work steadily throughout the 1970s, and posed for Italian Playboy. Mel's marketability depended on her youth and stunning looks, which faded as she moved into middle age. Even in Italy where she had been a genuine celebrity, her box-office appeal had declined by the late 1980s to the point that she was not being considered for the lowest-budget exploitation films, and she resorted to posing for cheap, soft-porn magazines. With no support, Mell accepted the inevitable and returned to Austria to live in impoverished and isolated circumstances, with her decades of heavy smoking and substance abuse having affected her appearance so negatively that she appeared far older than her true age. Mell's public profile was very low by her latter years although she got some acting work shortly before her 1992 death in Vienna, aged 53, from throat cancer.

She is depicted as the main goddess of evil in the setting and head of the Dark Pantheon.  Titles and forms  Within the Dragonlance universe, Takhisis was a sister of Gilean and Paladine, the goddess of control and evil, consort to Sargonnas, and mother to Zeboim and Nuitari. Takhisis was responsible for the corruption of the chromatic dragons, and appeared in one form as a dragon with heads the colors of blue, black, white, red, and green. Takhisis is also referred to as Dragon Queen (among elves), Nilat the Corrupter (among the barbarians of the plains), Tamex, the False Metal (among dwarves), Mai-tat, She of Many Faces (among the people of Ergoth), Queen of Many Colors and None (among the Knights of Solamnia), the Dark Queen, Erestem, Tii'Mhut, Lady Chaos, Mwarg, the One God, the Dark Warrior, and Shadow Sorcerer. Jeff Grubb believes that she is Tiamat, Goddess (or Queen) of evil dragons in many other Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. However, the two are separate entities according to Dragonlance creator, Tracy Hickman and others. The 4th Edition Draconomicon books confirm that Takhisis is Tiamat in fourth edition. This is confirmed again in the 5th edition Dungeon Master's Guide. Takhisis most often takes the form of a five-headed dragon; each head is represented by the color of one of the evil dragons (red, blue, green, black, and white). She also often uses the form of a beautiful temptress, said to be so lovely that no man can resist her. Additionally, she has another form known as the Dark Warrior. Sargonnas is Takhisis' consort. Together they have two children: Nuitari and Zeboim.  Ambition  Within the Dragonlance universe, Takhisis is the most ambitious of the gods, frequently making plans to upset the balance and take over the world for herself. In Dragons of the Hourglass Mage, for example, Takhisis attempts to take control of all magic. After being driven back by Huma Dragonbane in the Third Dragon War and sealed from the world, she bides her time in the Abyss, always looking for new ways into the world. This brings about the War of the Lance, where the dark goddess is ultimately thwarted by the Heroes of the Lance, and subsequently contributes to the Chaos War and the War of Souls. Raistlin Majere attempts to destroy Takhisis and assume her role as head god of evil. He succeeds in one timeline, but destroys the world of Krynn in the ensuing magical battle. His brother Caramon, with the aid of a time-travelling device, dissuades him from this path; and Raistlin sacrifices himself to prevent Takhisis from leaving the Abyss.  The War of Souls  After the Chaos War, Takhisis steals the world from the rest of the gods and becomes the \\"One God\\" of the world. When the rest of the gods return to Krynn, they realize that Takhisis has gone too far. Although Sargonnas has generally been loyal to her, the actions leading up to her being made mortal lead Sargonnas to declare she has gone too far and to support the decision. In order to retain the balance, Paladine sacrifices his godhood and immortality in order for Takhisis to be stripped of her godhood and immortality. She is then killed by the elven king Silvanoshei.  Other publications  Takhisis is key to the Dragonlance world creation myth as the primordial source of evil. This central role is crucial to how creation myths are presented. In the neo-pagan press, a series of books published by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, looks at Takhisis in the Dragonlance world and compares her to the Babylonian and Dungeons & Dragons version of Tiamat. The book is written as a school book for young wizards and witches of the neo-pagan sort. Takhisis is described for her role in the wars of good vs. evil. This ultimate source of the theme of evil is discussed again in a presentation by Dr. Stefan Ekman of Lund University in Sweden. Dr. Ekman compares Takhisis and other fantasy \\"dark lords,\\" such as Lord Foul and Sauron, to the biblical Satan. In particular he states, \\"Even though not all of the Dark Lords above signify the ultimate source of evil, Lord Foul, the Dark One, and Takhisis certainly do. And all of them are ultimately actants, characters whose raison d‚Äô√™tre is to provide the final threat\\". This theme of good versus evil, and human versus gods, is expanded in Dragonlance, a Shared World of Fantasy Fiction and Role-Playing Games. The central focus of this thesis is the struggle of the human characters versus Takhisis. This struggle is compared with the human, or at least mortal, heroes of the stories of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. Tiamat, in her Dragonlance/Krynn incarnation is also the subject of in the Dragon Gods and Evil dragons sections of the Practical Guide to Dragons. She is discussed in universe style with sidebars detailing her real-world publishing significance. This is continued in the follow-up series The Dragon Codices, in which Takhisis is the main, if somewhat hidden, antagonist.

In the legends of the Ylfing Helgi Hundingsbane, he was the son of king Granmar of S√∂dermanland, and he was killed by Helgi. The Chronicon Lethrense and included Annales Lundenses relate that Hother was the king of the Saxons and son of Hothbrod, whom Helghe had killed to win all of Denmark. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods. In Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus has merged the Ylfing Helgi Hundingsbane with the Danish skj√∂ldung king Helgi.

Edmonds became the Director of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence on 1 April 1919 and was responsible for the post-war compilation of the 28-volume History of the Great War. Edmonds wrote nearly half the volumes, including eleven of the 14 volumes dealing with the Western Front (Military Operations, France and Belgium). His task was not completed until the final volume was published in 1949. Early army life Edmonds was educated at King's College School, London and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Edmonds passed into the Royal Military Academy with the highest marks instructors could remember, won the Sword of Honour for the Best Gentleman Cadet and was commissioned into the Corps of Royal Engineers in 1881. In the Royal Engineers, his intellect earned him the nickname Archimedes. Edmonds possessed a considerable intellect and was fluent in many European and Asian languages. In 1896, he entered the Staff College, Camberley, achieving the highest score of his class on the entrance exam. His classmates included Douglas Haig, who became Commander-in- Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in December 1915, during the First World War; Edmund Allenby, who led British forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1917 to 1918 and William Robertson, who became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1916. Military Intelligence and MI5 Edmonds passed the two-year staff course at the top of his class. He was understandably marked for work in military intelligence and was posted to the War Office Intelligence Department in 1899. Edmonds served as an Intelligence Officer in South Africa from 1901 to 1904, then the Far Eastern desk of the War Office Intelligence Department, following the removal of an officer found to have made basic mistakes in the role. He performed well, rising to be the head of the renamed Military Operations Directorate 5 (MO5) in 1907, by which time he was a highly experienced intelligence officer. In 1905, with W. Birkbeck Wood, Edmonds authored The Civil War in the United States with Special Reference to the Campaigns of 1864 and 1865, a two-volume history of the American Civil War. The book, \\"subsequently abbreviated and constantly republished, remains to this day the best English history of the war\\". Edmonds was arguably the leading army intellectual of his day; as a child living in France he had witnessed the Franco-Prussian War and had studied the German Army ever since. He developed many German links and was important in convincing government ministers of a German spy threat before World War I. He is widely credited as being a pioneer of intelligence in the departments that developed into MI5, the British Security Service. Edmonds was a supporter of the appointment of Captain Vernon Kell to the Secret Service Bureau, the predecessor of MI5 of which Kell became the first head. First World War At the outbreak of the war in 1914, Edmonds was chief-of-staff of the 4th Division of the Expeditionary Force (renamed British Expeditionary Force on the arrival in France of the Indian Expeditionary Force) but the strain of the Great Retreat following the Battle of Mons (23 August), led to his replacement in September, within a month of the opening of hostilities. He spent the remainder of the war as a staff officer at the BEF GHQ, during which time he gathered documents to be used in the Official History. Edmonds needed to demonstrate great diplomacy to obtain information. He told his Australian counterpart, Charles Bean, Later career The History of the Great War (1922‚Äì1948) produced by Edmonds has been criticised as propaganda, for being too lenient on the British generals. It has been suggested that Edmonds' favourable portrayal of Haig was a counterpoint to the scathing criticism delivered by the former British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George in his memoirs. In 1991, Denis Winter, a critic of Haig, acknowledged Edmonds' comprehensive understanding of British operations during the war but said, Andrew Green in Writing the Great War: Sir James Edmonds and the Official Histories 1915‚Äì1948 (2003) considered the volumes of the Official History for Gallipoli, the Somme, 3rd Ypres and the German March offensive of 1918 and concluded that Edmonds had been far more objective than others had given him credit for and that Edmonds was knighted in the 1928 Birthday Honours. In 1939, he became Secretary of the Cabinet Office Historical Section, following the resignation of Colonel E. Y. Daniel and on 15 November 1939, the section moved to Lytham St Annes, Lancashire where it stayed until April 1942, then moved to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Edmonds died at Brecon House, Sherborne, Dorset, after a brief illness.

Block did not name the computer in the paper. Overview In \\"Psychologism and Behaviorism,\\" Block argues that the internal mechanism of a system is important in determining whether that system is intelligent and claims to show that a non-intelligent system could pass the Turing test. Block asks us to imagine a conversation lasting any given amount of time. He states that given the nature of language, there are a finite number of syntactically- and grammatically-correct sentences that can be used to start a conversation. Consequently, there is a limit to how many \\"sensible\\" responses can be made to the first sentence, then to the second sentence, and so on until the conversation ends. Block then asks the reader to imagine a computer which had been programmed with all the sentences in theory, if not in practice. Block argues that such a machine could continue a conversation with a person on any topic because the computer would be programmed with every sentence that it was possible to use so the computer would be able to pass the Turing test despite the fact that ‚Äî according to Block ‚Äî it was not intelligent. Block says that this does not show that there is only one correct internal structure for generating intelligence but simply that some internal structures do not generate intelligence. The argument is related to John Searle's Chinese room. A recent objection to the Blockhead argument is Hanoch Ben-Yami (2005), who agrees that Block's machine lacks intelligence but compares its answers to a poetic dialogue in which one man is whispered romantic poetry to recite to his would-be lover as it answers only what it has been told to answer in advance by its programmers.

He was the creator of the Nord SS.10/SS.11 missiles. He attempted to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle on 22 August 1962, following de Gaulle's decision to accept Algerian independence. The attack made international headlines. Bastien-Thiry was the last person to be executed by firing squad in France. Though the assassination attempt almost claimed de Gaulle's life, the President and his entire entourage escaped injury. The event is depicted in Frederick Forsyth's novel, The Day of the Jackal (1971), and also in the film adaptation of the same name (1973), in which actor Jean Sorel plays Bastien- Thiry. Life Bastien-Thiry was born to a family of Catholic military officers in Lun√©ville, Meurthe-et-Moselle. His father had known de Gaulle in the 1930s and was a member of the Gaullist RPF. He attended the √âcole polytechnique, followed by the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de l'A√©ronautique, then entered the French Air Force where he specialized in the design of air- to-air missiles. In 1957, he was promoted to principal military air engineer. He was married to Genevi√®ve Lamirand whose father, Georges Lamirand (1899‚Äì1994), had been General Secretary of Youth from September 1940 to March 1943 in the government of Vichy France although the rest of the family was Free French.Jean Lacouture, Charles de Gaulle ‚Äì Le souverain 1959-1970, p. 276-279. He had three daughters with her. Assassination attempt Since 1848, French Algeria had been considered by the French state as an integral part of France. After having returned to power with the stated intention of maintaining the French D√©partements of Algeria, in September 1959, de Gaulle reversed his policy and supported the independence of Algeria. Until this time, Bastien-Thiry had been a Gaullist; now he became an opponent. Due to this new policy, two referenda on self-determination were held, the first in 1961 and the second in 1962 (the French √âvian Accords referendum). Bastien- Thiry, who was involved with the still-mysterious organization, \\"Vieil √âtat- Major\\", tried to make contact with the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS), a paramilitary group opposed to de Gaulle's policy and to the National Liberation Front (FLN). According to Dr P√©rez, OAS chief of intelligence and operations section (ORO), a messenger from Vieil √âtat Major, named Jean Bichon, had met Bastien-Thirly in Algiers, but that was as far as it got. Bastien-Thiry never had contact with the OAS organization and he never stated that his direct chief was Jean Bichon, arrested later. Bastien-Thiry led the most prominent of several assassination attempts on de Gaulle. He and his group of three shooters (Lt. Alain de La Tocnaye, Jacques Prevost, and Georges Watin) made preparations in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart. On 22 August 1962, while Bastien-Thiry functioned as a lookout, de Gaulle's car (a Citro√´n DS) and some nearby shops were raked with machine-gun fire. De Gaulle and his wife and entourage escaped, uninjured. After the attempt, holes from fourteen bullets were found in the president's vehicle, one of which barely missed the president's head; another twenty were found to have struck the nearby Caf√© Trianon; and an additional 187 spent shell casings were found on the pavement. De Gaulle was said to have credited the unusual resilience of the Citro√´n DS with saving his life: even though the shots had punctured two of the armoured tires, the car escaped at full speed. George, Patrick (22 July 2012). The Citro√´n DS Saved A French President's Life\\". Jalopnik. Retrieved 14 November 2015. Arrest and trial Using intelligence gained from the interrogation of Antoine Argoud, Bastien-Thiry was arrested when he came back from a mission in the United Kingdom. He was brought to trial before a military tribunal presided over by General Roger Gardet, which ran from 28 January to 4 March 1963. He was defended by a legal team consisting of attorneys Jacques Isorni, Richard Dupuy, Bernard Le Coroller, and Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour who was later a candidate for the presidency in 1965. While claiming that the death of de Gaulle would have been justified by the \\"genocide\\" of the European population of newly independent Algeria (a reference mainly to the Oran massacre of 1962) and the killing of several tens or hundreds of thousands of mostly pro-French Muslims (harkis) by the FLN,¬´Statement of Colonel Bastien- Thiry¬ª, 2 February 1963 , Cercle Jean Bastien-Thiry, bastien-thiry.com he claimed that while the other conspirators might admittedly have been trying to kill the head of state, he had only been attempting to capture de Gaulle so as to deliver him to a panel of sympathetic judges. Bastien-Thiry, who had been certified as \\"normal\\" by psychiatrists in spite of a history of clinical depression (caused by a period of overwork), was convicted and sentenced to death, as were two of his accomplices: Lt. de la Tocnaye and Prevost (a former volunteer in Korea and in Vietnam). The only would-be assassin to escape was OAS member Georges Watin (also known as \\"The Limp\\"), who died in February 1994 at age 71. =Possibility of clemency= As president, de Gaulle had the power of clemency. He pardoned those who fired the shots, but refused to pardon Bastien-Thiry, despite an appeal from Bastien-Thiry's father. Before the trial, the President expressed his intention to grant clemency to Bastien- Thiry, saying the \\"idiot\\" would \\"get off with twenty years and in five years I'll free him\\".Jean Lacouture, Charles de Gaulle ‚Äì Le souverain 1959-1970, p. 328. However, according to his son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, after the conspirators' conviction, de Gaulle stated his reasons for refusing to alter the sentence: # Bastien-Thiry had directed his subordinates to fire on a car in which there was an innocent woman present (Madame Yvonne de Gaulle). # He had endangered civilians, namely the Fillon family, who had been travelling in a car near that carrying de Gaulle. # He had brought foreigners, specifically three Hungarians, into the plot. # During his trial, he claimed he intended to kidnap de Gaulle, not kill him. Asked how he intended to confine the President, Bastien-Thiry replied, \\"We would just have taken away his spectacles and braces.\\" His defense lawyer was heard to mutter, \\"he has just signed his own death warrant,\\" as it was much anticipated that while de Gaulle might have pardoned an assassin, he would not pardon an assassin who publicly mocked him. # Finally, and most serious in de Gaulle's eyes, while the other conspirators did the actual firing and had thus placed themselves in some danger, Bastien-Thiry had only directed events from afar, acting as a lookout for the gunmen. =Execution= Fearing a plot to free Bastien-Thiry, the authorities devised what was probably the biggest security operation in French judicial history in order to take him from his cell to the place of execution.Bastien-Thiry by Jean-Pax Meffret. Two thousand policemen were posted along the route and thirty-five vehicles used. There was indeed such a plot, headed by Jean Cantelaube, one of de Gaulle's former security officers, but it had been abandoned. Cantelaube was later identified as an intelligence agent who provided information to Bastien-Thiry's organization.Cantelaube's notes quoted in Jean-Pax Meffret's book; attempt accomplice interviewed by Olivier Cazeaux. The execution took place only one week after the trial, which was unusually swift. Moreover, an appeal was about to be heard by the Conseil d'√âtat (French supreme public court) which might have overturned the sentence. Nonetheless, Bastien-Thiry, having refused a blindfold and clutching a rosary, was executed by firing squad at Fort d'Ivry on 11 March 1963.although in the description given in \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" (second paragraph of chapter 1), he was blindfolded He was thirty-five years old. That very evening, President de Gaulle offered a dinner party to the presidents of the special courts, including the one who sent Bastien-Thiry to his death. About Bastien-Thiry, de Gaulle said \\"The French need martyrs ... They must choose them carefully. I could have given them one of those idiotic generals playing ball in Tulle prison. I gave them Bastien-Thiry. They'll be able to make a martyr of him. He deserves it.\\"Lacouture, 329  See also  * Capital punishment in France  References   Sources   * Category:French aerospace engineers Category:√âcole Polytechnique alumni Category:Supa√©ro alumni Category:Corps de l'armement Category:1927 births Category:1963 deaths Category:1962 crimes in France Category:People from Lun√©ville Category:Failed assassins Category:Executed French people Category:People executed by the French Fifth Republic Category:People executed for attempted murder Category:People executed by France by firing squad Category:Executed people from Lorraine ","title":"Jean Bastien-Thiry"},{"id":"1134568","title":"Sister Fidelma mysteries"},{"id":"1134573","text":"Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) is a digital rights management (DRM) technology that restricts digital home technologies including DVD players and televisions by encrypting interconnections between devices.

Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith (Middleton Press 1991) In 1974 the bridge (crossing the railway line) at Avery Hill Road was widened to allow buses to cross it. This replaced a narrow iron bridge which only had a separate path on one side for pedestrians. The Beehive public house was rebuilt in 1897. Most of New Eltham's housing dates from the 1930s. A library was built in 1931. As part of London's Cold War civil defences, a rectangular windowless blockhouse was built in 1954 behind New Eltham library. It served as the Woolwich Borough Control and when Woolwich merged with Greenwich in 1965 it took over the role as the Greenwich Borough Control. The control was part of the South East London Group reporting to the Regional Group War HQ at Chislehurst and later to Pear Tree House.

It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the invasion of Normandy in 1944, and was intended to mislead German intelligence as to the location of General Bernard Montgomery. The operation was conceived by Dudley Clarke in early 1944 after he watched the film Five Graves to Cairo. Following the war M. E. Clifton James wrote a book about the operation, I Was Monty's Double. It was later adapted into a film, with James in the lead role. The German high command expected Montgomery (one of the best-known Allied commanders) to play a key role in any cross-channel bridgehead. Clarke and the other deception planners reasoned that a high-profile appearance outside the United Kingdom would suggest that an Allied invasion was not imminent. An appropriate look- alike was found, M. E. Clifton James, who spent a short time with Montgomery to familiarise himself with the general's mannerisms. On 26 May 1944, James flew first to Gibraltar and then to Algiers, making appearances where the Allies knew German intelligence agents would spot him. He then flew secretly to Cairo and remained in hiding until Montgomery's public appearance in Normandy following the invasion. The operation did not appear to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command. It was executed some time before D-Day, and in the mid of several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit. Background In preparation for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard. The overall aim of the plan was to confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group, a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was a small portion of Bodyguard conceived by Dudley Clarke. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception, forming a deception department in Cairo named 'A' Force. Clarke and 'A' Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning (a role that fell to the London Controlling Section), but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation. On a visit to Naples in January 1944 Clarke had seen the film Five Graves to Cairo, in which actor Miles Mander makes a brief appearance. The film involves one character impersonating another and Clarke suggested attempting the same trick in real life. He proposed an operation to mislead German commanders as to Montgomery's location in the days immediately before the Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune). Montgomery was one of the most prominent Allied commanders and the German high command expected him to be present for any invasion of France. Clarke hoped Montgomery's apparent presence in Gibraltar and Africa would lend support to the idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France, as part of Operation Vendetta, rather than across the Channel. While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and Ops (B) drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta. Operation Mander, the actor from Five Graves to Cairo, was located in Hollywood but found to be too tall in real life. Another look-alike was identified but before he could be drafted into the operation he broke a leg in a motorbike accident. Eventually, Lieutenant- Colonel J. V. B. Jervis-Reid, head of Ops (B), spotted a photograph of Meyrick Clifton James in the News Chronicle. James, an Australian, had spent 25 years as an actor before the war, and at the time was assigned to the Royal Army Pay Corps. Colonel David Niven, a well-known British actor, was asked to contact James and offer him a screen test for future army films. When he arrived at the meeting, James was told his true role. James was not a perfect stand-in for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight to make sure he did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms. Allied deceivers used their double agent network to circulate the idea that Montgomery would command ground forces during the invasion. Then, on 26 May 1944, James flew overnight from RAF Northolt to Gibraltar, where the Germans maintained an observation post overlooking the airport from across the Spanish border. The plane had to circle for an hour before landing to allow James, who had smuggled a bottle of gin onto the flight, to sober up. He then attended breakfast with the British governor, Sir Ralph Eastwood, before departing again for the airfield. The Allies had arranged for Ignacio Molina P√©rez, a Spanish envoy known to be a German spy, to visit Government House. After observing James's departure, P√©rez hurriedly crossed the border to place a call to his German handler. James then flew to Algiers, where he was publicly paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade for a few more days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region. Impact The impact of Copperhead is unclear. The visit was reported up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received requests for information about Montgomery's movements. There is no indication that Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this to the fact that the deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion. Another factor was that, in early May 1944, an uncontrolled agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on details of a meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts it does not appear that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint.Niv: The Authorized Biography of David Niven by Graham Lord, Orion Books, 2003. p. 123 The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture. James did not enjoy the experience. Although he received equivalent pay (¬£10 per day) to Montgomery during the operation, it had been a stressful assignment. Following Montgomery's public appearance on the Normandy beachhead, James flew back to England and resumed his role within the Pay Corps and was warned not to discuss the operation. Dennis Wheatley, in his memoirs, commented that he felt James had been treated \\"shabbily\\" for his efforts. Later depictions In 1954 James wrote an account of the operation, entitled I Was Monty's Double (published in the United States as The Counterfeit General). The British government made no attempt to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name. James starred as himself, alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent.

Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur is the largest town in Northwest Iceland and the second-largest town on the north coast of Iceland, with a population of 2,612. It is the centre for commerce and services in the district, and an important link in Iceland's food production. The population of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur has grown steadily in recent years, and its economy is relatively diverse. Economic mainstays are fisheries, dairy production, light industry and broad-based services such as computer and engineering operations, financials, consulting, design and printing. The natural hot pool located north of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur is mentioned in the Grettis saga.  Etymology  Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur got its name from the creek that runs through the land. The creek is named Sau√∞√°, and the name Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur indicates that this is the coast where Sau√∞√° meets the Arctic Ocean. Directly translated to English, the name would be 'Sheep-river-hook'.  History  = First settlements = Iceland was settled in the late 9th century, mostly by Scandinavian Vikings. The Skagafj√∂r√∞ur region had many settlers, who divided the land according to commonly acknowledged rules. The land where Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur stands was first taken by the Viking S√¶mundr Su√∞ureyski (\\"S√¶mundur from the South Islands\\". 'South Islands' is the name Vikings gave the Hebrides islands off the coast of Scotland), but as he was marking his land another Viking, called Skefill, successfully \\"stole\\" the land where the oldest part of the town is today. These settlers did not build their homes at Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur, and the current site of the town was not settled until about 1,000 years later. = Market and merchants = Docking ships in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur was not an easy task for sailors and merchants. Few natural harbors are to be found, especially on the west coast of the fjord, and most merchants docked at the trading posts of Hofs√≥s, Grafar√≥s and Kolku√≥s on the east coast of the fjord. During the Danish monopoly (1602‚Äì1787) Hofs√≥s was the only permitted trading post in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur. At that time the river H√©ra√∞sv√∂tn was a huge obstacle for those living on the west side of the fjord, and many people lost their lives crossing the river to reach the market. As the population on the west side of the valley grew, so did the need for an accessible market place; and several times privateers tried their luck by illegally trading from their ships by the shore of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur. In 1856 Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur became a permitted trading post, and merchants were allowed to trade from their ships. = The first inhabitants = In 1871 the first real settlement at Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur took place. The blacksmith √Årni √Årnason, with his wife Sigr√≠√∞ur Eggertsd√≥ttir and several children, settled there to provide blacksmith services to the growing farming community in this prosperous region. The couple also decided to sell drinks and overnight services; this part of the business grew fast and earned √Årni a new nickname, \\"√Årni Vert\\" or \\"innkeeper √Årni\\". In 1873 the first merchant settled in Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur. The shopkeeper Erlendur Hallsson built the second house here, trading from his living room. By 1900 around 400 inhabitants lived here, and the settlement was evolving into a fully formed village with a hospital, school and church. Climate Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur has a mild subarctic climate (K√∂ppen: Dfc) bordering on a tundra climate (ET). Average temperature year round in Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur is about 3.2 ¬∞C (37.5 ¬∞F), with an average low temperature of around -5 ¬∞C in the coldest months of the year (January‚ÄìFebruary). Being located in the North Atlantic, the region is quite windy. However severe storms are unusual. Average wind speed in the town of Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur is 6.7 m/s. with wind directions from North and South to South- west. The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm (20 inches) distributed fairly evenly over the year, although spring and early summer seems to be the driest season. Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur experiences midnight sun for 4 to 5 days around the time of the summer solstice.http://jan.moesen.nu/daylight- calculator/?location=Sau%C3%B0%C3%A1rkr%C3%B3kur%2C+Iceland&latitude;=&longitude;= This is due to atmospheric refraction since the town lies just south of the Arctic Circle.Although Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur doesn't experience polar night, the shortest length of daylight is 3 hours 1 minute, from 11:46 UTC until 14:47 UTC on the winter solstice.http://jan.moesen.nu/daylight- calculator/?location=Sau%C3%B0%C3%A1rkr%C3%B3kur%2C+Iceland&latitude;=&longitude;= Transport The town and neighbouring area is served by Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur Airport, although it does not have scheduled flights. The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Akureyri Airport, about away by road. The town is connected to the Route 1 via Varmahl√≠√∞ through route 75 or alternatively via Bl√∂ndu√≥s through routes 744 and 74 (when road conditions are suitable). Reykjav√≠k is about away by road.

It is located south of Blenheim, close to the mouths of the Awatere and Blind Rivers and the Lake Grassmere salt works. At the 2018 census, the town had a population of 552 people. Salt and lime are major local industries, and the Awatere Valley is a developing wine region. The town was named for a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Richard Seddon. Earthquakes Seddon has been close to the epicentres of several significant earthquakes. On the morning of 16 October 1848, Marlborough was struck by a damaging earthquake later estimated to be between magnitude 7.4 and 7.7. The epicentre of this earthquake was 45 km southeast of Seddon. On 23 April 1966, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake with an epicenter in Cook Strait, 40 km east of Seddon was most strongly felt in the town, damaging the chimney on almost every house in town. In July and August 2013 Seddon was closest settlement to the epicentres of a doublet earthquake event. First, in late July, a series of sizeable earthquakes struck the region over a period of a few days being felt strongly in Blenheim, Wellington and the rest of Central New Zealand, the strongest being a magnitude 6.5 and having its epicentre in Cook Strait. Then on 16 August 2013 a magnitude 6.6 earthquake with its epicentre under Lake Grassmere struck about 2:30 PM and was followed by a series of aftershocks over the next few hours, one of which was above magnitude 6 and several others above magnitude 5. This came just a few years after devastating earthquakes affected Christchurch, 285 km away.http://goo.gl/maps/9jBWG  Demographics  The Seddon settlement had a usual resident population of 552 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 63 people (12.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 60 people (12.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 300 males and 252 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.19 males per female. Of the total population, 99 people (17.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 93 (16.8%) were 15 to 29, 279 (50.5%) were 30 to 64, and 78 (14.1%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 78.8% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 17.4% MƒÅori, 12.5% Pacific peoples, 2.2% Asian, and 1.6% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). Education Seddon School is the sole school in the town. It is a coeducational full primary (year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of approximately . The nearest state secondary schools are Marlborough Boys' College and Marlborough Girls' College in Blenheim. Transport State Highway 1 passes through Seddon on its route between Blenheim and Christchurch. The Marlborough section of the Main North Line railway reached Seddon from Blenheim in October 1902. This also saw the construction of a combined road-rail bridge over the Awatere River north of the town, with the single-lane road below the rail. The bridge remained in service for road traffic until October 2007, when a new two-lane road bridge opened. Seddon was the southern terminus of the railway until the line was extended to Ward in April 1911; the full line through to Christchurch didn't open until December 1945. Today, Seddon is served by the Coastal Pacific train, which runs once daily each way during the summer months. A train derailment at Blind River, south of Seddon, on 25 February 1948, killed six people and injured 40 others.

Following his death, Glasgow Corporation acquired the galleries and collection, and for a time they were known as the Corporation Halls before reverting to their former owner's name. The Galleries housed Glasgow School of Art from 1869 to 1899. In October 1986, the shop frontage building housing the Galleries was ravaged by fire, but they re- opened in 1990 as the largest quality, climate-controlled, temporary exhibition gallery in Scotland. While Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum was closed for refurbishment between 2003 and 2006, the McLellan Galleries hosted a display of its best-loved works. The McLellan Galleries was then leased to the Glasgow School of Art as studio and storage space in preparation for the planned redevelopment of the Glasgow School of Art campus. Since 2012 there has been public discussion involving user organisations such as the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts with a view to re-establishing the McLellan Galleries as a major feature in Glasgow‚Äôs cultural life.

Arnoldi finds an approximation to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general (possibly non- Hermitian) matrices by constructing an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, which makes it particularly useful when dealing with large sparse matrices. The Arnoldi method belongs to a class of linear algebra algorithms that give a partial result after a small number of iterations, in contrast to so-called direct methods which must complete to give any useful results (see for example, Householder transformation). The partial result in this case being the first few vectors of the basis the algorithm is building. When applied to Hermitian matrices it reduces to the Lanczos algorithm. The Arnoldi iteration was invented by W. E. Arnoldi in 1951.W. E. Arnoldi, \\"The principle of minimized iterations in the solution of the matrix eigenvalue problem,\\" Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, volume 9, pages 17‚Äì29, 1951 Krylov subspaces and the power iteration An intuitive method for finding the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of a given m √ó m matrix A is the power iteration: starting with an arbitrary initial vector b, calculate Ab, A2b, A3b,‚Ä¶ normalizing the result after every application of the matrix A. This sequence converges to the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value, \\\\lambda_{1}. However, much potentially useful computation is wasted by using only the final result, A^{n-1}b. This suggests that instead, we form the so-called Krylov matrix: :K_{n} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}b & Ab & A^{2}b & \\\\cdots & A^{n-1}b \\\\end{bmatrix}. The columns of this matrix are not in general orthogonal, but we can extract an orthogonal basis, via a method such as Gram‚ÄìSchmidt orthogonalization. The resulting set of vectors is thus an orthogonal basis of the Krylov subspace, \\\\mathcal{K}_{n}. We may expect the vectors of this basis to span good approximations of the eigenvectors corresponding to the n largest eigenvalues, for the same reason that A^{n-1}b approximates the dominant eigenvector. The Arnoldi iteration The Arnoldi iteration uses the modified Gram‚ÄìSchmidt process to produce a sequence of orthonormal vectors, q1, q2, q3, ‚Ä¶, called the Arnoldi vectors, such that for every n, the vectors q1, ‚Ä¶, qn span the Krylov subspace \\\\mathcal{K}_n. Explicitly, the algorithm is as follows: * Start with an arbitrary vector q1 with norm 1. * Repeat for k = 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ ** q_k \\\\leftarrow Aq_{k-1} \\\\, ** for j from 1 to k ‚àí 1 *** h_{j,k-1} \\\\leftarrow q_j^* q_k \\\\, *** q_k \\\\leftarrow q_k - h_{j,k-1} q_j \\\\, ** h_{k,k-1} \\\\leftarrow \\\\q_k\\\\ \\\\, ** q_k \\\\leftarrow \\\\frac{q_k}{h_{k,k-1}} \\\\, The j-loop projects out the component of q_k in the directions of q_1,\\\\dots,q_{k-1}. This ensures the orthogonality of all the generated vectors. The algorithm breaks down when qk is the zero vector. This happens when the minimal polynomial of A is of degree k. In most applications of the Arnoldi iteration, including the eigenvalue algorithm below and GMRES, the algorithm has converged at this point. Every step of the k-loop takes one matrix-vector product and approximately 4mk floating point operations. In the programming language python: import numpy as np def arnoldi_iteration(A, b, n: int): \\"\\"\\"Computes a basis of the (n + 1)-Krylov subspace of A: the space spanned by {b, Ab, ..., A^n b}.

Q[:, k + 1] = q else: # If that happens, stop iterating. return Q, h return Q, h Properties of the Arnoldi iteration Let Qn denote the m-by-n matrix formed by the first n Arnoldi vectors q1, q2, ‚Ä¶, qn, and let Hn be the (upper Hessenberg) matrix formed by the numbers hj,k computed by the algorithm: : H_n = Q_n^* A Q_n. \\\\, The orthogonalization method has to be specifically chosen such that the lower Arnoldi/Krylov components are removed from higher Krylov vectors. As A q_i can be expressed in terms of q1, ‚Ä¶, qi+1 by construction, they are orthogonal to qi+2, ‚Ä¶, qn, We then have : H_n = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_{1,1} & h_{1,2} & h_{1,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{1,n}  h_{2,1} & h_{2,2} & h_{2,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{2,n}  0 & h_{3,2} & h_{3,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{3,n}  \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & h_{n,n-1} & h_{n,n} \\\\end{bmatrix}. The matrix Hn can be viewed as A in the subspace \\\\mathcal{K}_n with the Arnoldi vectors as an orthogonal basis; A is orthogonally projected onto \\\\mathcal{K}_n. The matrix Hn can be characterized by the following optimality condition. The characteristic polynomial of Hn minimizes p(A)q12 among all monic polynomials of degree n. This optimality problem has a unique solution if and only if the Arnoldi iteration does not break down. The relation between the Q matrices in subsequent iterations is given by : A Q_n = Q_{n+1} \\\\tilde{H}_n where : \\\\tilde{H}_n = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_{1,1} & h_{1,2} & h_{1,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{1,n}  h_{2,1} & h_{2,2} & h_{2,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{2,n}  0 & h_{3,2} & h_{3,3} & \\\\cdots & h_{3,n}  \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & & 0 & h_{n,n-1} & h_{n,n}  0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & 0 & h_{n+1,n} \\\\end{bmatrix} is an (n+1)-by-n matrix formed by adding an extra row to Hn. Finding eigenvalues with the Arnoldi iteration The idea of the Arnoldi iteration as an eigenvalue algorithm is to compute the eigenvalues in the Krylov subspace. The eigenvalues of Hn are called the Ritz eigenvalues. Since Hn is a Hessenberg matrix of modest size, its eigenvalues can be computed efficiently, for instance with the QR algorithm, or somewhat related, Francis's algorithm. Also Francis's algorithm itself can be considered to be related to power iterations, operating on nested Krylov subspace. In fact, the most basic form of Francis's algorithm appears to be to choose b to be equal to Ae1, and extending n to the full dimension of A. Improved versions include one or more shifts, and higher powers of A may be applied in a single steps. This is an example of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. It is often observed in practice that some of the Ritz eigenvalues converge to eigenvalues of A. Since Hn is n-by-n, it has at most n eigenvalues, and not all eigenvalues of A can be approximated. Typically, the Ritz eigenvalues converge to the largest eigenvalues of A. To get the smallest eigenvalues of A, the inverse (operation) of A should be used instead. This can be related to the characterization of Hn as the matrix whose characteristic polynomial minimizes p(A)q1 in the following way. A good way to get p(A) small is to choose the polynomial p such that p(x) is small whenever x is an eigenvalue of A. Hence, the zeros of p (and thus the Ritz eigenvalues) will be close to the eigenvalues of A. However, the details are not fully understood yet. This is in contrast to the case where A is symmetric. In that situation, the Arnoldi iteration becomes the Lanczos iteration, for which the theory is more complete. Implicitly restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM) Due to practical storage consideration, common implementations of Arnoldi methods typically restart after some number of iterations. One major innovation in restarting was due to Lehoucq and Sorensen who proposed the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method. They also implemented the algorithm in a freely available software package called ARPACK. This has spurred a number of other variations including Implicitly Restarted Lanczos method. It also influenced how other restarted methods are analyzed. Theoretical results have shown that convergence improves with an increase in the Krylov subspace dimension n. However, an a-priori value of n which would lead to optimal convergence is not known. Recently a dynamic switching strategy has been proposed which fluctuates the dimension n before each restart and thus leads to acceleration in the rate of convergence.

She was friend to other important writers of the time, such as DH Lawrence, George Bernard Shaw, Katherine Mansfield and Dylan Thomas. She lived a transnational, unconventional life, moving between Australia, England and France. She is remembered as a modernist figure and feminist writer, although one who did not command sustained critical attention in her lifetime, although her poetry did earn her a major reputation at the time of writing and had been frequently anthologised. Her literary reputation has improved since her death and she is now regarded as an important early 20th-century woman writer. Early life She was born in Wimbledon, London and brought up in Australia, mostly in Brisbane and Sydney. Her pen-names imply an Australian self- identification: \\"Wickham\\" was adopted after a Brisbane street. She had used \\"John Oland\\" for her first collection, which alludes to the Jenolan Caves in New South Wales. Wickham returned to London in 1904, where she took singing lessons and won a drama scholarship (at the future RADA, just founded). She pursued her singing in Paris in 1905 with Jean de Reszke, the Polish tenor. In 1906 she married Patrick Hepburn, a City of London solicitor with interests in Romanesque architecture, and later astronomy. They had four sons. They lived first in central London, then in family houses in Hampstead: Downshire Hill from 1909, and then from 1919 a house on Parliament Hill which would be her permanent home. She became involved in the contemporary philanthropic movement concerned with maternal care, at St Pancras Hospital. Career and strife Her first collection, Songs by John Oland was published in 1911, and had a particular focus on the conflict between men and women, depicted in such poems as 'Song of the Low-Caste Wife', 'Surrender' and 'Divorce'. Other subjects included the ambition to be a writer, a post-Darwin loss of religious faith, and motherhood. Her husband was angered at her publishing a book, and subsequently also captured the interest of one of his friends in his astronomical circles. He was known to be possessive, and generally unsupportive of her singing and writing, which may have been a major factor leading to her breakdown and psychiatric hospitalisation. She was in a private psychiatric hospital in 1911 for a period of about six weeks. In her autobiographical writing she represented this occurrence as related to her husband's hostility to her writing of poetry. It followed a violent quarrel. Given the complexities of her emotional life at the time, post-natal (with two miscarriages) and in relation to parental conflicts, there would have been other factors at play, but this kind of hostility was not unusual towards pioneering women writers of the time. Shortly afterwards, she met Harold Monro at his Poetry Bookshop. He encouraged her writing, and she published a second collection in 1915. This was the effective start of thirty years during which she mixed with literati in London (and later inParis). She carried on a bohemian lifestyle, in parallel with the home life she often felt so hindered by. During World War I Patrick Hepburn spent time away from home, joining the RNAS. During this time, Anna struck up a friendship with D. H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda. She also knew H. D., with whom she'd had a brief affair, although that was one of several contacts which apparently failed in sympathy. Her relations with the novelist Eliot Bliss are said to have been intimate.McFarlin Library, Eliot Bliss Collections, note by Alison M. Greenlee Retrieved 17 September 2015 . Her third son Richard died of scarlet fever aged four. She spent a period in the early 1920s in Paris, after his death, to recuperate. There she developed a passion for Natalie Barney. It was not returned in the same way, but they sustained a correspondence (later published as Postcards and Poems). She met some leading Paris figures in anglophone modernism of the time. It is believed that her marriage was in crisis during 1926, and she was separated from her husband until 1928. He died in an accident, on holiday, in 1929. During the 1930s she was well known in literary London, and wrote a great deal of poetry (much of which was later lost in war damage) and much of which remained unpublished. She did find support from the somewhat louche John Gawsworth, who in 1936 put out a Richards Press collection of her work. An extended autobiographical essay Prelude to a Spring Clean dates from 1935. That was the year in which she supported the just- married Dylan Thomas and Caitlin, and then quarrelled with them. She took her own life suicide during the winter of 1947.

L√ºbecker Maschinenbau Gesellschaft in L√ºbeck built her in 1940 for the Kn√∂hr and Burchard shipping company of Hamburg. In 1961 Kn√∂hr and Burchard sold her to buyers who renamed her Magdalene and registered her in Panama. In 1965 she was renamed Old Warrior. She was scrapped in Yugoslavia in 1974. Thielbek is notable for having been sunk by RAF aircraft on 3 May 1945, killing 2,750 people aboard. She was at anchor in the Bay of L√ºbeck with the passenger ships and the , which were sunk in the same air raid. At the time Cap Arcona and Thielbek were crowded with prisoners from the Neuengamme, Stutthof, and Mittelbau-Dora concentration camps. The commander of the Gestapo in Hamburg later revealed that the prisoners were to be killed, possibly by scuttling the ships with the prisoners still aboard. Background On 17 April 1945 Thielbek was told she was to prepare for a \\"special operation\\". The next day the SS summoned Thielbeks Captain John Jacobsen, and Cap Arconas Captain Heinrich Bertram to a conference at which they were ordered to embark concentration camp prisoners. Both captains refused, and Jacobsen was relieved of his command. The order to transfer the prisoners from the camps to the prison ships came from Hamburg Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann, who in turn was acting on orders from Berlin. Kaufmann later claimed during a War Crimes Tribunal that the prisoners were destined for Sweden, but at the same trial Georg- Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, commander of the Hamburg Gestapo, said that the prisoners were in fact to be killed on Himmler's orders. Embarkation of prisoners began on 20 April, with the Swedish Red Cross present. The ship's water supply was insufficient for so many people and 20 to 30 prisoners died daily. The prisoners, with the exception of political prisoners, remained aboard for two or three days before being transferred to Cap Arcona by the cargo ship . Sinking Between the two attacks on Cap Arcona, nine Hawker Typhoon aircraft of No. 198 Squadron RAF stationed at Plantl√ºnne attacked Thielbek and Deutschland, five aircraft firing rockets at Deutschland and 4 at Thielbek. Numerous cannon shells and 32 rockets were fired at Thielbek. She caught fire, developed a 30 degree list to starboard, and sank 20 minutes after being attacked. Of the 2,800 prisoners aboard Thielbek, only 50 survived the attack. Subsequent career In 1949, four years after her sinking, Thielbek was refloated. Human remains found aboard her were buried in the Cap Arcona cemetery at Neustadt in Holstein. She remained in Kn√∂hr and Burchard service until 1961 when she was sold, renamed Magdalene, and registered under the Panamanian flag of convenience. In 1965 she was renamed Old Warrior.

He studied at the Juilliard School of Music with David Diamond and Vincent Persichetti, gaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. The English composer-pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji also expressed interest in Liebermann's early work, having critiqued the young composer's Piano Sonata in a private exchange between the two; Liebermann's Concerto for Piano, op. 12 would be dedicated to Sorabji.Roberge, p. 367. His most recorded works are the Sonata for Flute and Piano (1987), the Gargoyles for piano (1989) and the Concerto for Flute and Orchestra (1992). Other notable works include a sonata for flute and guitar (1988), four cello sonatas (most recently 2008) the second piano concerto (1992), the opera The Picture of Dorian Gray (1996),US Opera. a second symphony (2000), a trumpet concerto (2000), a violin concerto (2001), Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini for piano and orchestra (2001), and the opera Miss Lonelyhearts (2006) which was commissioned as part of the festivities surrounding the centennial of the Juilliard School. He was also commissioned by the Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation to compose \\"Three Lullabies\\" for two pianos. Lowell has also written the music for the ballet Frankenstein, a co-production between The Royal Ballet and San Francisco Ballet (2016). His music combines elements of traditional tonality and structure with more adventurous harmonies.

Biography Marks was born into a Polish- Jewish family in S≈Çonim, then in the Russian Partition of Poland, which after 1945 became part of Belarus. He emigrated to England around 1882 and moved to Leeds, where a company called Barran was known to employ Jewish immigrants. He married Hannah Cohen at the Great Synagogue on Belgrave Street, Leeds, in 1886. His date of birth is unknown; his naturalisation papers say 1859, but his age on his marriage certificate suggests 1863 or 1864.Chislett p. 8. Marks met Isaac Dewhirst, the owner of a Leeds warehouse, in 1884. A deal was arranged, whereby Marks agreed to buy goods from Dewhirst and sell them in nearby villages. The venture was a success and enabled Marks to raise enough capital to establish a stall in Leeds' open market. At his stall, he used the slogan \\"Don't Ask the Price ‚Äì it's a Penny\\". He also sold goods at Castleford and Wakefield markets. Marks also made the decision to rent an area at the new covered market in Leeds, which traded six days of the week. Over the next few years, Marks expanded his business and opened similar stalls in covered market halls all over Yorkshire and Lancashire. =Marks & Spencer= In 1894, Marks decided that if he was to expand the business further, he would need a business partner. He initially approached Bernard Sloman, the famous retired \\"whistler\\", who operated a stall in Leeds market selling soap, then Isaac Dewhirst, who also decided against the offer but suggested that his cashier Thomas Spencer might be interested. Spencer decided that the ¬£300 () required for a half-share in the business would be a good investment. The running of the business was split between Spencer, who managed the office and warehouse, and Marks, who continued to run the market stalls. Spencer had developed some important contacts while working for Isaac Dewhirst, and these allowed him to get the best prices for goods by dealing directly with the manufacturers. Together, Spencer and Marks were able to open stores in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Bristol, Hull, Sunderland and Cardiff. A new warehouse in Manchester was built in 1897. This store became the centre of a business empire that, by then, included thirty-six branches. New stores had been built in Bradford, Leicester, Northampton, Preston, and Swansea. London had a total of seven branches. On 5 May 1897, Marks was naturalised as a British subject. In 1903, Marks & Spencer became a limited company. Spencer's original ¬£300 investment had grown to a value of ¬£15,000 () and he retired later that year. Michael Marks continued to develop the business until his death at the age of 48, at Knoll House, 396 Bury New Road, Salford, on 31 December 1907. He was buried in the Old Jewish cemetery (Hebrew Congregation), Crumpsall, in plot number 1917, on 2 January 1908. In the 1930s, long after the death of Marks, his son Simon Marks, later the first Baron Marks of Broughton, laid the foundations for a long tradition. He introduced the \\"St Michael\\" brand name in honour of his father, which was in use until 2000.

There is a vast number of examples for block codes, many of which have a wide range of practical applications. The abstract definition of block codes is conceptually useful because it allows coding theorists, mathematicians, and computer scientists to study the limitations of all block codes in a unified way. Such limitations often take the form of bounds that relate different parameters of the block code to each other, such as its rate and its ability to detect and correct errors. Examples of block codes are Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes, Hamming codes, Hadamard codes, Expander codes, Golay codes, and Reed‚ÄìMuller codes. These examples also belong to the class of linear codes, and hence they are called linear block codes. More particularly, these codes are known as algebraic block codes, or cyclic block codes, because they can be generated using boolean polynomials. Algebraic block codes are typically hard-decoded using algebraic decoders. The term block code may also refer to any error-correcting code that acts on a block of k bits of input data to produce n bits of output data (n,k). Consequently, the block coder is a memoryless device. Under this definition codes such as turbo codes, terminated convolutional codes and other iteratively decodable codes (turbo-like codes) would also be considered block codes. A non-terminated convolutional encoder would be an example of a non- block (unframed) code, which has memory and is instead classified as a tree code. This article deals with \\"algebraic block codes\\".  The block code and its parameters  Error-correcting codes are used to reliably transmit digital data over unreliable communication channels subject to channel noise. When a sender wants to transmit a possibly very long data stream using a block code, the sender breaks the stream up into pieces of some fixed size. Each such piece is called message and the procedure given by the block code encodes each message individually into a codeword, also called a block in the context of block codes. The sender then transmits all blocks to the receiver, who can in turn use some decoding mechanism to (hopefully) recover the original messages from the possibly corrupted received blocks. The performance and success of the overall transmission depends on the parameters of the channel and the block code. Formally, a block code is an injective mapping :C:\\\\Sigma^k \\\\to \\\\Sigma^n. Here, \\\\Sigma is a finite and nonempty set and k and n are integers. The meaning and significance of these three parameters and other parameters related to the code are described below. = The alphabet Œ£ = The data stream to be encoded is modeled as a string over some alphabet \\\\Sigma. The size \\\\Sigma of the alphabet is often written as q. If q=2, then the block code is called a binary block code. In many applications it is useful to consider q to be a prime power, and to identify \\\\Sigma with the finite field \\\\mathbb F_q. = The message length k = Messages are elements m of \\\\Sigma^k, that is, strings of length k. Hence the number k is called the message length or dimension of a block code. = The block length n = The block length n of a block code is the number of symbols in a block. Hence, the elements c of \\\\Sigma^n are strings of length n and correspond to blocks that may be received by the receiver. Hence they are also called received words. If c=C(m) for some message m, then c is called the codeword of m. = The rate R = The rate of a block code is defined as the ratio between its message length and its block length: :R=k/n. A large rate means that the amount of actual message per transmitted block is high. In this sense, the rate measures the transmission speed and the quantity 1-R measures the overhead that occurs due to the encoding with the block code. It is a simple information theoretical fact that the rate cannot exceed 1 since data cannot in general be losslessly compressed. Formally, this follows from the fact that the code C is an injective map. = The distance d = The distance or minimum distance of a block code is the minimum number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ, and the relative distance \\\\delta is the fraction d/n. Formally, for received words c_1,c_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma^n, let \\\\Delta(c_1,c_2) denote the Hamming distance between c_1 and c_2, that is, the number of positions in which c_1 and c_2 differ. Then the minimum distance d of the code C is defined as :d := \\\\min_{m_1,m_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma^k\\\\atop m_1 eq m_2} \\\\Delta[C(m_1),C(m_2)]. Since any code has to be injective, any two codewords will disagree in at least one position, so the distance of any code is at least 1. Besides, the distance equals the minimum weight for linear block codes because: :\\\\min_{m_1,m_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma^k\\\\atop m_1 eq m_2} \\\\Delta[C(m_1),C(m_2)] = \\\\min_{m_1,m_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma^k\\\\atop m_1 eq m_2} \\\\Delta[\\\\mathbf{0},C(m_1)+C(m_2)] = \\\\min_{m\\\\in\\\\Sigma^k\\\\atop m eq\\\\mathbf{0}} w[C(m)] = w_\\\\min. A larger distance allows for more error correction and detection. For example, if we only consider errors that may change symbols of the sent codeword but never erase or add them, then the number of errors is the number of positions in which the sent codeword and the received word differ. A code with distance allows the receiver to detect up to d-1 transmission errors since changing d-1 positions of a codeword can never accidentally yield another codeword. Furthermore, if no more than (d-1)/2 transmission errors occur, the receiver can uniquely decode the received word to a codeword. This is because every received word has at most one codeword at distance (d-1)/2. If more than (d-1)/2 transmission errors occur, the receiver cannot uniquely decode the received word in general as there might be several possible codewords. One way for the receiver to cope with this situation is to use list decoding, in which the decoder outputs a list of all codewords in a certain radius. = Popular notation = The notation (n,k,d)_q describes a block code over an alphabet \\\\Sigma of size q, with a block length n, message length k, and distance d. If the block code is a linear block code, then the square brackets in the notation [n,k,d]_q are used to represent that fact. For binary codes with q=2, the index is sometimes dropped. For maximum distance separable codes, the distance is always d=n-k+1, but sometimes the precise distance is not known, non-trivial to prove or state, or not needed. In such cases, the d-component may be missing. Sometimes, especially for non-block codes, the notation (n,M,d)_q is used for codes that contain M codewords of length n. For block codes with messages of length k over an alphabet of size q, this number would be M=q^k.  Examples  As mentioned above, there are a vast number of error- correcting codes that are actually block codes. The first error-correcting code was the Hamming(7,4) code, developed by Richard W. Hamming in 1950. This code transforms a message consisting of 4 bits into a codeword of 7 bits by adding 3 parity bits. Hence this code is a block code. It turns out that it is also a linear code and that it has distance 3. In the shorthand notation above, this means that the Hamming(7,4) code is a [7,4,3]_2 code. Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes are a family of [n,k,d]_q codes with d=n-k+1 and q being a prime power. Rank codes are family of [n,k,d]_q codes with d \\\\leq n-k+1. Hadamard codes are a family of [n,k,d]_2 codes with n=2^{k-1} and d=2^{k-2}.  Error detection and correction properties  A codeword c \\\\in \\\\Sigma^ncould be considered as a point in the n-dimension space \\\\Sigma^n and the code \\\\mathcal{C} is the subset of \\\\Sigma^n. A code \\\\mathcal{C} has distance d means that \\\\forall c\\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}, there is no other codeword in the Hamming ball centered at c with radius d-1, which is defined as the collection of n-dimension words whose Hamming distance to c is no more than d-1. Similarly, \\\\mathcal{C} with (minimum) distance d has the following properties: * \\\\mathcal{C} can detect d-1 errors : Because a codeword c is the only codeword in the Hamming ball centered at itself with radius d-1, no error pattern of d-1 or fewer errors could change one codeword to another. When the receiver detects that the received vector is not a codeword of \\\\mathcal{C}, the errors are detected (but no guarantee to correct). * \\\\mathcal{C} can correct \\\\textstyle\\\\left\\\\lfloor {{d-1} \\\\over 2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor errors. Because a codeword c is the only codeword in the Hamming ball centered at itself with radius d-1, the two Hamming balls centered at two different codewords respectively with both radius \\\\textstyle\\\\left \\\\lfloor {{d-1} \\\\over 2}\\\\right \\\\rfloor do not overlap with each other. Therefore, if we consider the error correction as finding the codeword closest to the received word y, as long as the number of errors is no more than \\\\textstyle\\\\left \\\\lfloor {{d-1} \\\\over 2}\\\\right \\\\rfloor, there is only one codeword in the hamming ball centered at y with radius \\\\textstyle\\\\left \\\\lfloor {{d-1} \\\\over 2}\\\\right \\\\rfloor, therefore all errors could be corrected. * In order to decode in the presence of more than (d-1)/2 errors, list-decoding or maximum likelihood decoding can be used. * \\\\mathcal{C} can correct d-1 erasures. By erasure it means that the position of the erased symbol is known. Correcting could be achieved by q-passing decoding : In i^{th} passing the erased position is filled with the i^{th} symbol and error correcting is carried out. There must be one passing that the number of errors is no more than \\\\textstyle\\\\left \\\\lfloor {{d-1} \\\\over 2}\\\\right \\\\rfloor and therefore the erasures could be corrected.  Lower and upper bounds of block codes  Hamming limit thumb720px There are theoretical limits (such as the Hamming limit), but another question is which codes can actually constructed. It is like packing spheres in a box in many dimensions. This diagram shows the constructible codes, which are linear and binary. The x axis shows the number of protected symbols k, the y axis the number of needed check symbols n‚Äìk. Plotted are the limits for different Hamming distances from 1 (unprotected) to 34. Marked with dots are perfect codes: = Family of codes = C =\\\\\\\\{C_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\ge1} is called family of codes, where C_i is an (n_i,k_i,d_i)_q code with monotonic increasing n_i. Rate of family of codes is defined as R(C)=\\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty}{k_i \\\\over n_i} Relative distance of family of codes is defined as \\\\delta(C)=\\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty}{d_i \\\\over n_i} To explore the relationship between R(C) and \\\\delta(C), a set of lower and upper bounds of block codes are known. = Hamming bound = : R \\\\le 1- {1 \\\\over n} \\\\cdot \\\\log_{q} \\\\cdot \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\left\\\\lfloor {{\\\\delta \\\\cdot n-1}\\\\over 2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor}\\\\binom{n}{i}(q-1)^i\\\\right] = Singleton bound = The Singleton bound is that the sum of the rate and the relative distance of a block code cannot be much larger than 1: : R + \\\\delta \\\\le 1+\\\\frac{1}{n}. In other words, every block code satisfies the inequality k+d \\\\le n+1 . Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes are non-trivial examples of codes that satisfy the singleton bound with equality. = Plotkin bound = For q=2, R+2\\\\delta\\\\le1. In other words, k + 2d \\\\le n.

In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize. Take a bunch of pennies flat on the table and push them together. The result is a hexagon pattern like a bee's nest. But block codes rely on more dimensions which cannot easily be visualized. The powerful Golay code used in deep space communications uses 24 dimensions. If used as a binary code (which it usually is), the dimensions refer to the length of the codeword as defined above. The theory of coding uses the N-dimensional sphere model. For example, how many pennies can be packed into a circle on a tabletop or in 3 dimensions, how many marbles can be packed into a globe. Other considerations enter the choice of a code. For example, hexagon packing into the constraint of a rectangular box will leave empty space at the corners. As the dimensions get larger, the percentage of empty space grows smaller. But at certain dimensions, the packing uses all the space and these codes are the so-called perfect codes. There are very few of these codes. Another property is the number of neighbors a single codeword may have. Again, consider pennies as an example. First we pack the pennies in a rectangular grid. Each penny will have 4 near neighbors (and 4 at the corners which are farther away). In a hexagon, each penny will have 6 near neighbors. Respectively, in three and four dimensions, the maximum packing is given by the 12-face and 24-cell with 12 and 24 neighbors, respectively. When we increase the dimensions, the number of near neighbors increases very rapidly. In general, the value is given by the kissing numbers. The result is that the number of ways for noise to make the receiver choose a neighbor (hence an error) grows as well. This is a fundamental limitation of block codes, and indeed all codes. It may be harder to cause an error to a single neighbor, but the number of neighbors can be large enough so the total error probability actually suffers.

It was initially released in 1981, and a second release followed in 1983 which was a re-recording of the first one done in May 1981. The album featured a Middle Eastern rhythm section and was produced by Corsican bassist Philippe Quilichini. This was Nico's only album not to feature John Cale.  Background  After the release of The End... in 1974, Nico's partnership with Island Records ended, and for the next year, she spent the majority of her time in New York City without a recording contract. During that time, she appeared in a series of Philippe Garrel films. Nico continued to write new songs and perform intermittently. \\"Purple Lips,\\" featured in her solo sets as early as March 1975, was also performed on French television in April 1975. Its lyrics were recited by Nico in the Philippe Garrel film, Le Berceau de Cristal (1976). The earliest performance of \\"Genghis Khan\\" was recorded on August 6, 1975, and \\"Henry Hudson\\" began appearing in setlists in February 1977. By March 1978, after \\"The Sphinx\\" was also introduced into her set, Nico titled the album Drama of Exile and attempted a new style at odds with her previous harmonium-based sound. Nico continued to write and had enough songs ready to record the album in 1981.  Recording and release  In 1981, executive producer Nadette Duget, Philippe Quilichini's girlfriend, lived together with Nico in London. Duget had heroin connections and supported her own mild drug consumption, as well as Quilichini's and Nico's more serious addictions. Aura Records offered to finance one album recorded in London and produced by Philippe Quilichini. Contracts were drawn up, Aura advanced the production costs, and recording began almost immediately in April or May 1981. Recorded at Gooseberry Studios in Tulse Hill, London, with a band composed of Quilichini, French-Iranian guitarist, oriental string instrument expert Muhammad Hadi, drummer Steve Cordonna, Ian Dury's sax player Davey Payne, percussionist J.J. Johnson of Wayne County's Electric Chairs, and Andy Clark who previously played keyboards on David Bowie's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) album. Sessions were attended by French journalist Bruno Blum, a friend of J.J. Johnson's, who later published the inside story in French rock magazine Best. The original album was plagued by suspicious circumstances. There are different versions of the story, and the truth remains ambiguous. With the album nearly finished and following a disagreement over money, Aaron Sixx, the head of Aura at the time, allegedly received a tip-off from the studio that Nadette Duget (Nico's unofficial manager) had arranged to steal the master tapes from the studio and sell them without reimbursing Aura, but since Sixx had a signed contract with Duget and Quilichini, Sixx was able to take possession of all the multitrack, unmixed tapes. A legal battle ensued which reportedly lasted almost three years. Duget claimed Nico had not signed the contract which was true, but since Aura had paid out considerable sums in production costs, they owned the recordings.  Second recording and release  Duget, Quilichini, and photographer Antoine Giacomoni moved to a Linden Gardens basement flat in Notting Hill Gate, London. Violin player Thierry Matioszek was added to the lineup. Nico then recorded \\"S√£eta\\" and \\"Vegas,\\" also produced by Quilichini which was released on the London Flicknife Records label in 1981. Supported by Nico and the musicians, Duget and Quilichini began recording the entire Drama of Exile album again. Meanwhile, a mix of the unfinished first recording of the Drama of Exile album was released by Aaron Sixx on the Aura Records label in late 1981, with the date written on the back cover. This was allegedly done without the consent of Nico or the musicians and producers. The album cover was reported to have illegally used an Antoine Giacomoni color photograph. Furthermore, some of the musicians and mixing engineers were allegedly not credited, but Philippe Quilichini was still credited as producer. Completed over the summer at Music Works studio in London, the second recording of the album was mixed by producer Quilichini and released a few months later on the Paris indie label Invisible Records. This version of the album features photographs taken by Matioszek and Giacomoni of Nico, her son Ari, and Quilichini on the inner sleeve. The album cover was a large, black \\"N\\" with a white background and a nod to Corsican French emperor Napoleon who ended his life in exile. According to Bruno Blum's 1982 review, the new version was well mixed and unquestionably superior. It also included two extra tracks, S√£eta and Vegas. False stories of the Aura label having released the only official album with Nico's consent and of Quilichini having secretly copied the first version of the album tapes to remix later emerged: The re-recorded album was mixed by the original producer Philippe Quilichini and issued on Invisible Records in the spring of 1982. Deeply hurt by the legal battle and the fate of his work, Philippe Quilichini became involved with heroin and died in 1983. Nadette Duget left London permanently and flew back to Corsica where she died of anorexia a few months later. This left Aaron Sixx to further release the incomplete first version in the Netherlands and Sweden only with Nico's permissionSee: this page from a fan-site, which displays information of all releases of the original version. several months after the debacle with the masters. The original version of the LP was released on CD for the first time in Germany by Line Records in 1988. Shortly after, Nico died. The album was released in England by Great Expectations Records in 1989 and in the United States by Cleopatra Records in 1993. The original recording received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars. Rolling Stone gave a mostly favorable review, while Trouser Press received the album poorly.  Musical style  Drama of Exile has been described as \\"a tentative foray into post-punk\\". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, the author writes, \\"Drama of Exile pairs [Nico] with a thin new wave band that wouldn't have sounded out-of-place on, say, Rough Trade.\\" Nico and the album were covered in Dave Thompson's book on gothic rock, The Dark Reign of Gothic Rock.

The FN F2000 is a 5.56√ó45mm NATO bullpup rifle, designed by FN Herstal in Belgium. The F2000 made its debut in March 2001 at the IDEX defence exhibition held in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. As of early 2019, the F2000 is removed from the FN international and US websites. Design details The F2000 is a modular weapon system; its principal component is a compact 5.56√ó45mm NATO-caliber assault rifle in a bullpup configuration. The F2000 is a selective fire weapon operating from a closed bolt. The rifle consists of two main assemblies: the barreled receiver group and the frame, coupled together by means of an axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL- STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, return mechanism and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard. =Features= The F2000 is a gas-operated, fully automatic and ambidextrous bullpup rifle. Both the safety system and trigger mechanism were adopted from the P90 personal defense weapon; the selector toggle is a rotating disc located below the trigger. The fire selector doubles as the weapon's manual safety and secures the firearm against accidental discharge (the selector/safety disc has 3 settings: \\"S\\"‚Äîsafe, \\"1\\"‚Äîsemi-automatic mode, \\"A\\"‚Äîfully automatic fire). The \\"safe\\" setting disables the trigger. The hammers, group pins, and springs are steel while all other components are nylon injection molding. The shell of the rifle is made of composite materials. The F2000 is fed from standard NATO box magazines (STANAG 4179) with a 30-round cartridge capacity using 5.56√ó45mm ammunition. The magazine catch/release button is installed symmetrically in the pistol grip, in front of the magazine; the magazine catch is operated by an oversized actuator useful when wearing NBC gloves. The F2000 is not configured from the factory to have a drop-free magazine system due to the friction from the removable dust gaskets. The magazine needs to be pulled out manually. The rifle does not have a hold-open device; the bolt does not stay back after the last round is fired. The cocking handle is placed on the left side of the receiver, just above the handguard, and can be operated by left-handed shooters. There are no access points for the possible ingress of dirt or debris; the cocking handle slot is sealed. The weapon's primary sight is a telescopic sight with a fixed 1.6√ó magnification (the reticle also enables use in low-light conditions) contained in a plastic housing above the receiver (mounted on the MIL-STD-1913 rail), the secondary sight is a non-adjustable fixed notch and front blade, molded into the optical sight housing cover. The sight cover and sight module can be quickly removed to reveal the Picatinny rail. The rifle's chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated to retain accuracy after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel also features a flash suppressor with an angled cut at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: \\"normal\\" for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and \\"adverse\\"‚Äîused to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low-pressure ammunition. =Operating mechanism= This selective fire weapon is a gas-operated design utilizing a short-stroke piston system driven by propellant gases diverted into the gas cylinder through a port in the barrel; it fires from a closed bolt position. The weapon is locked with a rotating bolt which features 6 radial locking lugs, a spring-powered extractor and ejector. The chamber, bolt, and ejector mechanism can be accessed by flipping up a hinged inspection cover in the receiver, behind the optical sight housing. Partial disassembly (cartridge on bolt face) short- stroke gas piston The F2000 uses a unique ejection system, ejecting spent cartridge casings forward and to the right side of the weapon‚Äîthrough a tube running above the barrel. This method of ejection provides for fully ambidextrous operation; the rifle can be used without any modification by both right and left-handed shooters. This ejection pattern was achieved by using a swiveling polymer tray, which intercepts the empty casing from the bolt face immediately after disengaging from the extractor. As the empty casing is extracted it is held while the rocker assembly tilts to lift it above and clear of the feed path as the next round is stripped from the magazine by the bolt head. The casing is fed into the tray located in a cavity in the receiver wall, which then pivots the cartridge case and directs it into a chute (above the barrel); the case is discarded from the tilting tray by being impacted by a pin on the moving bolt carrier upon its forward return. Only when the ejection tube contains more than five cases is the first of them ejected forward through a port just behind and to the right of the muzzle. This is continued; every fifth round fired, all five shells are ejected in a burst, until the magazine is empty. Thus a 30-round magazine will be ejected in six bursts of five shells. This system is patent protected (patent number 5675924 dated 14 October 1997 by Ren√© Predazzer and patent 6389725 from February 25, 2000, author ‚Äì Charles Denuit). The ambidexterity provided by forward ejection is its most obvious benefit, and removes many of the tactical and user difficulties (such as lack of ambidexterity, and gas and debris released in close proximity to the shooter's face‚Äîsee the SA80 or OC-14) that bullpup designs usually create. =Grenade launcher= GL1 grenade launcher, not mounted GL1 mounted on F2000 One of the modules developed for the F2000 system is a proprietary lightweight 40 mm underslung GL1 grenade launcher (empty weight‚Äî1 kg) that uses standard low-velocity 40√ó46mm grenades.GL1 40 mm LV , FNHerstal.com The launcher is a single-shot breech-loaded reverse pump-action weapon with a barrel that slides forward for loading and unloading (like the M203 grenade launcher), locked by axial rotation of the barrel. The grenade launcher's trigger is installed directly under the F2000's trigger so that it can be manipulated without removing the shooting hand from the rifle's pistol grip. The double-action trigger lets the operator \\"try again\\" if the grenade's percussion type primer doesn't ignite. The breech release button is found on the left side of the launcher body, like on the M203. The grenade launcher comes with a basic flip-up ladder sight, but it was intended to be used with a specially designed optoelectronic fire control system designated FCS, developed in cooperation with the Finnish company Noptel. The aiming module is installed in place of the standard optical sight and becomes the weapon's primary sight when mounted, but its main purpose is to accurately determine and indicate the range of a grenade target. The module is powered by a 9 V battery pack, installed in the stock, behind the magazine well. The power pack is also intended to power any other tactical accessories or systems that could be introduced. The FCS integrates a low-power laser rangefinder (precise to within ¬± 1 m), a day-time aiming channel with an electronically projected reticle, a measured range display reading and a diode elevation adjustment indicator. The fire control system calculates a firing solution manifested by the barrel's angle of elevation using target range information from the laser rangefinder (the rangefinder is activated by pushing a button on the pistol grip, below the trigger), corrected manually by the shooter through a push- button interface (add/subtract buttons) on the FCS top cover to take account for head or tail winds that could affect the desired range. The F2000 FCS also contains software with the ballistic properties of up to six types of 40 mm grenades and can be reprogrammed to take advantage of future munition improvements. Batteries for the FCS are located in the bottom of the buttstock. After obtaining a range measurement, the distance to the target is displayed on a liquid crystal screen and the elevation diode flashes red. Once a correct elevation has been achieved by tilting the rifle, the diode changes color to green indicating the weapon is ready to fire Variants =F2000 Tactical= F2000 Tactical The F2000 Tactical railed variant is similar to the standard model, but it lacks the optical sight, and comes instead with an extended top receiver MIL-STD-1913 rail with flip-up iron sights allowing for picatinny rail accessories to be fitted. =F2000 Tactical TR= The F2000 Tactical TR variant is similar to the F2000 Tactical model, but includes a triple rail handguard for add-on accessories. =FS2000= Intended for civilian ownership, the FS2000 is a semi-automatic version of the F2000 that first became available in June 2006. The FS2000 Tactical model is equipped with an extended barrel with a permanently attached muzzle brake and a 1:7 in right hand twist rifling rate; the bayonet lug was not included on the FS2000 rifles. The lower hand guard can be removed in the same manner as the F2000 to accept the same variety of accessories. It comes with a Picatinny rail optic rail along with backup iron sights. The rear flip-up National Match-sized aperture is adjustable for windage, while the removable front sight is adjustable for elevation. A small number of the early models featured a stepped barrel contour as well as a demilled bayonet lug. Measurements on the stepped barrel's rifling were as long as the non-stepped barrel, revealing that the stepped barrel is not simply a shorter F2000 military barrel with an extended muzzle brake which is similar to the PS90. A variant of the FS2000, called the FS2000 Standard, is equipped with the factory F2000 1.6√ó magnification optic and sight cover. =F2000 S= A version of the F2000 Tactical modified for the Slovenian Army. It incorporates an elevated upper Picatinny rail that also doubles as a carrying handle.

It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm. Their use predates the invention of vacuum flasks as a means of keeping hot liquids hot. Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed. Some tea cosies are hand-knitted, resembling woollen hats, some even feature a \\"bobble\\" (pom-pom) on top, which may also serve as a handle to remove or lift the tea cosy. Sometimes, if the tea is served in a restaurant or in a hotel, the teapot is covered with a tea cosy that has a metal exterior to protect the inner fabric of the cosy from wear and tear and also to further improve the insulation of the teapot. A special tea cosy is the so-called tea lugger, which enables the hot teapot to be carried around easily. Tea cosies may sometimes be made in matching sets with items such as tablecloths, oven gloves, or aprons. Cloth tea-cosies may be embroidered, perhaps to complement a fine set of china. Some have been made with hidden pockets to be filled with fragrant herbs or flowers, similar to a potpourri.  History  Although the history of the tea cosy may begin when tea was introduced to Britain in the 1660s, the first documented use of a tea cosy in Britain was in 1867.A History of Hand Knitting, Richard Rutt (1987), London: Batsford. It is probably the Duchess of Bedford who, by establishing the activity of afternoon tea in 1840, would have brought the popularity of the tea cosy.Suie Roberts, \\"The History of the Tea Cosy\\", 31 March 2008 Afternoon tea was the time for networking and keeping up to date with aristocracy gossip and topical news. With all the chatter at teatime the teapot would get cold, which would have at times cut short some tea parties. And so, the tea cosy came about. Tea cosies then flourished during the late 19th century, where they appeared in many households across Britain, motivated by the obsession of decorating and covering objects characteristic of the Victorian era. Tea cosies started to be used in North America in the same period. Newspapers of the time reveal that tea cosies enjoyed \\"a sudden and unexpected rise in public favor\\" among women who hosted tea parties.Philadelphia Inquirer, 20 October 1892 Newspapers of the time included advice columns on how to make one: \\"Some very handsome ones are made of remnants of heavy brocade, but linen is generally used, embroidered or not, according to taste, as these covers are washable.

It is also the seat of the City of Griffith local government area. Like the Australian capital, Canberra, and extensions to the nearby town of Leeton, Griffith was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin. Griffith was named after Arthur Hill Griffith, the first New South Wales Minister of Public Works. Griffith was proclaimed a city in 1987, and had a population of 20,251 Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. in June 2018. It can be accessed by road from Sydney and Canberra via the Hume Highway and the Burley Griffin Way and from Melbourne, via the Newell Highway and either by using the Kidman Way or the Irrigation Way. Griffith can be accessed from other places like Adelaide, Orange, and Bathurst through the Mid-Western Highway and the Rankins Springs road from Rankins Springs and the Kidman Way from Goolgowi. History Griffith and other towns were created as part of the New South Wales State Government's Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) project, a plan to supply irrigation from the Murrumbidgee river to open up western New South Wales for farming . The town plan for Griffith, and nearby Leeton, was designed by Walter Burley Griffin in 1914, an unusual geometric pattern centred on a set of circular streets, with broad avenues radiating out in an octagonal arrangement. The streets were surveyed mostly according to that plan, and Griffith was declared a town in August 1916. Plan of Griffith, 1914 The main dam of the scheme was the large Burrinjuck Dam on the Murrumbidgee between Gundagai and Canberra, but was not completed until 1928. The Berembed Weir, near Narrandera, was built in 1912, diverting water from the Murrumbidgee River into the Bundidgerry Creek then into the Main Canal of the MIA at Narrandera. The Canal, almost a river in its own right, flows through the MIA, supplying water to the entire area, then flows through Griffith as part of the geometric plan, and peters out to the northwest of the town in rice farms. The water supply was further enhanced with the construction of the Snowy River scheme by the Australian Federal Government in the 1950s and 1960s. The Blowering Dam, a large dam near Tumut stores a significant amount of water to be released down the Murrumbidgee for irrigation around Leeton, Griffith and the newer Coleambally area south of the Murrumbidgee and Griffith. From the start of the MIA, citrus and other fruit and vegetables were grown in abundance around Griffith. In the 1950s the irrigation area expanded to include large rice farms. Vineyards were established early, and wineries followed, beginning with McWilliam's Wines at Hanwood and Yenda, two villages just outside the city. From its earliest days, the MIA was populated by Italian workers, some of whom were initially employed by Australian farmers to run steamboats on the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Approximately 60% of today's Griffith population claim Italian background. These include the initial settlement of Italians from the boat crews and other Italians who came out to Australia in the Depression, or from a second wave of immigrant Italians who came to Griffith in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the 1970s, Griffith was often associated with drug distribution (particularly marijuana) and organised crime, as depicted in 2009 by Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities. However, Griffith is now associated with good wine and food, primarily as a result of its diverse population, with notable contributions by Italian- Australians. Griffith's multi-ethnic population is now absorbing new national groups, including a significant Sikh Indian community. The city is sister city with the Italian city of Treviso in the Veneto Region. Many Italians in Griffith are from the Veneto Region or the Calabria Region of Italy. The Italian influence expanded the range of fruit and vegetables, and also significantly increased the number of wineries and the range of wines produced by the existing wineries in the region, such as McWilliam's. De Bortoli, Rosetto and other wineries were established by Italian immigrants, and today they are well known around Australia. In recent times they have been joined by one of the country's best known wine labels, Yellow Tail, produced by Casella Family Brands. Casella, DeBortoli, McWilliam's, Warburn and Berton Vineyards are now among the top 20 wine producers in Australia.2014 Wine Industry Directory Griffith is the cathedral city of the Anglican Diocese of Riverina. The foundation stone of the Parish Church of St Alban the Martyr was dedicated in 1954. It was proclaimed as a cathedral in 1984.

Coat of Arms of the RIC Founded in 1877 as the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain, its role was to focus on qualifications and the professional status of chemists, and its aim was to ensure that consulting and analytical chemists were properly trained and qualified. It awarded qualifications: AIC (Associate of the Institute of Chemistry) indicating full training, and FIC (fellow) indicating professional competence. It received its first Royal Charter in 1885. As well as insisting on thorough professional qualifications, it also laid down strict ethical standards. Its main qualifications were Licentiate (LRIC) (professional training following a course of practical study to a standard lower than an honours degree), Graduate (GRIC) (completion of study equivalent to at least second class honours degree), Associate (ARIC) (LRIC plus professional experience), Member (MRIC) (GRIC plus professional experience) and Fellow (FRIC) (more experience and standing than MRIC) of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. Following a supplemental Charter in 1975, Members and Fellows were permitted to use the letters CChem (Chartered Chemist). It published Royal Institute of Chemistry Reviews from 1968 to 1971, when it combined to form Chemical Society Reviews, and the Journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. At the same time, the Chemical Society had concentrated on the science of chemistry, and publishing learned journals. In 1972 these two organisations, together with the Faraday Society and the Society for Analytical Chemistry, started the process of merger, becoming the Royal Society of Chemistry on 15 May 1980.

It is responsible for providing services and expertise that promote and protect Kansas' food supply and natural resources while stimulating economic growth. The head of the Department is the Secretary of Agriculture, who is appointed by the Governor, with the approval of the Kansas Senate. The current Secretary of Agriculture is Mike Beam, who was appointed by Governor Laura Kelly in 2019. Former Secretaries of Agriculture have included Jackie McClaskey, Sam Brownback, Foster Dwight Coburn, Alfred Gray, Adrian Polansky, and Joshua Svaty.  History  Initially, the Kansas State Agricultural Society began organization is 1855 and held the first public meeting in 1857, while Kansas was a territory. The Kansas Legislature officially adopted the Kansas State Agricultural Society as a state entity in 1862. The Kansas Board of Agriculture was created in 1872, building upon the work of the Kansas State Agricultural Society, which had served as a model for departments of agriculture nationwide. The agency became the Kansas Department of Agriculture in 1995. The Department traces its history back to the 1850s when a group of farmers in Kansas Territory created agriculture \\"societies.\\" Records of the earliest society, established in 1857, are sparse because they were burned when a confederate named William Quantrill raided and burned Lawrence, Kansas. On March 5, 1862, the Kansas Legislature created the Kansas State Agricultural Society, with Floyd Perry Baker temporarily presiding, by statute to organize agricultural work statewide. In 1872, the Kansas Legislature created the State Board of Agriculture from the structure of the Agriculture Society. It became the grandfather of agricultural departments in all fifty states. The board's early years were spent organizing a state fair and acting as an immigration agency to attract needed settlers to homestead in Kansas. Gradually, the state lost its image as a part of the \\"Great American Desert\\". Farms and towns sprang up on the fertile plains of the future wheat state. The Board of Agriculture through an annual report and various publications about Kansas served as a source of information and new techniques in farming. Through the grasshopper invasion, droughts, blizzards, and through the invention of barbed wire, the development of combines and advances undreamed in 1872, the Kansas Board of Agriculture has served the producers and consumers of Kansas agricultural products. In 1994, the Board was renamed the Kansas Department of Agriculture. Today, the Kansas Department of Agriculture has many divisions and programs including the Agricultural Laboratory, Agricultural Marketing, Advocacy, and Outreach Team, Dairy and Feed Safety, Division of Animal Health, Division of Conservation, Division of Water Resources, Emergency Management, Food Safety and Lodging, Grain Warehouse, Meat and Poultry Inspection, Pesticide and Fertilizer, Plant Protection and Weed Control, and Weights and Measures. The Department also provides a large variety of services including licensing guides, grants and cost-share programs, Kansas commodity commissions, export inspections (foreign or domestic), soil fumigation notifications, weed free forage inspections, export certificate applications, live plant inspection applications, and much more.http://agriculture.ks.gov/home On June 16, 2014, the majority of the department's employees were moved from Topeka to offices in Manhattan, Kansas. Leadership The Department is administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Under Governor Laura Kelly, Mike Beam was appointed as Secretary in January 2019. =State Board of Agriculture= The Kansas State Board of Agriculture serves as an advisory board to the Governor of Kansas and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Board is composed of nine members, appointed by the Governor to serve four year terms. One member is appointed from each of Kansas' four congressional districts, with the remaining five being appointed at-large. No two members can reside in the same county and no more than five members may be from the same political party. The Board is responsible for electing its own Chair and Vice Chair. The Board assists the Governor and Secretary in the development of legislative priorities and Departmental rules and regulations, except those which relate solely to personnel matters of the Department. The Board, however, has no powers, duties or functions concerning the day-to-day operations of the Department.

He claimed that the name was still in use in his own day (c. 551). Jordanes' account Jordanes relates that the East Germanic tribe of Goths were led from Scandza by their king Berig. As soon as they had set foot in the land, they named the area Gothiscandza. The slowest of the three ships carried the Gepids, who settled in the \\"province of Spesis on an island surrounded by the shallow waters of the Vistula. This island they called, in the speech of their fathers, Gepedoios\\". They soon moved to the settlements of the Rugians (Ulmerugi, a Germanic tribe which had arrived in the area already before the Goths), who lived on the coast, and they chased them away. Then they defeated their new neighbours, the Vandals. After some time, when at least four generations of kings had passed after Berig, and Filimer was the king of the Goths, their numbers had multiplied. Filimer decided that everyone was to leave Gothiscandza and move to a new region named Oium (Scythia). The reliability of Jordanes for early Gothic history has been called into question. Etymology One interpretation of Gothiscandza is that is a Latinised form of the Gothic gutisk-an[d]ja, \\"Gothic end (or frontier)\\", since the Goths' territory extended to here.Adrian Room, Placenames of the World, 2nd Ed. Quote: \\"a Gothic name, from Gutisk-anja, \\"end of the Goths,\\" as these people's territory extended to here.\\", 142 Another interpretation is that an[d]ja means \\"cape\\" so that the whole word means \\"gothic peninsula\\". It is also possible that the word is a product of conflation of the words gothic and Scandinavia.Sigmund Feist, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary (translation), Brill, 1986, , 158 Herwig Wolfram mentions \\"Gothic coast\\" and \\"Gothic Scandia\\" but prefers the latter, thinking that the former is \\"linguistically questionable\\".Wolfram, Herwig. History of the Goths (transl. by Thomas J. Dunlap), University of California Press, 1988, , 38, 386 Identification =History and linguistics= In the 1st century AD, the mouth of the Vistula was indicated as the land of the Gutones (Pliny the Elder) or Gothones (Tacitus): The names given by Pliny and Tacitus appear to be identical to *Gutaniz, the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form of Gutans, the Goths' and the Gotlanders' name for themselves. The Gothiscandza theme was revived in German scholarship by Gustav Kossinna. Several archaeologists and historians have proposed the theory that the name Gothiscandza was evolved linguistically into Kashubian and other West Slavic languages' rendition of the various historical names of Gda≈Ñsk ().Martin Steink√ºhler (Author), Hans J. Schuch (Editor). (1997) Von Gothiscandza zu Danzig: Aus √ºber 1000 Jahren wechselvoller Geschichte. Westpreussisches Landesmuseum: M√ºnster-Wolbeck, Germany, pp. 12‚Äì23 =Archaeology= The red area is the extent of the Wielbark Culture in the first half of the 3rd century. The dark pink area is Gotland and the green area is the traditional extent of G√∂taland In the 1st century a new culture appeared at the mouth of the Vistula, called the Wielbark Culture replacing the local Oksywie culture. The most salient component of Scandinavian influence in the 1st century AD is the introduction of Scandinavian burial traditions such as stone circles and the stelae, showing that those who buried their dead preferred to do so according to Scandinavian traditions. However, there is also archaeological evidence of previous Scandinavian influence in the area during the Nordic Bronze Age and the Pre-Roman Iron Agehttps://web.archive.org/web/20040821091243/http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/publications/opia/gothicabstract.htm, perhaps corresponding to the arrival of Rugians and Vandals. In the 3rd century AD, the Wielbark culture spread into Scythia, where it formed the Gothic Chernyakhov culture. Norse mythology Norse mythology presents at least two traditions that may be connected to Gothiscandza. The first one, the Gutasaga, may refer to the migration of the Goths and the second one, the legend of Dag the Wise, of raids from Scandza. =The Gutasaga= The Gutasaga relates that when the Gotlanders had multiplied so that the island (Gotland, i.e. Goth-land) no longer could support them, they drew lots so that one third of the island's inhabitants had to leave and settle in the south. They eventually settled in the land of the Greeks. :over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn't support them all. Then they draw lots, and every third person was picked to leave, and they could keep everything they owned and take it with them, except for their land. ... they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks. ... they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language. =Ynglingatal= The legend of Dag the Wise may convey traditions of attacks by the Suiones in the 2nd or 3rd century. In Scandinavian sources, the territory is called Reidgotaland, a name that followed the Goths during their migrations in the Norse sagas.

History One of the aims of the Chemical Society was to hold meetings for \\"the communication and discussion of discoveries and observations, an account of which shall be published by the Society\\". In 1847, its importance was recognised by a Royal Charter, which added to its role in the advancement of science, the development of chemical applications in industry. Its members included eminent chemists from overseas including August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who became its president in 1861. Membership was open to all those interested in chemistry, but fellowship was for long restricted to men. In 1904, Edith Humphrey, thought to be the first British woman to gain a doctorate in chemistry (at the University of Zurich), was one of nineteen women chemists to petition the Chemical Society for admission of women to fellowship. This was eventually granted in 1919, and Humphrey was subsequently elected to fellowship. The Chemical Society of London succeeded where a number of previous chemical associations - the Lunar Society's London branch chemical society of the 1780s, the Animal Chemical Club of 1805, the London Chemical Society of 1824 - failed. One assertion of a cause of success of the Chemical Society of London is that it was, unlike its forerunners, a \\"fruitful amalgamation of the technological and academic chemist\\". Its activities expanded over the years, including eventually becoming a major publisher in the field of chemistry. On 15 May 1980, it amalgamated with the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Faraday Society and the Society for Analytical Chemistry to become the Royal Society of Chemistry.

This dojo was completed in 1945 and was originally called \\"The Aiki Shuren Dojo\\" (ÂêàÊ∞ó‰øÆÁ∑¥ÈÅìÂ†¥, lit. harmonising drill dojo). At first the dojo did not include tatami mats, and students received training directly upon the wooden floor. Eventually 24 mats were installed. The dojo was later moved to the present day location and expanded to 60 mats. When the founder formally established the Aikikai for the promotion of aikido in 1948, the dojo served as the world headquarters for the art and remained so until the opening of the new Aikikai Hombu Dojo in 1956. After the death of the aikido founder in 1969, Morihiro Saito became the caretaker and chief instructor at the Iwama Dojo and caretaker of the Aiki Shrine and remained so for more than thirty years. After Saito Shihan's death in May 2002, Moriteru Ueshiba became the default Dojo Chief while Saito's son, Hitohiro Saito, assumed the role of Acting Dojo Chief on behalf of the Doshu. However, in November 2003, Hitohiro Sensei announced his departure from the Aikikai. Hitohiro's organisation was formed following his formal separation from the Aikikai in November 2003. This created a split among students of Morihiro Saito with some joining Hitohira Sensei's new organisation and others (most notably the three that Sait≈ç had promoted to 7th dan, William Witt,Paolo Corallini, and Ulf Even√•s) remaining affiliated with the Aikikai. In December 2003, the dojo was renamed the Ibaraki Branch Dojo with Hiroshi Isoyama taking on the role of Acting Dojo Chief and Senior Instructor. Isoyama first began training in the Iwama dojo in 1949 at the age 12, as a direct student of the Morihei Ueshiba and the registration documents that he signed stated the name: \\"Daito-ryu Aiki- jujutsu\\". Isoyama's position was later taken over by Mitsuteru Ueshiba who then became the current Dojo Chief in place of his father in April 2015. Isoyama Shihan remains as chief instructor and Executive Advisor with support from Inagaki Shihan. On 11 March 2011, the dojo was severely damaged by an earthquake and rendered unusable. Aikido practice continued in the Aiki Shrine from 14 March until 17 September 2011 when the newly repaired dojo reopened for training. The Ibaraki Branch Dojo has nine regular local instructors, headed by Hiroshi Isoyama (8th dan), with the majority of the teaching (including the live-in student programme) being carried out by Shigemi Inagaki (8th Dan). Additionally, Dojo Chief Mitsuteru Ueshiba and Aikido Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba visit on Wednesdays and Saturdays respectively to teach the general class. General classes are held every day of the week for regular students while live-in students (ÂÜÖÂºüÂ≠ê uchi deshi ) practise three times per day in addition to carrying out other duties such as maintaining the dojo and shrine precincts. Aiki Jinja The Aiki Shrine in Iwama Aiki Jinja (ÂêàÊ∞óÁ•ûÁ§æ) is the shrine built by Morihei Ueshiba in Iwama in honor of the deities of aikido. (Jinja is the Japanese term for a shrine.) The shrine grounds include the Ibaraki Branch dojo (training hall). The 42 kami enshrined within the Aiki Jinja include Morihei Ueshiba's Guardian Gods, Saruta Hiko no Ookami, Kunitsu Ryuoh Kuzuryu, Daigongen, Tajikarao no mikoto, Amenomurakumo Kukisamuhara Ryuoh, Ketsumi Miko no Ookami, Wakumusubi no Mikoto, Ryuoh, Daigongen, Ootengu, Daibosatsu, and others. The first part of the shrine building (the Honden or \\"Okuden\\" housing the deities of aikido) was completed in late autumn, 1943. The second bigger part (the Haiden) was erected in front of the Honden in 1962. Both parts were renovated by care-taker Morihiro Saito in 2001-2002 with the approval of D≈çshu Moriteru Ueshiba. This renovation also included a fence set up around the compound, and a stone with the carvings \\"Aiki Jinja\\" designed by Seiseki Abe, a master of both calligraphy and Aikido, who was also the calligraphy teacher of Morihei Ueshiba. A large statue of the founder of aikido was erected in the shrine grounds and unveiled on 8 November 2009. Surplus material from this monument was used to make a bust of the founder which was unveiled at the newly rebuilt Iwama Station on 24 July 2012. The Torii gate and Honden were damaged during the Great Tohoku earthquake. The relatively unscathed Haiden was used for aikido training while the dojo was unusable. When Morihei Ueshiba was alive, once a month he would preside over what was initially a small religious ceremony in the Aiki Jinja called Tsukinamisai (Êúà‰∏¶„ÅøÁ•≠), which lasted up to an hour. Food offerings of fruits, vegetables, and fish adorned the kamidana.Later, a small party with the uchi deshi (live-in students) was held inside the dojo. After Ueshiba died, caretaker Morihiro Saito took responsibility for hosting the ceremony every month on the 14th. This tradition is kept up by current D≈çshu Moriteru Ueshiba. Every year on April 29 (the start of the Japanese Golden Week holiday), the annual shrine festival \\"Aiki Jinja Rei Taisai\\" (ÂêàÊ∞óÁ•ûÁ§æ‰æãÂ§ßÁ•≠ \\"Grand Festival of the Aiki Shrine\\") is held by Oomoto priests in commemoration of Ueshiba's death on April 26, 1969. Under former caretaker Morihiro Saito, the event grew to become a very big day for the small town of Iwama. The festival has continued to attract hundreds of Aikido practitioners to the small dojo and shrine under current Dojo Chief Moriteru Ueshiba. The Aiki Shrine Festival usually starts with a \\"shubatsu\\" (a Shinto ritual), \\"taisai-shukuji\\" (ritual felicitations) and \\"tamagushi-hoten\\" Ôºàoffering of sacred sprigsÔºâ by the Ueshiba family and representatives from the aikido world and local community. The attendees then take part in a ritual prayer and memorial service offered by the Ueshiba family and other dignitries. A special Shinto prayer called the \\"Amatsu Norito\\" is recited before the current D≈çshu makes a speech and a ritual demonstration of Aikido called a \\"h≈çn≈ç embu\\" (Â•âÁ¥çÊºîÊ≠¶) within the haiden of the shrine. The festival usually closes with \\"naorai\\" (a celebratory meal) in the dojo and surrounding gardens, often with the azaleas in bloom. Tanrenkan Tanrenkan (ÈçõÈå¨È§®, which means \\"Hardening Hall\\") is an aikido training hall run by Hitohiro Saito, now Hitohira, who is the son of Morihiro Saito. It is the main dojo of the Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-Kai organisation. The Tanrenkan was built in 2000 on Saito family land and exists independently of the original Iwama dojo. Other Iwama dojo There are also other aikido dojos in former-Iwama: * Shin-Shin Aiki Juku (Á•û‰ø°ÂêàÊ∞£Â°æ) is located 700 metres south-east from Tanrenkan. It is the old \\"Shin Dojo\\" built by Saito Morihiro Shihan. Uchi-deshi from Tanrenkan stay here. * Nisshinkan is a small dojo operated by Nemoto Hiroki (Aikikai 7th dan) next to his \\"Aiki House\\" student accommodation. * There is also aikido at Iwama Budokan (Martial Arts Hall). It is located at Iwama Junior High School, 1.3 km north-east from the founder's dojo. It is used by Watahiki (Ibaraki Branch), Nemoto and ISSASK.

Caird travelled to India from October 1878 to join a commission of famine inspectors. He held opinions that the Indian administrators did not appreciate. He was of the opinion that famine relief should be aimed to save life and was against fitness tests and wage payment against work for Indians. He believed that Indian governance needed fundamental change with peasants receiving payment in kind with handling of harvest variability. He even considered that land revenue superstructure including the Indian Civil Services needed pruning or even abolition. He was senior member of the Land Commission in 1882. He was director of the land department of the Board of Agriculture from 1889‚Äì91. He was appointed a CB in 1869 and promoted to KCB in 1882.

It may be an ancestor of cricket (a game it resembles), baseball, and rounders, in fact stoolball is sometimes called \\"cricket in the air\\". There is a tradition that it was played by milkmaids who used their milking stools as a \\"wicket\\" and the bittle, or milk bowl as a bat. Hence its archaic name of bittle-battle.History And Antiquities Of Horsham, Doreathea E. Hurst, Farncombe & Co, Lewes, Sussex 2nd Ed (1889) page 257 The sport of stoolball is strongly associated with Sussex; it has been referred to as Sussex's 'national' sport and a Sussex game or pastime. The National Stoolball Association was formed in 1979 to promote and expand stoolball. The game was officially recognised as a sport by the Sports Council in early 2008. The National Stoolball Association changed its name to Stoolball England in 2010 on the advice of the Sports Council and was recognised as the national governing body for stoolball in England in 2011. The game's popularity has faded since the 1960s, but continues to be played at a local league level in Sussex, Kent, Surrey and the Midlands. Some variants are played in some schools. Teams can be ladies only or mixed. There are ladies' leagues in Sussex, Surrey and Kent and mixed leagues in Sussex. History =Medieval and Tudor references= 1767 Illustration of Stoolball in the children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book Stoolball is attested by name as early as 1450. Nearly all medieval references describe it as a game played during Easter celebrations, typically as a courtship pastime rather than a competitive game. The game's associations with romance remained strong into the modern period. Written by William Shakespeare and the Sussex-born playwright John Fletcher, the comedy, The Two Noble Kinsmen used the phrase \\"playing stool ball\\" as a euphemism for sexual behaviour. =Early competitions and establishment of codes= Stoolball makes an appearance in the dictionary of Samuel Johnson, where it is defined as a game played by driving a ball from stool to stool. Stoolball seems to have been one of the earliest sports in which women participated. Activities for women before about 1870 were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were typically non-competitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasised physical activity rather than competition. In contrast, stoolball allowed women to participate in competitive sport. A ‚Äúfine match of stoolball‚Äù is recorded as having been played in June 1747 by a total of 28 women at Warbleton. The first inter-county stoolball match took place between the women of Sussex and Kent in 1797 at Tunbridge Wells Common on the historic border between the two counties. Sussex women wore blue ribbons to represent the county while the women of Kent wore pink ribbons. Andrew Lusted argues that between 1866 and 1887 the Glynde Butterflies stoolball team were the first women in England to be considered sports stars. In 1866 the first recorded stoolball match took place between teams of named women representing villages as the Glynde Butterflies took on the Firle Blues. Other teams included the Chailey Grasshoppers, Selmeston Harvest Bugs, Waldron Bees, Eastbourne Seagulls, Danny Daisies and Westmeston. The sport's modern rules were codified at Glynde in 1881 where the two slightly different sets of rules in the east and the west of Sussex were brought together. In 1867 the rules in the east of the county were compiled by the Rev William de St Croix, the vicar of Glynde, and were the first rules to be established. =20th century revival= A Sussex Stoolball League was established in 1903. Initially played by women only, men joined in shortly afterwards. Modern stoolball is centred on Sussex where the game was revived in the early 20th century by Major William Grantham. Grantham wore a traditional Sussex round frock and beaver hat to stoolball games. In 1917, Sussex County Cricket Ground in Hove hosted a match between young men who had lost one arm in First World War action at a temporary hospital in Brighton's Royal Pavilion, ‚Äúdamaged by wounds‚Äù, and a team of older lawyers, ‚Äúdamaged by age‚Äù. The soldiers won and were deemed to be 'heroes'. In 1919 a demonstration match was held at Lord's and the game was also played near the trenches of the battlefields of the First World War. First played in 1923, the League Championship Challenge Cup is open to the winning teams of the five leagues of the Sussex County Stoolball Association - North, East, West, Mid and Central. By the 1930s stoolball was being played in the Midlands and the north of England. Since 1938 Sussex and Kent have competed annually for the Rose Bowl, which was presented to Sussex by Major William Grantham. This is sometimes a team representing Sussex and sometimes one of Sussex's five leagues may represent the county against Kent. Grantham founded the Stoolball Association of Great Britain at Lord's in 1923. By 1927 over 1,000 clubs were playing stoolball across England, however in 1942 the Stoolball Association of Great Britain ceased to function. The National Stoolball Association was founded on 3 October 1979 at Clair Hall in Haywards Heath attended by 23 people from nine different leagues. On the advice of the Sports Council the governing body was renamed Stoolball England in 2010. In the early 20th century stoolball was also played outside England, including in France, Japan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Description and rules Stoolball is played on grass with a diameter boundary, and the pitch is long. Each team consists of 11 players, with one team fielding and the other batting. Bowling is underarm from a bowling \\"crease\\" from the batsman's wicket, with the ball reaching the batsman on the full as in rounders or baseball rather than bouncing from the pitch as in cricket. Each over consists of 8 balls. The \\"wicket\\" itself is a square piece of wood at head or shoulder height fastened to a post. Traditionally this was the seat of a stool hung from a post or tree; some versions used a tall stool placed upright on the ground. As it is played today, a bowler attempts to hit the wicket with the ball, and a batsman defends it using a bat shaped like a frying pan. The batsman scores \\"runs\\" by running between the wickets or hitting the ball beyond the boundary in a similar way to cricket. A ball hit over the boundary counts for 4 runs if it has hit the ground before reaching the boundary, or 6 runs if it landed beyond the boundary upon first contact with the ground. Fielders attempt to catch the ball or run out the batsman by hitting the wicket with the ball before the batsman returns from his run. Originally the batsman simply had to defend his stool from each ball with his hand and would score a point for each delivery until the stool was hit. The game later evolved to include runs and bats. Confusion with the game of Stoball According to Alice Gomme, the earliest references show that the game was called Stobball or Stoball,Gomme, Alice Bertha (1894). The traditional games of England, Scotland, and Ireland: with tunes, singing-rhymes, and methods of playing according to the variants extant and recorded in different parts of the Kingdom.

Archived by archive.org on June 26, 2007 and viewable here and was a game peculiar to North Wiltshire, North Gloucestershire, and a little part of Somerset, near Bath: but although 17th century antiquarian John Aubrey describes a game called \\"stobball\\", played in this area, his description of it does not sound like stoolball,\\"Stobball-play is peculiar to North Wilts, North Gloucestershire, and a little part of Somerset near Bath. They smite a ball, stuffed very hard with quills and covered with soale leather, with a staffe, commonly made of withy, about 3 [feet] and a halfe long... A stobball-ball is of about four inches diameter, and as hard as a stone.\\" and another contemporary text from the same region characterises \\"stoball\\" as a game played mainly by men and boys.From a Berkeley manuscript of c.1641:\\"The large and levell playnes..in the vale of this hundred..doe witnes the inbred delight, that both gentry, yeomanry, rascallity, boyes and children, doe take in a game called Stoball... And not a sonne of mine, but at 7. was furnished with his double stoball staves, and a gamster therafter.\\" John Smyth, The Berkeley manuscripts: the lives of the Berkeleys, lords of the honour, castle and manor of Berkeley in the county of Gloucester from 1066 to 1618...: printed for subscribers by John Bellows, Gloucester, 1883‚Äì1885. The Oxford English Dictionary considers it unlikely that \\"stool ball\\" could have been corrupted into \\"stobball\\".It suggests instead an etymology of the latter word from \\"stob\\" + ball, where \\"stob\\" means a stump or stub of wood, and refers to the club used to play the game.\\"‚Ä† stow-ball, n.\\".

The company is perhaps best known for its ViRGE and its much improved successor Savage 3D and Chrome series. Struggling against competition from 3dfx Interactive, ATI and Nvidia during the height of the 3D accelerator wars, the graphics portion of the company was spun off into a new joint effort with VIA Technologies. The new company focused on the mobile graphics market, and became a major player in this space. The company was purchased by HTC in 2011. Although primarily a mobile technology company, they still produce graphics accelerators for home computers under the \\"S3 Chrome\\" brand name. History S3 was founded and incorporated in January 1989 by Dado Banatao and Ronald Yara. On March 5, 1993, S3 began an initial public offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock on Nasdaq. After several profitable years as an independent startup company, and then struggling with the transition to integrated 3D cards, S3 remodeled itself as a consumer electronics company and sold off its core graphics division to a joint venture with VIA Technologies for $323 million. The joint venture, S3 Graphics, continues to develop and market chipsets based on the S3 graphics technology. The reformed company carried over a substantial cash pile from the profitable TRIO (see below) days and a successful investment in UMC, a Taiwanese semiconductor foundry. On November 15, 2000, S3 changed its name to SONICBlue and its NASDAQ stock symbol to SBLU. The new business model focused on digital media and information appliance opportunities while the graphics division was sold to VIA Technologies as S3 Graphics. ReplayTV, Rio, and GoVideo were some of the brands developed by SONICBlue. On March 21, 2003, SONICBlue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. S3 Graphics first only developed graphic cores for VIA IGP chipset while some years later they again began to produce graphics accelerators for home computers under the \\"Chrome\\" brand name. These include the Deltachrome, Gammachrome, Chrome S27 and Chrome 440GTX. On July 6, 2011, it was announced that HTC Corporation would buy the VIA Technologies stake in S3 Graphics, thus becoming the majority owner of S3 Graphics. Products S3 produces graphics cards primarily for PCs. While the earlier products such as the TRIO range were 2D only, later 3D functionality was added with the ViRGE and then Savage cards. More recently S3 chipsets have been sold as integrated VIA northbridge parts. However these units are also available for PCI-E. The Chrome 440 series supports DirectX 10.1, HD Blu-ray video, and 3D acceleration powerful enough to run most of today's games on moderate settings. Their latest graphics card, the Chrome 530gt supports DirectX 10.1, OpenGL 3.0, HD- DVD and HD Blu-ray video playback and GPGPU acceleration for image processing using S3FotoPro, video color correction, video encoding and transcoding, scientific research, game physics, engineering analysis, financial analysis and signal processing.

S3 Texture Compression went on to become an industry standard, and the Savage3D's DVD acceleration was market leading at introduction.

Integrated functionality enabled attractive pricing, and solid features for competitive prices remained a hallmark of S3's strategy. S3's most notable product range is the S3 TRIO 2D chipset. It remains one of the best selling graphics chipsets of all time. Updated in a number of timely revisions, each time S3 managed to keep the series one step ahead of the competition. However, TRIO was a 2D range, and by the mid 1990s consumers and OEMs started to demand 3D functionality from graphics cards. Internally, S3 failed to recognise this transition quickly enough, and had to rush out the S3 ViRGE range of 3D cards. While cheap, and popular with some OEMs for this reason, performance and drivers were poor. Some enthusiasts even nicknamed them graphics decelerators. The integrated modern style 3D feature produced by S3, was the Savage series of graphics cards. Notably these pioneered S3TC under the proprietary METAL API, subsequently adopted by Microsoft under royalty, as an industry standard for texture compression in DirectX. Savage also introduced a motion compensation engine, a quality video scaler, as well as hardware alpha-blended sub-picture blending, a first. However, the 3D performance of the Savage cards was never quite enough to take significant market share. Poor yields meant actual clock speeds were 30% lower than had been projected during development, and the transform and lighting engine implementation was flawed. It became apparent S3's integrated 2D technology was no longer enough to ensure the overall success of the chipset. While S3 could have continued development of the Savage cards, and most likely resolved the outstanding issues, instead in 2001 the S3 management decided to sell off the core business to VIA for $323 million. Subsequently, Savage derived chips turned up in numerous VIA motherboard chipsets as an integrated north bridge solution, such as Twister and UniChrome. More recent discrete derivations have carried the brand names DeltaChrome and GammaChrome. In this manner, S3 derived chips have held onto about a 10% share of the overall PC graphics market. SONICblue SONICblue was an American consumer electronics company resulting from the 1999 merger between computer peripheral maker Diamond Multimedia and graphics chipset maker S3 Incorporated. In November 2000, the combined company changed its name to SONICblue and changed its focus from graphics chipsets and computer peripherals to consumer electronics, such as the Rio line of MP3 players. In January 2001, the graphics chipset business was sold to a joint venture between SONICblue and VIA called S3 Graphics. Later that same year, the company bought ReplayTV, a maker of PVR systems, and Sensory Science Corporation, a company selling dual-deck DVD/VCR systems under the GoVideo brand name. On March 21, 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and sold off its main product lines. On April 16, 2003, D&M; Holdings, the parent company of Denon Ltd. and Marantz Japan Inc. purchased virtually all operating assets from SONICblue and now produces ReplayTV and Rio units under a new subsidiary, Digital Networks North America (DNNA), Inc. The last piece of the company was effectively sold in late 2003, when Best Data acquired the Diamond's Supra modem business along with rights to the Diamond Multimedia name for use in a new video card division. In August 2005, that company said it would discontinue making MP3 players, after it had licensed its digital audio software technology to chipmaker SigmaTel the month before.

From 1994 to 1999, Lytvyn was the aide to President Leonid Kuchma and, later, the head of his office. Early biography and private life Lytvyn was born in Sloboda-Romanivska village in the Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion of the Zhytomyr Oblast. Lytvyn graduated from the Kyiv University (Faculty of History) in 1978. In 1984, he defended his dissertation \\"Efforts of the Communist Party of Ukraine in improving the preparation of teachers in social disciplines\\". Lytvyn started his career at the Kyiv State University (1978‚àí86), then he worked as Head of Directorate in the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Vocational Training of the Ukrainian SSR (1986‚àí89). Between 1989 and 1991 he worked as a political analyst at the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian branch of CPSU. Lytvyn is a correspondent member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Honored Worker of Sciences and Technology of Ukraine. However, in 2002 he was publicly and reasonably accused of plagiarizing a Western scholar when writing his article to Dzerkalo Tyzhnia newspaper. He is married to Tetyana Kostyantynivna (born 1960), an economist. Their daughter Olena (born 1982) is a beauty industry entrepreneur, and their son Ivan (born 1989) is a student.

He became the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (speaker) of the legislature as a compromising figure among the parliamentary factions. Lytvyn refused to take part in the presidential election of 2004 despite his significant political influence. Lytvyn's brother, Mykola Lytvyn was the chief of Ukraine's Border Guard. Lytvyn is known for his ironic political expressions. One of his best- known sentences is \\"I do not protest at forming an artificial majority in our parliament. But I want this majority to include every member of parliament.\\" At the parliamentary elections on March 26, 2006, his Lytvyn's People's Bloc won 2.44% of the popular vote and no seats since it did not meet the 3 percent threshold. Lytvyn's allies (together with other parties) declared the voting results forged, filing a court suit and starting a public campaign.

Decorative door in Florence, Italy. Manual door closer. Use of a door handle in a hotel Design of door furniture is an issue to disabled persons who might have difficulty opening or using some kinds of door, and to specialists in interior design as well as those usability professionals which often take their didactic examples from door furniture design and use. Items of door furniture fall into several categories, described below. Hinges A hinge is a component that attaches one edge of a door to the frame, while allowing the other edge to swing from it. It usually consists of a pair of plates, each with a set of open cylindrical rings (the knuckles) attached to them. The knuckles of the two plates are offset from each other and mesh together. A hinge pin is then placed through the two sets of knuckles and usually fixed, to combine the plates and make the hinge a single unit. One door usually has about three hinges, but it can vary. Handles Doors generally have at least one fixed handle, usually accompanied with a latch (see below). A typical \\"handle set\\" is composed of the exterior handle, escutcheon, an independent deadbolt, and the interior package (knob or lever). On some doors the latch is incorporated into a hinged handle that releases when pulled on. See also: * Doorknob ‚Äì A knob or lever on an axle that is rotated to release the bolt; * Crash bar or Panic bar; * Doorhandles for all types of doors (glass, wooden, etc.) * Flush pull handle for sliding glass door. Locks A lock is a device that prevents access by those without a key or combination, generally by preventing one or more latches from being operated. Often accompanied by an escutcheon. Some doors, particularly older ones, will have a keyhole accompanying the lock. Fasteners Most doors make use of one or more fasteners to hold the door closed. Typical or common fasteners include: * Latch ‚Äì A device that allows one to fasten a door, but doesn't necessarily require an external handle * Bolt ‚Äì A (nearly always) metal shaft usually internal to the door, attached by cleats or a specific form of bracket, that slides into the jamb to fasten a door. ** Latch bolt ‚Äì A bolt that has an angled surface which acts as a ramp to push the bolt in while the door is being closed. By the use of a latch bolt, a door can be closed without having to operate the handle. ** Deadbolt ‚Äì Deadbolts usually extend deeper into the frame and are not automatically retractable the way latch bolts are. They are typically manipulated with a lock on the outside and either a lock or a latch on the inside. Deadbolts are generally used for security purposes on external doors in case somebody tries to kick the door in or use a tool such as a crowbar or a hammer and screwdriver etc. * Strike plate ‚Äì A plate with a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a latch bolt, it typically also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed. (Also known as just \\"strike\\") It's also available as electric strike which allows you to open the door even though the mechanical lock is locked. * Dust Socket - A (nearly always) plastic socket that sits under the Strike plate concealing the rough wood of the mortise. Accessories A typical peephole in a door, allowing the person to see who is outside the door without opening it. Numerous devices exist to serve specific purposes related to how a door should (or should not) be used. See: * Door chain - A device to secure door opening * Door closer ‚Äì Mechanical or electromagnetic device to close an open door (in the event of a fire) * Door opener - Automatic door opening device activated by motion sensors or pressure pads * Door damper ‚Äì A hydraulic device employed to slow the door's closure * Door knocker * Door stop ‚Äì used to prevent the door from opening too far or striking another object * Espagnolette (for a window) * Fingerplate * Letter box or mail slot * Peephole A number of items normally accompany doors but are not necessarily mounted on the door itself, such as doorbells.

Thomas Sutton (1532‚Äì1611) was an English civil servant and businessman, born in Knaith, Lincolnshire. He is remembered as the founder of the London Charterhouse and of Charterhouse School. Life Sutton was the son of an official of the city of Lincoln, and was educated at Eton College and at St John's College, Cambridge.Venn identifies him with a student at St John's College, Cambridge. For much of his life he held the prestigious role of Master of the Ordnance in the North, which meant that he was responsible for military supplies and fortification in the north of England. He also obtained the lease of the manors of Whickham and Gateshead, just south of Newcastle, in 1578, and so gained much of his early wealth from the coal mines in the area and from the sale of this lease five years later. In 1582, he married Elizabeth Dudley, the widow of John Dudley, who was a distant cousin of the earls of Warwick and Leicester, and this marriage more than doubled Sutton's annual rent income. Sutton's connections to the Dudley family were strong throughout his life. Early in his career, Sutton had held a post under the Earl of Warwick, who then helped him to the post of Master of Ordnance in the North in 1569, and the Earl of Leicester, a favorite of Elizabeth, was instrumental in gaining Sutton the lease of Whickham and Gateshead. Sutton bought Howard House from the Earl of Suffolk, which occupied the site of a former Carthusian Monastery on the outskirts of the City of London. Although dissolved by Henry VIII, parts of the monastery still survived. Sutton also purchased the manor of Castle Campes in Cambridgeshire,Shipley, N.R., 'The History of a Manor: Castle Campes, 1580-1629', Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, University of London, Vol. LXVII, 1974, pp. 162-81. which had been in possession of the de Vere familyEdward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sold Castle Campes to Thomas Skinner (d. 1596), whose son, Sir John Skinner, to pay his debts, sold it to Sutton on 2 August 1607; see Shipley, pp. 173-5. for over five hundred years, and, among other landholdings, he also owned the manors of Haddock, Littlebury, and Balsham, all near Saffron Walden in Essex. In 1588 Sutton contributed 100 pounds to defend the realm against the Spanish Armada, and it has been suggested he owned, and perhaps commanded, The Sutton, a barque of seventy tons and thirty men out of Weymouth, which captured a Spanish vessel and her cargo (estimated value of 20,000 pounds).* Later in his career, Sutton became one of the chief moneylenders in England, securing loans worth as little as a few shillings and as much as thousands of pounds to everyone from farmers to some of the most prominent courtiers, businesspeople, and politicians of his era, including Lord Burghley, Sir Edward Coke, Sir Percival Willoughby, Lord Compton, and the Earl of Sussex, among others, generally at the standard rate of ten percent per annum.

This immense wealth earned Sutton the nicknames among his contemporaries of \\"Croesus\\" and \\"Riche Sutton\\". John Aubrey is responsible for the almost certainly spurious legend that Sutton was the original of Volpone the fox in Ben Jonson's Volpone. Sutton left part of his fortune to be invested in establishing an almshouse for 80 impoverished gentlemen, combined with a school for 40 boys, on the site of his house off Charterhouse Square, on the outskirts of the City of London. This institution was to named the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, although it later became known as Sutton's Hospital in Charterhouse. The almshouse survives on the original site; while the school, now Charterhouse School, relocated to Godalming, Surrey, in 1872. The London buildings were badly damaged by bombs during the Second World War, but were restored during the 1950s.

However, the doshu also asked for the Iwama Ryu grading certificates to cease, and in return Hitohiro asked for the Aikikai to announce in publication that the founder's original style is preserved at Iwama.Formal statement by Hitohiro Saito regarding separation from Aikikai (translation and original) The latter did not occur, and Hitohiro also came under pressures within the Iwama group. In November 2003, Hitohiro separated from the Aikikai. By February 2004 he had formed his own organisation (ISSASK). While a number of Morihiro Saito's students preferred to remain affiliated with the Aikikai, others decided to follow Hitohiro Saito upon his break from the organization. Today he teaches full-time at his own Tanrenkan and travels constantly inside Japan and around the world, instructing at seminars attended by hundreds of aikido students each month. Aikido style His Aikido is known for being precise, austere and dynamic; he emphasizes aiki-j≈ç and aiki-ken. As a teacher he is demanding, always insisting in the deep studies of the basis of Aikido as the only way to get to understand the Aikido of the Founder and of his father Morihiro Saito. Personal life Hitohiro Sensei is also a professional chef, calligrapher, painter, and sculptor. In his atelier he carves mostly traditional Japanese masks and shishigashira (ÁçÖÂ≠êÈ†≠ lion mask). His wife and children also practice daily at his dojo, and in 2016 his sons began teaching Aikido seminars internationally.

It was formerly considered a member of the genus Cercopithecus. The diet of Preuss's monkey is primarily fruit, leaves and insects, although the species occasionally raids human crops. It is darkish in coloration with a white chin, and adult males have a blue scrotum. Preuss's monkeys weigh up to 10 kg. Troops consist of one adult male and several females and adolescents, averaging 17 total per troop. Females give birth to a single offspring about once every three years. The young mature at 4 years and live to be an average of 31 years. Preuss's monkey is an endangered species, due to habitat loss and hunting. It is one of the species that live in the Guinean Forests of the West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot.

Common models include a hinged length of wire mounted horizontally on a wall, a thicker axle either recessed into a wall or mounted on a frame, or a freestanding vertical pole on a base. In recent years, automatic toilet paper dispensers which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in public toilets.  Wire on hinge  In the first case, the idea is that the toilet roll maintains contact with the door or wall as the roll's radius decreases. This provides enough friction to allow the user to tear off a piece of tissue. More sophisticated designs include a curved horizontal plate that covers the roll, thus removing the necessity of touching the roll. These roll holders can be used in both orientations, but may be difficult to use in the \\"under\\" orientation.  Horizontal axle in wall  The horizontal axle design is found in most homes, and also in many schools. It is easy to use due to its low friction and ease of refilling. This is the type of holder most commonly assumed about when toilet paper orientation is mentioned. Horizontal freestanding axle Vertical pole toilet roll holder This type of holder is not common, probably because it can get in the way of traffic getting on and off the toilet more than the horizontal axle in the wall.  Vertical pole  Originally intended to hold a stock of replacement rolls, the vertical pole has become the only paper holder in some households. It is particularly useful in homes where the family has mixed handedness. Its drawbacks include that there is a lot more friction than in other types of toilet roll holders, and thus not as easy to use.  Public toilets  The holders in many public toilets are designed to make it difficult for patrons to steal the toilet rolls. Various contraptions have been devised to lock the spare rolls away, and release them only when the active roll is used up. An increasing number of public toilets are furnished with holders that hold very large rolls of toilet paper. Others hold two large rolls with an access door that allows the user to switch between roll one and roll two when one roll is empty. These are designed to save money by reducing the frequency of janitorial services to restock the paper. In many toilets, especially in elementary schools, a dispenser releases only a small square of toilet paper to prevent a user from intentionally clogging the toilet with large amounts of paper.

As of 2018, its population was 246,452. The city covers an area of , and the average temperature is , which is mild for the region. The Sinos River runs through the urban area. Consolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after Hamburg, Germany. Novo Hamburgo's population is still predominantly of German descent. In the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of \\"the national capital of shoes\\", attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the Sinos River Valley, the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain. History The area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of S√£o Leopoldo, the cradle of German immigration in Brazil. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state's main urban centers at that time with food. Some of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from S√£o Leopoldo on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to industrialization. The city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo in 1980. Emancipation http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa- cidade/historia/emancipacao/ In the mid 1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of S√£o Leopoldo. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: Jacob Kroeff Neto, Pedro Adams Filho, Leopodo Petry, Andr√© Klipp, Julius Kunz, Jos√© Jo√£o Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach. On three occasions letters sent to the S√£o Leopoldo council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was Borges de Medeiros who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation. Three years later on the 5 April 1927, Borges de Medeiros signed decree number 3818, known as ‚ÄúThe order Gold‚Äù creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors. Jacob Kroeff Netto was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820. Geography =Hydrography= Novo Hamburgo is part of the River Sinos basin. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the v√°rzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south. =Climate= Novo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around , and in some instances can reach . In the summer the temperatures get high, often above . The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is . Industry Novo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry.http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria- comercio-e-servicos/ The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions. This industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened. One example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, Fenac is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovis√£o Ecovis√£o (Leather Fair). A new Industrial District is being planned in the area of Lomba Grande, however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications. =Export= It is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of Rio Grande do Sul, with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations. Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in Brazil. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars. Shops and services Novo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of Sinos River Valley, with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, Lojas Renner, C&A;, Lojas Americanas, Casas Bahia, Ponto Frio, Lojas Colombo and Delta Sul. In the shopping district there are four large supermarkets(Wal- Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership), Carrefour, Bourbon (Zaffari) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.

The first school in Novo Hamburgo was founded in 1832, called Comunidade Evang√©lica Hamburgo Velho (Old Hamburg Evangelic Community). The school taught through the German language as that was the most common language at that time. The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces. In 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns - The Engel Sisters located in the Hamburgo Velho neighborhood. which would become a \\"Funda√ß√£o Evang√©lica\\" (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women's education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care. The first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900http://pt.scribd.com/doc/33658980/Livro- Colegio-Santa-Catarina-100-Anos-de-Historia by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families - Czermak, Carlos Klein, Jos√© Kroeff, Jo√£o Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz. The Jesuit priests arrived in the Sinos River Valley region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in Hamburgo Velho. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob's college. Feevale University. In 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477. The Vargas Era (1930‚Äì1945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo. In 1943, the city schools had grown to a total of 35, with a total of 3668 students.

Notable buildings along this street are the St. Catherine College, the building of the former Frohsin Society, designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest. The downtown area has landmarks such as the Monument to the Shoemaker, Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension, both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950‚Äì1960. =Natural Attractions Lomba Grande= :pt:Lomba Grande It is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the Sinos River is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both fauna as flora. Lomba Grande also received the first German immigrants who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of Sao Leopoldo. Today provides one of the main points of visiting the city, where the natural attractions of the neighborhood next to developments designed for leisure and tourism attracts many tourists. http://lombagrande.blogspot.com/ They are horse racing, recreational sites, resorts, environmental education center, allowing tourists to enjoy outdoor activities such as horseback riding, adventure tourism, contact with animals, recreation, swimming pools, mountain biking, among a host of other activities. http://www.lombagrande.org.br/index.htm Also in Lomba Grande that are harvested without pesticides the horticultural trade shows that cater to the rural producer in some properties of family farms and cooperatives produce colonial products and integrals. There are restaurants offering food fresh from the colonial neighborhood itself. The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as churches, cemeteries and a roadmap that includes visits to artists. Economy and society The German craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; favelas then formed. Today's Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.

This newspaper had a short life, lasting only nine issues, this was during the period in which Hamburguer Berg was still a district of Sao Leopoldo. There are reports that the Monoclo had an important role in the fight for emancipation of Novo Hamburgo city, despite having closed its activities before Novo Hamburgo was emancipated. The 5 Abril newspaper is considered the first newspaper published in the city of Novo Hamburgo, this was set up by Leopoldo Petry who decided to create the newspaper to defend the interests of the city. The 5 Abril newspapers were published weekly in Portuguese, but with ads in German. The newspaper lasted 35 years, completing 1811 editions. There were four pages per issue and 200 to 300 copies were distributed each week. These were significant numbers for the period, given that the German language was predominant among the 8,500 inhabitants. Over the next 30 to 50 years, there were several newspapers that began publishing in Novo Hamburgo such as: * The Novo Hamburgo newspaper directed by Anthony Benfica Filho, * The Intriga newspaper (1931). * Pau na Nunca newspaper (1931); * Gazeta Novo Hamburgo, led by Octavian Barreto de Borba (1934); * Gazeta newspaper (1948); * Evolucao newspaper (1953); * Correio Gaucho (1955); * Jornal NH (1960). The development of ‚Äúga√∫cho‚Äù journalism generated opportunities for the creation of new newspapers in such as the Jornal SL in 1957 in Sao Leopoldo and Jornal NH, in 1960 in Novo Hamburgo. Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state. Jornal NH is the largest newspaper in the region, one of the largest published in the state and the largest newspaper in Brazil outside a major metropolitan area, by number of subscribers.

Metro http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rs_linhaspoa/novohamb.htm The history of the railways of Rio Grande do Sul date back to 1866 with proposals for construction in the Sinos River Valley region. On 14 April 1874, the first train track between Porto Alegre and Sao Leopoldo was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called The Porto Alegre & New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity. The first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of Hamburguer Berg, the station was built some 3 km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to Canela in 1922. In 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of Hamburgo Velho. In 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to Taquara line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated. In 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of Porto Alegre Metro train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of S√£o Leopoldo, Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.

The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris and the cinematography was by N√©stor Almendros. The film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. With neither the guidance nor the restrictions of society, emotional and physical changes arise as they reach puberty and fall in love. The film contained substantial sexual content. The Blue Lagoon was theatrically released on June 20, 1980 by Columbia Pictures. The film was panned by the critics, who disparaged its screenplay, execution, and Shields's performance; however, Almendros's cinematography received praise. In spite of the criticism, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $58 million on a $4.5 million budget and becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1980 in North America. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, Almendros received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and Atkins was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actor. Shields won the inaugural Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her work in the film. Plot In the late Victorian period, two young cousins, Richard (Glenn Kohan as Young Richard) and Emmeline Lestrange (Elva Josephson as Young Emmeline), and a galley cook, Paddy Button (Leo McKern), survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and reach a lush tropical island. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them by \\"Law\\" from going to the other side of the island, as he had found remains from bloody human sacrifices on an altar there. He also warns them against eating a deadly scarlet berry. Paddy later dies after a drunken binge. Now alone, the children go to another part of the island and rebuild their home. When Richard and Emmeline become teenagers, they begin to fall in love. The experience is stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened by her first menstrual period; she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound. When Richard becomes physically attracted to Emmeline, she does not reciprocate his feelings; Richard responds to the situation by hiding from Emmeline and masturbating. A ship appears for the first time in years, but Emmeline does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard angrily confronts Emmeline about her failure, she asserts‚Äîto Richard's disbelief‚Äîthat the island is their home now and that they should remain there. Emmeline secretly ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. She associates the blood on the altar with the blood of Christ's crucifixion, concludes that the altar is God, and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the Law. The two insult each other. Emmeline reveals that she knows about Richard's masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about it. They throw coconuts at each other, and one coconut hits Richard on the head. Emmeline accidentally steps on a venomous stonefish. Sick and weak, she pleads with Richard to \\"take her to God.\\" Richard carries her to the other side of the island and places her on the altar, offering a prayer. Emmeline recovers and Richard admits his fear of losing her. After Emmeline regains her ability to walk, the two go skinny dipping in the lagoon and then swim to shore. Still naked, Richard and Emmeline discover sexual intercourse. They regularly make love from then on, and Emmeline becomes pregnant. Richard and Emmeline are stunned when they feel the baby move inside her and assume that it is her stomach causing the movements. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy. A ship led by Richard's father, Arthur (William Daniels), approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. When they notice the ship, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signalling for help, content with their lives. As they are covered in mud, their appearance is difficult to determine; Arthur assumes that they are natives. One day, the family takes the lifeboat to visit their original homesite. Richard goes to find bananas for them, leaving Emmeline and Paddy with the boat. Emmeline does not notice when Paddy brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat. Emmeline and Paddy slowly drift away, and Paddy tosses one of the oars out of the boat. Unable to reach the oar, Emmeline shouts to Richard and he swims to her, followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat is caught in the current and drifts out to sea. After drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline awake to find Paddy eating the berries he had picked. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, lying down to await death. A few hours later, Arthur's ship finds them. Arthur asks, \\"Are they dead?\\" The captain (Gus Mercurio) answers, \\"No, sir. They're asleep\\".

The film was a passion project of Randal Kleiser, who had long admired the original novel. He hired Douglas Day Stewart, who had written The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, to write the script and met up with Richard Franklin, the Australian director, who was looking for work in Hollywood. This gave him the idea to use an Australian crew, which Franklin helped supervise.Scott Murray, \\"The Blue Lagoon: Interview with Randal Kleiser\\", Cinema Papers, June‚ÄìJuly 1980 [166-169, 212] The film was shot at Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji. The flora and fauna featured in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents. As it turned out, the iguanas filmed on Fiji were a species hitherto unknown to biologists; this was noted by the herpetologist John Gibbons when he watched the film and after traveling to the island where the iguanas were filmed, he described the Fiji crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis) in 1981. Shields was 14 years of age when she appeared in the film. All of her nude scenes were performed by the film's 32-year-old stunt coordinator, Kathy Troutt. Shields did many of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her breasts.The Blue Lagoon (DVD Special Edition). Released October 5, 1999. Atkins was 18 when the movie was filmed, and he performed his own nude scenes (which included brief frontal nudity). Underwater moving picture photography was performed by Ron and Valerie Taylor.Valerie and Ron Taylor join the action in 'THE BLUE LAGOON', The Australian Women's Weekly, November 19, 1980, pages 64 and 65, Retrieved February 17, 2013 Reception =Critical reception= The Blue Lagoon was panned by critics. It holds a score of 8% on Rotten Tomatoes out of 24 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"A piece of lovely dreck, The Blue Lagoon is a naughty fantasy that's also too chaste to be truly entertaining.\\" Among the more common criticisms were the ludicrously idyllic portrayal of how children would develop outside of civilized society, the unfulfilled buildup of the island's natives as a climactic threat and the way the film, while teasing a prurient appeal, conspicuously obscures all sexual activities. Roger Ebert gave the film 1¬Ω stars out of 4, claiming that it \\"could conceivably have been made interesting, if any serious attempt had been made to explore what might really happen if two 7-year-old kids were shipwrecked on an island. But this isn't a realistic movie. It's a wildly idealized romance, in which the kids live in a hut that looks like a Club Med honeymoon cottage, while restless natives commit human sacrifice on the other side of the island.\\" He also deemed the ending a blatant cop-out. He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their \\"dogs of the year\\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews. Time Out commented that the film \\"was hyped as being about 'natural love'; but apart from 'doing it in the open air', there is nothing natural about two kids (unfettered by the bonds of society from their early years) subscribing to marriage and traditional role-playing.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post similarly called the film \\"a picturesque rhapsody to Learning Skills, Playing House, Going Swimming, Enjoying the Scenery and Starting to Feel Sexy in tropical seclusion.\\" He particularly ridiculed the lead characters' persistent inability to make obvious inferences. Metacritic gave the film a score of 31, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". =Box office= The film was the twelfth-biggest box office hit of 1980 in North America according to The Numbers,https://www.the-numbers.com/market/1980/top-grossing-movies grossing US$58,853,106 in the United States and Canada on a $4.5 million budget.https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Blue-Lagoon- The#tab=summaryhttp://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56372http://www.tcm.com/this- month/article/21857%7C0/The-Blue-Lagoon.html Awards and honors *Main awards **Nominee: Academy Award for Best Cinematography ‚Äì N√©stor Almendros **Nominee: Saturn Award ‚Äì Best Fantasy Film **Nominee: Golden Globe Award, New Star of the Year ‚Äì Christopher Atkins *1st Golden Raspberry Award **Won: Worst Actress (Brooke Shields) *1980 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards **Nominee: Worst Actor (Christopher Atkins) **Won: Worst Actress (Brooke Shields) **Won: Most Intrusive Musical Score **Nominee: Worst On-Screen Couple (Atkins and Shields) *Young Artist Awards **Nominee: Best Major Motion Picture ‚Äì Family Entertainment **Nominee: Best Young Motion Picture Actor ‚Äì Christopher Atkins **Nominee: Best Young Motion Picture Actress ‚Äì Brooke Shields =Other honors= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated Versions and adaptations The Blue Lagoon was based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole's novel of the same name, which first appeared in 1908.

History  On September 20, 1926, Mercyhurst College opened its doors just a few blocks away from the city's southern boundary. It was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of the Diocese of Erie, who were led by Mother M. Borgia Egan, who became the first president of Mercyhurst College. The college received its charter on October 5, 1928, after Mother Egan convinced the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the Sisters of Mercy were a living endowment for the college and worth just as much as a monetary endowment. From the beginning, Mother Egan was determined to make Mercyhurst the \\"beauty spot in the diocese of Erie.\\" Wanting the institution to be a masterpiece of harmony, she directed that the exterior of the college be given as much attention as its interior by hiring prominent architect F. Ferdinand Durang of Philadelphia to create Old Main. It became a masterpiece of English Gothic design and stateliness that has the suggestion of a medieval castle in its lines. With the addition of the college gates in 1950, the Mercyhurst campus became a city landmark. In 1963, the college prep department separated to form Mercyhurst Preparatory School, which is located behind the university. On February 3, 1969, the board of trustees voted to make Mercyhurst a coed college. From its foundation in 1926 until 1972, members of the Sisters of Mercy had been presidents of the college. After 1972, lay presidents led the college. On March 27, 1991, Mercyhurst purchased the 100-year-old Redemptorist Seminary in North East and turned it into a branch campus, offering associate degrees and one-year certificates. In the past two decades, Mercyhurst has become one of the top comprehensive colleges in the North and the second largest Mercy college in America. Among its five campuses, enrollment has grown to well over 4,000 students while full-time faculty employment numbers includes 168 members. The endowment has increased to more than $20 million and its budget is more than $85 million. A $40 million program of building and campus renovation has changed the look of Mercyhurst's 50 structures during the past 20 years. The Mary D'Angelo Performing Arts Center opened in February 1996. Then, in fall 2002, the $7.5 million Audrey Hirt Academic Center opened on the southeast edge of campus, a building funded largely through the college's $22.8 million capital campaign. On October 10, 2004 the Erie Times-News published a story stating that former president Dr. William Garvey molested grade school boys while serving as a basketball coach at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Erie. The article further stated that \\"two current Erie residents told the Erie Times-News that Garvey paid them to have sex with him in the early to mid-1980s, when both men were minors.\\" On December 17 the paper reported that Garvey \\"abruptly announced his retirement Thursday, months before the completion of a college- ordered investigation Garvey had predicted would exonerate him.\\" Several months after Garvey retired, an investigation conducted by retired Erie County Judge Michael Palmisano, at the instruction of the board of trustees, determined that the allegations against Garvey \\"appear[ed] to have merit\\". The campus' central park was once named \\"Garvey Park\\" in honor of Garvey, but following the allegations was renamed to \\"Trinity Green\\". In August 2005, the $5 million Michele and Tom Ridge Health and Safety Building was dedicated at Mercyhurst North East. A $1.3 million residential apartment complex also opened in time for the North East campus' academic year. Also in 2005, the board of trustees authorized the purchase of in Girard as the first step towards developing Mercyhurst West, a two-year college serving western Erie County, northwestern Crawford County and northeastern Ohio. The board of trustees elected Dr. Thomas J. Gamble as the 11th president of Mercyhurst College. Dr. Gamble, who previously served as vice president of academic affairs at the college, assumed the presidency March 1, 2006. The construction of a $14 million freshman residence hall began in fall 2008, and the hall opened in the fall of 2009. Frances Warde Hall, a . building, houses 318 students and contains a convenience store, media room, TV lounges, computer lab, campus printing station and a fitness center. Opened in September 2012 is the Center for Academic Engagement, a four-story, building that will be set into the rolling hill north of Hammermill Library and feature a skywalk over East Main Drive to connect the two facilities. The building, which boasts many green technologies, houses classrooms and lab space for two of Mercyhurst's signature programs‚ÄîIntelligence Studies and Hospitality Management‚Äîas well as the Evelyn Lincoln Institute for Ethics and Society and the Mercyhurst Center for Applied Politics (MCAP). On January 25, 2012, Mercyhurst College officially became Mercyhurst University. The Board of Trustees of Mercyhurst University appointed Michael T. Victor, J.D., LL.D., as the 12th president of Mercyhurst University on May 19, 2015. Victor had served as president of Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, since 2006. Victor served as dean of the Walker School of Business at Mercyhurst from 2002 to 2006. He took office on Aug. 3, 2015. On August 16, 2018, Mercyhurst University opened a $25 million residence hall. Ryan Hall houses more than 350 student suites. It also includes a dining hall, lounge area, convenience store, and a 150-seat banquet hall. Mercyhurst University continues to be guided by the legacy of its founders, the Sisters of Mercy, in educating students in a culture where faith and reason flourish together; where the beauty and power of the liberal arts combine with an appreciation for the dignity of work; and a commitment to serving others. To do this Mercyhurst embraces and lives its five core values, being socially merciful, globally responsible, compassionately hospitable, intellectually creative, and reflectively aware. Campus The university still maintains its campus in North East, Pennsylvania at the site of the former St. Mary's Seminary. The university has also operated Mercyhurst Corry, a school offering an associate degree in business administration, for over 25 years. Meanwhile, a new campus location at the Booker T. Washington Center makes it easier for disadvantaged members of the Erie community to attain a college degree. The university's fifth campus, Mercyhurst West, was located in Girard, Pennsylvania, at the site of the former Faith Lutheran Church. Classes began at this location in fall 2006. Due to low enrollment, the campus closed at the end of the 2013‚Äì2014 school year. Academics Enrollment at Mercyhurst University's Erie campus is nearly 4,500 students. The university formerly was on a trimester calendar and moved to a 4‚Äì1‚Äì4 calendar for the 2013‚Äì2014 school year. Currently, the university is on a traditional semester calendar. It has more than 57 undergraduate degrees and almost 25 percent of the student body chooses to study abroad. Students at Mercyhurst all complete the REACH curriculum, which stands for Reason and Faith, Expression and Creativity, Analytical Thought, Contexts and Systems, and Humans in Connection. The university is organized into four colleges: * The Hafenmaier College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences * The Walker College of Business * The Zurn College of Natural and Health Sciences * The Ridge College of Intelligence Studies & Applied Sciences The school is best known for its programs in biology, archaeology and forensic anthropology, intelligence (ISS- MU & CIRAT), forensic science, dance, music, and art therapy.

It is a scheduled monument and the abbey's ruins are listed at Grade II by Historic England. The adjacent Lesnes Abbey Woods are a Local Nature Reserve.Natural England, Local Nature Reserves, Lesnes Abbey Woods Part of the wood is the Abbey Wood SSSI, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which is an important site for early Tertiary fossils.Natural England citation, Abbey Wood History After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the area of Lesnes, close to the town of Erith, passed into the possession of Bishop Odo and is mentioned in the Domesday Survey as Loisnes in the Hundred of Litlelai.Open Domesday Online: Lesnes The year 1178 saw the foundation of the Abbey of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr at Lesnes. Lesnes Abbey, as it is known, was founded by Richard de Luci, Chief Justiciar of England, in 1178. This may have been in penance for the murder of Thomas Becket, in which he was involved. In 1179, de Luci resigned his office and retired to the Abbey, where he died three months later. He was buried in the chapter house. The abbey is situated in the suburbs of south east London, in the north of an ancient but long-managed Lesnes Abbey Woods that are named after it, where the land rises above what would originally have been marshland. In 1381 Abel Ker of Erith led a local uprising linked to the famous Peasants' Revolt. It actually began in Essex but a mob from Erith burst into nearby Lesnes Abbey and forced the abbot to swear an oath to support them. After this they marched to Maidstone to join the main body of men led by Wat Tyler. The Abbott of Lesnes Abbey was an important local landlord, and took a leading part in draining the marshland. However, this and the cost of maintaining river embankments was one of the reasons given for the Abbey's chronic financial difficulties. It never became a large community, and was closed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, under a licence to suppress monasteries of less than seven inmates. It was one of the first monasteries to be closed after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1534, and the monastic buildings were all pulled down, except for the Abbott's Lodging. Henry Cooke acquired the site in 1541 and it eventually passed to Sir John Hippersley who salvaged building materials, before selling the property to Thomas Hawes of London in 1632. It was then bequeathed to Christ's Hospital in 1633. Some of the stone is said to have been used in the construction of Hall Place in nearby Bexley. The abbey was effectively lost and the area became farmland. with the abbot's house forming part of a farmhouse. It has been restored to show some of the walls and the entire outline of the abbey is visible giving a good idea of the size and atmosphere of the original place. It is on the Green Chain Walk and surrounded by parkland and an ornamental garden. There is a cafe and a small exhibition of the abbey and also toilet facilities for visitors. There is a large externally propped mulberry tree (Morus nigra) at the northern side of the abbey. The site was excavated by Woolwich & District Antiquarian Society in about 1909 to 1910.Woolwich and District Antiquarian Society, \\"Report on Explorations at Lesnes Abbey Kent\\", several volumes 1909 to 1912 Some archaeological finds from the Abbey's site are displayed in Greenwich Heritage Centre, Artillery Square at Woolwich SE18 4DX, others are further east in the museum in Erith Library 100 High Street DA8 1SL. The \\"Missale de Lesnes\\" is in the library of the Victoria & Albert Museum in South Kensington, London. The former London County Council purchased the site of the ruins in 1930, which were opened to the public as a park in 1931. Since 1986, the site has been the property of the London Borough of Bexley. A branch of the Green Chain Walk passes the ruins on its way from Oxleas Wood to Thamesmead riverside. Burials at Lesnes Abbey *Richard de Luci was buried at the abbey on 14 July 1179. Lesnes Abbey ward Lesnes Abbey ward (green) within the London Borough of Bexley (yellow). Today Lesnes Abbey gives its name to one of the London Borough of Bexley's 21 electoral wards. The ruins themselves are in the north of Lesnes Abbey ward. Woolwich Road, the A206 road, cuts through the middle of the ward spanning east to west; the A2041 road spans north to south marking the ward's western boundary. West Heath is located within the ward to the south of Woolwich road. Lesnes Abbey ward is long north to south at its longest point, and little under at its widest point east to east. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 11,346.

Synaptics primarily sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and display manufacturers. Since its founding in 1986, the company's notable innovations include the first ever computer touchpad, touch technology for the click wheel on the classic iPod, touch sensors used in numerous Android phones, touch and display driver integrated chips (TDDI), and biometrics technology for fingerprint sensors. All touch and fingerprint technology on smartphones was based on capacitive sensing up until the introduction of optical fingerprint sensing in late 2016.  History  =19861998= Scientists and engineers Federico Faggin and Carver Mead founded Synaptics in 1986, inspired by their interest in neural networks and how technology might imitate neural networks. Faggin and Mead applied their research and discoveries on neural networks and transistors on chips to build pattern recognition products. The name of the company is a portmanteau, blending synapse and electronics. In 1991, Synaptics patented a refined \\"winner take all\\" circuit for teaching neural networks how to recognize patterns and images, so called because it uses basic physics principles in order to select the strongest signal from the array of different processors. During Synaptics' early years, the laptop industry was struggling to make devices thinner because the spherical trackballs included in them required thicker device builds. Synaptics' founders recognized this issue and in 1992, used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world's first touchpad. By 1994, Twinhead and Epson America had adopted Synaptics' touchpad for their computers, followed by Apple in 1995 and later by other leading computer manufacturers of the time, including Compaq and Dell. =19992010= As adoption of the touchpad grew, Synaptics sought to integrate the technology with other products and expand the company with a range of human interface technologies. In 1999, Francis Lee took over as CEO. The company had an initial public offering in 2002. In 2004, Apple debuted the iPod Mini and fourth-generation iPod, both featuring a scrolling click wheel enabled by Synaptics' capacitive touch technology, and Synaptics also provided a similar, vertical solution for the click wheel of the Creative Zen Touch portable media player. In 2005, Synaptics sensors were featured in the Samsung B310, the first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology ‚Äì and as early 2017, Samsung and many other Android phone manufacturers continued to use Synaptics sensors in their phones. In October 2006, Synaptics provided a live demonstration of the Onyx, a concept smartphone with a color touchscreen enabled by its ClearPad touch controller technology. The Onyx's touch sensor could also tell the difference between a finger and a cheek, preventing accidental inputs during calls. In 2007, LG launched its Prada phone, the world's first mobile phone with a capacitive touchscreen, featuring Synaptics' touch sensors. Synaptics' touchscreen technology was also featured in Logitech's Harmony line of universal remote controls with capacitive-touch capabilities, which debuted in 2008. In 2009, Synaptics revealed the Fuse concept smartphone, which included several features that are now standard in modern smartphones, and showcased it at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2010. The Fuse offered touch sensitivity on the back of the phone, the ability to interact with the phone by squeezing, animated icons, a user interface sensitive to the phone's orientation and tilt, and haptic gestures. =2011present= In 2011, the company appointed Rick Bergman to succeed Francis Lee as CEO. In 2012, Synaptics introduced the first full-function capacitive-touch product that used pressure recognition (i.e. force sensing) to allow for multi-finger and variable-force input. (Apple debuted Force Touch, a similar technology, in 2014.) In late 2013, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor, adding capacitive fingerprint sensing to Synaptics' portfolio. Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. The acquisition enabled Synaptics to integrate offerings of touch and display driver technologies into a single \\"TDDI\\" (Touch and Display Driver Integration) chip. With its growing portfolio of touch, display, and fingerprint offerings, in 2015 the company expanded into additional markets, including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals. In July 2015, Synaptics debuted a unique ‚Äúmatch-in-sensor‚Äù fingerprint authenticator for laptops and other devices that authenticates the fingerprint within the chip itself for greater security. The company debuted the Clear ID FS9100, its first optical- based fingerprint sensor, in December 2016, and after improving the technology, sent it into full production a year later. In January 2018, the Chinese company Vivo announced the X20 Plus UD, a smartphone featuring Synaptics‚Äô Clear ID optical fingerprint sensor. This was the world‚Äôs first full-production smartphone with fingerprint authentication directly in the OLED display. In July 2017, Synaptics acquired Conexant Systems, an Amazon Alexa partner that creates voice and audio software and silicon products for smart homes, for $300 million in cash and 726,666 shares of stock. At the same time, Synaptics acquired Marvell Technology Group's Multimedia Solutions unit, which creates video and audio processing technology, for $95 million. The two acquisitions were intended to aid Synaptics' expansion into the Internet of things market. In Aug. 2019, the board of directors appointed Michael Hurlston as the new CEO.  Technology  As of July 2017, Synaptics held more than 1,900 granted or pending patents for human interface technologies. Many Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor, as opposed to resistive touchscreen technologies, which sense direct pressure and require an amount of force. Synaptics also offers products based on optical sensing technology, which uses light, rather than electrical current, to obtain its readings.  Products  Synaptics Clear ID fingerprint sensor Synaptics' product offerings focus on human machine interface technologies, including touch, display and audio. The company also sells technologies through acquisitions, including fax/modem and imaging solutions. *Touchpad products: Touch-sensitive trackpads that sense the position and movement of one or more fingers on their surfaces. The TouchPad's core market is notebook PCs. *ClearPad touch controllers: Capacitive-touch controllers with minimal size and low power requirements, tailored for compact displays and mobile devices. *Natural ID (capacitive) and Clear ID (optical) fingerprint sensors: Fingerprint authentication sensors combining biometrics and advanced encryption.

More broadly, it may also describe the management of cross-functional, cross-business groups and other work models that do not maintain strict vertical business units or silos grouped by function and geography. Matrix management, developed in U.S. aerospace in the 1950s, achieved wider adoption in the 1970s. Overview There are different types of matrix management, including strong, weak, and balanced, and there are hybrids between functional grouping and divisional or product structuring. For example, by having staff in an engineering group who have marketing skills and who report to both the engineering and the marketing hierarchy, an engineering-oriented company produced \\"many ground-breaking computer systems.\\" This is an example of cross-functional matrix management, and is not the same as when, in the 1980s, a department acquired PCs and hired programmers. Often senior employees, these employees are part of a product- oriented project manager's team but also report to another boss in a functional department. A senior employee who may have worked previously for an advertising agency, designing ads for computers, may now be part of a marketing department at a computer company, but be working with an engineering group. This is often called cross-functional matrix management. Companies that have multiple business units and international operations, upon closer inspection may apply matrix structures in different ways. Even function-based organizations may apply this arrangement for limited projects.Seet, Daniel. \\"Power: The Functional Manager‚Äôs Meat and Project Manager‚Äôs Poison?\\", PM Hut, February 6, 2009.

Interdental consonants may be transcribed with the extIPA subscript plus superscript bridge, as in , if precision is required, but it is more common to transcribe them as advanced alveolars, as in . Interdental consonants are rare cross-linguistically. Interdental realisations of otherwise dental or alveolar consonants may occur as idiosyncrasies or as coarticulatory effects of a neighbouring interdental sound. The most commonly occurring interdental consonants are the non-sibilant fricatives (sibilants may be dental, but do not appear as interdentals). Apparently, interdentals do not contrast with dental consonants within any language. Voiced and voiceless interdental fricatives appear in American English as the initial sounds of words like 'then' and 'thin'. In British English, these consonants are more likely to be dental .

These are rare in English but relatively common in other languages.\\" Most of the words are loanwords from French, with others coming from Spanish, Portuguese, German, or other languages.Bryan A. Garner The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style (2000) p. 100: \\"Diacritical Marks, also known as 'diacritics', are orthographical characters that indicate a special phonetic quality for a given character. They occur mostly in foreign languages. But in English a fair number of imported terms have diacritical marks\\" [revised version of text in Garner Garner's Modern American Usage (2009)] The grave accent ( \` ) and the diaeresis mark ( ¬® ) are the only diacritics native to Modern English, but their usage is considered to be largely archaic.On Diacritics and Archa√Øsm. Flakery.org, June 18, 2006. Proper nouns are not generally counted as English terms except when accepted into the language as an eponym ‚Äì such as Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller tube, or the English terms roentgen after Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, and biro after L√°szl√≥ B√≠r√≥, in which case any diacritical mark is often lost. Unlike continental European languages, English orthography tends to use digraphs (like \\"ph\\", \\"sh\\", \\"oo\\", and \\"ea\\") rather than diacritics to indicate more sounds that can be accommodated by the letters of the Latin alphabet. Unlike other systems (such as Spanish orthography) where the spelling indicates the pronunciation, English spelling is highly varied, and diacritics alone would be insufficient to make it reliably phonetic. (See .) Types of diacritical marks Though limited, the following diacritical marks in English may be encountered, particularly for marking in poetry:John Lennard, The Poetry Handbook (2006), p. 57: \\"Though limited in English the following may be encountered: acute (n√©e) and grave (chang√®d) accents, modifying vowels or marking stresses; the circumflex (entrep√¥t), indicating omitted s; the diaeresis (na√Øf), preventing a diphthong, or umlaut (√ºber), altering Germanic vowels; the cedilla (soup√ßon), softening c; the tittle (fr≈ç [sic]), indicating omitted n or m, or macron (stat≈´s), lengthening vowels; the tilde (Se√±or), indicating palatalised n; and the breve (dr≈èll = 'drol', not 'drowle'), shortening vowels....\\" * the acute accent (n√©e) and grave accent (English poetry marking, chang√®d), modifying vowels or marking stresses * the circumflex (entrep√¥t), borrowed from French * the diaeresis (Zo√´), indicating a second syllable in two consecutive vowels * the tittle, the dot found on the regular small i and small j, is removed when another diacritic is required * the macron (English poetry marking, lƒìad pronounced 'leed', not 'led'), lengthening vowels, as in MƒÅori; or indicating omitted n or m (in pre-Modern English, both in print and in handwriting). * the breve (English poetry marking, dr≈èll pronounced 'drol', not 'drowle':), shortening vowels. * the umlaut (√ºber), altering Germanic vowels * the cedilla (soup√ßon), in French, Portuguese and in Catalan it is a softening c, indicating 's-' not 'k-' pronunciation * the tilde (Se√±or), in Spanish indicating palatalised n (although in Spanish and most source languages, it is not considered a diacritic over the letter n but rather as an integral part of the distinct letter √±) In representing European personal names, anthroponyms, and place names, toponyms, the following are often encountered: * the h√°ƒçek (as in Karel ƒåapek), often also called the haƒçek in English (adapted from \\"h√°ƒçek\\", the Czech name ), as ƒå/ƒç, ≈†/≈°, ≈ò/≈ô (only in Czech), ≈Ω/≈æ broadly turns \\"c\\" \\"s\\" \\"r\\" \\"z\\" into English \\"ch\\" \\"sh\\" \\"≈ô a simultaneous rr() and si .\\" \\"zh\\" sounds respectively, and ƒé/ƒè, ƒΩ/ƒæ (only in Slovak), ≈á/≈à and ≈§/≈• turn \\"d\\" \\"l\\" \\"n\\" and \\"t\\" into palatal \\"dy\\" \\"ly\\" \\"ny\\" and \\"ty\\" sounds. In most fonts the caron looks like an apostrophe sitting inside the Slovak capital L, as \\"ƒΩ\\", but in fact is only another form of caron. * the Polish crossed ≈Å and nasal ogonek (as in Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa) a \\"dark L\\", nearer an English \\"W\\", and a nasal \\"e\\", nearer English \\"en\\" (in Polish called \\"crossed ≈Å\\" or pronounced rather similary to GA 'oh'. and , \\" little tail\\") * the Croatian and Serbian crossed ƒê (as in Franjo Tuƒëman or Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá), equivalent to the Cyrillic letter Dje * the Maltese crossed ƒ¶ (as in the ƒ¶al- town prefix, ƒ¶al Far Industrial Estate), a hard H * the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish over-ring √Ö (as in the √Öland Islands), the √• vowel sound * the Romanian »ò (as in Chi»ôinƒÉu), the voiceless postalveolar fricative For a more complete list see diacritical marks. =Special characters= Some sources distinguish \\"diacritical marks\\" (marks upon standard letters in the A‚ÄìZ 26-letter alphabet) from \\"special characters\\" (letters not marked but radically modified from the standard 26-letter alphabet) such as Old English and Icelandic eth (√ê, √∞) and thorn (uppercase √û, lowercase √æ), and ligatures such as Latin and Anglo-Saxon √Ü (minuscule: √¶), and German eszett (√ü; final -√ü, often -ss even in German and always in Swiss- German).Karen Cheng, Designing Type (2006) p. 212: \\"The eszett (also spelled esszett or referred to as a 'sharp s') is not a diacritic, but a ligature that occurs only in the German language.

Native English words In some cases, the diacritic is not borrowed from any foreign language but is purely of English origin. The second of two vowels in a hiatus can be marked with a diaeresis (or \\"tr√©ma\\") ‚Äì as in words such as co√∂perative, da√Øs and re√´lect ‚Äì but its use has become less common, sometimes being replaced by the use of a hyphen.diaeresis: December 9, 1998.

Straight Dope Message Board. and MIT Technology Review under Jason Pontin have maintained such usage as house styles. The diaeresis mark is also in rare cases used over a single vowel to show that it is pronounced separately (as in Bront√´). It is often omitted in printed works because the sign is missing on modern keyboards. The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (r√©bel vs. reb√©l) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (cal√©ndar); the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (warn√®d, parl√¨ament). =In historical versions of English= The Old English Latin alphabet began to replace the Runic alphabet in the 8th century, due to the influence of Celtic Christian missionaries to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The orthography of Old English ‚Äì which was entirely handwritten in its own time ‚Äì was not well standardized, though it did not use all the Latin letters, and included several letters not present in the modern alphabet. When reprinted in modern times, an overdot is occasionally used with two Latin letters to differentiate sounds for the reader: * ƒã is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /tÕ° É/ * ƒ° for a palatal approximant /j/ (probably a voiced palatal fricative / ù/ in the earliest texts) Some modern printings also apply diacritics to vowels following the rules of Old Norse normalized spelling developed in the 19th century. In the Late Middle English period, the shape of the English letter √æ (thorn), which was derived from the Runic alphabet, evolved in some handwritten and blackletter texts to resemble the Latin letter y. The √æ shape survived into the era of printing presses only as far as the press of William Caxton. In later publications, thorn was represented by \\"y\\", or by ·∫è to distinguish thorn from y. By the end of the Early Modern English period, thorn had been completely replaced in contemporary usage by the digraph \\"th\\" (reviving a practice from early Old English), and the overdot was no longer needed outside of printings of very old texts. The overdot is missing from the only surviving usage of a Y-shaped thorn, in the archaic stock phrase ye olde (from \\"√æe olde\\", pronounced \\"the old\\", but \\"ye olde\\" is often misanalyzed and pronounced with the modern \\"y\\" sound).  Words imported from other languages  Non-English loanwords enter the English language by a process of naturalisation, or specifically anglicisation, which is carried out mostly unconsciously (a similar process occurs in all other languages). During this process there is a tendency for accents and other diacritics that were present in the donor language to be dropped (for example French h√¥tel and French r√¥le becoming \\"hotel\\" and \\"role\\" respectively in English, or French √† propos, which lost both the accent and space to become English \\"apropos\\").Bryan A. Garner, Garner's Modern American Usage (2009) p. 248: \\"Sometimes they survive indefinitely, but often they fall into disuse as terms are fully naturalised. Nobody today, for example, writes h√¥tel or r√¥le.\\" In many cases, imported words can be found in print in both their accented and unaccented versions. Since modern dictionaries are mostly descriptive and no longer prescribe outdated forms, they increasingly list unaccented forms, though some dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, do not list the unaccented variants of particular words (e.g., soup√ßon). Words that retain their accents often do so to help indicate pronunciation (e.g. frapp√©, na√Øve, souffl√©), or to help distinguish them from an unaccented English word (e.g. expos√©, r√©sum√©, ros√©). Technical terms or those associated with specific fields (especially cooking or musical terms) are less likely to lose their accents (such as the French soup√ßon, fa√ßade and entr√©e). Some Spanish words with the Spanish letter √± have been naturalised by substituting English ny (e.g. Spanish ca√±√≥n is now usually English canyon, Spanish pi√±√≥n is now usually English pinyon pine). Certain words like pi√±ata, jalape√±o and quincea√±era are usually kept intact. In many instances the √± is replaced with the plain letter n. In words of German origin, the letters with umlauts √§, √∂, √º may be written ae, oe, ue.Robbin D. Knapp, \\"German English Words: A Popular Dictionary of German Words Used in English\\" (2005) p. 108: \\"When German words with umlauts are assimilated into the English language, they sometimes keep their umlauts (e.g., doppelg√§nger, Fl√ºgelhorn, f√∂hn, Der Freisch√ºtz, f√ºhrer, j√§ger, k√ºmmel, K√ºnstlerroman, schweizerk√§se, √ºber-), but often are ...\\" This could be seen in many newspapers during World War II, which printed Fuehrer for F√ºhrer. However, today umlauts are usually either left out, with no e following the previous letter, or in sources with a higher Manual of Style (such as The New York Times or The Economist) included as German. Zurich is an exception since it is not a case of a \\"dropped umlaut\\", but is a genuine English exonym, used also in French (from Latin Turicum) written without the umlaut even alongside other German and Swiss names that retain the umlaut in English.Diccon Bewes Swiss Watching 2012 \\"In English, the most daring thing we do now is leave the umlaut off Z√ºrich; not that any British ear would hear the difference anyway. For other official names, such as the houses of parliament, I have given only the German version, as it's the one used most often.\\" =Accent-addition and accent-removal= As words are naturalized into English, sometimes diacritics are added to imported words that originally did not have any, often to distinguish them from common English words or to otherwise assist in proper pronunciation. In the cases of mat√© from Spanish mate (; ), anim√© from Japanese anime, and latt√© or even latt√® from Italian latte (; ), an accent on the final e indicates that the word is pronounced with a diphthongised \\"e{h/y}\\" sound (the diphthong , ) at the end, rather than the e being silent. Examples of a partial removal include resum√© (from the French r√©sum√©) and haƒçek (from the Czech h√°ƒçek) because of the change in pronunciation of the initial vowels. Complete naturalization stripping all diacritics also has occurred, in words such as canyon, from the Spanish ca√±√≥n. For accurate readings, some speech writers use diacritics to differentiate homographs, such as lƒìad (pronounced like leed) and lƒïad (pronounced like led). Not to be forgotten are adjectives such as learn√®d and belov√®d, which are pronounced with two and three syllables respectively, unlike the past participles learned and beloved, which are each pronounced with one fewer syllable.  Regional differences  =Canada= In Canadian English, words of French origin retain their orthography more often than in other English- speaking countries, such as the usage of √© (e with acute) in caf√©, Montr√©al, n√©e, Qu√©bec, and r√©sum√©. This is due to the large influence afforded by French being one of Canada's two official languages at the federal government level as well as at the provincial level in New Brunswick and Manitoba, and the majority and sole official language in Qu√©bec. =New Zealand= New Zealand English includes words derived from the Maori language, which uses a macron (MƒÅori: tohut≈ç) to indicate vowel length. In English, the vowel length of these words is indicated in three ways: no change (Maori), doubling the vowel (Maaori), or using a macron (MƒÅori). An umlaut has sometimes been used (M√§ori) in place of a macron where the technical capacity to display a macron is limited. Since 2000, macrons are increasingly common in New Zealand English; both of the main newspaper chains had adopted macrons in their print and online editions in May 2018.

Hebrew and Greek, with their vowel points and accents, and music posed problems of vertical as well as horizontal ..\\" However problems with representation of diacritical marks continued even in scholarly publishing and dissertations up to the word processor era.Scholarly publishing (1982), p. 335: \\"... after printed copies of the dissertation ‚Äì printed by the traditional letterpress process, from metal type ‚Äì had been deposited in ... The original languages often required diacritical marks not used in English or an alphabet other than the Roman.\\" Mechanical typewriter keyboards manufactured for English-speaking countries seldom include diacritics. The first generation of word processors also had character set limitations,Rosemary Sassoon Computers and Typography (1993) p. 59: \\"character set limitations\\" and confusion due to typesetting convention was exacerbated in the character coded environment due to limitations of the ASCII character set.Horst Bunke, Patrick Shen-pei Wang Handbook of character recognition and document image analysis (1997) p. 276: \\"Confusion due to typesetting convention is exacerbated in the character coded environment due to the unfortunate limitations of the ubiquitous ASCII character set and the lack of a single widely accepted international standard for representation of characters with diacritics\\"  References   See also  * Lists of English words by country or language of origin * List of French expressions in English * List of German expressions in English Diacritics English terms ","title":"English terms with diacritical marks"},{"id":"1135008","text":"is a Japanese multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and frontman for the Southern All Stars, as well of his own solo band, the Kuwata band. He has also done a significant amount of scoring music for films. He went to Aoyama Gakuin University. In 2010, Southern All Stars was ranked #1, and Kuwata's solo band, the Kuwata Band, ranked #12 on a list of the top 100 musicians in Japan. Kuwata has worked as a record producer, a movie director, has recorded albums as bandleader of his own band, the Kuwata Band, and has worked on projects scoring music to film.  Biographical information  Keisuke Kuwata was born February 26, 1956, and raised in Chigasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Kuwata's wife, Yuko Hara, is also a member of the Southern All Stars. She is a vocalist and plays keyboards. The two met while in college, where they were in the same circle of musicians. They married in 1982, after the success of the band's single Chako no Kaiganmonogatari, and invited 3000 fans of the band to their wedding reception. They share a love of the blues and have two sons together. On July 28, 2010, Kuwata announced that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.Pop Vocalist Keisuke Kuwata Diagnosed With Cancer The operation to remove the cancer was successful and he has made several public appearances since June 2011.  Musical style  Yuko Hara on keyboards during the Southern All Stars' 30th Anniversary concert Kuwata plays guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. For one album, Suteki Na Mirai Wo Mite Hoshii (Á¥†Êïµ„Å™Êú™Êù•„ÇíË¶ã„Å¶Ê¨≤„Åó„ÅÑ), Kuwata played every musical instrument and recorded the entire album himself. Kuwata's Western musical influences are varied. Along with his wife, the band's keyboardist and backing vocalist, Yuko Hara, the couple have long been inspired by American folk music, where preferences run from Bob Dylan, The Band, Blues, and Southern rock music, to British and American influences that are arguably pure rock and Roll; with a flattering number of songs covered from the work of Eric Clapton. Aside from Dylan, Kuwata's work has shown emphasis on music of the American South, including that of Creedence Clearwater Revival and Little Feat. Along with the Southern All Stars, Kuwata has performed with Little Feat on several occasions, and recorded cover songs from the band. He was a participant and performer in a tribute concert to the late Lowell George, (Little Feat's original frontman), recording a medley on video that contained his version of \\"Dixie Chicken\\". In 1991, Kuwata began a series of concerts, similar to MTV Unplugged performances, called the \\"Acoustic Revolution\\", featuring Hirokazu Ogura on guitar, and Yoshiyuki Sahashi on mandolin, along with other musicians using acoustic instruments. Here again, Dylan's influence shone through their work choosing standards including \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Kuwata also developed a love for rock music. The influence from Eric Clapton is strong and can be heard even when Kuwata performs songs in same manner and style as those that Clapton himself covered, and did not write. In addition, other artists covered have been Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, and Sam Cooke. In 1994, the \\"On Air Music Fair\\", \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" by Bob Marley was performed by Kuwata and Ann Lewis.  Philanthropy  Kuwata has performed with his band, and collaborated with several others annually to donate money towards AIDS research and treatment. To draw the largest possible audiences, Kuwata performs additional Western songs so the concerts are more inclusive. Depending upon the year of the concert, sometimes the chosen songs have a theme. Kuwata has been joined in benefit concerts by other bands and musicians. Most notable is the frequent appearance of , a band featuring guitarists and . The band features a combination of jazz, blues, and rock, along with their own combination of ambient experimental music. Yamagen is considered a \\"guitar support unit\\", in the same way Westerners would think of a horn section.

Early life Adair was born in Los Angeles County in 1943. He grew up in New Mexico, where his father, John, an anthropologist who was studying the Navajo people. He went to Antioch College (based in Yellow Springs, Ohio). Career Adair entered the film industry in the 1960s and first gained critical attention with his 1967 documentary Holy Ghost People, a film record of a Pentecostal snake handler worship service in the Appalachians. After he realised he was gay, he decided to make a film about it. From 1975 to 1977, he collaborated with his lesbian sister Nancy Adair and other members of the Mariposa Film Group to produce and direct Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives. The film, the first of its kind to present gays and lesbians in a positive light, was a critical hit nationwide. Word Is Out inspired Nancy to collaborate with Casey Adair, Peter and Nancy's mother, on a companion book, published in 1978. Peter Adair always chose the subject matter for his film based on his current passions, and Word Is Out was as much a vital part of his own coming out process as it was an attempt to show gays and lesbians in a very human and non-sensational manner. In 1984 Adair produced and directed Stopping History, which examined ethical questions around nuclear weapons. Then in 1984 acted as consultant and did additional camerawork on The Times of Harvey Milk, directed by his former prot√©g√© Rob Epstein. That same year he worked with the Project Read adult literacy program of the San Francisco Public Library to produce a series of tutoring videos. In 1986, he made \\"Modern Selling\\", a tongue-in-cheek industrial film, made in a mock-'40s style, that shows bank loan officers how to treat their female clients. =Late career= As he began to see his friends in the art and film communities succumb to the plague of AIDS, Adair co-directed, with Rob Epstein, The AIDS Show: Artists Involved in Death and Survival, one of the first films to examine AIDS' impact on the arts community, in 1986. When he became aware of his own HIV status, he wrote and directed Absolutely Positive in 1991, an examination of how asymptomatic HIV positive people live with uncertainty. The 11 interviewees are seen at different stages of the disease and how they are coping with their illnesses in different ways. Peter and his producer Janet Cole, had interviewed 120 people before selecting the 11 most interesting including; Doris, a soprano in her Baptist church choir who discovered she was HIV positive when her baby son was diagnosed with AIDS; Gregg, a gay San Francisco-based model, and Juan, a young husband and father who was infected by his late first wife, a drug addict. In 1995, Adair and Haney Armstrong completed \\"In the First Degree,\\" an interactive CD-ROM featuring live actors. It was published by Broderbund Software. In January 1996, he received The Frameline Award (Given in San Francisco to a person or entity that has made a major contribution to LGBT representation in film, television, or the media arts). In June 1996, Adair succumbed to complications of AIDS at the age of 52 in Bernal Heights, San Francisco. Awards He won many awards, including the Columbia-Dupont Citation for Broadcast Excellence, Golden Gate Award, EMMY, James D. Phelan Award, Distinguished Documentary Achievement, Blue Ribbon, Red Ribbon, American Film Festival and the Prix l'Age d'Or.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees (1983), Cleveland Indians (1984‚Äì87), Montreal Expos (1988‚Äì90), Atlanta Braves (1991‚Äì93, 1999), Boston Red Sox (1994), Texas Rangers (1995), Toronto Blue Jays (1996‚Äì97), Los Angeles Dodgers (1997), Minnesota Twins (1998) and a final return to the Atlanta Braves (1999), in a career that spanned from 1983 to 1999. Nixon has the most career stolen bases (620) for a player who never appeared in an MLB All-Star game since the All-Star Game began in 1933. Career In the minor leagues, Nixon led the league twice in stolen bases ( in the South Atlantic League with 67 & in the International League with 94), runs scored (1980 in the South Atlantic League with 124 & 1983 in the International League with 129), hits (162 in 1983 in the International League), at bats (557 in 1983 in the International League) and walks (57 in 1979 in the Appalachian League, 113 in 1980 in the South Atlantic League and 110 in 1981 in the Southern League). He started out as an infielder but was switched to outfield in 1983 due to his superior speed and frequency of errors (56 in 127 games in 1981 at shortstop for the Nashville Sounds). In 1982, Nixon stole 107 bases in a combined season between the AA level Nashville Sounds and the AAA level Columbus Clippers. In 17 seasons Nixon played with the New York Yankees (1983), Cleveland Indians (1984‚Äì87), Montreal Expos (1988‚Äì90), Atlanta Braves (1991‚Äì93. 1999), Boston Red Sox (1994), Texas Rangers (1995), Toronto Blue Jays (1996‚Äì97), Los Angeles Dodgers (1997) and Minnesota Twins (1998). Nixon shares the single game stolen base Major League record with 6 on June 16, 1991. He also holds the Atlanta Braves single season record for stolen bases with 72 in 1991. On July 25, 1992, Nixon made a catch over the wall to rob Andy Van Slyke of a home run, a catch that was replayed many times on sports news programs. Nixon made the final out of the 1992 World Series attempting to bunt for a base hit with a runner on third and 2 out in extra innings of Game 6. Nixon had successfully bunted for base hits many times for the Braves. On his previous at-bat, Nixon had singled home the tying run (swinging, not bunting) with 2 out in the bottom of the ninth to send Game 6 to extra innings. It was the second World Series in history to end on a bunt. (Lee Lacy of the Dodgers popped out on a bunt attempt to end the 1977 World Series.) In the 1999 National League Championship Series, 40-year-old Nixon made one of the key plays to save the series for the Braves. After the Braves had blown 5-0 and 7-3 leads in Game 6 and trailed 8-7 in the 8th inning, Nixon pinch ran at 1st base with 1 out and changed the momentum of the game and the series by stealing second and going to third when the throw went into center field. Nixon went on to score the tying run, and the Braves eventually won the game in extra innings. In his career, Nixon batted .270 hitter with 11 home runs, 318 RBI, 878 runs, 1379 hits, 142 doubles, 27 triples, and 620 stolen bases in 1709 games. In his post season career, Nixon hit .321 with a .396 OB%, 13 runs and 11 stolen bases in 24 games. In eight career World Series games, Nixon hit .310 with five stolen bases.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nixonot01.shtml Personal Nixon's younger brother, Donell Nixon, is also a former Major League Baseball player, playing from 1987 until 1990. Nixon battled a cocaine habit for much of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1987 while a member of the Cleveland Indians organization. Nixon failed a drug test in September 1991 and was suspended for 60 days, which caused him to miss the 1991 World Series. In 2000, he married former R&B; singer Perri Reid. They divorced in 2004. In an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on SiriusXM, Nixon discussed how he overcame his demons and conquered his drug and alcohol addiction.Last Call podcast, Otis Nixon discusses how he conquered his demons, Hardcore Sports Radio / Last Call, February 11, 2010.

The cause of his death has since been debated, although several different theories concerning it have been suggested. History of illness Arafat's illness began on 12 October 2004 with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Soon afterward, his general health deteriorated. Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt, Arafat was taken to France on a French government jet, and was admitted to the H√¥pital d'instruction des arm√©es Percy in Clamart, a suburb of Paris, on 29 October 2004. On admission, he was suffering from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and generalised abdominal pain, along with mild liver and kidney failure linked to disseminated intravascular coagulation. His condition deteriorated with acute renal failure, and, on 3 November, he lapsed into a gradually deepening coma. A controversy erupted between officials of the PNA and Suha Arafat when officials from the PNA traveled to France to see Yasser Arafat. Suha stated, \\"They are trying to bury Abu Ammar [Arafat] alive\\". French law forbids physicians from discussing the condition of their patients with anybody, with the exception, in the case of a grave prognosis, of close relatives. Accordingly, all communications concerning Arafat's health had to be authorized by his wife. Palestinian officials expressed regret that the news about Yasser Arafat was \\"filtered\\" by her. The next day, chief surgeon Christian Estripeau of Percy reported that Arafat's condition had worsened, and that he had fallen into a deeper coma. Sheikh Taissir Tamimi, the head of the Islamic court of the Palestinian territories, who held a vigil at Arafat's bedside, visited Arafat, and declared that it was out of the question to disconnect him from life support, since, according to him, such an action is prohibited in Islam. Death Arafat mausoleum Arafat was pronounced dead on 11 November 2004 at 03:30 UTC at the age of 75 of what French doctors called a massive haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident. However, the underlying infection was declared unknown. The official statement announcing his death failed to determine a cause, saying only that he had a \\"mystery blood disorder\\". The Canard Encha√Æn√© newspaper reported alleged leaks of information by unnamed medical sources at Percy hospital that had access to Arafat and his medical file. According to the newspaper, the doctors at Percy hospital suspected, from Arafat's arrival, grave lesions of the liver responsible for an alteration of the composition of the blood; Arafat was therefore placed in a hematology service. Leukemia was \\"soundly ruled out\\". According to the same source, the reason why this diagnosis of cirrhosis could not be made available was that, in the mind of the general public, cirrhosis is generally associated with the consequences of alcohol abuse. Even though the diagnosis was not of alcoholic cirrhosis and Arafat was not known for consuming any alcohol, there was a likelihood of rumors. The source explained that Arafat's living conditions did little to improve the situation. Thus, according to the source, the probable causes of the disease were multiple; Arafat's coma was a consequence of the worsened cirrhosis. The French newspaper Le Monde quoted doctors as saying that he suffered from \\"an unusual blood disease and a liver problem\\". After Arafat's death, the French Ministry of Defence said that Arafat's medical file would be transmitted to only his next of kin. It was determined that Arafat's nephew and PNA envoy to the UN, Nasser al-Qudwa, was a close enough relative, thus working around Suha Arafat's silence on her husband's illness. Nasser al-Qudwa was given a copy of Arafat's 558-page medical file by the French Ministry of Defence. Theories about the cause of death Palestinian honor guard stationed at Arafat's temporary tomb in Ramallah There are numerous theories about the cause of Arafat's death. Initially Arafat's records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials. In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath has said after talks with Arafat's French doctors that they had \\"ruled out completely poison\\". However, Shaath recently stated in \\"The Price of Kings\\", a documentary on Arafat's leadership, \\"I have no doubt that he was assassinated. The French said that whatever toxic material was in his body did not test positive in their toxicology table, saying in plain words \\"this was a poison we did not have in our laboratories.\\"https://www.spiritlevelfilm.com/thepriceofkings/landingb/ Al- Kurdi, Arafat's personal physician for 18 years, said \\"I would usually be summoned to attend to Arafat immediately, even when all he had was a simple cold ... But when his medical situation was really deteriorating, they chose not to call me at all\\", and Arafat's wife, Suha, refused to allow him to visit Arafat in the private Paris hospital where he was being treated. Later he was denied access to Arafat's body after his death. Al-Kurdi also lamented that Arafat's widow Suha had refused an autopsy, which he said would have answered many questions regarding cause of death. Medical records released in 2005 showed that Arafat's doctors could not agree on the cause of death, stating that he died from a stroke that stemmed from an unknown condition. Analysis based on those records suggested him dying from poisoning, AIDS, or an infection. In 2012, newly released medical records revealed that French doctors initially diagnosed Arafat with gastroenteritis. =AIDS= In September 2005, based on obtained Arafat records, an Israeli AIDS expert claimed that Arafat bore all the symptoms of AIDS, while The New York Times claimed it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from AIDS. John Loftus reported on ABC radio that Arafat had died of AIDS. According to Loftus, the CIA had knowledge of his condition, and convinced Israel not to assassinate him and wait for his inevitable death of the disease, since the subsequent widespread connotations of the disease with homosexuality would discredit him. Arafat's personal doctor for 18 years, Dr. Ashraf Al-Kurdi, said Arafat suffered from AIDS. However an article published in a number of American news publications rejected the assertion that Arafat had AIDS, stating, \\"An Israeli infectious disease specialist said he would have performed the test, if only to be thorough and to refute the rumors that surrounded the case. He said news accounts during Arafat's illness made him strongly suspect that Arafat had AIDS. But after studying the records, he said that was improbable, given the sudden onset of the intestinal troubles\\", though AIDS-associated opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis can begin in this way. This same article also states that it is \\"highly unlikely\\" that Arafat had died from poisoning, and further asserts that Arafat had died from a stroke linked to an \\"underlying infection.\\" =High-tech laser= In 2005, Palestinian ambassador to Sri Lanka Attalah Quiba alleged that Arafat was killed by two Israelis with a high-tech laser, and the two Israelis attempted to flee but were \\"wrestled down by Palestinian Security personnel\\". Quiba also alleged that 16 countries had tested the blood of Arafat, and determined that Arafat was poisoned through \\"high technology\\". =Gastroenteritis= New medical records that were released in July 2012 showed that Arafat's condition was initially diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis by his Arab doctors who took care of him in the West Bank in the Mukataa before he was airlifted to France, although his condition later improved and he even joined in the fast of Ramadan. However, there was persistent vomiting and diarrhea, Arafat began feeling weaker, and his blood platelet count dropped. On 28 October, his medical team decided to send him abroad, and he was flown to France the next morning. Dr Joseph Zimmerman, an Israeli specialist who reviewed the Ramallah medical file said Arafat's early symptoms were not consistent with viral gastroenteritis, and did not believe that type of viral infection would lead to death. He also said that poisoning appeared unlikely, even by a radioactive substance such as polonium-210. He reminded people that Arafat's platelet counts dropped suddenly and stayed low, and that Arafat eventually exhibited signs of liver dysfunction, which could have been caused by a bacterial infection, but is not typical of poisoning. =Platelet disorder= A report by the French doctors who treated him states that a platelet disorder caused Arafat's death. The cause of this platelet disorder is unknown, although poison is a possibility. =Poisoning= In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said after talks with Arafat's French doctors that they had \\"ruled out completely poison\\". A 2005 article in The New York Times said that based on his records it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from poisoning. Meanwhile, al-Kurdi called for the creation of an independent commission to carry out investigations concerning Arafat's suspicious death, stating, \\"any doctor would tell you that these are the symptoms of a poisoning\\". Former Knesset member, peace activist and personal friend of Arafat Uri Avnery claimed at the time of Arafat's death that he had been poisoned, and repeated the claim in 2012.Uri Avnery,Poisoning Arafat, at CounterPunch, 6‚Äì8 July 2012. Another \\"senior Israeli physician\\" claimed in an article in Haaretz that it was \\"a classic case of food poisoning\\", probably caused by a meal eaten four hours before he fell ill that may have contained a toxin such as ricin, rather than a standard bacterial poisoning. However, in the same week as the report in Haaretz, The New York Times published a separate report, also based on access to Arafat's medical records, which claimed that it was highly unlikely that Arafat had food poisoning. Poisoning with thallium In 2009, Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's former advisor, alleged that Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel, had poisoned Arafat by a lethal dose of thallium,Arafat's aide: New information on president's death , Ma'an News Agency, 10 January 2011. a rare chemical whose effects are difficult to trace, via Arafat's daily medications. Abu Sharif alleged that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had held the driver of a Palestinian ambulance that brought him his medications, for a minimum of 30 minutes while the IDF searched it. According to Abu Sharif, this incident would have allowed Israel to replace Arafat's medications with poison. In his book Arafat and the Dream of Palestine: An Insider's Account, Abu Sarif wrote, \\"I was positive they were poisoning his food on a daily basis and doing it right under our very eyes.\\" In 2011, Abu Sarif alleged that an investigation conducted by \\"the most prominent forensic toxicology expert in the UK\\" had revealed that thallium was responsible for poisoning Arafat. According to Abu Sharif, European toxicology experts are not familiar with thallium and only this forensic toxicology expert could have identified the thallium. However, Abu Sharif did not reveal the names of the expert or the institution responsible for the research. As a result of Abu Sharif's allegations, the delegates at the August 2009 Fatah convention in Bethlehem voted for a resolution which blamed Israel for poisoning Yasser Arafat. An editorial in The Jerusalem Post questioned the legitimacy of Abu Sharif's allegations, noting that \\"nobody asked how Abu Sharif came to possess this information, whether he can back it up or why he chose to divulge it so late\\". A leader of Fatah and a nephew of Arafat said that an investigation indicated a \\"high possibility of poisoning\\" but that there was not any proof. Poisoning with polonium According to Israel Radio, a former Palestinian intelligence officer, attorney Fahmi Shabana, said that Yasser Arafat's political rivals were responsible for his death, and that he was poisoned with polonium. Shabana, who took part in the investigation into Arafat's death in a French hospital in 2004, also said that several months after his death, the same cell murdered the head of military intelligence in Gaza, General Moussa Arafat, a relative of the PLO leader, in order to prevent a blood feud. The lawyer called on Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas to reopen the investigation into Arafat's death.\\"Kol Yisrael English news, 17 January 2011, 0430 UTC On Newsnight on UK TV on 21 January 2016, during a feature on the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinienko, George Galloway claimed to have been with Yasser Arafat in Paris when he died of polonium-210 poisoning. =Al Jazeera's investigation= On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera reported that a nine-month investigation by Al Jazeera had revealed that none of the causes of Arafat's death suggested in several rumors were true, as Arafat was in good health until he suddenly fell ill on 12 October 2004. Tests carried out by the Institut de Radiophysique (Institute of Radiation Physics) at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland found traces of polonium, a rare, highly radioactive element, on Arafat's personal belongings, including his toothbrush, hat, surgical bouffant (headgear), and underwear, which suggested that there was a high level of polonium inside his body when he died. The investigation ruled out HIV or any other infectious disease as a cause of death. The polonium was found in quantities much higher than could occur naturally, and further, that 60%‚Äì80% of that polonium (depending on the item being tested) had not come from natural sources but from a nuclear reactor. The quantities found on his personal items at the time of this investigation were generally consistent with quantities of polonium that would have been given to poison him when he suddenly first came down with major symptoms of illness.\\"Arafat's widow calls for body to be exhumed\\".

BBC, 4 July 2012 In October 2010, an official press release from the Institut de Radiophysique, where those items were analyzed, had stated that: > \\"an unexplained quantity of Polonium-210 has been detected on the personal > effects of Mr. Arafat. However, this is not sufficient to determine the > causes of death. In particular, it will be recalled that, contrary to what > happened in the case of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, Mr. > Arafat did not lose his hair, and some of the findings in the forensic > report are inconsistent with an acute radiation syndrome.\\" In July 2012, a spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique stressed that the \\"clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not\\", and that \\"the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210\\". Fran√ßois Bochud, who heads the Institute of Radiation Physics in Lausanne, Switzerland, stated that \\"our results are clearly not a proof of any poisoning\\". Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds in England, stated: \\"You don't know much about the provenance of the clothing and whether it had been tampered with later on. You'd want to test the body.\\" In response to Al Jazeera's report, Dr Ely Karmon, at Herzliya's Institute for Counterterrorism, a specialist in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, said that \\"the half- life of the substance [i.e., slightly more than 138 days 9 hours] would make it impossible for polonium to have been discovered at such high levels if it had been used to kill Arafat eight years ago. If it had been used for poisoning, minimal levels should be seen now. Yet much higher levels were found. Someone planted the polonium much later.\\" He went on to question why Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, who provided the researchers with Arafat's belongings was not also poisoned while she was by his side at the hospital touching him and his clothing.Polonium found on Arafat's clothing was planted, The Jerusalem Post, 5 July 2012 Israel has denied any connection to the rumours. Deputy Spokesman of Israeli Foreign Ministry Paul Hirschson was skeptical of the rumours, joking, \\"All of a sudden, Suha's checking her wash basket and discovered clothes that weren't washed for eight years. Suddenly, out of nowhere a couple of garments turn up; we test them, and presto! There's Polonium.\\" Avi Dichter, who was in charge of the Shin Bet when Arafat died, told Army radio that \\"Yasser Arafat had many enemies, domestically, abroad. But let them investigate. ... The Palestinians know well how to investigate what goes on in their house. Let them investigate and find out.\\" On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article titled \\"Improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning\\". In the article, a group of Swiss doctors suggested that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning. The team analysed 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free. Several of the Arafat samples were notably more radioactive than the controls, but not all. The team believed that an autopsy could be useful in this case. After testing Arafat's personal belongings and samples of his body fluids, the chief of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency of Russia, Vladimir Uiba, concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death, but the Agency then denied that Uiba's comments were official.\\"Swiss team: Arafat poisoned to death with polonium\\". Reuters/Haaretz, 6 November 2013 British forensic scientist Professor David Barclay said the Swiss team's findings were a \\"smoking gun\\", and that it was \\"absolutely certain\\" that polonium had been the cause of his death. After the results of the French and Russian tests became public, David Barclay did not comment or communicate any more on the case. The French tests found some polonium but stated it was from \\"natural environmental origin\\". Later the Russian tests released in December 2013 found that Arafat's death was not caused by radiation. Vladimir Uiba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated that Yasser had died of natural causes and they had no plans to conduct further tests. =Call for new investigation= Following Al Jazeera's revelations, Suha Arafat, Arafat's widow, called for the exhumation of Arafat's body for further testing, in response to the Al Jazeera story about polonium. In response, Abbas ordered a committee to be formed, and stated that there were no religious or political obstacles to exhuming the body. However, Nimr Hamad, an aide to Abbas, stated that a team of experts would first be sent to Europe to learn more from the Swiss institute and from the French military hospital where Arafat died. Abbas stated that he would only order an autopsy if the family agreed, but did not define whom in the family he meant. Later, Abbas stated that they would only investigate \\"if necessary\\". Tawfiq Tirawi, the head of the committee in charge of investigating Arafat's death, stated: \\"We are certain that there are Palestinian hands that contributed to the elimination of Yasser Arafat.\\" With regards to those people, Tirawi stated that they \\"will be subject to severe penalties and doomed to death\\". On 30 July 2012, Tirawi added, \\"We haven't initiated the investigation based on the hypothesis that Arafat was killed by poison, but we agreed to begin an investigation searching directly for the killer regardless of the medical reports which will eventually show the method of killing and name of the toxin.\\" Tunisia also requested that the Arab League convene a ministerial meeting to discuss Arafat's death and study the circumstances in which he died. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby stated that a permanent representative meeting would be held to discuss Arafat's death, and that permanent representatives would prepare a report and raise proposals over necessary action, which they would present in the soonest Arab League ministerial meeting. Exhumation of Arafat's remains On 9 July 2012, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas approved the exhumation of Arafat's body in response to the Al Jazeera story about polonium. On 8 August 2012, Swiss experts were invited to the West Bank to prepare for the examination of Yasser Arafat's remains to investigate possible poisoning. The lab said that they wanted guarantees that the investigation would not be used for political purposes, saying, \\"Meanwhile, our main concern is to guarantee the independence, the credibility and the transparency of any involvement that we may have.\\" On 27 November 2012, three teams of international investigators collected samples from Arafat's body and the surrounding soil in the mausoleum in Ramallah. A French, a Swiss and a Russian team have independently investigated the samples.\\"Yasser Arafat's body exhumed in Ramallah\\". Gregg Carlstrom, Al Jazeera, 27 November 2012\\"Yasser Arafat's remains exhumed for death investigation, Palestinians say\\". CBS, 27 November 2012 Publication of the results of the studies was delayed, reportedly on the request of the Palestinian Authority, which feared they could have negative impact on the peace talks.\\"Experts late with test results in Arafat death case\\". Khaled abu Toameh, Jerusalem Post, 2 October 2013 On 6 November 2013, Al Jazeera reported that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat's ribs and pelvis 18 times higher than normal, and were 83% confident that polonium poisoning had occurred, but Professor Bochud disagreed with this interpretation by Al Jazeera and only stated that the poisoning hypothesis by polonium was \\"moderately supported\\". According to a journalist from the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps, Luis Lema, the Swiss experts had concluded that on a probability scale ranging from one to six, death by polonium poisoning was around five. Arafat's widow Suha stated her belief that he was a victim of a \\"political assassination\\" but refrained from finger-pointing and said she would await the French forensic results.Angelique Chrisafis, Harriet Sherwood,Arafat may have been poisoned with polonium, tests show,' The Guardian, 6 November 2013.David Poort and Ken Silverstein,'Swiss study: Polonium found in Arafat's bones,' al-Jazeera, 6 November 2013. Joods Actueel, a Belgian monthly newspaper, claimed that most experts in forensics disagreed that the results were consistent with polonium poisoning and that the conclusions of the Swiss study were not in line with the results obtained.Is the \\"Arafat was poisoned\\" hypothesis \\"moderately\\" supported by the Swiss report, \\"strongly wrong\\"? Forensic biologist Nathan Lents of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said the report's results were consistent with a possible polonium poisoning, but \\"There's certainly not a smoking gun here.\\" Derek Hill, a professor in radiological science at University College London who was not involved in the investigation, said: \\"I would say it's clearly not overwhelming proof, and there is a risk of contamination (of the samples), but it is a pretty strong signal. ... It seems likely what they're doing is putting a very cautious interpretation of strong data.\\" After the testing of Arafat's remains by the Russian team, the Russian Medical-Biological Agency concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death. However, the government scientific body later denied that it had made any official statement about the research, saying only that it had handed its results to the Russian Foreign Ministry.Arafat: Russia rules out death caused by polonium poisoning . ANSA, 15 October 2013 However, Al Jazeera found that the Russian scientists had only investigated four out of 20 samples, being the samples that were unlikely to show the amount of radioactive exposure. The scientists also appear to have been restricted by the Russian Foreign Ministry in how to present the report. According to Al Jazeera's source, \\"Russia's goal was to fulfill the Palestinian Authority's request, not offend Israel by helping the PA, and not create a new hotbed in the Middle East\\".\\"Experts question Russian Arafat findings\\", Al Jazeera, 8 November 2013. In December 2013, an unidentified person leaked what were claimed to be the results of the French investigation to AFP, saying that \\"the report rules out the poisoning theory and goes in the sense of a natural death\\". According to the leaker, the report says Arafat died of a \\"generalised infection\\". On December 4, Al Jazeera quoted Suha Arafat speaking at a press conference after having received the French report: \\"Is it the poisoned body that would have contaminated the environment outside? Or is it the opposite? The first one is the conclusion of the Swiss. The Swiss think that the body was poisoned and contaminated the environment. And the French reach the opposite conclusion‚Äîthat it's actually the environment outside which explains the presence of polonium 210.\\"Al Jazeera: French Experts Rule Out Arafat Poisoning Later that same month, a Russian investigative team from the Federal Medico-Biological Agency agreed that Arafat did not die from poisoning. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. Luis Lema, \\"Yasser Arafat, la valse des isotopes\\", Le Temps, Saturday 24 May 2014, p. 3. The French later announced that foul play was not involved.Yasser Arafat: French rule out foul play in former Palestinian leader's death The CHUV published in February 2016 a paper in Science Direct to justify their conclusions. They admitted: \\"The evidences gathered during this expert report are not clear-cut: we cannot exclude 210Po as a cause of death, but we cannot be sure that 210Po was the cause of death.\\" In another document the CHUV explains \\"...these results do not then define the probability to which Yasser Arafat would have been poisoned by polonium, but must be integrated into the larger context of the police and legal investigations in connection to this case, and which are beyond our field of expertise\\" which shows several press articles using probability figures were completely wrong in interpreting the results.Page 1 Frequently asked questions regarding the expertise conducted on President Yasser Arafat's personal belongings and remains Lausanne, 15 December 2015 (corrected version of 15 February 2016) Joods Actueel publishes in July 2016 an updated document whereby it states that their previous analysis was confirmed by CHUV. According to them, the conclusions that are based only on Bayes analysis are not valid as they are not documented with figures.Two years after, the CHUV (Swiss scientists) admits no proof of Arafat's poisoning. It also reminds juridical errors based on such method as the case of Sally Clark.

Melman stated that the IDF had wanted to take harsh action against Arafat, ranging from killing him to expelling him, but Prime Minister Sharon rejected these ideas, stating that the advantages wouldn't outweigh being accused of killing Arafat, and Arafat already seemed to be an irrelevant leader who wasn't trusted by the international community.

Globally, there is a wide variety of views on the topic. Most western countries have legislation that mandates only evolutionary biology is to be taught in the appropriate scientific syllabuses. Overview While many doctrines do not raise theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present form of life on Earth, various fundamentalist sects, including many churches within Christianity, have objected vehemently. Some adherents are passionately opposed to the consensus view of the scientific community. Literal interpretations of religious texts are the greatest cause of conflict with evolutionary and cosmological investigations and conclusions. Internationally, evolution is taught in science courses with limited controversy, with the exception of a few areas of the United States and several Islamic fundamentalist countries. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled the teaching of creationism as science in public schools to be unconstitutional, irrespective of how it may be purveyed in theological or religious instruction. In the United States, intelligent design (ID) has been represented as an alternative explanation to evolution in recent decades, but its \\"demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions\\" have been ruled unconstitutional by a lower court. By country =Australia= Although creationist views are popular among religious education teachers and creationist teaching materials have been distributed by volunteers in some schools, many Australian scientists take an aggressive stance supporting the right of teachers to teach the theory of evolution, unhindered by religious restrictions. =Brazil= In Brazil, teaching of creationism in scientific education classes is forbidden by the Ministry of Education (MEC). Religious education is not forbidden as such, but the federal constitution states that the union can neither impose, nor promote, nor finance any religion, because by law Brazil is a secular state. See Title III, Chapter 1, Article 19. In 2004 however, teachers of religious education classes in schools of the education department of Rio de Janeiro began to present creationism in their classes as scientific fact. The practice was directly initiated by politicians in power who were promoting their personal religious views, and their action moved Brazilian scientists to protest the abuse. Subsequently, in congress a \\"religious bench,\\" or faction, has become increasingly influential. For example, a Brazilian senator, Marcelo Crivella, the former Minister of Fishing and Aquiculture, publicly declared his religiously founded antagonism to evolution. * Such prominent influences have drawn the attention of the defenders of the secular state. =China= Evolutionary theory is part of the public education in the People's Republic of China.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8ab/86c6b216004b21fa228ae0233fdb44b00d35.pdf As private religious schools are rare, nearly all students receiving primary and secondary education in Mainland China are receive education that includes evolutionary theory. However, one study has identified limitations with the textbooks used in Mainland China, including the absence of topics covered in other countries such as the USSR and the USA. =Council of Europe= ;Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1580 On October 4, 2007, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted its Resolution 1580 titled The dangers of creationism in education. The resolution observed that \\"The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism closely linked to extreme right-wing political movements,\\" and urged member states \\"firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion.\\" ;Drafting and adoption The Assembly's work leading to adopting the resolution began in 2006, when several delegates of the assembly, led by British Labour Party politician Andrew McIntosh, suggested to adopt a recommendation on this theme. During drafting, the report and draft resolution were prepared by the delegate from the French Socialist Party, Guy Lengagne. The report was returned by PACE to its Committee on Culture, Science and Education for revision in June 2007 with 63 votes against 46, at the request by the leader of the Christian Democratic group in the Assembly Luc Van den Brande. Verbatim record of the PACE sitting on June 25, 2007 - see para. 7. Reuters noted that calling off the debate and vote \\"also won support from east European deputies, who recalled that Darwinian evolution was a favorite theory of their former communist rulers.\\" The procedure used for the referral was criticized by the Assembly's Committee on Culture, Science and Education. After the revision by a new rapporteur, Anne Brasseur, a delegate from Luxembourg representing the Liberal group in the Assembly and several amendments made by the Assembly, the resolution was adopted, by 48 votes against 25. Minutes of the PACE sitting on October 4, 2007. * Voting results on the amendments and resolution (\\"The dangers of creationism in education\\" (Doc. 11375)). Vote on resolution: In favour: 48; against: 25; abstention: 3. ;Content The resolution's aim is \\"to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science ‚Ä¶ the Parliamentary Assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies. If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights.\\" It rejects that creationism in any form, including \\"intelligent design,\\" can be considered scientific (Para. 4), but considers possible its inclusion in religion and cultural classes (Para. 16). The resolution concludes that teaching creationism in school as a scientific theory may threaten civil rights (Paras. 13 and 18). The resolution summarizes itself in Para. 19: ;Coverage and reaction After the rejection of Lengagne's report, the former rapporteur was interviewed on the subject by the French newspaper 20 Minutes, where he evaluated the events as follows: \\"We are witnessing a return to the Middle Ages.\\" The resolution was criticised by deputy head of the Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, stating that \\"those few fossils presented by the anthropologists as examples of ape-human transitional forms could be explained by random mutations. We don't claim to found a new species upon finding a fish with two heads.\\" and by the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Albert Mohler considering that \\"this can only mean that Europe (at least as represented by the Council of Europe) has forgotten even its Christian memory.\\" In February 2009, the resolution was a starting point of a conference held in Dortmund, Germany, and led by Dittmar Graf from the Dortmund University of Technology. The conference, including participation of Anne Brasseur, among others, was held in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology, University of Vienna and Hacettepe University and with support from German Ministry of Education and Research. Michael Poole, a King's College London Visiting Research Fellow in Science and Religion and a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion, criticised the resolution for being too restrictive while disapproving of young Earth creationism and the intelligent design movement. Deutsche Welle, covering the disagreement among members of the Assembly on whether the resolution constituted an attack on religious beliefs, and Die Welt, pointing to journalists-expressed suspicions of wishing to limit freedom of conscience and Brasseur's response that the aim was to draw a line between the spheres of faith and science. =Denmark= On April 25, 2007, Member of Parliament Martin Henriksen (Danish People's Party) asked Education Minister Bertel Haarder (Liberal Party of Denmark) for information about how many educational institutions had received The Atlas of Creation (2006) by Harun Yahya. * The minister responded that the Ministry of Education was not in possession of information about the number of educational institutions that had received the book. Further, he stated that the choice of educational materials is decided by local school boards. Moreover, it is his view that the end goal of primary school biology instruction is to enable students to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to explain the basic elements of heredity and evolution and to address the issues related to the biological coursework. In interview sessions during 2002, less than 10% of the interviewed Danes declared the theory of evolution as being definitely false. \\"Supporting Online Material for Public Acceptance of Evolution\\" (PDF). =Iran= Iranian scientific development, especially the health-related aspects of biology, has been a goal of the Islamic government since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Since Iranian traditional practice of Shi'a religion isn't preoccupied with Qur'anic literalism as in case of fundamentalist Wahhabism but ijtihad, many influential Iranian Shi'ite scholars, including several who were closely involved in the Iranian Revolution, are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general, disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the Muslim mainstream. Evolution is incorporated in the science curriculum starting from the 5th grade. An emphasis is placed on empirical evidence, such as the study of fossils, rather than Islamic scripture, thus portraying geologists and other types of scientists as the authoritative voices of scientific knowledge. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands some factions teach creationism in their own schools, besides evolution.Stefaan Blancke en Abraham C. Flipse, The Low Countries, in: 'Creationism in Europe, red. Stefaan Blancke, Hans Henrik Hjermitslev and Peter C Kj√¶rgaard (Medicin, science, and religion in historical context, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014), 65-84.' In May 2005, a discussion on intelligent design erupted when Minister of Education Maria van der Hoeven suggested that debate about intelligent design might encourage discourse between the country's various religious groups. She sought to \\"stimulate an academic debate\\" on the subject. Following strong objection from some scientists, she dropped plans of holding a conference on the matter. After the 2007 elections, she was succeeded by Ronald Plasterk, described as a \\"molecular geneticist, staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design.\\" =Norway= In 1986, Norway's then-Minister of Church and Education Affairs Kjell Magne Bondevik proposed new education plans for the elementary and middle school levels which included skepticism to the theory of evolution and would hold that a final answer to the origin of mankind was unknown. The proposal was withdrawn after it had generated controversy. =Pakistan= Although it has been claimed that evolution is not taught in Pakistani universities; the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, which is the federal body which sets standards of course content, has knowledge and understanding of evolution as being compulsory for several courses such as microbiology, bioinformatics, zoology, botany as well as others. In 2006, the Pakistan Academy of Sciences became a signatory of the InterAcademy Panel Statement on \\"The teaching of evolution.\\" Many of the contemporary titles on the creation‚Äìevolution controversy, such as those by biologist Richard Dawkins, are available for general sale.Titles such as The Blind Watchmaker (1986) by Richard Dawkins are also available for general readership . =Poland= Poland saw a controversy over creationism in 2006 when Deputy Education Minister Miros≈Çaw Orzechowski denounced evolution as a lie taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of National Education Roman Giertych, has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, \\"as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory.\\" Giertych's father, Member of the European Parliament Maciej Giertych, has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that \\"in every culture there are indications that we remember dinosaurs. The Scots have Nessie; we Poles have the Wawel dragon.\\" =Romania= In 1998, Ioan Moisin, a Christian Democratic senator and a Greek Catholic priest, called upon Romania's Ministry of Education to establish a commission of Catholics who would revise biology textbooks and philosophical textbooks to not contradict Biblical creationism. Moisin disapproved of students learning from their religious teachers that God created human beings and then learning to the contrary from biology and philosophy teachers that humans descend from apes as a product of evolution by Darwinian natural selection. Moisin's proposal to establish the commission also sought to form a Council of Public Morality that would feature representatives composed of teachers and clergy, to oversee public education, and to be subordinated only to the direct authority of the President of Romania. Romania's Parliament and Ministry of Education never seriously considered the latter proposals. However, starting the year 2006 and ongoing Darwinian evolution was discontinued from newly printed school books throughout the country without being reintroduced.> =Russia= In December 2006, a schoolgirl in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and her father took the issue of the teaching of evolution in Russian schools to court. The Russian Ministry of Education supports the theory of evolution. Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church backed the suit. In February 2007, the first instance court, and in July, the second instance court, ruled in favour of the Ministry. In August 2014 the Mayor of Kazan, Il'sur Metshin, expressed surprise at schools teaching the \\"theory of Darwin\\". He added that he intended to raise the question of the school curriculum at the federal level. =Saudi Arabia= As a religious state, Saudi Arabia has denied the theory of evolution in their science education. Science textbooks approved by the Saudi Ministry of Education have associated Darwin with Western philosophy which they reject and perceive to be \\"problematic\\". Saudi's denial of evolution originated from the lack of secularization in the nation, the continuing development of its education system, and its homogenic religious population. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, the only co-ed university in the state, received criticism for its co-ed establishment and was called for further scrutiny in its science curriculum. Sheikh Saad al- Shithri, a religious scholar, stated that ‚Äúthe recommendation is to set up sharia committees at this university to oversee these studies and look into what violates the sharia (Islamic law)\\". He further states, \\"We are looking at some of the sciences that have included some irregular and alien ideologies, like evolution and such other ideologies‚Äù. According to a poll by Reuters News, Saudi Arabia was ranked the highest in the list of countries that favor creationist views. As an Islamist state, Saudi education policies are centered around the \\"complete Islamic conception of the universe, humanity, and life\\". This is referenced in various science textbooks, such a 6th grade textbook teaching divine creation by citing a Quran verse that states \\"we have indeed created man with the best of moulds\\". A 10th grade textbook includes a glossary of biological terms with religious explanation, such as the term adaptation being defined as \\"Allah, glory to him, created for organisms those characteristics and structures that enable them to live in their different environments\\". A Saudi 12th-grade textbook mentions evolution by name only where it claims that Charles Darwin has \\"denied Allah's creation of humanity\\". The rest of the textbook focuses on descriptions of the taxonomic ranks: it makes no further mention of evolution, only quoting Qur'an verses as relevant to certain groups of animals. =Serbia= In Serbia the teaching of evolution was suspended for one week in 2004, under Minister of Education and Sport Ljiljana ƒåoliƒá, only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism. \\"After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties\\" says the BBC report, ƒåoliƒá's deputy, Milan Brdar, made the statement, \\"I have come here to confirm Charles Darwin is still alive\\" and announced that the decision was reversed. ƒåoliƒá resigned after the government said that she had caused \\"problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government.\\" =Turkey= In Turkey, a country where the majority of population is Muslim, evolution is often a controversial subject. Evolution was added to the school curriculum shortly after the Turkish Revolution of the 1920s and 30s. There was some resistance to this, such as that of Said Nurs√Æ and his followers, but opposition was not particularly powerful. In fact, some prominent Turkish scholars during the first decades of the new-born Turkish republic, such as Ahmet Hamdi Akseki (d. 1951), who once served as the President of Religious Affairs of Turkey, and ƒ∞zmirli ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± (d. 1946) thought that the theory of evolution cannot be seen as contrary to Islam because it was already to be found in the classical works of Muslim theology. In the 1980s, conservatives came into power, and used the ideas of scientific creationists in the US as a method of discrediting evolution (notwithstanding material on the age of the Earth, which Islamic creationism is less specific about). One anti- evolutionist group in Turkey is the Istanbul based Bilim Ara≈ütƒ±rma Vakfƒ± (BAV), or \\"Science Research Foundation,\\" which was founded by Adnan Oktar in 1990. Its activities include campaigns against the teaching of evolution. It has been described as one of the strongest anti-evolution organizations outside of North America. US based creationist organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) have worked alongside them. Some scientists have protested that anti-evolution books published by this group (such as The Evolution Deceit (1999) by Harun Yahya) have become more influential than real biology textbooks. The teaching of evolution in high schools has been fought by Ali G√∂ren, a member of parliament and professor of medicine, who believes such education has negative effects. The situation is very fragile, and the status of evolution in education varies from one government to the next. For example, in 1985 the Minister of National Education, Youth and Sports Vehbi Din√ßerler had scientific creationism added to high school texts, and also had the discredited Lamarckism presented alongside Darwinism. Only in 1998 was this changed somewhat, with texts presenting a more balanced view, though still mentioning creationism and Lamarckism. At present the moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party, which is sympathetic to creationist views, holds power. It was elected in 2002 and again with a greater majority in 2007. In general, material that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey. For example, in November 2007 a prosecutor launched a probe into whether Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion (2006) is \\"an attack on religious values.\\" Its publisher could face trial and up to one year in prison if the prosecutor concludes that the book \\"incites religious hatred\\" and insults religious values. Turkish academics who have defended evolutionary theory have received death threats, for instance Turkish biologist Aykut Kence received an email telling him to enjoy his \\"final days.\\" Kence helped establish the Evolution Group, whose aim is to improve public understanding of evolution. However, opposition to creationism is not very powerful; Umit Sayin, a neurologist, describes academics and universities as \\"slow and sluggish\\" in their response. Kence maintains that \\"if knowledgeable people keep quiet, it only helps those who spread nonsense.\\" In June 2017, the education ministry announced the removal of evolution from the secondary school curriculum, scheduled to take effect in 2019; as of the date of the announcement the only other Muslim majority country where evolution is challenged in the education system was Saudi Arabia, where the concept is briefly named and heavily criticized in the curricula. =United Kingdom= In each of the countries of the United Kingdom, there is an agreed syllabus for religious education with the right of parents to withdraw their children from these lessons. The religious education syllabus does not involve teaching creationism, but rather teaching the central tenets of major world faiths. At the same time, the teaching of evolution is compulsory in publicly funded schools. For instance, the National Curriculum for England requires that students at Key Stage 4 (14‚Äì16) be taught: # that the fossil record is evidence for evolution # how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction Similar requirements exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 2003, the Emmanuel Schools Foundation (previously the Vardy Foundation after its founder, Sir Peter Vardy) sponsored a number of \\"faith-based\\" academies where evolution and creationist ideas would be taught side-by-side in science classes. This caused a considerable amount of controversy. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has expressed his view that creationism should not be taught in schools. An organisation called Truth in Science has distributed teaching packs of creationist information to schools, and claims that fifty-nine schools are using the packs as \\"a useful classroom resource.\\" The government has stated that \\"Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum. The Truth in Science information pack is therefore not an appropriate resource to support the science curriculum.\\" It is arranging to communicate this message directly to schools. The teaching of creationism and intelligent design in schools in the UK is being opposed by the British Centre for Science Education (BCSE). =United States= In the United States, creationists and proponents of evolution are engaged in a long-standing battle over the legal status of creation and evolution in the public school science classroom. Some 13 US states are exposed to offer pro-creationist contents in public or charter schools, and they often are criticized as unconstitutional. There are also religious homeschool curriculum that offer creationist education.

The series was produced by Roving Enterprises. It featured many well-known Australian comedians, including comedy-band Tripod. Reruns can now be seen on The Comedy Channel on Foxtel. In the UK, it is shown on the channel Paramount Comedy 2 and Trouble. The title name itself is a pun on the colloquialism \\"shithouse\\". The series only ran for two seasons, before being cancelled due to a combination of dwindling ratings and the withdrawal of the cable network Foxtel as co-financier of the program's production.  Cast  Skithouse was produced by Roving Enterprises, a production company formed by Rove McManus. Two key performers were Rove's Rove Live co-hosts Peter Helliar and Corinne Grant. The show also featured Cal Wilson, Scott Brennan, Fiona Harris, Damian Callinan, Roz Hammond, Michael Chamberlin, Ingrid Bloom, Tom Gleeson, Jason Geary and Ben Anderson. Members of the comedic band Tripod also featured, not just as the band but in the actual skits as well. Tripod are Scod (Scott Edgar), Yon (Simon Hall) and Gatesy (Steven Gates). The director was Full Frontal alumna, Daina Reid. Since the cancellation of the series, a number of the stars have moved on to other areas in the comedy industry. Scott Brennan and Fiona Harris starred in Comedy Inc. (before the show's end) as well as Damian Callinan and Cal Wilson staying on Network Ten on The Wedge with Roz Hammond and Ben Anderson as part of the ensemble cast on Thank God You're Here.  The show  The show consisted of numerous comedic skits. The half- hour shows themselves often seemed to have themes (or at least they repeated the use of sets, costumes, characters and props). Its comedic styling was reminiscent of many classic Australian sketch comedies, like Full Frontal and Fast Forward, sharing common elements such as self-depreciating humour, low- cost props and effects.  Notable characters and sketches  Many characters recurred throughout the series, often appearing several times in a single episode, creating a semi-coherent storyline. Some more notable recurring characters and/or scenarios are listed below. ;The Australian Fast Bowler (Gleeson): a cricket fast bowler, loosely resembling Dennis Lillee, who uses his bowling skills to help people or defend against evil, superhero style - indeed, he has his own sidekick and nemesis (Callinan as The English Batsman). For instance, a choking man would be helped with a ball bowled at his back. The Australian Fast Bowler has been shown as a 12-year-old boy, the Schoolyard Fast Bowler; one episode also featured the Australian Lawn Bowler, seemingly the Australian Fast Bowler many years later (a reference to the common perception of lawn bowling as an \\"old people's sport\\"). Another episode also featured the Australian Spin Bowler and another featured the Australian One Day Fast Bowler (who was quite hopeless to say the least). ;Bubble Wrap Man (Yon): Bubble Wrap Man is a send up of traditional superheroes. His outfit consisted of a standard red superhero outfit, complete with underwear on the outside, and a bubble wrap cape. Bubble Wrap Man would appear in stressful situations for other unnamed characters, and say to them, \\"Pop the bubbles on my cape!.\\" This draws on the theory that popping the bubbles on standard bubble wrap will relieve stress. Once the situation is resolved Bubble Wrap Man then leaves the scene, leaving his calling card, a small piece of bubble wrap. ;The \\"I'll Snap Ya\\" Guy (Callinan): A parody of an Australian 'bogan' who continually narrates sketches in which he speaks of various people he has punched (or 'snapped'). One episode saw \\"I'll Snap Ya\\" Guy being assaulted by Russell Crowe, a reference to the actor's numerous altercations. ;Redheads (Gleeson, Wilson, Hammond, Yon): stereotyped white red-haired people who have an extreme fear of sunlight. They seem incapable of natural speech, communicating in squeaks. ;Batman (Callinan): a depressed, alcoholic version of Batman. His Batmobile is a wreck, he has no work, and seems romantically attracted to Robin (Chamberlin). He is perpetually at odds with the more dynamic Captain Terrific (Helliar), who is now Robin's partner. ;The \\"I Love Beer\\" Guy (Helliar): A man who, despite professing to everyone how much he loves beer, quite obviously cannot stomach the drink. Onlookers try to convince him that it is okay not to drink beer, but he refuses to acknowledge his dislike. This is a mockery of the common stereotype of the beer-drinking Australian male. ;The Ticket Lady (Harris): A perpetually cheerful parking inspector who is oblivious to how much she is hated by the general public; she often speaks highly of people while being pelted with rocks, eggs, and other heavy objects. Usually ends a sketch after having something thrown at her, by exclaiming \\"I love this job!\\" ;Glenn Bush (Brennan): An awkward, annoying schoolboy in his teens, with many pimples and a squeaky voice. Glenn is mostly portrayed at school camp in video diary format, or doing a school biology assignment with his \\"friend\\" (Chamberlin), who cannot get rid of him. ;Tripod as themselves: The three friends engaged in various strange or geeky activities, including playing Dungeons and Dragons, and teaching Yon how to dance. ;\\"Nothing Suss!\\" (Gleeson, Brennan): Two men attempt to sell odd products (normally partner exercise equipment) in the medium of an infomercial for their mail order service. The two frequently use the exercise equipment to demonstrate and end up in sexually suggestive positions, while maintaining all the while that there is \\"nothing suss\\" about what they are doing. The credits of each show are accompanied by a song by Tripod. While sometimes new material is used, it is sometimes a song previously featured in their \\"Song In An Hour\\" challenge with Triple J. Although not a regular sketch, one of the best-known segments on \\"Skithouse\\" was a sketch depicting an interview with a group of insurgents during the Iraq War. During the sketch, the leader of the militant group realises that his comments are being subtitled in real time and takes offence at the criticism of his English language skills.  Music and theme  The main title was composed by John Von Ahlen and recorded at Subterrane Recording Studio, and the end credits read \\"Theme by John Von Ahlen for Planet J Productions\\". The incidental stings were also recorded at Subterrane Recording Studio. The credits of each show are accompanied by a song by Tripod. A compilation of expanded studio versions of these songs was later released as the album Middleborough Rd, which won an ARIA award in 2005 for Best Comedy Release.

He served as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1991 to 2013. As the spiritual head of the United Synagogue, the largest synagogue body in the UK, he was the Chief Rabbi of those Orthodox synagogues, but was not recognized as the religious authority for the Haredi Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations or for the progressive movements such as Masorti, Reform and Liberal Judaism. As Chief Rabbi, Sacks formally carried the title of Av Beit Din (head) of the London Beth Din. He is now known as the Emeritus Chief Rabbi.Compare: Since stepping down as Chief Rabbi, in addition to his international travelling and speaking engagements and prolific writing, Sacks has served as the Ingeborg and Ira Rennert Global Distinguished Professor of Judaic Thought at New York University and as the Kressel and Ephrat Family University Professor of Jewish Thought at Yeshiva University. He has also been appointed as Professor of Law, Ethics and the Bible at King's College London. He won the Templeton Prize (awarded for work affirming life's spiritual dimension) in 2016. He is also a Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. Early life and education Born in Lambeth, London on 8 March 1948, Sacks commenced his formal education at St Mary's Primary School and at Christ's College, Finchley. He completed his higher education at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, where he gained a first-class honours degree (Master of Arts (Cambridge)) in Philosophy. While a student at Cambridge, Sacks traveled to New York to meet Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson to discuss a variety of issues relating to religion, faith and philosophy. Schneerson urged Sacks to seek rabbinic ordination and to enter the rabbinate.Jonathan Sacks, \\"How The Rebbe Changed My Life\\". 28 November 2011. Sacks subsequently continued postgraduate study at New College, Oxford and at King's College London, completing a PhD which the University of London awarded in 1982. Sacks received his rabbinic ordination from Jews' College and London's Etz Chaim Yeshiva. Career Sacks's first rabbinic appointment (1978‚Äì1982) was as the Rabbi for the Golders Green synagogue in London. In 1983, he became Rabbi of the prestigious Marble Arch synagogue in Central London, a position he held until 1990. Between 1984 and 1990, Sacks also served as Principal of Jews' College, the world's oldest rabbinical seminary. Dr. Sacks was inducted to serve as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth on 1 September 1991, a position he held until 1 September 2013. Sacks became a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2005 \\"for services to the Community and to Inter-faith Relations\\". He was made an Honorary Freeman of the London Borough of Barnet in September 2006.Honorary Freemen of the London Borough of Barnet. Barnet.gov.uk (29 September 2009).

A visiting professor at several universities in Britain, the United States and Israel, Sacks holds 16 honorary degrees, including a doctorate of divinity conferred on him in September 2001 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to mark his first ten years in office as Chief Rabbi. In recognition of his work, Sacks has won several international awards, including the Jerusalem Prize in 1995 for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life and The Ladislaus Laszt Ecumenical and Social Concern Award from Ben Gurion University in Israel in 2011. The author of 25 books, Sacks has published commentaries on the daily Jewish prayer book (siddur) and has completed commentaries to the Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pesach festival prayer-books (machzorim) . His other books include, Not in God's Name: Confronting Religious Violence, and The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search for Meaning. His books have won literary awards, including the Grawemeyer Prize for Religion in 2004 for The Dignity of Difference, and a National Jewish Book Award in 2000 for A Letter in the Scroll. Covenant & Conversation: Genesis was also awarded a National Jewish Book Award in 2009, and his commentary to the Pesach festival prayer book won the Modern Jewish Thought and Experience Dorot Foundation Award in the 2013 National Jewish Book Awards in the United States. His Covenant & Conversation commentaries on the weekly Torah portion are read by thousands of people in Jewish communities around the world. Sacks' contributions to wider British society have also been recognised. A regular contributor to national media, frequently appearing on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day or writing the Credo column or opinion pieces in The Times, Sacks was awarded The Sanford St Martin's Trust Personal Award for 2013 for \\"his advocacy of Judaism and religion in general\\". He was invited to the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton as a representative of the Jewish community. At a Gala Dinner held in Central London in May 2013 to mark the completion of the Chief Rabbi's time in office, the Prince of Wales called Sacks a \\"light unto this nation\\", \\"a steadfast friend\\" and \\"a valued adviser\\" whose \\"guidance on any given issue has never failed to be of practical value and deeply grounded in the kind of wisdom that is increasingly hard to come by\\". =Chief Rabbi= In his installation address upon succeeding Immanuel, Lord Jakobovits as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in September 1991, Sacks called for a Decade of Renewal which would \\"revitalize British Jewry's great powers of creativity\\". He said this renewal should be based on five central values: \\"love of every Jew, love of learning, love of God, a profound contribution to British society and an unequivocal attachment to Israel.\\" Sacks said he wanted to be \\"a catalyst for creativity, to encourage leadership in others, and to let in the fresh air of initiative and imagination\\". This led to a series of innovative communal projects including Jewish Continuity, a national foundation for Jewish educational programmes and outreach; the Association of Jewish Business Ethics; the Chief Rabbinate Awards for Excellence; the Chief Rabbinate Bursaries, and Community Development, a national scheme to enhance Jewish community life. The Chief Rabbi began his second decade of office with a call to 'Jewish Responsibility' and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism.

These include: (1) a volume on his work entitled Universalizing Particularity that forms part of The Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers series, edited by Hava Tirosh- Samuelson and Aaron W. Hughes; (2) a book entitled Radical Responsibility edited by Michael J. Harris, Daniel Rynhold and Tamra Wright; and (3) a book entitled Morasha Kehillat Yaakov edited by Rabbi Michael Pollak and Dayan Shmuel Simons. =Early influencers= In a pamphlet written to mark the completion of his time as Chief Rabbi entitled \\"A Judaism Engaged with the World\\", A Judaism Engaged with the World Sacks cites three individuals who have had a profound impact on his own philosophical thinking. The first figure was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson who \\"was fully aware of the problem of the missing Jews... inventing the idea, revolutionary in its time, of Jewish outreach... [He] challenged me to lead.\\" Indeed, Sacks called him \\"one of the greatest Jewish leaders, not just of our time, but of all time\\"Jonathan Mark, The Chief Rabbi And The Rebbe. The Jewish Week, 11/29/11. The second was Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik whom Sacks described as \\"the greatest Orthodox thinker of the time [who] challenged me to think.\\" Sacks argued that for Rav Soloveichik \\"Jewish philosophy, he said, had to emerge from halakhah, Jewish law. Jewish thought and Jewish practice were not two different things but the same thing seen from different perspectives. Halakhah was a way of living a way of thinking about the world ‚Äì taking abstract ideas and making them real in everyday life.\\" The third figure was Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, a former principal of the London School of Jewish Studies. Sacks called Rabinovitch \\"One of the great Maimonidean scholars of our time, [who] taught us, his students, that Torah leadership demands the highest intellectual and moral courage. He did this in the best way possible: by personal example. The following thoughts, which are his, are a small indication of what I learned from him ‚Äì not least that Torah is, among other things, a refusal to give easy answers to difficult questions.\\" Of What Was Moses Afraid? Covenant & Conversation for Shemot 5768 by R. Sacks =Universalism vs particularism= As a rabbi, social philosopher, proponent of interfaith dialogue and public intellectual, Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that \\"[Sacks's] vision‚Äîinformed as it is by the concerns of modern Orthodoxy‚Äîis paradoxically one of the most universalizing voices within contemporary Judaism. Sacks possesses a rare ability to hold in delicate balance the universal demands of the modern, multicultural world with the particularism associated with Judaism.\\" This is a view supported by Rabbi Nathan Lopez Cardozo who wrote in The Jerusalem Post that Sacks' \\"confidence in the power of Judaism and its infinite wisdom enabled him to enter the lion's den, taking on famous philosophers, scientists, religious thinkers and sociologists and showing them that Judaism had something to teach that they couldn't afford to miss if they wanted to be at the forefront of philosophy and science.\\"\\"The rebellion of Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks\\", The Jerusalem Post, 7 September 2013 Harris and Rynhold, in their introduction to Radical Responsibility argued that: \\"The special contribution made by the thought of Chief Rabbi Sacks is that it not only continues the venerable Jewish philosophical tradition of maintaining traditional faith in the face of external intellectual challenges, but also moves beyond this tradition by showing how core Jewish teachings can address the dilemmas of the secular world itself. What make Lord Sacks' approach so effective is that he is able to do so without any exception of the wider world taking on Judaism's theological beliefs.\\" =Torah v'Chokhma= The framework for Sacks' philosophical approach and his interaction between the universal and the particular is not too dissimilar from those positions adopted by other leading Orthodox thinkers of recent times. The favoured phrase of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was Torah im derekh eretz, 'Torah and general culture'; for Rabbi Norman Lamm it was Torah u-mada. 'Torah and Science'. For Sacks, his favoured phrase has been Torah vehokhmah, 'Torah and Wisdom'. As noted in the introduction to Radical Responsibility: \\"Torah, for Jonathan Sacks represents the particularistic, inherited teachings of Judaism, while hokhmah (wisdom) refers to the universal realm of the sciences and humanities.\\" Framed in religious terms, as Sacks sets out in his book Future Tense: \\"Chokhmah is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. Chokhmah is the universal language of humankind; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. Chokhmah is what we attain by being in the image of God; Torah is what guides Jews as the people of God. Chokhmah is acquired by seeing and reasoning; Torah is received by listening and responding. Chokhmah tells us what is; Torah tells us what ought to be.\\"Jonathan Sacks, Future Tense (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2009), p.221 Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes are of the opinion that whilst Torah v'Chokhmah is certainly a valid overarching framework, they note that Sacks' perspective is one rooted in modern orthodoxy: \\"Although he [Sacks] will try to understand various denominations of Judaism, he is always quick to point out that Orthodoxy cannot recognize the legitimacy of interpretations of Judaism that abandon fundamental beliefs of halakhic (Jewish law) authority. Judaism that departs from the truth and acceptance of the halakha is a departure from authentic Judaism and, he reasons, is tantamount to the accommodation of secularism. So, while Sacks will develop a highly inclusive account of the world's religions, there were times when he was critical of the denominations within Judaism.\\"Universalizing Particularity, p.7 =\\"No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth\\"= After the publication of his book The Dignity of Difference, a group of Haredi rabbis, most notably Rabbis Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and Bezalel Rakow, accused Sacks of heresy against what they consider the traditional Orthodox viewpoint. According to them, some words seemed to imply an endorsement of pure relativism between religions, and that Judaism is not the sole true religion, e.g. \\"No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth.\\" This led him to rephrase more clearly some sentences in the book for its second edition, though he refused to recall books already in the stores. In his \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\" of the book, Sacks wrote that certain passages in the book had been misconstrued: He had already explicitly criticised cultural and religious relativism in his book, and he did not deny Judaism's uniqueness. He also stressed, however, that mainstream rabbinic teachings teach that wisdom, righteousness, and the possibility of a true relationship with God are all available in non-Jewish cultures and religions as an ongoing heritage from the covenant that God made with Noah and all his descendants, so the tradition teaches that one does not need to be Jewish to know God or truth, or to attain salvation.Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, The Dignity of Difference, 2nd edition, 2003, pp. vii, 52‚Äì65Faith Lectures: Jewish Identity: The Concept of a Chosen People. Chief Rabbi (1 December 1990). Retrieved on 3 December 2011. As this diversity of covenantal bonds implies, however, traditional Jewish sources do clearly deny that any one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth. Monopolistic and simplistic claims of universal truth he has characterized as imperialistic, pagan and Platonic, and not Jewish at all.See Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, The Dignity of Difference, Chapter 3: \\"Exorcising Plato's Ghost,\\" and reaffirmed in his book, Future Tense, 2009, Chapter 4: \\"The Other: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\\" The book received international acclaim, winning the Grawemeyer Award for Religion in 2004. =Efforts to accommodate Haredi Jews= A book by the British historian and journalist Meir Persoff, Another Way, Another Time, has argued that \\"Sacks's top priority has been staying in the good graces of the Haredi, or strictly Orthodox, faction, whose high birthrate has made it the fastest-growing component of British Jewry.\\" =Relationship with the non-Orthodox denominations= Sacks provoked considerable controversy in the Anglo-Jewish community in 1996 when he refused to attend the funeral service of the late Reform Rabbi Hugo Gryn and for a private letter he had written in Hebrew, which (in translation) asserted that Auschwitz survivor Gryn was \\"among those who destroy the faith\\", was leaked and published. He wrote further that he was an \\"enemy\\" of the Reform, Liberal and Masorti movements, leading some to reject the notion that he is \\"Chief Rabbi\\" for all Jews in Britain. He attended a memorial meeting for Gryn, a move that brought the wrath of some in the ultra-Orthodox community.Ian Burrell, \\"Leaked letter widens schism in Jewry\\", The Independent, 15 March 1997 Rabbi Dow Marmur, an Israel-based progressive Rabbi, argued that after attending the memorial service, Sacks then attempted to placate the ultra-Orthodox community, an attempt which Marmur has described as \\"neurotic and cowardly.\\" Later, in a letter to The Jewish Chronicle in May 2013, Jackie Gryn, the widow of Rabbi Hugo Gryn, wrote: \\"I feel the time has come for me to lay to rest, once and for all , the idea‚Ä¶ that there ever was a 'Hugo Gryn Affair', as far as I am concerned, regarding the absence of the Chief Rabbi at the funeral of my late husband, Hugo‚Ä¶ From the beginning, relations were cordial and sympathetic and have remained so\\", she wrote. \\"There has never been any personal grievance between us concerning his non-attendance at the funeral, which promoted such venomous and divisive comments and regrettably continues to do so.\\" Sacks responded to the incident by rethinking his relationship with the non-Orthodox movements, eventually developing what he called the \\"two principles\\". Responding to an interview shortly before his retirement, he wrote that \\"You try and make things better in the future. As a result of the turbulence at that time, I was forced to think this whole issue through and I came up with these two principles; on all matters that affect us as Jews regardless of our religious differences we work together regardless of our religious differences, and on all things that touch our religious differences we agree to differ, but with respect. As a result of those two principles, relations between Reform and Orthodox have got much better and are actually a model for the rest of the Jewish world. Progressive rabbis sit with me on the top table of the Council of Christians and Jews, we stand together for Israel. All of this flowed from those two principles. Until then there had been a view never to do anything with the non-Orthodox movements but once you thought it through you saw that there were all sorts of opportunities.\\" Rabbi Sacks would later draw some criticism when he and his Beth Din prevented the retired Rabbi Louis Jacobs, who had helped establish the British branch of the Masorti movement, from being called up for the Reading of the Torah on the Saturday before his granddaughter's wedding. =Secularism and Europe's changing demographics= Sacks has expressed concern at what he regards as the negative effects of materialism and secularism in European society, arguing that they undermine the basic values of family life and lead to selfishness. In 2009, Sacks gave an address claiming that Europeans have chosen consumerism over the self- sacrifice of parenting children, and that \\"the major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians\\". He argued that Europe is in population decline \\"because non-believers lack shared values of family and community that religion has\\". =Consumerism and Steve Jobs= Rabbi Sacks made remarks at an inter-faith reception attended by the Queen, in November 2011, in which he criticised what he believed to be the selfish consumer culture that has only brought unhappiness. \\"The consumer society was laid down by the late Steve Jobs coming down the mountain with two tablets, iPad one and iPad two, and the result is that we now have a culture of iPod, iPhone, iTune, i, i, i. When you're an individualist, egocentric culture and you only care about 'I', you don‚Äôt do terribly well.\\"Chief Rabbi blames Apple for helping create selfish society. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.Rabbi vs. Steve Jobs: iThis & iThat cause sadness ‚Äì OTOH: On the other hand . Blogs.computerworlduk.com. Retrieved on 3 December 2011. In a later statement, the Chief Rabbi's office said \\"The Chief Rabbi meant no criticism of either Steve Jobs personally or the contribution Apple has made to the development of technology in the 21st century.\\" =Position on gay marriage= In July 2012 a group of prominent British Jews criticised Sacks for opposing plans to allow civil marriage for gays and lesbians. He has said that he understands \\"the fear that gays have of prejudice and persecution\\" and went on to say, in a lecture on the institution of marriage, that a world that persecutes homosexuals is one \\"to which we should never return.\\" =Interfaith dialogue= Rabbi Sacks is an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.The Elijah Interfaith Institute - Jewish Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders =Politics in the United States= In October 2017, Jonathan Sacks inveighed against a \\"politics of anger\\" he said was corroding the fabric of U.S. society. \\"The politics of anger that's emerged in our time is full of danger,\\" Sacks said. He decried the breakdown of American society into narrower and narrower identities that nurtured a \\"culture of grievances.\\" Sacks warned that \\"The social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost.\\" =On antisemitism= In a June 2019 debate on antisemitism in the House of Lords, Sacks stated that \\"there is hardly a country in the world, certainly not a single country in Europe, where Jews feel safe\\" and that societies tolerating antisemitism had \\"forfeited all moral credibility\\".

It was published by Sega in Japan and THQ in North America and Europe. It is the second fighting game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the first game being Sonic the Fighters. It is the sequel to 2002's Sonic Advance 2 and was released in Japan in December 2003 and in North America and Europe in early 2004. Plot While studying the diary of his grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman learns of an artifact Gerald had unearthed: a 4000-year- old sentient weapon called the Gizoid created by an ancient civilization. Eggman attempts to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, but is unsuccessful and abandons it at Emerald Beach. Sonic the Hedgehog finds the Gizoid, which activates and develops a link with him after Sonic demonstrates his abilities. The Gizoid, which Sonic names Emerl due to its ability to use the Chaos Emeralds, demonstrates an ability to perfectly replicate any moves it sees and quickly gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Tails, Rouge, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, and Shadow, Emerl learns of the world and of concepts like friendship. As they train together, the group discovers that Emerl becomes stronger and develops more sentience with each Chaos Emerald that he obtains, and begin searching for the remaining Emeralds to help the robot develop. While searching, they are repeatedly attacked by the forces of Eggman, who now wants to retrieve the weapon, including a rebuilt E-102 Gamma and a series of imperfect Emerl duplicates under the name \\"E-121 Phi\\". Eventually, all the Chaos Emeralds are obtained and Emerl achieves full sentience. In a last attempt, Eggman decides to lure Emerl onto his new Death Egg to capture him. The two battle, and Emerl emerges victorious, but Eggman uses his new Final Egg Blaster to force Emerl to override his link with Sonic with Eggman's own. However, this overloads Emerl, deleting his personality and causing him to go haywire. The rogue Gizoid then turns the blaster towards the planet, and Sonic is sent to stop him before the world is destroyed. Sonic defeats Emerl, who briefly reverts to his previous personality and bids his friends farewell before overloading with energy and exploding, leaving the shards of the Chaos Emeralds he acquired behind. Sonic returns home to his friends, who are saddened by the loss of Emerl. When asked if he believes Emerl is truly gone, Sonic reassures everyone that they will see him again someday. Gameplay Shadow the Hedgehog participates in a battle with Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower and Knuckles the Echidna. The 3D stage features a grassy environment with Chao-themed ruins. Battles are fought in 3D arenas with up to four players. Each character has a set of attacks and abilities. The majority of attacks are used with B, including the combo (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Attack), Air Attack, Upper Attack (used to knock opponents straight up), Heavy Attack (used to knock opponents away), and Aim Attack (used to pursue an opponent after the Heavy Attack). The A button is used to jump, and the L button lets the player block attacks, or heal damage if the button is held. The playable characters also have unique special moves, the three types being Shot, Power, and Set. Shot moves center around using a projectile to damage the opponent from a distance. Power moves focus on dealing damage quickly in a single move. Trap moves generally involve using a type of bomb to surprise-attack the enemy. However, only a limited number of special moves can be selected. Shot, Power, and Trap must be allocated to three slots: Ground, Air, and Defend. The special move you set to Ground will be used when you press R on the ground. The move you set to Air will be used when you press R in mid-air. The last slot, Defend, has a different function; When a player sets a certain type of special move to Defend, then every time an enemy uses the same type of special move set to Defend to attack, it will automatically be blocked. Each player has two vital stats, a health bar and an Ichikoro Gauge. When health is completely depleted, the player is KO'd and loses one life (in a survival match) or the one who KO'd them gets a point (in a KO match). The Ground, Air, and Defend settings are chosen at the beginning of the match, and every time the player respawns. As a player takes damage, blocks attacks, or heals, the Ichikoro Gauge fills up. When it is full, the next special move the player does will instantly KO anyone it hits. However, if they chose to defend against that type of special, or successfully block, their Ichikoro Gauge will be filled instantly. Players healing damage will also slowly fill up their Ichikoro Gauge, but are still vulnerable to attacks. =Characters= The main playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Cream the Rabbit, E-102 Gamma, and Chaos (E-102 Gamma and Chaos are not playable in Story Mode, but they are playable in Battle Mode and Challenge Mode when you unlock them in the Story Mode), as well as the original character Emerl, whose Skill Copy allows players to teach him different fighting abilities throughout the game. =Minigames= The game includes five mini-games. The only mini-game available at the beginning of the game is \\"Soniclash\\", in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In Tails' Fly and Get, players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. Knuckles' Mine Hunt is a single-player game based on the computer game Minesweeper. In Amy's Treasure Island, players move around and search for emeralds, and in Shadow's Speed Demon (which is relatively similar to the stage \\"Radical Highway\\" on Sonic Adventure 2), the players race against each other. Reception The game received generally mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator site Metacritic. While some critics praised the game's \\"surprisingly deep arena-fighting gameplay\\", graphics, and multiplayer mode, others dismissed it for its \\"limited moveset\\" and use of 2D sprites on a 3D fighting arena. IGN gave the game a positive review, saying \\"It does try hard to be what Smash Bros. is, and even though the game doesn't quite reach the same status Nintendo and HAL created for the Nintendo consoles, Sonic Battle has enough stuff to make it one of the top original fighters on the Game Boy Advance system.\\" GameSpy also gave a positive review, saying \\"A solid and pleasantly deep arena beat-'em-up with lots of longevity, and though the presence of the Hedgehog and his posse adds absolutely nothing to the game, it's nice to see them getting work in these tough economic times.\\" Nintendo Power gave a more mixed review, saying the \\"moves are limited, but the overall experience is tons of fun.\\" GamePro also gave a mixed review, criticizing the game's story mode, saying \\"The biggest problem with Sonic Battle is the poor game design in Story mode. Earning Skill Points, and thereby new abilities for Emerl the Robot, is a grueling ordeal.\\" Notes References External links * * Category:2003 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic Team games Battle Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games produced by Yuji Naka Category:Video games with oblique graphics Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Sonic Battle"},{"id":"1135097","text":"Marcher may refer to: *one who is marching *one who takes part in a demonstration (political) *anything pertaining to a march (territory), especially **the Welsh Marches **a Marcher Lord **March law ","title":"Marcher"},{"id":"1135098","text":"Sir John Bertrand Gurdon (born 2 October 1933) is an English developmental biologist. He is best known for his pioneering research in nuclear transplantation and cloning. He was awarded the Lasker Award in 2009. In 2012, he and Shinya Yamanaka were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells. Early days Gurdon attended Edgeborough and then Eton College, where he ranked last out of the 250 boys in his year group at biology, and was in the bottom set in every other science subject. A schoolmaster wrote a report stating \\"I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.\\" Gurdon explains it is the only document he ever framed; Gurdon also told a reporter \\"When you have problems like an experiment doesn't work, which often happens, it's nice to remind yourself that perhaps after all you are not so good at this job and the schoolmaster may have been right.\\" Gurdon went to Christ Church, Oxford, to study classics but switched to zoology. For his DPhil degree he studied nuclear transplantation in a frog species of the genus Xenopus with Michael Fischberg at Oxford. Following postdoctoral work at Caltech,Rodney Porter Lectures: Biography he returned to England and his early posts were at the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford (1962‚Äì71). Gurdon has spent much of his research career at the University of Cambridge, first at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (1971‚Äì83) and then at the Department of Zoology (1983‚Äìpresent). In 1989, he was a founding member of the Wellcome/CRC Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer (later Wellcome/CR UK) in Cambridge, and was its Chair until 2001. He was a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 1991‚Äì1995, and Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, from 1995 to 2002. Research A video from an open-access article co- authored by Gurdon: Animal view of different embryos developing in Xenopus laevis eggs: a diploid laevis x laevis is shown on the top, cleaving and entering gastrulation about 50 min earlier than haploid [laevis] x laevis (middle) and [laevis] x tropicalis cybrid (bottom) embryos. =Nuclear transfer= In 1958, Gurdon, then at the University of Oxford, successfully cloned a frog using intact nuclei from the somatic cells of a Xenopus tadpole. This work was an important extension of work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from embryonic blastula cells and the successful induction of polyploidy in the stickleback, Gasterosteus aculatus, in 1956 by Har Swarup reported in Nature.Swarup H. Production of heteroploidy in the three-spined stickle back (Gasterosteus aculeatus L) Nature in 1956;178:1124‚Äì1125. doi: 10.1038/1781124a0; http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v178/n4542/abs/1781124a0.html At that time he could not conclusively show that the transplanted nuclei derived from a fully differentiated cell. This was finally shown in 1975 by a group working at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland. They transplanted a nucleus from an antibody-producing lymphocyte (proof that it was fully differentiated) into an enucleated egg and obtained living tadpoles. Gurdon's experiments captured the attention of the scientific community as it altered the notion of development and the tools and techniques he developed for nuclear transfer are still used today. The term clone (from the ancient Greek word Œ∫ŒªœéŒΩ (kl≈çn, \\"twig\\")) had already been in use since the beginning of the 20th century in reference to plants. In 1963 the British biologist J. B. S. Haldane, in describing Gurdon's results, became one of the first to use the word \\"clone\\" in reference to animals. =Messenger RNA expression= Gurdon and colleagues also pioneered the use of Xenopus (genus of highly aquatic frog) eggs and oocytes to translate microinjected messenger RNA molecules, a technique which has been widely used to identify the proteins encoded and to study their function. =Recent research= Gurdon's recent research has focused on analysing intercellular signalling factors involved in cell differentiation, and on elucidating the mechanisms involved in reprogramming the nucleus in transplantation experiments, including the role of histone variants, and demethylation of the transplanted DNA. Politics and religion Gurdon has stated that he is politically \\"middle of the road\\", and religiously agnostic because \\"there is no scientific proof either way\\". During his tenure as Master of Magdalene College, Gurdon created some controversy when he suggested that fellows should occasionally be allowed to deliver \\"an address on anything they would like to talk about\\" in college chapel services. In an interview with EWTN.com, Gurdon reports that \\"I'm what you might call liberal minded. I'm not a Roman Catholic. I'm a Christian, of the Church of England.\\" Honours and awards Gurdon was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1971, and was knighted in 1995. In 2004, the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer was renamed the Gurdon Institute in his honour. He has also received numerous awards, medals and honorary degrees. In 2005, he was elected as an Honorary Member of the American Association of Anatomists. He was awarded the 2009 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research award and in 2014 delivered the Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians. In 2017, Gurdon received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. =Nobel Prize= In 2012 Gurdon was awarded, jointly with Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine \\"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\\". His Nobel Lecture was called \\"The Egg and the Nucleus: A Battle for Supremacy\\".

The name of this genus is derived from the Greek words acanthos (\\"spiny\\") and ephippion (\\"saddle\\"), referring to the saddle-like labellum of the plants. This terrestrial and sometimes myco-heterotrophic genus of sympodial orchids is distributed from the Indian subcontinent to Taiwan, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the southwest Pacific.Flora of China, v 25 p 309, ÂùõËä±ÂÖ∞Â±û tan hua lan shu, Acanthephippium Blume, Bijdr. 353. 1825. The terrestrial species are up to 80 cm tall. They have short rhizomes. The oblong and fleshy pseudobulbs are up to 25 cm tall. They produce at their apex 2 to 3 large plicate, lanceolate, parallel-veined leaves, which can be up to 65 cm long.Thomas, S.A. 1997 - Taxonomic revision of the genus Acanthephippium (Orchidaceae).

The erect inflorescence arises laterally from the pseudobulbs, with 3 to 6 flowers, subtended by large, glabrous bracts. The flowers are prominent, large, striated cup- or urn-shaped, fleshy, waxy, and about 4 cm long. They resemble a tulip, a most unusual shape for an orchid. The flowers have a wide range of colors, from dull yellow to red to shades of orange and pink, marked with stripes or spots. The blossoms are usually odiferous with a very strong fragrance. This genus is allied to genera Calanthe, Cephalantheropsis, Phaius, and Spathoglottis. Taxonomy The genus Acanthophippium was first described by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1825. He used the spelling with an \\"o\\". Many sources have since spelt the name \\"Acanthephippium\\" (i.e. with an \\"e\\"). This is regarded as an orthographic variant by the International Plant Names Index. The original spelling is used by sources such as the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. =Species= # Acanthophippium bicolor (S.

Rainy River is situated on the eponymous Rainy River, which forms part of the Ontario-Minnesota segment of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Across the river is the town of Baudette, Minnesota. The two towns are connected by the Baudette ‚Äì Rainy River International Bridge. Rainy River is at the northwestern terminus of Highway 11. Rainy River was frequently thought to have been the northwestern terminus of Yonge Street, or Highway 11 running north from Toronto. Because of this incorrect conflation, Yonge Street was known as the \\"longest street in the world.\\" and gained its fame in the Guinness World Records for many years. Highway 11 is marked through Rainy River as Atwood Avenue, although the town and the City of Toronto both maintain commemorative markers at each end. History From Rainy Lake, derived from the French Lac la Pluie (Lake of Rain). Appears as Rain Lake in 1813 Gazetteer. Post office (Rainy River) established in 1886. Incorporated as the town of Rainy River in 1904, the community was first formed around 1895 as part of mill development by a group of lumbermen along the East shore of the Rainy River. Their mill and related developments were located about 2 km from the current town center. In 1898 their mill was purchased by the Beaver Mills Lumber Company. The small village took the name Beaver Mills until it was incorporated as a town. In 1901 the Ontario and Rainy River Railway completed a bridge connecting Minnesota, United States to Ontario, but the Beaver Mills town site was in the way of the eastern end. The company developed a new town further upriver, between the two large lumber mills. The only method of transport at the time was by steamship so parts of the bridge were shipped and arrived addressed to \\"Rainy River\\". The town eventually accepted this as their name. Rainy River Town Hall, formerly the town's train station. The thriving lumber industry and associated mills stimulated growth of the town, as did the Railway. In 1910, a forest fire known as the Great Fire of 1910, originating in northern Minnesota, swept north and destroyed the mills. On the southern, US side of the river, the villages of Baudette and Spooner were completely burned out. Many of the people survived only because a group of brave residents from Rainy River backed a train of box cars across the bridge and pulled the people north to safety. After the fire, the mill industry relocated. The population of Rainy River quickly declined from more than 2000 people to less than 800. No alternative economy was developed to support a larger population. This is a map of the Town of Rainy River circa 1910.

At one time it was the site of a rail round house and associated jobs. In the 1960s the Rainy River Boat company operated here, and in the 1970s Arctic Cat Apparel manufactured related clothing. The decline of these industries has adversely affected the rural town. The town is located at southeast of Lake of the Woods.
