Around the pedestal of the monument may be found the names of the Confederate regiments raised in Anderson County and a list of those men wounded or killed during the war. There were a few Civil War skirmishes at Lawrenceburg, The Battle of Lawrenceburg and the Battle of Dog Walk, just before the Battle of Perryville in October 1862. In particular, the Union Ninth Kentucky Cavalry fought the Confederate cavalry under Colonel Scott on October 6, 1862. Confederate troops that would control Frankfort had marched through the town. In later years, the local area saw guerrilla warfare, which force the creation of a Union Home Guard unit in the town.Kleber, John E. The Kentucky Encyclopedia.

It has successfully supported research for the United States crewed spacecraft programs and numerous uncrewed projects. The facility uses vertical drop tests in a vacuum chamber to investigate the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion in such circumstances. The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, in diameter, that extends below ground level. A steel vacuum chamber, in diameter and high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3 atm) before use. Test equipment is typically mounted in a cylindrical container, and has a maximum weight of . Equipment dropped in the chamber experiences microgravity for about 5.15 seconds before landing in a deceleration cart filled with expanded styrofoam beads; it typically experiences 32g during deceleration, but may range up to 65g. The service building at the top of the shaft contains a shop area, control room, and a clean room. Assembly, servicing, and balancing of the experiment vehicle are accomplished in the shop area. Tests are conducted from the control room, which contains controls for the \\"pump down\\" of the vacuum chamber, the experiment vehicle pre-drop checkout, release and the data retrieval system. History The Zero Gravity Research Facility was built in 1966 as part of NASA's Centaur upper-stage rocket development program. In order to ensure proper firing and functioning of upper-stage rockets, NASA needed to understand the behavior of fluids (importantly, the liquid gases fueling the rockets), in the reduced gravity where they would fire. The facility was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985 for its role in the early space program.

They formed a collegium devoted to Jupiter as the patron of good faith. The duties of the fetials included advising the senate on foreign affairs and international treaties, making formal proclamations of peace and of war, and confirming treaties. They also carried out the functions of traveling heralds or ambassadors (Pater Patratus). According to one source the original meaning is unclear. The term could be read \\"father of the fathers\\", referring to the fetiales, or it could be read as a father whose own father is still living. Patratus can also be read as from the latin verb meaning to accomplish, or bring about, which could simply mean that the title meant that he was the \\"spokesman\\", the appointed father, or chosen father. In another sense of the same verb, it could mean a father who is of great accomplishment or esteemed. An Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language, 1828, Francis Edward Jackson VALPY, pg. 324) The first mention of the fetials by Livy occurs in the context of the war between Alba Longa and Rome, during which the Roman king Tullus Hostilius appointed M. Valerius as a fetial and Sp. Fusius as pater patratus, for the purpose of binding Rome and Alba Longa by a treaty.Livy Ab Urbe Condita I.32. According to Livy, the ritual by which the fetials were to declare war, the ritual of rerum repetitio, was introduced to Rome by Ancus Marcius, borrowing on the traditions of the Aequicolae. However, he had already described the ritual actions of the fetials when recording the wars of Tullus Hostilius.Livy, AUC I.24. Thus some scholars think the mentions of the Aequi may be a misinterpretation due to a folk etymology connecting Aequi to aequus, the Latin adjective for fair. On the other hand ancient sources support the tradition that the priesthood was created under the influence of Aequian king Ferter Resus.Inc. Auc. de Praenominibus I apud Valerius Maximus X: \\"Fertorem Resium qui ius fetiale constituit\\"; Inc. Auc. de Viribus Illustribus V 4 apud Aurelius Victor p. 29: \\"(Ancus Martius) ius fetiale...ab Aequicolis transtulit quod primus Ferter Rhesus excogitavisse\\"; CIL VI 1302 from the Palatine (II-I century BC); Festus s. v. Ferctius p. 81 L; Propertius IV 105-146; Plutarch Marcellus 8. 4, Romulus 16. 6. Rerum repetitio The ritual of rerum repetitio, a request of restitution or reparations, involved the pater patratus. Wearing a woolen hair-band, he was to announce Roman demands using a series of prescribed phrases, first at the enemy's frontier, then when he passes over the borders, again to the first man he meets, again on entering the enemy's gate, and again on entering the forum in the presence of local magistrates. If the demands are not met, the pater patratus declares war within 33 days and returns to Rome to await the resolution of the Roman king and senate. Once they have resolved to go to war, a fetial returns to the enemy frontier carrying a javelin with a steel or fire-hardened tip and dipped in blood. He declares war on the enemy, and throws the javelin into their territory. The fetial is connected to matters of law and not directly to war, hence in his formulae he never invokes Mars, but Jupiter, Juno (or perhaps Janus) and Quirinus. The religious relevance of the collegium or sodalitas lay in ensuring that Rome enjoyed the protection of gods in its relationships with foreign states. This collegium was probably common to other Latin cities as Livy makes reference to the fetials of Alba. Etymology According to some scholars,G. Dumezil, La religion romaine archa√Øque, 1974.M. Morani \\"Lat. sacer...nel lessico religioso latino\\" Aevum LV, 1981, pp.30-46. the name derives from the noun root *feti-, which means 'foundation' and not 'stipulation'. It is allied to the basic religious concept of fas, both being rooted in IE *dh(e)s, originally meaning 'to set, setting'. This root has given the verb facere, 'to do, make' by a semantic shift. Both fetial and fas preserve the original sense of 'foundation' here, as in Vedic dhaman, dhatu in its religious sense. Religious implications The implications of this etymology would hint to the fact that outside their own ager Romans felt the need for a religious, founding justification of their actions as a people toward other ones. A need was felt to go beyond the sphere of human law or right. While juridical justification was acknowledged as necessary Romans wanted to ensure the approval of what founds right and makes it possible, the fas. This attitude is testified by the ceremonies held by the fetials that confer religious value to political decisions and specifications in their dealing with foreign nations, aimed at placing the gods on the side of Rome and hence effectively entrusting to them the fate of Rome. Details of the operative duties of the fetials The sodalitas dispatched two of its members, of whom only one, called the pater patratus,The meaning of this title is unclear; according to Plutarch it denotes \\"a man whose father is still alive and who has children\\" (Mor. IV, 62), but he confuses it with pater patrimus. The word patratus may be connected to either the noun pater (\\"father\\") or the verb patrare (\\"to execute, bring about\\"). Possible translations include \\"one who is made father\\" and \\"the father accomplisher\\". See A. Strobach, Plutarch und die Sprachen (1997), 78; R.E. Mitchell, \\"The definition of patres and plebs: an end to the struggle of the orders\\", in K.A. Raaflaub, Social struggles in archaic Rome: new perspectives on the conflict of the orders (2005), 128-167, esp. 143. was active, while the other called verbenarius was limited in function to accompanying the pater patratus with sacred herbs (sagmina of vervain) gathered on the Capitolium. We know the ceremonies and formulae of two circumstances: (1) conclusion of a treaty and (2) request of reparations and declaration of war. In the first circumstance the pater patratus called standersby and the gods to witness, staked the word of Rome, and vowed Rome to divine wrath if it should not abide by its word, asking for execratio. Oaths were made by Jupiter Lapis (per Iovem Lapidem). The flintstone was believed to be a seat of Jupiter's because if struck it emitted sparks, thus being analogous to lightning. The ceremony has two known variants. In the first one the pater patratus hits a pig with flintstone taken from the temple of Jupiter Feretrius pronouncing the formula referred by Livy;Livy, AUC I.24.8: \\"Si prior defexit publico consilio dolo malo tum tu illo die, Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam, tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes pollesque.\\" in the second he throws the flintstone and vows Rome to fall as the stone itself if it should fail to abide by the oath.Pol. 3, 25, 6-9 When Rome asked for reparations for an offense or damage, the fetials were sent as ambassadors to the foreign country concerned. If the requests borne by the pater patratus were not met, he went back to Rome after invoking Jupiter, Juno (or Janus), and Quirinus, along with the heavenly gods, the terrestrial gods, and the gods of the netherworld as witnesses of the violation of the ius and after declaring war within 30 or 33 days. When this period of time had expired he went back to the border and opened the hostilities with a magic gesture: while affirming once again the good right of Rome he threw a spear with steel point or a javelin of corniolum hardened with fire into the enemy's territory.Livy, AUC I, 32, 5-14; Dion. Hal. 2,72, 6-8 The fetials were a common institution of the Latins and of other Italic people.Dionysius of Halicarnassus Ant. Rom. I 21, 1; II 72; Livy, AUC I.32.4. According to G. Dum√©zil, the initial contract concluded with the gods and extended through the sacra and the signa is sufficient to justify the acts of official religious authorities (such as pontiffs and augurs) within the Roman ager. Actions beyond this boundary require an additional religious foundation, based not only on ius but also, on a deeper level, the fas on which ius is based. This is the task of the fetials who achieve their aim through the *feti-, word that as Vedic dhƒÅtu means founding. They rely on a set of ceremonies that bestow a religious value on the political or military decisions of the magistrates, ensuring that under any circumstance Rome has the gods on her side. Besides offering their advice on international issues to the senate or the consuls, the sodalitas dispatches two envoys (the pater patratus and the verbenarius, the last one having only the task of carrying the sagmina taken from the Capitol Hill) to ask for the reparations, to declare war in a form that is pious and just, and lastly to conclude the peace. The god under whose protection they act and whom the pater patratus invokes is Iupiter Lapis in the rite of the conclusion of a treatyLivy I.24.8. and in general when there an agreement is reached. If a declaration of war ensues the fetial calls as witnesses Jupiter, Juno (or Janus, correction accepted by most editors), Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and nether gods of the violation of the ius and declares war within thirty-three days.Livy I.32.10. Political implications of the ius fetiale The author of Cicero's apocryphal speech of Furius Filus and the Christian apologists blamed the Romans for craftily using the ius fetiale in order to ensure divine support for Rome in international disputes. They allege that Romans were not moved by a desire for justice in their use of the ius fetiale, but rather bent its rules and made a disproportionately excessive use of its technicalities to acquire an undue advantage over other peoples with the ultimate goal of stealing their lands and riches.

Along with several other Semnopithecus, it had been previously considered a subspecies of the northern plains gray langur, Semnopithecus entellus, i.e., Semnopithecus entellus dussumieri. Subsequent genetic research has revealed that Semnopithecus dussumieri is an invalid taxon. These monkeys live in groups in forests and other rural habitats, with some groups being habituated to human contact and feeding. They are herbivorous, feeding by day mainly on foliage, fruits and flowers, and sleeping at night high in a tree. Taxonomy The taxonomy of gray langurs has been in a state of flux. At first, all gray langurs were included in a single species, Semnopithecus entellus, with several subspecies, but more recently some authorities have elevated these to species status. The southern plains gray langur was the common name ascribed to Semnopithecus dussumieri by Mammal Species of the World (3rd edition) in 2005. Along with several other Semnopithecus, it had been previously considered a subspecies of the northern plains gray langur, Semnopithecus entellus, i.e., Semnopithecus entellus dussumieri. Subsequent genetic research has revealed that Semnopithecus dussumieri is an invalid taxon. As a result, most populations of gray langurs that had been considered to be southern plains gray langur are considered to be populations of northern plains gray langurs S. entellus. Description The populations formerly regarded as southern plains gray langur are among the smaller gray langurs, with a height of about , a tail longer than the body and a weight of about . The hair on the top of their heads are cream-coloured, the body fur is grayish-brown or purplish-brown and the underparts are yellowish. The face and ears are black as are the hands and feet, and sometimes the ends of the limbs. When they move around, they carry their tails pointing backwards. Distribution and habitat The populations that had been considered to be southern plains gray langur are native to western, central and south-western India. They are found in various forest habitats, both humid and dry, and in dry scrubby locations, and have adapted to live in close proximity to humans, visiting agricultural areas, orchards, grassland and villages. Ecology The diet mainly consists of leaves, fruits and flowers, supplemented by insects, gum and soil. The food is mostly gathered from trees and shrubs, but grasses and small herbs are also eaten. A range of other foods are also eaten such as cultivated plants, tubers and roots. The monkeys are often fed by humans and accept cakes, millet, and other foods. The diet varies according to the time of year and food availability. In some areas, cattle and deer will stand under trees where the langurs are feeding and consume the edible pieces that they drop. The monkeys are preyed on by leopards, tigers and dholes, and they sometimes mob snakes. Groups may consist of a mature male with several females and their offspring of different ages; or they may be larger mixed-sex groups, or groups of different sizes formed entirely of males. Females often remain permanently in their natal group while males change groups more often. The dominant male in a mixed-sex group fathers all or most of the young. The incidence of infanticide is high and dominant females are more likely to raise their young successfully. The gestation period is about two hundred days and weaning takes place at about thirteen months. Females are sociable towards each other and much infant care is provided by females other than the mother. The southern plains gray langur can live for about thirty years. Status The populations that had been regarded as southern plains gray langur have a very wide range and are common. It faces no particular threats and when it was considered a species the International Union for Conservation of Nature assessed its conservation status as being of least concern. It is illegal to kill or capture these monkeys, but the law is not well known or well enforced, and many are used for public entertainment or kept as pets. They are considered sacred and some are used by Hindu priests for religious purposes. They have adapted to living in close proximity to humans in urban settings and occasionally get killed on the road. In rural areas, they may be persecuted by farmers when they raid crops. They are also sometimes hunted for food, and certain parts of their body are used for lucky charms.

The route is long, stretching north from an intersection with New York State Route 32 (NY 32) in the hamlet of Central Valley to a junction with NY 218 in the town of Cornwall, just west of the village of Cornwall-on-Hudson. CR 9 passes several historical buildings, such as the Carvey-Gatfield House, Cromwell Manor, the David Sutherland House, and the Sands Ring Homestead Museum. The northern terminus of CR 9 was originally located at Quaker Avenue in Cornwall, then designated as part of New York State Route 307\\\\. NY 307 continued north on Main Street to Hudson Street, where it ended at NY 218\\\\. In 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 307 was transferred to Orange County, and its routing became part of two county routes: an extended CR 9 and the new County Route 107\\\\. Route description CR 9 begins at an intersection with NY 32 in Central Valley, just north of its intersection with NY 17\\\\. The route heads northeastward, passing homes and tree patches. There are intersections with local roads, as CR 9, also known as Smith Clove Road, crosses the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87 or I-87). The road continues, passing Filters Lake and Central Valley Golf Club. Soon afterwards, CR 9 passes through a large patch of forests, which also covers parts of West Point Military Academy. CR 9 eastbound through Cornwall Smith Clove Road continues, passing forests to the east and homes to the west. The highway parallels I-87 and NY 32, as it progresses farther to the northeast. Soon after, Smith Clove Road becomes full of forests and grass, with homes becoming scarce. CR 34 (Trout Brook Road) terminates at CR 9 while the road continues towards Cornwall. Whispering Brook is afterwards, a small road on the east of CR 9. CR 9 becomes known as Mineral Springs Road and continues northward through forests. CR 65 (Angola Road) terminates at CR 9 soon after. However, the name Angola Road continues to the north along CR 9\\\\. As the highway approaches Cornwall, it becomes more suburbanized, with the Carvey- Gatfield House approachable on the east. With NY 32 parallelling to the north, Angola Road continues into Cornwall. Just before the overpass of U.S. Route 9W (US 9W), CR 9 passes the Cromwell Manor, an early-19th-century house. Just after the overpass comes the David Sutherland House, a stone structure dating back to 1770. His descendant also has a house along CR 9, Daniel Sutherland House, which is located at the Chadeayne Circle. The highway there continues along Main Street, an urbanized, 3-lane highway until its terminus at NY 218 in Cornwall-on-Hudson. CR 9 is longer than five state-maintained highways in Orange County. NY 210, NY 284, NY 293, NY 416, and NY 747 are all shorter than CR 9. History The original northern terminus of CR 9 was at the intersection of Quaker Avenue, Angola Road, and Main Street in Cornwall. At this intersection, CR 9 met NY 307, a southwest‚Äìnortheasterly route assigned in the mid-1930s that extended from NY 32 to NY 218 by way of Quaker Avenue, Main Street, and Hudson Street. Meanwhile, the portion of Main Street from Hudson Street (NY 307) to Academy Street (NY 218) was an unsigned, state- maintained highway. On January 9, 1980, the NY 307 designation was removed from the entirety of its routing. Ownership and maintenance of both NY 307's former routing west of Hudson Street, and Main Street between Hudson Street and NY 218, was transferred from the state of New York to Orange County roughly three months later on April 1 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Following the swap, CR 9 was extended northward along Main Street to a new terminus at NY 218 while NY 307's former routing along Quaker Avenue was designated as CR 107. Originally, CR 9's Mineral Springs Road segment had a longer alignment within the forests south of Angola Road. This was realigned and the old alignment became known as Old Mineral Springs Road.

Spurius Postumius Albinus was a politician of Ancient Rome, of patrician rank, of the 4th century BC. He was consul in 334 BC, and invaded, with his colleague Titus Veturius Calvinus, the country of the Sidicini. But on account of the great forces which the enemy had collected, and the report that the Samnites were coming to their assistance, a dictator was appointed, Publius Cornelius Rufinus.Livy, viii. 16, 17 He was censor in 332 BC and magister equitum in 327 BC, when Marcus Claudius Marcellus was appointed to hold the comitia.Livy, viii. 17, 23 In 321 BC, he was consul a second time with Titus Veturius Calvinus, and with him marched against the Samnites and their commander Gaius Pontius in the Second Samnite War. Postumius was defeated at the Battle of the Caudine Forks, near Caudium, and obliged to surrender with his whole army, who were sent \\"under the yoke\\", a symbolic gesture of submission to the enemy. As the price of his deliverance and that of the army, he and his colleague and the other commanders swore, in the name of the Republic, to a humiliating peace. Upon returning to Rome, the consuls, because of their disgrace, laid down their office and their senatorship, and proposed that all persons who had sworn to the peace (that is, themselves) should be stripped and bound and handed over to the Samnites by the Fetiales. The historian Livy quotes extensively from Postumius' speech in the Roman Senate on this matter. The proposal was accepted, and Postumius and the other prisoners were brought to the Samnites, but Gaius Pontius refused to accept their surrender, on the grounds that it was being used as an excuse to annul the treaty (unfavorable to Rome) that had concluded the Battle of the Caudine Forks.Livy, ix. 1‚Äî10Appian, de Reb.

The Tomy Tutor, originally sold in Japan as the and in the UK as the Grandstand Tutor, is a home computer produced by the Japanese toymaker Tomy. It was architecturally similar, but not identical, to the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and used a similar Texas Instruments 16-bit CPU.TI-vs- Tomy, Floodgap.com The computer was launched in the UK and the United States in 1983. Outside Japan, however, sales were not significant. History Produced by Matsushita, the computer was released in Japan in 1982 under the name Tomy Pyuuta. Tomy described the Tutor, with 16K RAM, as good for games and education. The company stated that its documentation would let an eight- year-old child use the computer without adult supervision. One of the major flaws pointed out with the Tutor was not its hardware, but its marketing: the Tutor was announced as a children's computer when in fact it was practically a cheap, evolved version of the TI-99/4A, even having a similar 16-bit CPU (the TMS 9995, closely related to the TI-99/4's TMS 9900); other competitors in its price range still used 8-bit microprocessors. The Tutor did not sell well against the ZX Spectrum in the UK and the Commodore 64 in other countries. It ended up being removed quickly from the market and replaced the following year by the Tomy Tutor MK II with a standard mechanical keyboard instead of the original \\"Chiclet\\"-style keyboard. However, the new model seems to have been sold only in Japan, and even then only for a short period of time.

Youngman explained that the band was more out for the personal satisfaction of assaulting the culture rather than making money.\\"Margaret Sutherland, (May 16, 1968), Loy Norrix High School Newspaper Super Jerome's Magic Band, Kalamazoo MI 1968 =Motor City Mutants= After a near-fatal car accident in September 1969, Jerome retreated to Amsterdam to recuperate and conceptualize his next musical project. What emerged in the Summer of 1970 was the Motor City Mutants, a high-energy, urban, punk blues band. The band debuted on January 1971 at Ann Arbor Union Ballroom. This performance featured the dissection of several dead animals the band found along I-94 on the way to the performance. Motor City Mutants original band members were Mutant Bob Tremain on electric piano, Julius Rodgers on drums, James Graves on vocals, Don Klos on bass guitar, Tom Morwatts and Youngman on guitars. The Motor City Mutants performed at many Michigan venues including the Grande Ballroom and quickly gained a hardcore following. The band lasted for over ten years. In January 1974, Youngman left the band and moved to Hollywood, California. =Punk= Punk was Youngman's first Hollywood band in 1974. Punk was managed by Roy MacMillan from Dynamic Recording in West Covina, California where the band shared rehearsal space with Van Halen and pre Wall of Voodoo band Sky People. Band members were Youngman on guitar, Steve (Liberty) Loria on bass, and Lee Jenkins on drums. In October 1974, Punk performed at Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco on the Sunset Strip. Punk broke up a year later after Youngman's suicide attempt that injured his left hand. His suicide attempt caused permanent neural damage to his left hand and he was unable to play guitar for over a year. During his recovery, best friend and drummer, Phil Cohen suggested they form a new band with Youngman playing keyboards. Youngman and Cohen created several new songs including \\"Photo Dating Queen\\", and The Flys were born. Youngman gradually began playing guitar again, but could only play two string bar chords due to his inability to feel his left hand. In 1976, The Flys opened for The Ramones at Svens Smoke House in Redondo Beach, California. The Ramones inspired Youngman and his confidence soon returned. A leaner, more minimal guitar style began to emerge. His next Hollywood project was called Ripper. Ripper played most of the Hollywood clubs, including the Troubadour, the Starwood, and the Masque. The band soon disintegrated because of major personality problems and the lack of quality vocals. Ripper recorded three songs at Ratz studio. Youngman's \\"Creeps at my Door\\", \\"Trapped like a Rat\\", and \\"Unter der Faust\\", a German version of The Rolling Stones \\"Under my Thumb\\". This German version puts a fascist twist to the original sexist version, since \\"Unter der Faust\\" means under my fist. The original Ripper recording of \\"Unter der Faust\\" featured Youngman's piano playing, lead guitar, and heavy-duty style rhythm guitar, and the recording was also to feature \\"Creeps at my Door\\". After moving to New York City, with drummer Quito Ecuador to form Hooks, Youngman's rhythm guitar tracks were deleted. This deletion turned the heavy punk version into a light new wave pop recording. The songs were released on Bomp! Records and \\"Creeps at my Door\\" was omitted from this record. =Hooks= Hooks was a five-piece band that was dedicated to the simplicity that is the heart of rock and roll. Hooks began its musical odyssey in Hollywood in December 1978, when singer Sharon 7 teamed up with Youngman and drummer Quito Ecuador to record a demo of the Exciters' 1960s hit, \\"Tell Him\\". The results were a tremendous updating that featured the embryo of the sound that was to become the trademark of Hooks. Seeing that there was chemistry between the players, Sharon 7 suggested that Youngman and Ecuador move to New York. Keyboardist, J. Elliot joined them and after months of searching for a bass guitarist, Hooks found Lew Mazzeo. Hooks single \\"Lipstick on Your Collar\\" and \\"Young and Boring\\" was produced by Roy Cicala and Sam Ginsberg of the Record Plant. Hooks were regulars on the N.Y.C. club scene playing clubs like CBGB's, Max's Kansas City and the Ritz. Hooks appeared live with Duran Duran, the Ramones, Iggy Pop, Adam & the Ants, Heartbreakers, David Johansen, King Crimson, The Beat, Sylvain Sylvain, Klaus Nomi, and others. Hooks was featured on a NBC Nightly News segment in 1982 that explored the phenomena of the Music Building on 8th avenue', in the heart of NYC Garment District. Madonna lived in the Music Building with her girlfriend, Camille from 1980 to 1982. In 1982, she recruited Youngman, Quito and Lou to create two original songs for her and back her up for a live performance on the Uncle Floyd Show. Youngman left Hooks in 1983 after disagreements with the record producers and returned to Detroit to complete his academic studies. In April 1983, he obtained a B.A. in Psychology from Wayne State University. A week after graduation, Jerome quickly returned to Hollywood and formed Too Many Gods. =Too Many Gods= In 1983 Youngman moved back to Los Angeles. In 1985, he released his first solo effort, a gold 45 record I Need More as Reverend Jerome T. Youngman. He then created a band of machines called Too Many Gods, the first one-person techno punk blues band. For the first time, with the invention of MIDI in 1983, a one-person pre-programmed live performance band became possible. With the assistance of Shelly, a dancer, Too Many Gods became regulars at the Limbo Lounge in the West Hollywood underground punk disco drag queen scene. Too Many Gods evolved into Mutant Press. =Mutant Press= In 1990, Youngman started Mutant Press, a political hard rock techno/punk blues band in Hollywood, California. Mutant Press's first job was headlining international act at the LUC club in Mexico City in 1990. Mutant Press Mexico City, 2018 In 1992, the Mutant Press project moved to Michigan. He obtained a social worker license and worked for many Detroit social service agencies with homeless and mentally ill populations. From 1996 to 2004, he managed 500 Pound Weasel Records, his recording studio in Southfield, Michigan. He released fourteen Mutant Press albums, and produced over 200 CDs for local rap, hip hop, and punk rock artists. Frank Moore & Mikee Labash (Love Underground Visionary Revolution) from San Francisco joined the creative team after the 2004 Mothers‚Äô Day performance at Kimos. The same year, artist Mikee Labash created the art for the album Evil. In 2004 after the death of his parents, Youngman returned to Long Beach, California and produced the Mutant Press album Idiots Rule with Steve Loria (Spirit) on bass guitar and Phil Cohen (The Heaters) on drums. Josie Cotton performed a cover of the Mutant Press song \\"Creeps at my Door\\" on her 2006 release entitled Movie Disaster Music. Mutant Press has received outstanding reviews. In 2003, Blood for Oil appeared in Robert Christgau's Choice Cuts in The Village Voice. Amy Goodman opened her show Democracy Now! with this song. Blood for Oil was first recorded for the 2003 album of the same name that was a Mutant Press tribute to the Fugs. In 2007, Robert Christgau wrote about Mutant Press ‚Äúif the MC5 hadn't kicked the bucket, they'd be older and greyer than these guys, but not louder, or more revolutionary\\". In August 2018, Mutant Press performed two sets for the first Motor City Muscle (MCM) Festival in downtown Detroit.

The album deals with Tolkki's personal beliefs and thoughts about life and encourages the listener to believe in him/herself. Despite some song names, Tolkki uses strong criticism against religions. Musically the album is for most parts anything but metal. Tolkki added a lot of different influences; pop, rock and classical. The song \\"Father\\", which is Tolkki's expression about his late father, also has doom metal elements in it. Perhaps due to its very non-Stratovarius style, the album did not have a very cheerful welcome from the metal audience. On the other hand, the album was never meant to be metal, but a solo album free of the style of Stratovarius.

The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Newport Gwent Dragons. Rugby had been played in Trinant before 1956, but proof of the existence of Trinant RFC can not be substantiated before this date. The club was founded by Albert Clement, who had played rugby in the town in the 1940s, and Ray Morgan, who became secretary. As the club was at this point not affiliated to any union, they had to write to other teams to arrange friendly matches, and out of 75 teams contacted 31 accepted the invitation. The first club to play against the newly formed Trinant RFC was Hafodorynys. Team colours were decided and the club chose black with white hoops. When news that Trinant had reformed began to travel, many local players from rival clubs, requested to move to Trinant. This resulted in a bitter complaint from the secretary of Oakdale when eight of their players switched clubs.  Club badge  The Trinant badge consists of a shield split into quarters.

Shay 2-8-8-8-2 locomotiveThe sole 2-8-8-8-4 triplex locomotive A Triplex locomotive is a steam locomotive that divides the driving force on its wheels by using three pairs of cylinders rigidly mounted to a single locomotive frame. Inevitably any such locomotive will be articulated. All the examples that have been produced have been of the Mallet type but with one extra set of driving wheels under the tender. Triplex classes Baldwin built the only three examples of the type for the Erie Railroad between 1914 and 1916. The first was named Matt H. Shay, after a beloved employee of that road. It could pull 650 freight cars. The Erie Railroad scrapped their Triplexes from 1929, 1931, and 1933.. One 2-8-8-8-4 was also built, for the Virginian Railway, as No. 700, in 1916. This was class XA, so named due to the experimental nature of the locomotive. The 2-8-8-8-4 was unsuccessful because it only made a maximum speed of 3‚Äì5 miles per hour and had high maintenance costs. The XA was sent back to Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1920 to be converted to a 2-8-8-0 and a 2-8-2. These two engines were in service until 1953. Neither of the two engines were preserved. There was also a proposal for a quadruplex super Garratt locomotive with a 2-6-6-2+2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement for South African Railways, but this was never built.Leslie Paxton and David Bourne, Locomotive of the South African Railways, Struik, 1985, pp. 8‚Äì9.  Usage  The purpose of the Triplexes was banking heavy trains over steep inclines, requiring high tractive effort, but low speed, over short distances. The center set of cylinders received high- pressure steam. The exhaust from these was fed to the two other sets of cylinders, which were valved for low pressure. The right cylinder exhausted into the front set of low pressure cylinders, and the left into the rear set; this is also why the high pressure cylinders have the same diameter as the low pressure ones, whereas most mallet locomotives have much smaller high pressure cylinders. The front set exhausted through the smokebox and the rear set exhausted first through a feedwater heater in the tender and then to the open air through a large pipe, which can be seen in the photo. Since only half of the exhaust steam exited through the smokebox, firebox draft (and thus boiler heating) was poor. Although the boiler was large (in line with contemporary two-cylinder and four-cylinder practice), six large cylinders demanded more steam than even such a boiler could supply. With all six cylinders operating at their full pressure (which could not be sustained for very long), the Triplexes produced huge amounts of tractive effort (TE) that may have been the highest of any steam locomotives before or since. (Westing gives a figure of in compound mode and seems to indicate that it was the largest TE for any locomotive up to the time [1914‚Äì1916].) The Triplexes could also be considered the largest tank engines ever built since the tender had driving wheels as well and thus contributed to traction. The problem of variable adhesion on the tender unit was not a serious one, since pusher locomotives had frequent opportunities to take on additional fuel and water. In total, only four Triplexes came into existence and only in the United States; all of the Erie triplexes were retired by 1930; none were preserved. The Virginian XA #700 2-8-8-8-4 was unsuccessful. It was returned to Baldwin where it was rebuilt into a 2-8-8-0 and a 2-8-2. A two wheel trailing truck was added later, making it into a 2-8-8-2. These two locomotives were operated until 1953.  Expanding the concept  Quadruplex = In June 1914, George R. Henderson was granted US Patent 1,100,563 for a quadruplex 2-8-8-8-8-2 locomotive, which was assigned to the Baldwin Locomotive Company. Baldwin submitted a design for a 2-8-8-8-8-2 quadruplex to the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway.Solomon, Brian, 2015. The Majesty of Big Steam. Voyageur Press. Drury, George H. (1993). Guide to North American Steam Locomotives. Waukesha, Wisconsin: Kalmbach Publishing Company. The proposed quadruplex was essentially a cross between the cab-forward locomotives for the Southern Pacific and the Triplexes built for the Erie and Virginian, with a cab at the front for the driver and the rear cab for the fireman. It was a compound locomotive - the front boiler fed the front set of high-pressure cylinders, and their exhaust fed the next set back of low-pressure cylinders. Similarly, the rear boiler fed the rear set of high-pressure cylinders, and their exhaust fed the next set forward of low-pressure cylinders. The exhaust from both sets of low-pressure cylinders was vented to the atmosphere. = Quintuplex = The Baldwin Locomotive Works submitted a design for a 2-8-8-8-8-8-2 quintuplex to the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. The proposed quintuplex was essentially a cross between the cab-forward locomotives for the Southern Pacific and the Triplexes built for the Erie and Virginian, with a cab at the front for the driver and the rear cab for the fireman. Baldwin may have also developed a design for a 2-10-10-10-10-10-2 quintuplex locomotive; a drawing of this proposal appeared in Trains magazine. It was shown to be the largest and most powerful steam locomotive in the world.Solomon, Brian, 2015. The Majesty of Big Steam. Voyageur Press. Drury, George H. (1993).

The main attractions of Safari World are located in Marine Park. Seven shows take place daily at different times, Dolphin show, Spy War show, Orangutan boxing show, Bird Show, Cowboy stunt show, Elephant show and Sea lion show. Other attractions at the Marine Park included Jungle cruise and Safari terrace, where visitors could feed hundreds of giraffes with bananas and leaves. The Marine Park has a walk-thru aviary called Mini world where visitors could feed hundreds of free flying sun conures on their hands. Mini World also has an aviary for Caribbean flamingoes, Wood duck and mandarin duck. Mini world aviary is the star attraction at Marine Park. Another aviary called Hornbill jungle with Great Indian hornbill, Wreathed hornbill, Oriental pied hornbill, Rhinoceros hornbill, Nicobar pigeon, Pied imperial pigeon and White-crowned hornbill is also there. There is another Macaw aviary with huge flocks of scarlet macaw, hyacinth macaw, Red-and-green macaw and Blue-and-yellow macaw. There are enclosures for marsupials like Red kangaroos, Agile wallaby and Bennett's wallaby, as well as for Australian birds like Emu and Southern cassowary. Another exhibit called Tiger kingdom has enclosures for Bengal tiger, White tiger and Siberian tiger. Near the giraffe terrace are exhibits for Ring tailed lemur, Black-and-white ruffed lemur and manatees. Besides mammals there are over 100 aviaries for small birds for avifauna spread throughout the park. Beside the sea lion show theatre is an exhibit for malayan tapir. Other exhibits in the park include capybara, African porcupine, Puma, Leopard, Walrus, Mandrill, common marmoset, pygmy hippopotamus, Red- shanked douc langur, Cape fur seal, Binturong, White handed gibbon, Prairie dog and Linnaeus's two-toed sloth. A very large exhibit housing a very large group of siamese crocodiles is also there with separate exhibits for false gharial and a monster-sized saltwater crocodile.

The treatment of orangutans came to the attention of Jim and Allison Cronin, founders of Monkey World and avid animal rights campaigners and other animal rights groups such as PETA, as well as being featured in a 2013 episode of the British animal rescue show Wildlife SOS.Orangutan Show in Safari World  See also  * Dream World (Thai amusement park) * Siam Park City ReferencesExternal links * * Sister park in Phuket Category:Safari parks Category:Zoos in Thailand Category:Amusement parks in Thailand Category:Buildings and structures in Bangkok Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok Category:Companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand Category:1988 establishments in Thailand Category:Zoos established in 1988 Category:Khlong Sam Wa District ","title":"Safari World"},{"id":"17939794","text":"Selma is an unincorporated community in northwestern Van Buren County, Iowa, United States.

The Inglefield clip (also known as a sister clip and a Brummel hook) is a clip for joining a flag or ensign quickly, easily and securely to flag halyards so that the flag can be hoisted. They are also used for jib sheets on small boats and to connect the speed line in paragliders. Each clip resembles a link of chain, with a split through one side. The edges of this split are chamfered, so that the clips can be engaged or disengaged, but only if they are carefully aligned by hand. When pulled tight, the links are securely fastened. There are no moving parts to the link, although some have additional swivel pieces. They can be made of any durable material; commonly brass, bronze, stainless steel or plastic. The clips come in two basic types: 'standard' with the halyard attached directly to the clip, and 'swivel' which incorporates a rotational connector so that the halyard can rotate without affecting the flag. In the Royal Navy a flag or ensign normally has both types of clip, one at each end of the heading. Some flags have the top clip sewn directly onto the heading rather than a rope running through it. This allows these flags to be flown 'tight-up' against the top of the mast, gaff or yard arm.  History  Lieutenant Edward Fitzmaurice InglefieldLater Rear Admiral Sir Edward Inglefield KBE invented these clips for attaching signalling flags whilst serving in HMS Melita in the early 1890s. The first set of prototype clips was made up in the Malta Dockyard and by 1895 Inglefield clips were standard issue to the British Royal Navy.

As a circular walk it can be walked from any point, but it is common to start and finish at the Weavers' Triangle Visitor Centre in Burnley. It covers a range of terrain from canal towpaths to open moorland. The path is waymarked by a letter \\"B\\" and a bird symbol. It was created in 1993 and updated in May 2008. Route The route is described in a series of six sectional leaflets, updated in 2008, which are available from Burnley Tourist Information Centre. The first section begins at the Manchester Road canal bridge (where the Weavers' Triangle Visitor Centre is located), and follows the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal over the Burnley Embankment to Thompson Park. It then follows the River Brun through Bank Hall Park and past Heasandford House where it joins the route of the Bront√´ Way out of Burnley, almost to Lea Green Reservoir. It then passes the ruined Extwistle Hall and over the River Don to Queen Street Mill Textile Museum in Harle Syke. The second section crosses Todmorden Road, passing a number of farms and over Thursden brook. It then follows the road up the Thursden valley and crosses into West Yorkshire, descending to Widdop Reservoir. Joining the Mary Towneley Loop section of the Pennine Bridleway at the Gorpe track, it moves back into Lancashire and past Hurstwood Reservoir to the Elizabethan hamlet of Hurstwood. The third section rejoins the Mary Towneley Loop, going through some of the new woodland created by the Forest of Burnley project and crosses Sheddon Clough into Cliviger (There was a limestone hushing operation here in the 17th century). It then joins an ancient road called The Long Causeway, and passes Coal Clough Wind Farm before descending into the Cliviger Gorge toward the village of Portsmouth, West Yorkshire. Section four ascends the opposite side of the gorge to Heald Moor, and onto the highest point of the route at Thieveley Pike (). Here part of the path follows a Medieval saltway route that ran from Cheshire via Manchester to Knaresborough and Wetherby. And next to the triangulation station are the remains of what is thought to be an ancient beacon, possibly reusing the site of upland round barrow. The path then steeply descends back into the valley toward Holme Chapel before reconnecting with the Mary Towneley Loop over Easden Clough. At this point walkers are offered a choice between two paths: one passes Dyneley Hall, the home of Lady Mary Towneley (late wife of Sir Simon) in whose honour the local section of the Pennine Bridleway is named, while the other passes a wooded hillock called the Fireman's Helmet. At Walk Mill the route continues on to Barcroft Hall and then to the Towneley Hall museum and park. Section five again climbs the hillside into Habergham Eaves where a choice is offered of crossing or bypassing the golf course at Burnley Golf Club. After crossing Crown Point Road the route descends into Dunnockshaw and Clowbridge Reservoir before summiting Hambledon Hill. As well as the old rifle range on the common at Higher Barley Green, the descent into Hapton passes the Hameldon Hill Wind Farm. This is also the site of Hapton Tower around which, in the late 15th century, Sir John Towneley was given licence to create a deer park of 1,000 Lancashire arces. From Mill Hill Lane it shares the route of the Hyndburn Clog and Huncoat Trail through Castle Clough Wood before crossing the Railway, M65 motorway and the canal near Shuttleworth Hall. The sixth section descends to the River Calder, and enters Padiham through Memorial Park. At Padiham Town Hall it follows the Calder out of the town on the Grove Lane Greenway, with views of Gawthorpe Hall and Burnley FC's training ground. To cross the Calder, the route again joins the Bront√´ Way and at this point connects to the Pendle Way for the Forest of Pendle and Pendle Hill. Passing through Ightenhill, the route again joins the canal towpath to pass over the M65 aqueduct and return to the old cotton mills of the Weavers' triangle.

It is particularly used to describe vascular murmurs or transmitter heart sounds which occur during pregnancy, either from the uterus and breasts of the mother, or from the fetus. Uterine souffle Uterine souffle or placental souffle is a soft, blowing sound heard using a stethoscope, usually in the second trimester of pregnancy (13‚Äì28 weeks). This sound is heard most clearly in the lower part of the uterus and is synchronous with the pulse of the mother. The uterine souffle is produced by the rush of blood through the dilated vessels of the uterus. On auscultation, uterine souffle may often be confused with funic souffle, which is a sharp, whistling sound that is synchronous with the pulse of the foetus. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to confirm uterine souffle. Uterine souffle is considered as a probable objective sign of pregnancy. Funic souffle Funic souffle (also known as funicular or fetal souffle), is a blowing sound heard in synch with fetal heart sounds, and may originate from the umbilical cord. It has also been described as a sharp, whistling sound that is synchronous with the pulse of the foetus, usually heard during the second trimester of pregnancy (13‚Äì28 weeks). It is heard because of the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries of the foetus, and is therefore synchronous with the foetal pulse. The funic souffle is not heard consistently. On auscultation, funic souffle may often be confused with uterine souffle, which is a soft, blowing sound synchronous with the maternal pulse. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to differentiate uterine souffle from funic souffle.

Biography According to legend, Hripsime was possibly of noble birth. She belonged to a community of virgins in Rome, numbering 35 under the leadership of Gayane. She was known to be extremely beautiful, and attracted the notice of Diocletian. To avoid his advances she, along with her community, fled the city, going first to Alexandria before settling in Vagharshapat. The varying accounts of her martyrdom diverge at this point. One story indicates that Hripsime again was noticed for her beauty, this time by King Tiridates III, who proceeded to pursue her. Upon being brought before him, she refused his advances and was punished by being roasted alive. Gayane was then put to death by Tiridates' soldiers, as were all the members of her community except for Nune (or Marine), who was later a missionary in Georgia and, as Saint Nino, is praised as the founder of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Another version of the saint's Acts indicates that, upon discovering Hripsime's whereabouts, Diocletian sent a letter to Tiridates insisting that he either send her back or take her for himself. The king's servants found her among her companions, here described as nuns, and urged that she follow his wishes. She responded that she could not marry as she was betrothed to Jesus Christ, as were the others. At this, a voice from heaven was heard, saying, \\"Be brave and fear not, for I am with you\\". Upon this, Tiridates ordered that Hripsime be tortured; her tongue was cut out, her stomach cut open, and she was blinded before being killed. Her body was then cut into pieces. Inspired by her example, Gayane and two other nuns gave themselves over to similar treatment before being beheaded. The rest of the community was put to the sword, their bodies thrown to the beasts to be eaten. Supposedly, Tiridates and his soldiers were then punished by God for their actions; the soldiers were beset by devils, and began to act like wild animals, running through the forests, gnawing at themselves, and tearing their clothes. The legend states that the King was turned into a wild boar for his actions, and had to be saved by the intervention of Gregory the Illuminator. These accounts are likely highly fictionalized; about the only thing certain about Hripsime's story is that she and her companions were, in fact, martyred in Armenia in about 290. St. Hripsime Church, Echmiadzin Tombstone of Saint Hripsime St. Hripsime Church in Echmiadzin is dedicated to Hripsime; the current structure was consecrated in 618, and contains her tomb in the catacombs beneath the building. According to legend, Christ designated the spot for the shrine by descending from heaven in a shaft of light and smiting the ground with a golden hammer until the earth shook. Some of the saint's relics, along with items relating to Tiridates and Gregory the Illuminator, were pillaged by Persians during an invasion in 1604, but were restored in 1638. Feast In the Catholic tradition, Hripsime and her companions are commemorated with a feast day of September 29; the Orthodox Church in America commemorates them on September 30. The Armenian Apostolic Church remembers Hripsime and her companions on June 4; Gayane and her companions are commemorated separately, on June 5.Church Calendar Veneration in Ethiopia Saint Hripsime is known as \\"Arsema\\" (·ä†·à≠·à¥·àõ) to Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. Currently there are three well known churches and monasteries named after her in Ethiopia. Among the churches, the oldest one is found in one of the Lake Tana islands and is known for its miracles. There are many old icons in the church portraying how she was martyred by Tiridates III ( Dirtadis in Ethiopian languages) and how the cruel king was changed into a beast after killing her. There is annual pilgrimage by Ethiopian Christians to this church in January. There are also Christian songs praising her faith and martyrdom. The book entitled Gedle Arsema meaning \\"The Life of Arsema\\" is found almost in every spiritual bookshop throughout Ethiopia. Her story is told in the Ethiopian Synaxarium on M√§sk√§r√§m 29 (which equates to September 26 or 27 on the Julian Calendar, and October 9 or 10 on the Gregorian Calendar) which coincides with the date of the saint's martyrdom.Budge, E. A. Wallis.

Foppe of thumb \\"Camunian rose\\" as thumb The Camunian rose (or in Italian Rosa camuna) is the name given to a particular symbol represented among the rock carvings of Val Camonica (Brescia, Italy). It consists of a meandering closed line that winds around nine cup marks. It is engraved in the form symmetrical, asymmetrical or swastika. Meaning and variations There are many theories about its meaning, Emmanuel Anati suggests that it might symbolize a complex religious concept, perhaps a solar symbol linked to the astral movement. In Val Camonica this motif dates back to the Iron Age, particularly from the 7th to 1st centuries BC. There is only one doubtful case datable at the Final Bronze Age (1,100 BC). These figures are placed mainly in the Middle Camonica Valley (Capo di Ponte, Foppe of Nadro, Sellero, Ceto and Paspardo), but numerous cases are in the Low Valley too (Darfo Boario Terme and Esine). Camunian rose in the swastika shape on the rock 57 of Vite, Paspardo The motif has been deeply studied by Paola Farina, who created a corpus of all the \\"camunian roses\\" known in Val Camonica: she counted 84 \\"roses\\" engraved on 27 rocks. Three basic types have been determined:Farina, Paola (1997). The motif of the ‚ÄúCamunnian Rose‚Äù in the Rock Art of Valcamonica (Italy)*, TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin 7, May 1997 # swastika type: the 9 cup-marks make a 5 by 5 cross; the contour forms four arms that bend about 90¬∞ and every arm includes one of the top cup-marks of the cross. There are 16 ‚Äúroses‚Äù of this type; # asymmetric-swastika type: the disposition of the 9 cup-marks is the same as the previous; but the contour is different, because only two arms bend 90¬∞, while the other ones join together in a single bilobate arm. There are 12 ‚Äúroses‚Äù of this type; # quadrilobate type: the 9 cup-marks are aligned in three columns of three cups; the contour develops into four orthogonal and symmetric arms, and everyone includes a cup- mark. It is the more widespread type of ‚Äúcamunian rose‚Äù, there are 56 examples. Regarding the interpretation, not easy for a symbol pertaining to a lost and past culture, Paola Farina suggests that the \\"Camunian rose\\" had originally a solar meaning, which then developed into a wider meaning of a positive power, to bring life and good luck.Farina, Paola (1998). The motif of the ‚ÄúCamunnian Rose‚Äù in the Rock Art of Valcamonica (Italy)**, TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin 10, May 1998 The symbol is called in Italian \\"rosa camuna\\" (camunian rose) because it looks like a flower, but this name is a modern invention. A stylized \\"camunian rose\\" has become the symbol of the Lombardy Region.

Life Mohsen Fayz Kashani was born in Kashan to a scholarly family renowned for its learning, Fayz started his education his father, Shah Morteza. His father owned a rich library which benefited Fayz. When he reached the age of twenty, he travelled to Isfahan for further study. However, after a year in Isfahan, he moved to Shiraz to study Hadith and Fiq (Jurisprudence) under Majid Bahrani, one of the leading Shi'ite scholars of his time. Bahrani died a few months later, and Fayz returned to Isfahan where he joined the circles of great scholar Shaikh Bahai and studied philosophy under Mir Damad. After performing the hajj, he stayed a short time before returning to Persia. Upon his return he found a new master, Qom Molla Sadra who taught him in different disciplines. Sadra taught him for eight years, studying ascetic exercises and learning all of the sciences. Sadra gave Fayz one of his daughters to marry, they later had a son named, Muhammad Alam al-Huda, who followed in his fathers footsteps. Fayz is said to have produced works that mixed Islamic scriptual moral concerns with Aristotelian, Platonic schemas and illunminationist mysticism- a rationalist gnostic approach.(Rizvi) Some of his works brought him bad attention, he was criticized by Unlama for not using the Idjma in questioning jurisprudence, such as the legitimacy of music and the definition of impurity. One of Fayz students later blames him for encouraging his students to listen to music.(Chittick)Fayz taught at the Molla'√Åbd-Allah madrasa and led Friday prayer in Isfahan. After an unknown period of time Fayz returned to Kasan where he later died in the year 1680. Before his death, an earthquake struck the city of Sherwan in Iran. During the same year, the town of Mashad was also victim to an earthquake of high intensity. The rule at the time had happened to be traveling through Kashan and became greatly worried over the loss of life and infrastructure that had occurred. He soon began to seek answers from among those who were claimed to be the wisest in the city. Eventually he came across Mohsen Fayz Kashani and asked for an answer. Kashani is reported to have said, \\"There is a spate of earthquakes because of you. You may not know, but it is proven through the traditions of the Infallibles that frequent earthquakes will come when bribery is practiced in the courts of law.\\"Hassan, Moulana S. \\"Mohammed Mohsin Faiz Kashani.\\" Islamic-laws. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Aug. 2013. Works He was a prolific writer in both Persian and Arabic, with a bibliography of more than a hundred and twenty titles. One of his famous work is Mohjat-al-Beyza which is entirely rewritten of the Ihya' ulum al-din (Revival of Religious Sciences), the great work by al-Ghazali, from the Shia point of view. Another of his great works, 'Ayn al-yaqin, The Certitude of the Eye-witness, is a personal synthesis which complements his great commentary on the Quran.Corbin (1993), p.344 His other works include Abwab-ol-Jenan (the doors of the Paradise), the comment of Safi, the comment of Asfi, Wafi (on exposition of Usul Kafi), Shafi, (the thing which cures), Mafati'h al-Sharayi (The Keys of Islamic Law), Asrar-o-ssalat (the secrets of the prayers), Elm-ol yaghin (certain knowledge) on the principles of the religion, Kalim√°t al-Makn√∫nah (Hidden Words) The exposition on astronomy, Safina-to-nejat (the ship of relief), the exposition on the Al-Sahifa al- Sajjadiyya, Tarjomat-ol salat (the translation of prayer) (in Persian), The translation of Taharat (the purification mentally and physically), Translations of the ideas, The \\"list of the sciences\\" and Divan of poems. There are some 13000 lines of poems in his works. He was one of the first to present the revolutionary idea that Islamic prayer does not necessarily have to be in Arabic. A thorough bibliographic study has shown that Fayz wrote 122 works for a total on over 550,000 lines; of these, about forty have been published. He wrote some 20,000 verses of Persian poetry, mostly in Sufi style, and thirty Persian prose works. PhilosophyArchetypal Images= One of Fayz Kashani's most well known contributions to Islamic philosophy is his discourse on the archetypal images. Borrowing heavily from Platonic ideas of universals and particulars, Fayz seeks to articulate the relationship between the spiritual and material worlds and how their interaction fulfills divine will. From the beginning of creation, God entrusted Spirits to govern matter. However, because both spiritual and material substances possess distinct and separable essences, the power of the spiritual world alone is insufficient to establish a connection between the spiritual and the material. There must be an intermediary world which allows this interaction to take place. The archetypal world is a spiritual universe and yet also maintains characteristics of the material world. It is capable of manifesting itself in space and time and so can be perceived by the senses. At the same, it is formed from pure light beyond which the eyes can interpret, and so it transcends space and time as well. In this sense, the archetypal world is neither completely material or spiritual. It merely functions as a realm of existence by which the spiritual and the divine can interact with one another. Having established the need for the existence of the archetypal world, Kashani expands upon the manner in which the spiritual and the material worlds come to interact with another. It is through the material world and the properties which define it that allow the spiritual world to manifest itself within it and become corporeal. This new corporal reality should not be construed to mean a change of essence. The archetypal world merely allows the spiritual to be embodied and symbolized in the material. As Fayz points out, when Gabriel appeared before Maryam, his spiritual substance was \\"typified\\" when he took on a body. The perfection of the spiritual substance was maintained but was also symbolized by his material form and rendered him visible before Maryam. However, just as spirits are corporealized in this intermediary world, so too does the body become spiritualized. Because material and spiritual properties are all connected by archetypes, the material substance itself becomes reflected in the spiritual substance. This allows the perfect soul to transfer itself from its physical form into its spiritual form upon death. In sum, the beings in world of archetypal images are particular forms that are separate from matter, but these forms still are intimately connected to matter.Dabashi, Hamid, and Seyyed V. Nasr. \\"Mulla Muhsin Fayd Kashani.\\" Shi'ism: Doctrines, Thoughts, and Spirituality. Ed. Seyyed H. Nasr. Albany: State University of New York, 1988. 307-08. Print. =Gnosis= In his work KalimƒÅt-i Makn≈´nah, Fayz provides a theoretical understanding of knowledge and its impact on the relationship between the individual and his apprehension of divine mystery. His first claim is that the individual's pursuit of truth is an impossible task because the truth encompasses all things. Everything is its manifestation but those whom he calls the \\"elite\\" are capable of discerning it from everything that it embodies. Being is a kind of light. Since darkness is not a thing in itself but merely the absence of light, all knowledge of being depends upon the individual's ability to perceive different degrees of light. God represents the highest degree of light and so represents the highest degree of being. God's light is so bright that a veil is placed over all things which seek Him. Since the source of spiritual knowledge is God, this veil acts as a barrier to the individual who wishes by his own power to apprehend divine knowledge. But humans have being as well and so possess a smaller degree of this light and the spiritual knowledge that comes with it. Fayz concludes that God is Being and subsists in Himself while everything else subsists in it and is a reflection of Him. Fayz later expands on this relationship in his discussion of divine attributes. The divine attributes are identical with the divine substance and yet they remain distinct from it. Each being subsists by its relationship to one of these divine attributes or names. The divine names can be understood in two ways: In the first way, they are hidden but are mirrors which reflect the truth and manifest the truth into the world. In the second way, they are apparent and the truth mirrors them but in the process the truth becomes hidden. Fayz argues that the perfect gnostic is one who contemplates both of these mirrors. He sees the material world as a mirrored reflection of divine truth while also his own essence as being a mirrored reflection of the material world and the divine. The self cannot by his own power apprehend divine truth. Indeed, the self is ultimately the barrier to obtaining it. Thus, viewing one's essence as a mirror of the material world and the divine eliminates the essence of the self and grants the person this knowledge.\\"Sadr Al-Din Shirazi.\\" History of Muslim Philosophy. Ed. M. M. Sharif. Lahore, Pakistan: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1961. 964-60. History of Muslim Philosophy. Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore Pakistan, Aug. 2007. Web. 13 Apr. 2013. =Ethics= Kashani insists upon the importance of Mur√¢btatah, or vigilance, as a kind of relationship that one may develop with his own soul. The virtue of vigilance can be divided into five stages. Preconditioning Borrowing from the works of al Ghazzali, Fayz likens the relationship between man and the soul to a business venture between two partners. Man and the soul are the partners while life is the capital that is used for investment. In this case, man spends his life refining and purifying the soul in order to reap the eternal benefits from doing so. Like a contract, conditions must be set forth and agreed upon by both partners before investment can take place. Thus, conditions must be placed on the soul by man in order to begin the process of its purification. Self-Supervision Self-supervision is defined by Kashani as a concentrated effort to discover if the conditions set forth are in accordance with the will of God. This stage of vigilance is characterized by a change in the heart that prompts a person to gain satisfaction when occupied with thoughts of heeding divine instruction. Ultimately, the result of achieving this state is a type of knowledge which produces a greater awareness of God as He who observes the action of His servants. Self-Accounting Kashani describes this stage as a state in which the person reviews his actions and strives to know if the conditions set forth for the soul are being met. It involves any kind of consideration of the frequency and order of actions performed and the positive and negative results which follow from them. It is in this stage that a person begins to understand the importance of repentance. Only when a person accounts for the negative consequences of his actions can he begin to repent. Conversely, only when a person accounts for the positive consequences of his actions can he gain satisfaction and joy. Self-Punishment Kashani characterizes this stage as a dedication to keep the soul from further disobedience. It is a means of preventing the soul from obtaining the pleasure it would have possessed if man had not sinned. In order to make sure that the soul does not sin again, the individual must be willing to accept the consequences of their sinful actions. Acts of penance are meant to inflict pain on the soul so that the requirements of divined justice are fulfilled. At the same time, this self-caused pain begins the slow process of purifying the soul of the effects caused by sin. Self-Fighting According to Kashani, there is a tendency of man to avoid the responsibility associated with investing in the soul. Man does not like forcing himself to perform good actions. He desires to do what his will is habitually inclined to do. To keep himself from becoming lazy in his dedication toward refining the soul, the individual must constantly urge himself to do difficult acts of worship and duty so as to compensate for his laziness. Over time, this constant urging will produce in the person a habit that lessens the struggle to always perform good actions.Saghaye-Biria, M. N. \\"Al-Fayd Al-Kashani's Self-supervision and Self-accounting.\\" Thesis. McGill University, 1997. Al- Fayz Al-Kashani's Self-supervision and Self-accounting. National Library of Canada. Web. 13 Apr. 2013. TheologyThe Perfect Man= According to Kashani, the Perfect Man is one who has manifested within himself one of the divine attributes and has overcome the barrier between the Absolute and the mundane. Further, the Perfect Man is the focal point of mediation and connection by which the unknowable aspects of the Absolute come down into the realm of knowable existence. The attributes of God enter into and become one with man while retaining their essence. At the same time, essential relations are established between man and himself which allow him to participate with the divine but remain distinct from it. While the Perfect man remains alive in this world, he draws upon and continually preserves the self- manifestations of the divine. Because the Perfect man exists as a unity between the material and the divine, the reflection of the divine attributes within him permit change in the material world that he is a part of. More crucial for Fayz is establishing how this connected state of being in the Perfect Man connects to the practice of the Imam. God and his attributes are eternal. By manifesting his attributes into man, God is connecting creation with the divine. Since the Perfect Man manifests the connection of creation to God, the dependency of creation upon God for its existence is also connected to the Perfect Man. In this sense, The world would cease to be without the existence of the Perfect Man. The Imam represents the Perfect Man who functions as an intermediary. Therefore, the Imam is essential for the continuation of the world.Takim, Liyakat. \\"The Concepts of the Absolute and Perfect Man in Mulla Fayd Al-Kashani.\\" Liyakat Takim. University of Denver, Colorado, Aug. 2008. Web. 13 Apr. 2013. =Four Major Groups of Muslims= According to Fayz, those that comprise the Muslim community are divided into four groups: the philosophers, the mystics, the theologians, and the deviates. Although none of these groups fall within the category of infidel, each in some manner has gone astray in their respective pursuits. Philosophers engage in the search for truth, but their approach is so based in rationalism that it fails to fully comprehend the truth. Their tendency to invoke a priori proofs ignores the importance of tradition and scripture in the effort to gain spiritual knowledge. Mystics and theologians claim to be acting from within the school or tradition they are a part of, but often fall into the trap of pure speculation. Any kind of theological speculation and mystical speculation which is not traceable to the Qur'an and the Hadith is to be immediately discarded.Leaman, Oliver. \\"The School of Isfahan.\\" History of Islamic Philosophy Part I.

It is surrounded by the states of West Bengal to the north- east, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west and north-west, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to the south and south-west. Odia (formerly known as Oriya) is the official and most widely spoken language, spoken by 33.2 million according to the 2001 Census. The modern state of Odisha was established on 1 April 1936, as a province in British India, and consisted predominantly of Odia-speaking regions. April 1 is celebrated as Odisha Day. Visual arts Other cultural attractions include the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, known for its annual Rath Yatra or Chariot, tala Chitra (palm leaf engravings), famous stone utensils of Nilgiri (Balasore) and various tribal influenced cultures. The Sun Temple at Konark is famous for its architectural splendour while the Sambalpuri textiles equals it in its artistic grandeur. =Sand art= Sand sculpture is practised on the beaches of Puri. : Religion Gita Govinda manuscript In its long history, Odisha has had a continuous tradition of dharmic religions especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Ashoka's conquest of Kalinga (India) made Buddhism a principal religion in the state which led to the establishment of numerous Stupas and Buddhist learning centres. During Kharavela's reign Jainism found prominence. However, by the middle of the 9th century CE there was a revival of Hinduism as attested by numerous temples such as Mukteshwara, Lingaraja, Jagannath and Konark, which were erected starting from the late 7th century CE. Part of the revival in Hinduism was due to Adi Shankaracharya who proclaimed Puri to be one of the four holiest places or Char Dham for Hinduism. Odisha has, therefore, a syncretic mixture of the three dharmic religions as attested by the fact that the Jagannath Temple in Puri is considered to be holy by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Presently, the majority of people in the state of Odisha are Hindus. As per the census of 2001, Odisha is the third largest Hindu populated state (as a percentage of population) in the country as illustrated in the 2001 census table and in this table. However, while Odisha is predominantly Hindu it is not monolithic. There is a rich cultural heritage in the state owing to the Hindu faith. For example, Odisha is home to several Hindu saints. Sant Bhima Bhoi was a leader of the Mahima sect movement, Sarala Dasa, was the translator of the epic Mahabharata in Odia, Chaitanya Dasa was a Buddhistic-Vaishnava and writer of the Nirguna Mahatmya, Jayadeva was the author of the Gita Govinda and is recognized by the Sikhs as one of their most important bhagats. Swami Laxmananda Saraswati is a modern-day Hindu saint of Adivasi heritage. Odisha has Christian and Muslim minorities. There are around 898,000 Christians in Odisha (2.44% of the population). Literature The history of Odia literature has been mapped by historians along the following stages, Old Odia (900‚Äì1300 CE), Early Middle Odia (1300‚Äì1500 CE), Middle Odia (1500‚Äì1700 CE), Late Middle Odia (1700‚Äì1850 CE) and Modern Odia (from 1850 CE till the present). But this crude categorization could not skillfully draw the real picture on account of development and growth of Odia literature. Here, we split the total periods into different stages such as Age of Charya Literature, Age of Sarala Das, Age of Panchasakha, Age of Upendra Bhanja, Age of Radhanath, Age of Satyabadi, Age of Marxism or Pragati yuga, Age of Romanticism or Sabuja Yuga, Post Independent Age. The beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of Charya Sahitya, the literature thus started by Mahayana Buddhist poets.Mukherjee, Prabhat. The History of medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa. Chapter: The Sidhacharyas in Orissa Page:55. This literature was written in a specific metaphor named \\"Sandhya Bhasha\\" and the poets like Luipa, Kanhupa are from the territory of Odisha. The language of Charya was considered as Prakriti. The first great poet of Odisha is the famous Sarala Das who wrote the Mahabharata, not an exact translation from the Sanskrit original, but a full-blown independent work. Sarala Mahabharat has 152,000 verses compared to 100,000 in the Sanskrit version. Among many of his poems and epics, he is best remembered for his Sarala Mahabharata. Chandi Purana and the Vilanka Ramayana are also two of his famous creations. Arjuna Das, a contemporary to Sarala Das, wrote Rama-Bibha, a significant long poem in Odia. Towards the 16th century, five poets emerged, though there is hundreds year gap in between them. But they are known as Panchashakhas as they believed in the same school of thought, Utkaliya Vaishnavism. The poets are Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Achyutananada Dasa, Ananta Dasa and Jasobanta Das. The Panchasakhas are very much Vaishnavas by thought. In 1509, Chaitanya, an Odia devotee of Vishnu whose grandfather Madhukar Mishra had emigrated to Bengal, came to Odisha with his Vaishnava message of love. Before him Jayadeva, one of the foremost composers in Sanskrit, had prepared the ground by heralding the cult of Vaishnavism through his Gita Govinda. Chaitanya's path of devotion was known as Raganuga Bhakti Marga, but the Panchasakhas differed from Chaitanya's and believed in Gyana Mishra Bhakti Marga, which has similarities with the Buddhist philosophy of Charya Literature stated above. At the end of the age of Panchasakha, the prominent poets are Dinakrushna Das, Upendra Bhanja and Abhimanyu Samanta Simha. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism as the characteristics of Shringara Kavyas, became the trend of this period to which Upendra Bhanja took a leading role. His creations were Baidehisha Bilasa, Koti Brahmanda Sundari, Lavanyabati were proved a landmark in Odia literature. Upendra Bhanja was conferred with the title Kabi Samrat of Odia literature for the aesthetic poetic sense and verbal jugglery proficiency. Dinakrushna Das's Rasokallola and Abhimanyu Samanta Simhara's Bidagdha Chintamani are prominent kavya of this time. The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which heralded a great revolution in Odia literature, instead of palm leaf inscription. The books were being printed and the periodicals and journals were published. The first Odia Magazine of Bodha Dayini was published from Balasore in 1861. The main object of this magazine was to promote Odia literature and to draw attention to the lapses in government policy. The first Odia paper, The Utkal Deepika made its appearance in 1866 under the editorship of late Gouri Sankar Ray with the help of late Bichitrananda. The publication of these papers during the last part of the 19th century encouraged the modern literature and acted as a media to provide a wide readers range for the writers, The educated intellectuals came in contact with the English Literature and got influenced. Radhanath Ray (1849‚Äì1908) is the prime figure, who tried to write his poems with the influence of Western Literature. He wrote Chandrabhaga, Nandikeshwari, Usha, Mahajatra, Darbar and Chilika was the long poems or Kavyas. Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843‚Äì1918), the prime figure of modern Odia Fiction Prose is the product of that generation. He was considered the Vyasakabi or founder poet of Odia language. Fakir Mohan Senapati is well known for his novel Chha Maana Atha Guntha. It is the first Indian novel to deal with the exploitations of landless peasants by the Feudal Lords. It was written much before the October revolution of Russia or much before the emerging of Marxist ideas in India. With the rise of a freedom movement, a literary thought emerged with the influence of Gandhiji, and idealistic trend of Nationalism formed as a new trend in Odia literature. Much respected personality of Odishan culture and history, Utkalmani Gopabandhu Dash (1877‚Äì1928) had founded a school at a village Satyabadi near Sakshigopal of Odisha and an idealistic literary movement influenced the writers of this age. Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kuntala-Kumari Sabat is the other renowned names of this age. The progressive movement in Odia literature was initiated with the formation of the Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad in 1935. The main proponents of Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad were Ananta Patnaik and Bhagabati Panigrahi, while they were students at Ravenshaw College. Thereafter many others joined in. The mouthpiece of Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad was Adhunika. Bhagabati Panigrahi was the editor and Ananta Patnaik was the managing editor of Adhunika. Ananta Patnaik was mainly a poet though he has written many short stories as well as dramas. Bhagabati Panigrahi was mainly a short story writer. Influenced by the romantic thoughts of Rabindranath Tagore, during the thirties when the progressive Marxian movements were in full flow in Odia literature, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, the brother of Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi, the founder of Marxian Trend in Odisha, formed a group during 1920 called Sabuja Samiti. Mayadhar Mansingh was a renowned poet of that time though he was considered as a romantic poet, he kept the distance away from the influence of Rabindranath Tagore successfully. As the successor of Sachi babu, two poets Guruprasad Mohanty (popularly known as Guru Prasad) (1924‚Äì2004) and Bhanuji Rao came with T. S. Eliot and published their co-authored poetry book Nutan Kabita. Later, Ramakanta Rath modified the ideas. Sitakanta Mohapatra, Soubhagya Kumar Mishra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Brajanath Rath, Jayanta Mahapatra, Kamalakant Lenka, J. P. Das, Brahmotri Mohanty, Mamata Dash, Amaresh Patnaik, Hrushikesh Mallick, Sunil Kumar Prusty, Sucheta Mishra, Aparna Mohanty, Pritidhara Samal, Basudev Sunni, Gajanan Mishra, Bharat Majhi are some poets of this contemporary age. In the Post-Independence era Odia fiction assumed a new direction. The trend which Fakir Mohan had started actually developed more after the 1950s. Gopinath Mohanty (1914‚Äì1991), Surendra Mohanty and Manoj Das (b. 1934) are considered as three jewels of this time. The other significant fiction writers are Chandrasekhar Rath, Shantanu Acharya, Mohapatra Nilamani Sahoo, Rabi Patnaik, Jagadish Mohanty, Kanheilal Das, Satya Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal, Yashodhara Mishra and Sarojini Sahoo are few writers whose writings have created a new age in the field of fiction. After 1970, the women wing of Odia writers emerged as a prime voice of feminism. Jayanti Ratha, Susmita Bagchi, Paramita Satpathy, Hiranmayee Mishra, Chirashree Indrasingh, Supriya Panda, Gayatri Saraf, Mamata Chowdhry are few fiction writers in this period. But, among all the women writers Sarojini Sahoo played a significant role for her feministic and sexuality approach in fiction. For feminism she is considered as the Simone de Beauvoir of India, though theoretically, she denies the Hegelian theory of \\"Others\\" developed by Simone in her The Second Sex. Unlike to Simone, Sarojini claims the women are \\"Others\\" from masculine perspective but as a human being, she demands similar right as Plato recommended. In the field of drama, the traditional Odia theatre is the folk opera, or Jatra, which flourishes in the rural areas of Odisha. Modern theatre is no longer commercially viable. But in 1960, experimental theatre made a mark through the works of Manoranjan Das, who pioneered the new theatre movement with his brand of experimentalism. Bijay Mishra, Biswajit Das, Kartik Rath, Ramesh Chandra Panigrahi, Ratnakar Chaini, Ranjit Patnaik continued the tradition. Performing arts Desaraja Maudamani Adiguru Singhari Shyamasundar Kar, scion of Jagannatha temple tradition of Odissi music =Music= Odissi music is the traditional classical music of the state of Odisha. Born as a seva in the Jagannatha temple of Puri, it was developed by great composers such as Jayadeva, Upendra Bhanja, Dinakrusna Dasa, Banamali Dasa Kabisurjya Baladeba Ratha, Gopalakrusna Pattanayaka and others. Odissi music has a history of over 2000 years, several native shastras or treatises, unique ragas and talas and a distinctive style of rendition. Being a part of the rich culture of Odisha, its music is also as much charming and colourful. Odissi music is more two thousand five hundred years old and comprises several categories. Of these, the five broad ones are Tribal Music, Folk music, Light Music, Light-Classical Music and Classical Music. Anyone who is trying to understand the culture of Odisha must take into account its music, which essentially forms a part of its legacy. In ancient times, some saint-poets wrote the lyrics of poems and songs that were sung to rouse the religious feelings of people. It was by the eleventh century that the music of Odisha, in the form of Triswari, Chatuhswari, and Panchaswari, underwent a transformation and was converted into the classical style. Folk music like Jogi Gita, Kendara Gita, Dhuduki Badya, Prahallada Nataka, Palla, Sankirtan, Mogal Tamasa, Gitinatya, Kandhei Nacha, Kela Nacha, Ghoda Nacha, Danda Nacha and Daskathia are popular in Odisha. Almost every tribal group has its own distinct song and dance style. =Dance= Odissi dance and music are classical forms. Odissi has a tradition of 2,000 years, and finds mention in the Natyashastra of Bharatamuni, possibly written circa 200 BCE. However, the dance form nearly became extinct during the British period, only to be revived after India's independence by a few proponents, such as Guru Deba Prasad Das, Guru Pankaj Charan Das, Guru Raghunath Dutta and Kelucharan Mohapatra. Odissi classical dance is about the divine love of Krishna and his consort Radha, mostly drawn from compositions by the notable Odia poet Jayadeva, who lived in the 12th century CE. Chhau dance (or Chau dance) is a form of tribal (martial) dance attributed to origins in Mayurbhanj princely state of Odisha and seen in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are three subtypes of the dance, based on the original places where the subtypes were developed. Seraikella Chau was developed in Seraikella, the administrative head of the Seraikela Kharsawan district of Jharkhand, Purulia Chau in Purulia district of West Bengal and Mayurbhanj Chau in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha. Mahari Dance is one of the important dance forms of Odisha. Mahari dance originated in the temples of Odisha. History of Odisha provides evidence of the Devadasi cult in Odisha. Devadasis were dancing girls who were dedicated to the temples of Odisha. The Devadasis in Odisha were known as Maharis and the dance performed by them came to be known as Mahari Dance. It was during the reign of Chodagangadeva, Maharis was employed in the temples of Puri. After Chodagangadeva's death, Ananabhimadeva built Natyamandapa in the Jagannath temple for the dance performances inside the temple. Moreover, in those days, the Mahari dancers belonged to different categories namely, the Nachunis (dancers), the Bahara Gauni, the Bhitara Gauni and the Gaudasanis. The Mahari Dancers of Odisha are supposed to follow certain restrictions, such as: * They should dance on the ceremonies connected to Lord Jagannath. * They should adhere to the specifications made by the Shastras. * They must always wear clean clothes. * The dancer cannot be physically handicapped. * At the time of the performances, the dancers are not supposed to look at the audience. * The Maharis are married to the Lord at the age of nine. * Before their performances, the Mahari dancers pay their obeisance to the Lord. 281x281pxIn Odisha, one can also come across another type of Mahari dancers, who are known as Samarpada Niyoga. The duty of the Samarpada Niyoga is to dance during the ceremonial procession of the deities. These dancers perform during the Ratha Yatra, Jhulana Yatra, Dola Yatra, etc. Western Odisha has also a great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \\"Chhiollai\\", \\"Humobauli\\" and \\"Doligit\\"; the adolescent poems are \\"Sajani\\", \\"Chhata\\", \\"Daika\\", \\"Bhekani\\"; the youth compositions are \\"Rasarkeli\\", \\"Jaiphul\\", \\"Maila Jada\\", \\"Bayamana\\", \\"Gunchikuta\\" and \\"Dalkhai\\"; the workman's poetry comprises \\"Karma\\" and \\"Jhumer\\" about Lord Vishwakarma and the \\"Karamashani\\" Goddess. The professional entertainers perform Dand, Danggada, Mudgada, Ghumra, Sadhana, Sabar‚ÄìSabarein, Disdigo, Machina‚ÄìBajnia, Samparda and Sanchar. They are performed during all occasions with varieties of rhythm and rhyme. Pala is a unique form of balladry in Odisha, which artistically combines elements of theatre, classical Odissi music, highly refined Odia and Sanskrit poetry, wit, and humour. The literal meaning of Pala is turned. It is more sophisticated than the other Odia ballad tradition, Daskathia. Pala can be presented in three different ways. First one is known as Baithaki Pala or 'seated', in which the performers sit on the ground throughout. The other one is Thia Pala or \`standing\`, which is considerably more popular and aesthetically more satisfying. The third one is called the Badi Pala, which is a kind of Thia Pala, in which two groups vie for excellence. This is the most entertaining, as there is an element of competition. Gotipua dance is another form of dance in Odisha. In Odia colloquial language Gotipua means single boy. The dance performance done by a single boy is known as Gotipua dance. When decadence and declination came in to Devadasi or Mahari tradition due to various reasons this Gotipua dance tradition evolved as a sequel as these performances were practised to please God. It is totally unknown that when exactly this danced form came in to practice. Still, some historians say that this dance tradition appears to have originated during the region of Prataprudradev (1497 CE to 1540 CE) and gained popularity in the subsequent Muslim rule. Ray Remananda the famous Vaishnavite Minister of King Pratapruda and ardent follower of Sri Chaitanya is the originator of this boy dancing tradition, as the Vaishnavas were not approving of the females into dance practices so it possible that the dance tradition must have come after Sri Chaitanya came to Odisha. The Gotipua Dance Tradition is now seen in the village Raghurajpur situated 10 km away from Puri town, situated on the banks of river Bhargabi. It is otherwise known as the Crafts Village as various Odishan handicrafts‚Äô craftsmen reside in this village contributing their expertise in Pattachitra painting and other handicrafts. Jhumair is a folk dance from North and Western Odisha. It is performed during harvest season and festivals.289x289px =Odia cinema= The Odia film production in the initial years was very slow. After the first Odia film Sita Bibaha, only two films were produced until 1951. A joint consortium of landlords and businessmen who collected fund after 1948 produced those two movies. The 1951 production Roles to Eight was the first Odia film having an English name. It was released after 15 years of the first Odia film Sita Bibaha. It was the fourth Odia film produced by Ratikanta Padhi. The eleventh Odia film Sri Lokenath was the first Odia film, which got National Award in 1960 directed by Prafulla Sengupta.http://Odishacinema.com/history.html The name of Prashanta Nanda would always come while dealing with Odia Film Industry. He was present in Odia films since 1939, but he became super active only after 1976. Nanda served Odia Film Industry as an actor, director, screenplay writer, and lyricist and even as a playback singer. Such a versatile genius is quite rare in Indian cinema history. Uttam Mohanty, whose debut film Abhiman won accolades, was one of the ruling heroes of the Odia Film Industry. His wife Aparajita Mohanty is a very successful leading lady of Odia films. Odia cuisine Salepur Rasagola.Rasagola, famous throughout India originated from Odisha Odisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous Jagannath Temple in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand chefs, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called chulas, to feed over 10,000 people each day. Rasagolla, one of the most popular desserts in India, is an extension of the cuisine of Odisha and West Bengal. It had been enjoyed in Odisha for centuries and neighbouring Bengal, like the well-known rice pudding, kheeri (kheer), that is relished all over India. In fact, some well- known recipes, usually credited to Bengal, are of Odishan origin. This is because during the Bengal renaissance, Brahmin cooks from Odisha, especially from Puri, were routinely employed in richer Bengali households. They were famed for their culinary skills and commonly referred to as Ude Thakurs (Odia Brahmin-cooks). As a result, many Odia delicacies got incorporated into the Bengali kitchen. Chena Poda is another famous sweet delicacy in Odisha with the origin from Nayagarh District, Odisha. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yoghurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Odias are very fond of sweets and no Odia repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. A typical meal in Odisha consists of a main course and dessert. Typically bread is served as the main course for breakfast, whereas rice is eaten with lentils (dals) during lunch and dinner. The main course also includes one or more curries, vegetables and pickles. Given the fondness for sweet foods, the dessert course may include generous portions of more than a single item. Odia desserts are made from a variety of ingredients, with milk, chhenna (a form of ricotta cheese), coconut, rice, and wheat flour being the most common.  Clothing  Ethnic female and male cloth draping style in Odisha. Traditional sari draping style of Cuttack. The western-style dress has gained greater acceptance in cities and towns among men, although the people prefer to wear traditional dresses like Dhoti, Kurtha and Gamucha during festivals or other religious occasions. Women normally prefer to wear the Sari Sambalpuri Sari, or the Shalwar kameez; western attire is becoming popular among younger women in cities and towns. The Saree of Odisha is much in demand throughout the entire world. The different colours and varieties of sarees in Odisha make them very popular among the women of the state. The handloom sarees available in Odisha can be of four major types; these are Sambalpui Ikat, Sambalpuri Bandha, Sambalpuri Bomkai and Sambalpuri Saptaper. Odisha sarees are also available in other colours like cream, maroon, brown and rust. The tie-and-dye technique used by the weavers of Odisha to create motifs on these sarees is unique to this region. This technique also gives the sarees of Odisha an identity of their own.

It accommodates 137 people. :It has a production capacity of 32,000 tonnes of gas per day. * Cossack Pioneer Floating Production Storage and Off-Loading (FPSO) :The facility was commissioned in late 1995 and produces up to of crude oil which is offloaded via a flexible line to oil tankers moored astern. Located 34 km east of the North Rankin A platform, it is moored to a riser turret which is connected by flexible flowlines to subsea production wells at the Wanaea, Cossack, Lambert and Hermeson gas fields. :It has a storage capacity of of oil and a production capacity of of oil per day. :In May 2008, Woodside announced plans to replace the 13-year-old vessel with a view to extending oil output to 2025-2030. The condensate is transported to the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) onshore facility on the mainland 130 km away by two and undersea pipes. Other assets include: * LNG and condensate loading facilities at Withnell Bay at Karratha including jetties, LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure, and supported by Dampier Port Authority. * Karratha gas plant. In 2008, the facility capacity was increased to 16.3 million tonnes per year with the commissioning of a fifth, 4.4 million tonnes per year LNG production train. As well as processing gas for export, the facility supplies domestic supplies to consumers and businesses in Western Australia. The facility also processes condensate which is extracted from the gaseous hydrocarbons during processing. * A fleet of nine purpose built LNG cargo ships. The ships are powered using gas vapour from the storage tanks on board which is used to run steam turbines. Each of the ships is equipped with four spherical tanks giving a total capacity of 125,000 cubic metres (138,500 cubic metres in the case of the most recently delivered Northwest Swan) and utilise docking facilities at the Karratha gas plant's Withnell Bay terminal. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Shipping Service Company Pty Ltd manages the shipping operations. In March 2008, the partners approved a A$5 billion North Rankin 2 project which will underpin supply commitments to customers in Asia beyond 2013. The project will recover remaining low pressure gas from the ageing North Rankin and Perseus gas fields using compression. It will include the installation of a new platform (North Rankin B) which will stand in about 125 metres of water and will be connected by a 100-metre bridge to the existing North Rankin A platform. Production and sales The first LNG shipments went to Japan in 1989. 200 shipments per year (about one shipment every 1.5 days) in the purpose built LNG carriers totalling more than seven million tons are made around the world. Markets include sales to long term customers in Japan and spot buyers in China, Spain, South Korea and the United States. To date, the venture has produced more than 1000 cargoes of light crude oil (natural gas condensate). Condensate is sold on the international energy market. In 2002, a contract was signed to supply 3 million tonnes of LNG a year from the North West Shelf Venture to China. The contract was worth $25 billion: between $700 million and $1 billion a year for 25 years.smh.com.au, 9 August 2002, Gas boom as China signs $25bn deal by Tom Allard and John GarnautThe Age, 30 September 2017, How Australia blew its future gas supplies by Tony Wright The price was guaranteed not to increase until 2031, and, as international LNG prices were increasing, by 2015 China was paying one-third as were Australian consumers. The venture is Western Australia's largest single producer of domestic gas providing about 65% of total State production. Pipeline gas is processed at the consortium's Karratha facility, and transported to customers in southern Western Australia via the 1530 km Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd markets the domestic gas component to customers in Western Australia through private contracts and sales to AlintaGas.

It is an Iraqi city situated along the south side of Euphrates River near the Syrian border. It is a subdistrict of Al Qa'im and contains both New Ubaydi and Old Ubaydi as well as a number of smaller villages that stretch down the Euphrates to the east. During the Iraq War, the city was patrolled by United States Marines, and was the location of a forward operating base, a US military base, as well as several battle positions. Following Operation Steel Curtain, in which US Marines and Iraqi Army units swept the city of insurgents, the streets were secured by a combination of Iraqi Army and Marine forces. Old Ubaydi is the stronghold of the Al-Bu Mahal tribe, who was the first tribe in the region to openly cooperate with coalition forces and fight the insurgency. New Ubaydi is a modern style city, complete with city planning. It was built to support the workers of the Al Qaim Phosphate plant, which is located to the south west of Ubaydi. The villages to the east that fall under Ubaydi's jurisdiction are made of a mix of tribes including Mahal, Rawi, and Salmani. These villages are mostly made of farmers and fishermen. Ubaydi has a functioning city council and mayor and a fully operational police force. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant captured the city in 2014. The Iraqi Army later recaptured the city in November 2017.

The Culture of Uttar Pradesh is an Indian Culture which has its roots in the Hindi and Urdu literature, music, fine arts, drama and cinema. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, has several beautiful historical monuments such as Bara Imambara and Chhota Imambara. It has also preserved the damaged complex of the Oudh-period British Resident's quarters, which are being restored. Uttar Pradesh attracts large number of visitors, both national and international; with more than 71 million domestic tourists (in 2003) and almost 25% of the All-India foreign tourists visiting Uttar Pradesh, it is one of the top tourist destinations in India. There are two regions in the state where a majority of the tourists go, viz. the Agra circuit and the Hindu pilgrimage circuit. The city of Agra, gives access to three World Heritage Sites: Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri. Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is cited as \\"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\\". Agra Fort is about 2.5 km northwest of its much more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled palatial city. Fatehpur Sikri was the world-famous 16th-century capital city near Agra, built by the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, whose mausoleum in Agra is also worth a visit. Dayal Bagh in Agra is a modern-day temple and popular tourist sight. Its lifelike sculptures in marble are unique in India. Agra's dubious modern attractions include Asia's largest Spa as well as Asia's second 6D theatre. The pilgrimage circuit includes the holiest of the Hindu holy cities on the banks of sacred rivers Ganges and the Yamuna: Varanasi (also considered world's oldest city), Ayodhya (birthplace of Lord Rama), Mathura (birthplace of Lord Krishna), Vrindavan (the village where Lord Krishna spent his childhood), and Allahabad (Prayagraj) (the confluence or 'holy-sangam' of the sacred Ganges-Yamuna rivers). Culture from cities Varanasi is widely considered to be one of the oldest cities in the world. It is famous for its ghats (bathing steps along the river), full of pilgrims year-round who come to bathe in the sacred Ganges River. Mathura is world- famous for its colourful celebrations of the Holi festival, which attracts many tourists also ‚Äì thanks partly to the hype, which the Indian film industry has given to this highly entertaining socio-religious festival. Thousands gather at Allahabad (Prayagraj) to take part in the Magh Mela festival, which is held on the banks of the Ganges. This festival is organised on a larger scale every 12th year and is called the Kumbha Mela, where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate ‚Äì proclaimed as one of the largest gathering of human beings in the world. Badaun is a religiously important city with many historical monuments and tombs of famous people which attracts thousands of tourists annually. The historically important towns of Sarnath and Kushinagar are located not far from Varanasi. Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath after his enlightenment and died at Kushinagar; both are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists. Also at Sarnath are the Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, both important archaeological artefacts with national significance. At a distance of 80 km from Varanasi, Ghazipur is famous not only for its Ganges Ghats but also for the Tomb of British potentate Lord Cornwallis, maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.  Architecture Dance and Music Kathak is a famous dance form, the most important cultural figure and indigenous to Uttar Pradesh. The state is home to a very old tradition in dance and music. During the eras of Guptas and Harsh Vardhan, Uttar Pradesh was a major centre for musical innovation. Swami Haridas was a great saint-musician who championed Hindustani Classical Music. Tansen, the great musician in Mughal Emperor Akbar's court, was a disciple of Swami Haridas. Kathak, a classical dance form, involving gracefully coordinated movements of feet along with entire body, grew and flourished in Uttar Pradesh. Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, was a great patron and a passionate champion of Kathak. Today, the state is home to two prominent schools of this dance form, namely, Lucknow Gharana and Banaras Gharana. Well- known music personalities such as Naushad Ali, Talat Mehmood, Begum Akhtar, Anup Jalota, Shubha Mudgal, Bismillah Khan, Ravi Shankar, Kishan Maharaj, Vikash Maharaj, Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Gopal Shankar Misra, Siddheshwari Devi, Girija Devi and Sir Cliff Richard were originally from Uttar Pradesh. The region's folk heritage includes songs called rasiya (known and especially popular in Braj), which celebrate the divine love of Radha and Krishna. These songs are accompanied by large drums known as bumb and are performed at many festivals. Other folk dances or folk theater forms include Raslila, Swang, Ramlila (a dramatic enactment of the entire Ramayana), Nautanki, Naqal (mimicry) and Qawwali. The Bhatkhande Music Institute is situated in Lucknow.  Languages  The common state-language of Uttar Pradesh is standard Hindi. While standard Hindi (Khari boli) is the official language, several important regional Hindi 'dialects' are spoken in the state and among these are: Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bagheli and Bundeli, besides several local dialects that do not have a formal name. Urdu is prominent in Uttar Pradesh as Lucknow was once the centre of Indo-Persianate culture in north India. The language of Lucknow (\\"Lakhnavi Urdu\\") is a form of high literary Urdu. Dr. Parichay Das is path- breaker poet, essayist, creative critic and singer-actor in Bhojpuri-Hindi- Maithili. He was born in Mau nath Bhanjan district 's Rampur Devlaas village.

It was designed by architect Alexander Rice Esty. A transept chapel designed by the firm Sturgis and Cabot was dedicated in 1893 to the memory of Sarah Appleton Lawrence (wife of Amos A. Lawrence). A parish hall designed by the firm of Cabot and Chandler was completed in 1880 and enlarged in 1922. A rectory, designed by architect Arthur Rotch of the firm Rotch and Tilden, was the gift of Sarah Appleton Lawrence and was dedicated in 1886. The parish has a long and distinguished history of church music. Composer Gardner Evans served as organist and choir director from 1923 until his death in 1951.

The museum is an important project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Knowledge Innovation Program, and a joint project of the academy and Yunnan Provincial Government. The Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology presents the diversity of fauna, past and present, of Southwest China. It started earth construction in 2000 and opened to the public since November 2006. Various specimens collected by several generations of scientists in Kunming Institute of Zoology are fundamental basis for the establishment of the museum. A trio of dino-skeletons dominate the prehistoric exhibit on the first floor. These plant-eaters stomped around Yunnan about 200 million years ago. Though the biggest of the three is a cast, the smaller ones are genuine bones, exhumed from Yunnan's Lufeng Basin in the 1980s. Though the prehistoric exhibit is the most impressive, there are plenty of animals to be seen on all of the museum's three floors. An array of taxidermied mammals and birds lines the display cases of the second floor. Up another flight of stairs reveals a \\"Rainforest Adventure,\\" which walks visitors along a path through synthetic trees, bird calls and a darkened cave. There are rigid fish and snakes entombed in formaldehyde jars. Because of the museum's affiliation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is well positioned as both a tourist attraction and a home to future zoological scholarship.

The name is first found on the northernmost runestone in Europe, the Fr√∂s√∂ Runestone, as eotalont (in normalized Old Norse: Jamtaland). The prefix Jamta is a genitive plural case of Jamts, a Germanic tribe. The root of Jamt (Old West Norse: jamti), and thus J√§mtland, derives from the Proto-Germanic word stem emat- meaning persistent, efficient, enduring and hardworking. So J√§mtland basically mean \\"Jamts' land\\" or \\"land of hardworking people\\". A folk explanation is that the name ought to have something to do with the even parts around the lake Storsj√∂n. This theory is based on the similarity between the Swedish words j√§mt (from emat-) and j√§mnt (from Germanic *ebna, \\"even\\") The form J√§mtland is Swedish, which previously (pre 20th century) was spelled Jemtland, as it still is in e.g. Danish, whilst the local name of the province is Jamtland ( ). There have been several Latinized forms of the name, such as Jemtia, Iempihia and Iemthalandia. Origin How and when the Jamts got their name is unknown, though one possible explanation is presented in the Icelandic work Heimskringla from the 13th century. Development Detail from Carta Marina, J√§mtland is Latinized as Iempihia In older sources the province's name can be found in forms such as JamptalandDiplomatarium Norvegicum (volumes I-XXI) Pedher Karlson fogode offwer Jamptaland ok Sparbo and JamptalandeDiplomatarium Norvegicum (volumes I-XXI) Sigurdr Jonsson Loghmadr J √ûrandheimi, oc Halluardr Karleson Loghmadr J Jamptalande with a p. Later a sound change occurred in East Scandinavian from a into e, the so-called i-mutation. This led to new forms such as Jempteland.Diplomatarium Norvegicum (volumes I-XXI) ...twghwndrede rynskgylden och femty√¶ tymmer hermelynn for affgyfft aff Tronndelagenn Nommedalenn Gouldalen och Jempteland The sound change eventually spread northwards although it never made itself apparent in the province's own dialects where the a was preserved. The genitive case (now both a and e, depending on the area) was ultimately dropped everywhere, leading to a reduction of the three consonant mpt. In Swedish and Danish the p was dropped, which resulted in the form Jemtland. This did not happen in Jamtlandic where the t was lost which resulted in the form Jamplann (when nd was assimilated into nn). This form was commonly used in regional speech until the 20th century when an altered version, Jamtlann became prominent. In Swedish language the form Jemtland was still commonly used and when the letter √§ became \\"mod√§rn\\" in the early 20th century the province's spelling changed into J√§mtland. This never happened in the Danish language (and thus not in Norwegian either), where the spelling with an e remained. In Icelandic and New Norwegian (Nynorsk) it is still spelled Jamt(a)land. Settlements like Jemtland in Ringsaker, Norway and Jemtland in Maine, United States both use an older spelling, given that the time they were settled by Jamtish emigrants the form J√§mtland hadn't reached official status. When J√§mtland was occupied by Sweden in the 16th and 17th century many Jamts fled from their province and founded villages like Jamt√∏ya, Jamtgarden and Jamt√•sen in Tr√∏ndelag, Norway.

The organisation grew into the second largest of the German state railways (after that of the Prussian state railways) with a railway network of 8,526 kilometres (including the Palatinate Railway or Pfalzbahn) by the end of the First World War. Following the abdication of the Bavarian monarchy at the end of the First World War, the 'Royal' title was dropped and on 24 April 1920 the Bavarian State Railway (Bayerische Staatseisenbahn), as it was now called, was merged into the newly formed German Reich Railways Authority or Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen as the Bavarian Group Administration (Gruppenverwaltung Bayern). The management of the Bavarian railway network was divided into four Reichsbahn divisions: Augsburg, Munich, Nuremberg and Regensburg. The former Palatinate Railway formed the Ludwigshafen division. On 1 October 1933 the only group administration within the Deutsche Reichsbahn- Gesellschaft, the Gruppenverwaltung Bayern, was disbanded. As a nation-state, Germany did not come into being until the creation of the German Empire in 1871 from the various German-speaking states such as Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Baden and W√ºrttemberg. By then each of the major states had formed its own state railway and these remained separate, albeit working increasingly closely together, until after the First World War. After 1815 the territory of Bavaria included the Palatinate, or Pfalz, which was west of the Rhine and bordered on France and became part of the newly formed German state of Rhineland- Palatinate in 1946.  The three Bavarian main lines  The three Bavarian main lines. The Ludwig South-North Railway is shown in red, the Ludwig's Western Railway is shown in blue, and the Bavarian Maximilian Railway in green With the nationalisation of the Munich-Augsburg route in 1844 the Bavarian state railway era began. In the beginning the Royal Bavarian State Railways concentrated on the construction of 3 main lines: * The Ludwig South-North Railway (Ludwig-S√ºd-Nord-Bahn), 548 km long and built between 1844 and 1853. It ran from Lindau near Lake Constance via Kempten, Augsburg, Nuremberg and Bamberg to Hof, Germany near the present Czech border and linked to the Saxon railway network. * Ludwig's Western Railway (Ludwigs-West-Bahn), which was 100 km long, built from 1852 to 1854 and opened in sections. It ran from Bamberg via Schweinfurt and W√ºrzburg to Aschaffenburg with a link into the state of Hesse. * The Bavarian Maximilian‚Äôs Railway (Maximilians-Bahn) which ran from Ulm to Augsburg and from Munich to Kufstein with a branch to Salzburg in Austria. It was built from 1853 to 1860 and was 188 km long. In the following years the state railway network was continually expanded. Gaps were closed and from the middle of the 1880s the countryside was opened up with an extensive branch line network. These were known as the Lokalbahnen or 'local lines'.  Bavarian branch lines (Lokalbahnen)  Branch lines were once a common feature of the Bavarian countryside. The constant ringing of bells (German: bimmeln) as they crossed ungated tracks gave rise to the nickname Bimmelbahn. There were over 180 of them, including about 20 private lines. The majority were standard gauge but some were narrow gauge, including the Chiemsee-Bahn which still operates today as a roadside tramway. But motorisation, especially after the Second World War, led to widespread closures. By 1977 there were only 79 branch lines left and further closures have occurred since. By contrast, some lines are enjoying new-found museum status, such as Mellrichstadt‚ÄìFladungen, and others continue to thrive as a result of border re-opening and holiday traffic, as in the Bavarian Forest (Bayerische Wald). In 1995 the Nuremberg Nordost to Gr√§fenberg branch (built in 1908) was still running in the traditional way with a locomotive and two coaches, albeit of modern stock, but most surviving branches are operated by DMUs. The first branch line proper was built in 1872 and ran from Siegelsdorf to Markt Erlbach. The last was Zwiesel to Bodenmais, in the Bavarian Forest, which opened as late as 1928 and is still operational. Track was often lightly laid, limiting axle-loading to 4.25 or 5 tonnes. On well-drained land, sand, gravel, cinders or a mix of the three was sometimes used instead of normal ballast. Rail bridges were simple and tracks followed the lines of roads, paths, or rivers where possible to keep civil engineering to a minimum. Specially designed branch line coaches (Lokalbahnwagen) were produced from the 1890s onwards, initially in green livery with white outlines. These lasted well into the 1960s. On some of the more robust lines, wooden or steel 'thunderboxes' were used from the 1930s onwards, and even former main line six-wheelers were cascaded to some branches.  Railways taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways  * On 1 June 1846 the Royal Bavarian State Railways took over the Munich-Augsburg Railway Company with its 62 km of railway line. The purchase price was 4.4 million gulden. * On 15 May 1875 the Bavarian Eastern Railway (Bayerische Ostbahn) were taken over with their main lines Munich-Regensburg-Bayreuth/Eger and Nuremberg-Passau as well as all their branch lines; a total of some 900 km of line. * On 1 January 1909 the 3 private railways which were grouped into the Palatinate Railway were taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Their network at this point comprised 870 kilometres of line, of which 60 km was narrow gauge. The state had to find around 300 million marks for this purchase. The three private lines were the: ** Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn) ** Palatine Maximilian Railway (Pf√§lzische Maximiliansbahn) ** The Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pf√§lzischen Nordbahnen) with the Neustadt‚ÄìD√ºrkheim Railway Company (Neustadt- D√ºrkheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft)  Organisation  The regional administrative branches were originally called railway offices (Bahn√§mter) and major railway offices (Oberbahn√§mter). The latter were located in Augsburg, Bamberg, Ingolstadt, Kempten, Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg, Rosenheim, Weiden and W√ºrzburg. Prior to 1886 they were subordinated to the \\"Head Office of the Royal Transport Institution\\" (Generaldirektion der k√∂niglichen Verkehrsanstalten). From 1886 to 1906 they came under the \\"Head Office of the Royal Bavarian State Railways\\" (Generaldirektion der k√∂niglich bayerischen Staatseisenbahnen). In 1906 railway divisions were created and they reported to the State Ministry of Transportation. These were the Augsburg, Ludwigshafen/Rhein, Munich, Nuremberg, Bamberg, Regensburg and W√ºrzburg divisions which, apart from Bamberg (absorbed into the Nuremberg division) were taken over by the German Imperial Railway Authority (Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen) after 1920.  Locomotives of the Royal Bavarian State Railways  Like the majority of its sister administrations in the other German states, the Royal Bavarian State Railways procured its railway engines from locomotive manufacturers within its own borders. These included Joseph Anton von Maffei and the Krauss & Co. Engine Works of Munich. Four engines were purchased from Baldwin in the USA in 1899 and 1901 in order to study modern construction techniques. The knowledge thus obtained was used in the design of new Bavarian machines. Details of the individual Bavarian locomotive classes may be found in the List of Bavarian locomotives and railbuses.  Notable Bavarian locomotives  Bavarian Class S 3/6 Locomotive The one example of the Bavarian S 2/6 engine was designed and built by Anton Hammel, an engineer at the Maffei Locomotive Works, within 5 months and was displayed to the public at the 1906 Nuremberg State Exhibition. After its return from the exhibition it was taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways on 21 November 1906. A few months later, in July 1907, it set the world speed record for steam locomotives, recording a top speed of 154.5 km/h on the Munich to Augsburg line. Since being taken out of service in 1925 it has been preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum. After the success of this record-holding locomotive, Hammel designed a Pacific engine for Bavaria, based on the Class IVf engines built by Maffei for the Baden State Railways. This new express locomotive, the Bavarian S 3/6 (later the DRG Class 18.4-5), illustrated right, was a major success and continued to be built by the DRG. For many enthusiasts this is the most beautiful German steam locomotive and its popularity is testified by the numerous models produced in recent years by manufacturers such as Roco, M√§rklin and Trix. In 1914 the first units of the most powerful Bavarian steam locomotive, the Class Gt 2x4/4 Mallet tank engine (later DRG Class 96.0) entered service. This was used in pusher service to support trains on the steeper Bavarian inclines. Perhaps the most iconic branch line engine was the Bavarian PtL 2/2 nicknamed the Glaskasten or \\"glass box\\". The first ones were built at the Maffei and Krauss locomotive works in Munich in 1906. Their design was radically new, the most striking features being the large driver‚Äôs cab which surrounded the entire boiler and the semi- automatic firing which enabled one-man operation. Gangways at the front and rear allowed train staff to cross over to the engine even on the move. Twenty- nine locomotives of this class were produced up to 1909 and another three were delivered by Krauss in 1910 for the Prussian state railways. Seven survived the Second World War and the last one retired in 1963.

A Grade I listed building, it is now a country house hotel. The current building was constructed between 1738 and 1757 for the Powell family, with the Shrewsbury architect Edward Haycock Sr. designing the stable block in the 1830s, and William Ritson Coultart designing the east wing and rear offices in 1841. The family occupied the house for some 200 years up until the last of the Powells, Margaret Powell, who died in 1951. At its peak the Nanteos estate comprised some 31,000 acres in 1800, covering most of what is today Aberystwyth, and was the major employer of the county. The name derives from the Welsh for \\"brook\\" (nant) and \\"nightingale\\" (eos). The house was once the home of the Nanteos Cup, a medieval mazer drinking bowl that has been attributed with a supernatural ability to heal those who drink from it; it was traditionally believed to be fashioned from a piece of the True Cross. A 1905 pamphlet declared it to be the Holy Grail. History Nanteos in its grounds The earliest recorded occupant of the estate was Colonel John Jones, a Royalist during the English Civil War and High Sheriff of Cardiganshire for 1665. He had no sons and so the estate was inherited in 1666 by his daughter Anne, who had married a Dutch mining engineer, Cornelius Le Brun, who in turn became High Sheriff in 1676. Their only daughter Averina duly inherited, having married William Powell (1658‚Äì1738) of Llechwedd Dyrus, and passed it on in 1738 to their eldest son, Thomas. Thomas had married a wealthy heiress, Mary Frederick, and started to build the present house soon afterwards. He was MP in turn for Cardigan Boroughs and Cardiganshire and died in a London street. The property then descended in the family to the Reverend William Powell in 1752, who completed the building work. His son Thomas inherited and was High Sheriff in 1785; Thomas's son William Edward was High Sheriff in 1810 and MP for Cardiganshire between 1816 and his death in 1854. It passed further down in the family to Margaret Powell, the widow of Edward Athelstan Lewis Powell, who had died in 1930. Their only son was killed in the First World War. She bequeathed the property in 1951 to Mrs. Elizabeth Mirylees, a distant relative of her husband, who moved in 1956. She sold it only 11 years later to Geoff and Rose Bliss, who lived there until 1983, opening the building to the public. Since then there have been several owners but the mansion now operates as a hotel. In 2004 it was purchased by the Saxoncourt Group. In 2008 it was featured in an episode of the television series Ghost Hunters International. A major refurbishment was completed in 2012. References * Re-printed 2012.

Howard was impressed by the lifestyle of New York, as compared to Virginia, and urged his wife to bring good silver from England.Hatfield, p. 173. Lady Howard arrived in Virginia, but died the next year on 13 August 1685 at age 31. Their daughter, Margaret Frances, died while accompanying Lady Howard's body, being transported for return to England. In 1687, Howard again travelled to New York to negotiate with the Iroquois, with a stop in Philadelphia on the way.Hatfield, p. 206. Despite his negotiation efforts, Howard was unpopular among Virginians. He ordered that no one in the colony could use a printing press for any reason and tried to gain the power to overturn laws and levy taxes. Land grants could only be passed if Lord Howard was paid a fee. He created a court of equity and named himself a petty Lord Chancellor. In 1687, he expelled Colonel Philip Ludwell from the Virginia Council, calling him \\"an abettor in fomenting disputes over which the Assembly was so obstinate.\\" The expulsion backfired, however, when Ludwell's resultant popularity led to a meeting with King William. A successful meeting with the king led to Ludwell's council seat being restored on 7 May 1691.Tyler, pp. 145-146. Late life Howard left Virginia for England on 20 October 1688. He lived mostly in Little Chelsea in Kensington, then Middlesex. He was allowed to remain governor of Virginia from afar at half the salary. Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., who had administered the colony during Howard's time in New York in 1684, did so again while Howard was in England until Howard's deputy, Francis Nicholson, arrived on 16 May 1690. Howard remarried on 20 January 1690 to Susan Felton, daughter of Sir Henry Felton, Baronet, and widow of Philip Harbord. His funeral took place at St Giles in the Fields.Bolton, p. 152.

In their adult stage of life, they are blood-sucking ectoparasites of nestling birds. Within the genus Carnus, this is the only species widespread across Europe and the cold and temperate regions of Asia and North America. Female body length is about 1.5 mm, males are smaller. It typically occurs in the nests of medium- to large-bodied birds, provided that the nest is not on the ground. It is particularly common on the chicks of owls, falcons, rollers, bee-eaters and starlings. Females give birth to larvae that live within the nest and feed on organic debris and the pupae also overwinter there. The emergence of imagines is synchronized to the hatch of host nestlings in the subsequent year. They prefer larger chicks within the nest. Adult flies have a winged and an unwinged variety, the latter being much commoner. In fact, unwinged flies still carry the basal part of their wings, but the majority of the wing is broken off (see a close view of the above photo). Flies live only on the nestlings before and during the development of the plumage, and disappear later on. Infestations by Carnus hemapterus appear to be rather harmless for the host chicks. In spite of that, barn owl females advertise their resistance genes by the dark spots on their breast and belly; nestlings of heavily spotted females tend to be more resistant. In this study, potential environmental confounding effects were controlled for by cross- fostering chicks. The faeces and blood remains from these ectoparasitic flies make spots on the eggshell surface of host birds. This contamination appear to increase abundance and diversity of eggshell bacterial loads and, consequently, increase the chance of embryo death. Image:Barnowl.jpgBarn owl, heavily spotted.

Career  He began in journalism as a local reporter on The New York Times. In 1949 he came to Washington as a congressional correspondent for the United Press, until 1958 when he joined TIME Magazine where he worked for nearly 30 years reporting on Congress, and served as chief Congressional correspondent. For TIME Magazine, MacNeil reported many cover stories, including on such members of Congress as Sam Rayburn, Mike Mansfield, Lyndon Johnson, the Kennedy brothers (John, Robert, and Ted), Everett Dirksen, Gerald Ford, Hubert Humphrey, William Fulbright, Robert Byrd, and Howard Baker. He appeared on such programs as NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet The Press‚Äù and CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace The Nation.‚Äù For three years starting in 1964, MacNeil made a weekly report, ‚ÄúMacNeil on Congress,‚Äù for the Eastern Educational Television Network, a program enlarged in 1967 into ‚ÄúWashington Week in Review‚Äù on National Public Television. He was a weekly regular on that program until 1978. He wrote three books: Forge of Democracy: The House of Representatives, 1963; Dirksen: Portrait of a Public Man, 1970, and The President‚Äôs Medal 1789-1977, 1977, a study of presidential inaugural medals. At the time of his death, MacNeil was completing a fourth book, tentatively titled Call The Roll: A Candid History of the United States Senate. After his death in June 2008 Oxford University Press contacted Richard A. Baker, historian emeritus of the Senate and asked him to assist in completing this book. It was posthumously published under the title The American Senate: An Insider's History and was the winner of the Society for History in the Federal Government's George Pendleton Prize for 2013. For many years he served on the executive committee of the Congressional Periodical Press Galleries. In 1980 he won the Dirksen Award for distinguished reporting on Congress. In 1976 MacNeil served as chairman of the United States Assay Commission, a citizens‚Äô group annually appointed by the President to test the validity of the government‚Äôs coinage, a commission originally created by George Washington during his administration and abolished in 1977 by President Carter as an economy measure.  Personal  In 1939, as a boy of 16, MacNeil suffered a fractured skull in a batting practice accident, and after that he had to wear a special protective helmet made for him by the Davega Sports Company whenever batting, by odd chance one of the first batting helmets ever made, now housed at Baseball‚Äôs Hall of Fame, Cooperstown, New York. In 1976 and 1977 MacNeil was president of the Clan MacNeil Association of America. Elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, 1974, and the Massachusetts Historical Society, 1977, MacNeil served as a trustee of the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Historic Site, Cornish, New Hampshire, since 1975.

In the Galilee, most of the illegal villages were regulated and recognized, and from a population of 90,000 Bedouin in the north, a few hundred still live in unrecognized villages.Prof. Arnon Sofer, Because of lack of governance the new guard is born, March 2011, On new guard In the south, it is estimated that about 90,000 residents live in unrecognized Bedouin villages; these Bedouin comprise 45% of the total Bedouin population.According to a survey of Association of Forty =Status= The unrecognized Bedouin villages were either built without authorization from the Israeli state or predates either the state itself or the \\"Planning and Construction Law\\" passed in 1965. As the state considers them a menace, they remain ineligible for municipal services, such as connection to the electrical grid, water mains or trash-pickup, and they cannot elect government representatives. These communities dots the Northern Negev and often military fire zones, natural reserves, landfills, etc, have been built around them. For example, in the 1950s, the 'Azazme were forced off their grazing grounds and settled in Wadi al-Na'am. Since then, an IDF munitions factory and military fire zone, the Efrat Oil Terminal ‚Äì an oil-storage site, the Israel Electric Corporation and Mekorot ‚Äì the national water carrier site have come to surround the village.Am Johal, \\"Powerless\\" Bedouin Village Still Seeking Health Care According to a report by the Israeli NGO Adva Center, \\"The Bedouin living in the Negev constitute the only group of Arab citizens of Israel that still has a large- scale hold on the land, a hold that the state officially denies in principle, while recognizing in practice.\\" According to the Israel Land Administration (2007), some 60 per cent of the Negev Bedouin lived in seven permanent state- planned townships, such as Rahat, Tel as-Sabi, Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom), Ar'arat an-Naqab, Kuseife, Lakiya and Hura, while the rest (40 per cent) ‚Äì \\"in illegal homes spread over hundreds of thousands of dunams\\".Bedouin information, ILA, 2007 Since 2003 a number of previously illegal Bedouin communities were recognized by the state (such as al-Sayyid), and several new ones were built (such as Tirabin al-Sana) totaling 12 (not including the previous seven townships).Patricia Golan, Built on sand , Jerusalem Report, 26 June 2012 They were united under Abu Basma Regional Council that was split on 5 November 2012 into two newly created bodies: Neve Midbar Regional Council and al-Kasom Regional Council.Information for the citizens , Abu Basma Regional Council official site (Hebrew) As of July 2013, there are no updated official statistics on the number of Bedouin living outside the government- planned and officially recognized communities. HistoryThe Ottoman empire= During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the semi-arid region of the Negev was inhabited mostly by semi-nomadic Bedouin tribes.Rebecca Manski, [Criminalizing Self-Subsistence], News from Within, Summer 2006 In 1858 the Turks enacted a law stating that all landowners names must be officially documented as a means of regulating matters relating to land in the Ottoman Empire. Most of the land in the Negev was classified as muwat (dead land, wasteland unsuitable for cultivation). The Bedouin did not create a written record of their connection to the land, and some argue that even opposed to it, since it would make them subject to the Ottoman empire, what would require them to pay taxes and serve in the Ottoman army. Also, when the publication of the Ottoman Lands Ordinance, the Negev area had no permanent settlement. By the year 1896 Negev Bedouin lived in almost complete freedom. The Ottomans were not interested and did not intervene in the Negev and the Bedouins. According to Yosef Ben-Dor, only after a tribal war, the Turkish government marked tribal boundaries, but did not give the Bedouins in this agreement \\"ownership\\" of tribal territorial lands.Goldberg Commission's recommendations, RCUV, p.6 =British Mandate= The British government adopted the Ottoman land laws, and added to them the Land Ordinance, intended to prevent squatting and recognition of unauthorized takeover of land. In 1921, the government of the British Mandate issued an order for all the Negev residents to register their land. According to the Land Ordinance of 1921, any Bedouin who cultivated and improved a \\"mewat\\" (dead) land received a confirmation of ownership on that same land. Although the Bedouin were granted with a special extension of two-month to register their land, they have never done so, and the land remained unregistered.Joseph son of David. [Bust Negev Bedouin, Jews, land, fresh: Center for Arab society in Israel], 1996 Mandate authorities also conducted a preliminary registration of land and since 1934 began to collect land taxes. Mandatory maps show the location of the Bedouin tribes, however, the maps never marked the boundaries of each tribe. The 1947 report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine estimated the number of bedouins in the Beersheba district to be about 90,000.UNSCOP Report, Vol II. , Chapter 2, Para. 21. In preparation for a 1946 census of Palestine that was never carried out, the British government surveyed all the tribes in situ and concluded that the number of bedouin in the Beersheba district was about 92,000 out of 127,000 in the whole country. It also reported that they \\"cultivated about two million dunums of cereal land and that aerial photographs of the northern Beersheva taken by the Royal Air Force revealed the existence of 3,389 houses and 8,722 tents.\\"Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestine Question, Report of Sub-committee 2, November 11, 1947, UN Doc A/AC.14/32, pages 40 and 65. The same figure of two million dunams appeared in a 1944/5 book of Yosef Weitz, but in contrast \\"Shimoni and Tartakover estimate the area cultivated by Bedouin in the Negev at only 60,000 dunam.\\"Goldberg Committee recommendations, quoting a 1982 paper of Aharon Zohar. According to Sasson Bar Zvi, a cultural researcher of the Negev Bedouin, and Arie Efrat who served as director for the Arab villages in the south, the lack of water in the Negev area did not allow its residents to revive the land and therefore they preferred nomadic life and shepherding to an organized and rental land cultivation, and this is why the land remained a desolate area.Salim Ali Agdia to Hawashla and others vs. State of Israel, Civil Appeal No. 218\\\\74] According to the Bedouin, although they did not document land ownership, the Turkish government and the British recognized the rights of ownership of land in which they roamed, and this recognition was expressed when the Bedouins sold land to the Zionist movement during the British Mandate, and the sales were recognized and recorded in the land registry (Tabu). In contrast, Dr. Yosef Ben-David explains this fact by claiming that the Ottoman and British authorities saw a blessing in transferring land from the Bedouin to the applicant for registration, because they will be likely to use land intensively, without the authorities taking into consideration any legal rights the Bedouins had to the land recognized by either government. Furthermore, Jews who dealt with redemption of lands in the establishment of Israel gave ex gratia funds to the Bedouin to enable the rapid registration of Israel lands in the land registry, and not because legal recognition of ownership of the Bedouin on the land. Since the beginning of the 1930s and until the establishment of the State of Israel, the Bedouin sold almost 765,000 dunams of land, of which about 180,000 sold to JNF representatives and about 45,000 dunams to private Jews. The rest 545,000 dunams, were sold mainly to Arab peasants from the Gaza Strip.Daniel Center for Strategic Dialogue, Negev Bedouin strategic challenge to Israel, Netanya Academic College, January 2013 =Israel= Goats grazing beneath garbage bins in Tel Sheva During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Negev region saw harsh battles between the newly created Israel Defense Forces and the Egyptian army. In the aftermath of the war, most of the Negev was included within the borders of the newly established State of Israel. Censuses before and after the war indicate that about 80% of the Bedouin population left the Negev to areas that remained under Arab rule.Report of the Commission to Propose a Policy for Arranging Bedouin Settlement in the Negev, a.k.a. the Goldberg Report, pp. 6‚Äì13 (Hebrew version) The Israeli authorities' treatment of the Bedouin population was ambivalent. On the one hand, the Bedouin were considered loyal to the new state, and some of them even volunteered to serve in the IDF. On the other hand, Israel saw the Negev as its \\"hinterland\\", being sparsely populated and as the West Bank came under Jordanian rule. The policy eventually adopted was forcing the Bedouin to concentrate in an area of 1,100 km2, that has become known as the Siyagh (Arabic for \\"the permitted area\\") region, stretching between the West Bank border to the north-east, Be'er Sheva to the south-west and Arad to the south. All the Bedouin remaining under Israeli rule were granted Israeli citizenship, but the Siyagh region was placed under martial law until 1966, like many other mostly Arab-populated areas in Israel at the time. This was the time when most of the unrecognized villages of today were established. The Bedouin claims for ownership on lands in the Negev were, by and large, rejected by the Israeli authorities, on the pretext that the ownership is not appropriately documented or that the lands claimed are not eligible to private ownership. Both Bedouin citizens and state authorities agree that only a small minority of the claim can be backed with full legally valid documentation, however the Bedouin claimants demand that their traditional ties with the lands, namely the fact that they de facto held the rights on these lands without objection on behalf of the former Ottoman or British authorities, be recognized by the State of Israel as ownership. Implementing her land policies, Israel started to rely on the Ottoman Land Code of 1858, the only preceding law frame in the region. According to these regulations, lands that were not registered as of private ownership, were considered state lands. Israel relied mainly on Tabu recordings. Most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Eventually, Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance from 1969.(Hebrew) Dr. Tobi Fenster, A summary stance paper on Bedouin land issues, written for \\"Sikkuy ‚Äì for equal opportunity\\" Hura downtown In order to reinforce the invisible Siyag fence and sedentarize the Bedouin, the State employed a reining mechanism, the Black Goat Law of 1950. The Black Goat Law curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings. Since few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was thereby rendered illegal. Most Bedouin who had the option, preferred not to register their lands under the Ottoman rule as this would mean being taxed without representation or services. Those whose land claims were recognized found it almost impossible to keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, only a small portion of the Bedouin were able to continue to graze their goats. Instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, the majority of the Bedouin migrated in search of wage-labor. In the mid-1970s Israel let the Negev Bedouin register their land claims and issued special certificates that served as the basis for the \\"right of possession\\" later granted by the government. Following the signing of the Treaty of Peace with Egypt, it became necessary to move an airport from a Sinai peninsula to a locality inhabited by some five thousand Bedouin. The government, recognizing these land claim certificates, negotiated with the certificate holders and paid compensation to them. Most moved to Bedouin townships, built houses and established businesses.Dr. Yosef Ben-David. The Bedouin in Israel, 1999 The Israeli government has promoted the sedentarization of the Bedouin population. In 1963, Moshe Dayan said: Dayan added, \\"Without coercion but with governmental direction ... this phenomenon of the Bedouins will disappear\\". The Bedouin communities in the Negev, many unrecognised by the Israeli government, were classified as \\"open areas\\" during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict and so their 200,000 residents did not have warning sirens or anti- rocket protection. State treatmentArrangement attempts= In the 1970s Israel collected all the \\"claims of ownership\\" in the Negev, without permits and without proof, for the purpose of registering these claims. However, the Bedouin saw the state registry as a recognition for their claims. More than 3,000 ownership claims were filed for the land sized over 800,000 dunams, which includes nearly the whole area between Be'er Sheva ‚Äì Arad ‚Äì Dimona and other areas throughout the entire Negev, including those that belong to kibbutzim and cities. In the first years of the arrangement, anyone demanding area of over 400 dunams had the opportunity to get 20% of the land from the Land Registry, and for the rest of the area they would receive financial compensation. Anyone who demanded less than 400 dunams, had received only monetary compensation. In addition, the state of Israel compensated the Bedouin for any building, tin shack, barn or even a tree that the Bedouin placed and the government removed. The compensation value was even higher than the property's value in the market. In 20% of the claims the state has reached a settlement with the Bedouin. At the same time, some Bedouin tried to claim the land ownership in the court, despite the May 1984 Supreme Court precedent ruling of Justice Avraham Halima, stating that Bedouin are nomads by definition and thus cannot have any ownership of land.While the state is the owner of all the mawat land in the Negev as defined in the 1858 Ottoman lands ordinance and the 1921 British lands ordinance, unless the Bedouin have legal title deeds (Supreme Court, C.A. 218/74) In all 80 cases in which Bedouin claims arrived to court, the judges ruled in favor of the state, since there was no document proving Bedouin land ownership. According to recent data submitted to the Goldberg Commission by the Bedouin Administration in July 2008, 2840 claims remained, whose overall area is 571,186 dunams.According to claims officer attorney Rami Damari. Goldberg committee report, A land settlement, No. 34, p.15 =Planned townships= Dealing with the problem of the Negev Bedouin, between 1968 and 1989 Israel built seven planned townships especially for the Bedouin in the attempt to urbanize them. The largest Bedouin locality in Israel, the city of Rahat, was established in 1971. Other townships include Tel as-Sabi (Tel Sheva) (established in 1969), Shaqib al- Salam (Segev Shalom) in 1979, Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev) and Kuseife in 1982, Lakiya in 1985 and Hura in 1989.Rebecca Manski. \\"THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE IN BEDOUIN URBAN TOWNSHIPS: THE END OF SELF- SUBSISTENCE\\" ; Life and Environment, 2006 (translation from Hebrew)Jonathan Cook.\\"Bedouin in the Negev face new 'transfer\\"; MERIP, 10 May 2003 Since grazing has been severely restricted, and the Bedouin rarely receive permits to engage in subsistence agriculture,Aref Abu-Rabia.

Since then it has been rebuilt and destroyed several dozen times (September 2012).Palestinian villagers demand Guinness entry for demolition record, Al Arabiya, 13 June 2012 The matter of land ownership in the area of al-Araqeeb was raised in court when several members of al-Uqbi family filed a suit against the State claiming ownership of land. After a thorough examination of this case involving leading experts in the field, in March 2012 came a court ruling in favor of the State. Judge Sarah Dovrat said that the land was not \\"assigned to the plaintiffs, nor held by them under conditions required by law,\\" and that they still had to \\"prove their rights to the land by proof of its registration in the Tabu\\" (Israel Lands Authority). The judge noted that the Bedouin knew they were supposed to register but did not.Jerusalem Post, \\"Court rejects 6 Bedouin Negev land lawsuits\\", 19 March 2012. =Prawer plan= In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year economic development plan called the Prawer plan.Cabinet Approves Plan to Provide for the Status of Communities in, and the Economic Development of, the Bedouin Sector in the Negev, PMO official site, 11 September 2012 One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000‚Äì40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships.Al Jazeera, 13 September 2011, Bedouin transfer plan shows Israel's racismGuardian, 3 November 2011, Bedouin's plight: \\"We want to maintain our traditions. But it's a dream here\\" According to the PMO official press release, the plan is based on four main principles: # Providing for the status of Bedouin communities in the Negev; # Economic development for the Negev's Bedouin population; # Resolving claims over land ownership; and # Establishing a mechanism for binding, implementation and enforcement, as well as timetables. Tirabin al-Sana's mosque (its dome taken from mosque in the previous Tarabin tribe residence place next to Omer) When the cabinet approved it, simultaneously it also approved a NIS 1.2 billion economic development program for Bedouin Negev whose main purpose is to support the Bedouin women and youth in the fields of employment since they will contribute to the increased economic growth of the entire Bedouin community. Much of the approved funds will be allocated for the development of industrial zones, establishment of employment centers and professional training. According to the Prawer plan, the present Bedouin communities will undergo a comprehensive planning process. The existing communities will be expanded, some unrecognized communities will be recognized and start to receive public services, while their infrastructure will be renewed. All these changes will be done in the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. It's important to note that the nature of these future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin. For those of them who are to be relocated, 2/3 of them will receive a new residence nearby. The Prawer plan seeks to give an answer to numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin. It will offers significant compensation in land and funds ‚Äì 50% of the claim (currently it's only 20% offered), while each claim will be dealt in a unified and transparent way provided by law. Nevertheless, exists harsh criticism of the Prawer plan.

He would not dare. He will prefer to live in a cave, instead of approaching the land\\".Kalman Libeskind Negev going lost: How the state failed to treat the Bedouins of the South. NRG, 16 July 2010 There is a common phenomenon of the Bedouin who receive compensation and new homes in legal towns, yet return and construct again in state lands thus not fulfilling the agreements signed with the government. They were paid a compensation for relinquishing their claims to the state, but still claim ownership on the land to other Bedouin, so the problem remains unsolved. The town of Kuseife, for example is built almost entirely on lands claimed by different tribes, and thus two-thirds of the city is empty. Bedouin lands' claims don't take into account central planning issues. When agreement made, the Bedouin receive 20%‚Äì62% of the land they claimed. These lands are speckled with those registered in the Land Registry as belonging to other Bedouin. As a result, state encounters a serious problem developing Negev. Due to this issue, it is not possible to develop the eastern part of the Be'er Sheva metropolitan.Ehud Prawer and Lirit Srafis, Negev Bedouin, policies, problems and recommendations, January 2006, National Security Council According to government sources, another hindrance in the arrangement attempts is the absence of deadline for the negotiations. According to Prof. Sofer: \\"Bedouin always say 'no' to attempts to reach a compromise with them about the lands that they claim, because they know that every 'no' only strengthens them. One of the main problems in this program is lack of a final date. The state should set a date by which it is willing to give increased compensation for those who erase the claim of ownership, and from there on ‚Äì no more compromise and a confrontation is needed even if it will come at a high price.\\" According to officials involved in negotiations, there is a lack of consistency in granting compensations. The Bedouin Administration manages negotiations with each tribe or family separately, soo the compensation size differs. Conciliatory families receive lower compensation, while the recalcitrant families' compensation is higher (a good example is the evacuation of the Bedouin Tarabin from the outskirts of Omer). The state also offers higher compensations to families with a leader that the government needs him by their side, or to families that claim land ownership in the areas of special importance to the state. One of the reasons for the lack of uniformity is the crisis of the Bedouin community leadership. Currently there is no agreed Bedouin leadership to resolve the land issue, and the Bedouin refuse to place representatives on the ground, so there is no authority to represent all of the claimants. Another factor hindering the arrangement is tribal feud. According to one of the negotiators, attorney Itay Bar, Southern District Attorney for Civil Affairs, \\"Sometimes you can not place one Bedouin next to another because his son insulted him 20 years ago\\". According to Faisal el-Husael, the public representative from the Bedouin inside the Goldberg committee, often the Bedouin are not willing to relocate to planned towns since they prefer rural settlements to semi-urban townships.Protocol of Goldberg Committee for proposing a policy of regulating Bedouin settlement in the Negev, Haifa University, 15 January 2008 FeaturesHigh natural growth= The Israeli state consider the high fertility rate among Bedouins to be a big problem.

So while in 1951 they numbered 12,000, in 1970 ‚Äì about 25,000, in 1990 ‚Äì about 87,000 people, and in 2008 ‚Äì approximately 180,000. In 2020 are expected to reach 400,000.

In the absence of any alternative, and as they cannot receive planning permission in the villages, they have no alternative, so they claim, but to build illegally\\" In 1945 there were 290 illegal structures in the dispersed communities, in 1956 ‚Äì 955, in 1994 ‚Äì 12,000, in 1998 ‚Äì 24,225, in 2004 ‚Äì 42,561, and in 2011 ‚Äì 64,000.Section 68 in Goldberg report Between the years 1998‚Äì2001, the demolition of illegal buildings stopped as a government policy and gradually resumed later. Law enforcement has failed, and there is no viable option to destroy all illegal construction. The threat of destruction does not deter residents from illegal building.Section 69 in Goldberg report According to enforcement officials, it is not possible to monitor every case of illegal construction because the residents who build in the dispersed communities impose on the inspectors criminal and terrorist threats.According to the testimony of Brigadier General Menashe Arviv, head of the Coordination of enforcement activities in front of members of the [weblaw.haifa.ac.il/he/Faculty/Kedar/lecdb/general/protocol.doc committee headed by Justice Eliezer Goldberg] According to the Commissioner of Administrative Enforcement Shlomo Cizzer: \\"We evacuate only intruders who have a place to live, we have evacuated, and will re-evacuate, the people who invaded al-Araqeeb, because they have homes in Rahat, Lod, and in Kafr Qasim. They invaded just to prove ownership of the land. There are tens of thousands of others who are also criminals whom we do not evacuate, because they have no other houses to go to. Until the state decides what to do with them, we will act in accordance with the law \\".Tani Goldstein, Is there a solution to the problem of the Negev Bedouin land?, Ynet, 28 August 2010 =Ecological issues= While Bedouin take up open spaces that could be used for touristic purposes and construction of towns to accommodate new settlers, prominent Israeli environmental figures argue, that unapproved construction of unrecognized villages are an environmental hazard. Some ecologists say that Bedouin communities are causing damage to ecosystems since the Negev has unique habitats. There is a transitional area between the desert and the border region of the south of Judaean Mountains and Shfela, where most plant and animal species perform a gradation between habitats. Therefore, this zone is vital for them, especially during the global warming when species of the desert are expected to migrate to the north.Dotan Rotem (open areas ecologist division of science from the Nature and Parks Authority), and Azri Alon (Southern District Planner in Nature and Parks Authority), The ecological effects of the Bedouin dispersals of the Negev, February 2012, Ecology and Environment Magazine The keeping and feeding livestock bring steady amounts of vegetation food that grow wild and bring about consolidation of invading flora species. The Bedouins keep livestock in herds greater than the carrying capacity of the land, which leads to serious overgrazing, and to the creation of vast areas of empty of any plants. The cumulative effect creates huge areas where there is no vegetation at all (not natural and not agricultural) and no animals. In fact, the result is an ongoing and total destruction of habitat. Species unique to the region as Pterocles, houbara bustard, leopard fringe- fingered lizard and irises, disappeared from large surfaces. Illegal gas stations in the Bedouin dispersed communitiesGadi Golan, Disaster on the way 08/06/12, Israel Today represent a threat to the quality of air, soil and groundwater as fuel tanks do not meet basic standards of environmental protection meant to ensure that the fuel does not soak into the soil and groundwater, as well as the fuel itself does not meet environmental standards.Doron Herman and Hila Shai-Vazan, Illegal gas stations in the South sell fake and dangerous diesel fuel, Nana10, 08.06.2011 According to Itamar Ben Dodi from the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, the lack of sewage infrastructure and waste removal and illegal slaughter houses in the Bedouin dispersed communities cause an accumulation and spreading of wastewater and household waste that reach streams channels and cause odor nuisances, health problems for residents, and damage to nature.According to the testimony of Itamar Ben-David, a planner from the conservation department in SPNI in front of the Goldberg committee, 13 March 2008 In July 2013 Israeli government ordered to allocate NIS 40 million for garbage pick-up and recycling for the Negev Bedouin communities in the area of the Al-Kasom and Neveh Midbar regional councils ‚Äì for the first time. The main reason for the lack of garbage collecting services was unresolved land ownership disputes. Some homes in the area do not have legal standing and consequently do not pay local taxes which leads to the lack of income for the local authorities to operate garbage collection services.Zafrir Rinat, Some 30,000 Bedouin to get garbage collected for first time, Haaretz, 15 July 2013 A large number of Israelis, including both Bedouin and Jews, are settled in some 2.5% of the Negev desert available for civilian use living in proximity to Israel's nuclear reactors, 22 agro and petrochemical factories, an oil terminal, closed military zones, quarries, a toxic waste incinerator (Ramat Hovav), cell towers, a power plant, several airports, a prison, and two rivers of open sewage.BUSTAN on the Blueprint; Excerpt of Rebecca Manski, \\"A Desert Mirage: The Rising Role of American Money in Negev Development\\" ; News from Within, October/November 2005) Some of this infrastructure is concentrated on the grounds of the unrecognized village of Wadi el-Na'am. According to the Ministry of Health data (as of June 2004), the rates of cancer and mortality are 65% higher for those living within a 20 km radius of the Ramat Hovav Industrial Zone. Some 350,000 people live within this danger zone, including the residents of Beer Sheva.

After serving in France and for the household of Edward III, he was impeached during the Good Parliament of 1376, the earliest recorded impeachment in the Parliament of England. Early life and service in France Born on 24 March 1330 in Scampston, Ryedale Wapentake, North Riding of Yorkshire (now North Yorkshire), England, Latimer was the son of William Latimer, 3rd Baron Latimer, by Elizabeth, daughter of John de Botetourt, 1st Baron Botetourt. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel and Alice de Warenne, by 1353 and they had a daughter, Elizabeth (1357‚Äì1395). She married firstly John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby and secondly Robert Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He was present at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346, and by 1351 he had been knighted and was in royal service in Calais. In January 1356 he was present when Edward Balliol surrendered his claim to the Scottish throne and he served in Gascony in 1359. He was created a Knight of the Garter in 1361 in succession to Sir William FitzWarin and fought on the side of John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany at the Battle of Auray in 1364. In 1368, he was appointed Keeper of B√©cherel and in 1370 of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Return to England and impeachment After returning to England, he served as Steward of the Household from 1368 to 1370 and Chamberlain of the Household from 1371. His son-in-law John Neville, Lord Neville de Raby was appointed Steward of the Household in the same year, and until 1376 they were prominent figures in court and Latimer was high in favour with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the king's son. He became Constable of Dover Castle in 1373 and Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1374. He was also involved in negotiations with Portugal in 1373 and France in 1375. When Parliament was called in April 1376, known as the Good Parliament and led by Peter de la Mare, the members wanted to remove corrupt advisers from court. Latimer, Neville, London merchant Richard Lyons and Alice Perrers were accused, and the charges against Latimer were that he had been guilty of oppression in Brittany; had sold the castle of Saint-Sauveur to the enemy, and impeded the relief of B√©cherel in 1375; that he had taken bribes for the release of captured ships, and retained fines paid to the king, notably by Sir Robert Knolles, and the city of Bristol; and finally, that in association with Robert Lyons he had obtained money from the crown by the repayment of fictitious loans. Seconded by William of Wykeham, de la Mare sought to have Latimer immediately convicted, with the Commons acting on behalf of the king. They were unsuccessful and a trial took place. The charges were proven and he was removed from his positions in the royal household and on the council, fined and imprisoned. He was pardoned in October 1376 and with Lancaster's recovered influence he returned to favour. Latimer's impeachment is the earliest recorded in Parliament. Later life Latimer was named an executor of the will of Edward III, who died in June 1377. In 1377 he became governor of Calais, and took part against the Spaniards at the battle of Sluys. He also accompanied Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham on his expedition through France into Brittany in 1380. Latimer died on 28 May 1381 and was buried at Gisborough Priory, Yorkshire. He was survived by his wife and their daughter, Elizabeth who married John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, and had descendants. External links * Inquisition Post Mortem #375-389, dated 1381.

Carnatic Music Dikshita is spoken of as 'One of the Trio of Theoreticians' of modern period; the others being Ramamatya and Somanatha. The Nayaks brought with them the glorious tradition of their country to the fertile regions of river Cauvery. The Nayaks donated an entire village to 500 Brahmin families for fostering art and learning.

New York Times. Accessed May 10, 2008. History This group of Nashville session players played a mixture of pop and jazz standards. The all-star lineup featured guitar legends Hank Garland and Chet Atkins, saxophonist Boots Randolph, pianist/violinist Brenton Banks, pianist Floyd Cramer, bassist Bob Moore, drummer Buddy Harman, and vibes prodigy Gary Burton, who was only 17 years old at the time. Even though the players were playing country music day-in and day-out in Nashville sessions, they had a deep love of jazz and played often at the Carousel Club on Printer's Alley in Nashville. When their much-anticipated festival performance was canceled due to an unruly crowd, the group documented their performance anyway, recording on the back porch of a mansion RCA had rented during the festival (depicted by the drawing on the cover.) Hank Garland Biography by Rich Kienzle. Accessed May 10, 2008. Two of the songs, \\"Nashville to Newport\\" and \\"Riot-Chous\\" were composed for the occasion, the latter after the riot on the night prior to recording. Other groups since have taken the name Nashville All-Stars. Reception Allmusic critic Thom Owens called the album \\"a surprisingly jazzy effort, highllighted by some excellent leads by Atkins, yet it is a bit too down-home for jazzbos, and a bit too polished for country fans.

Biography Josef, the fourth of eight children, lost his father when he was eight years old. He was apprenticed in a woodcarving studio under Franz Prinoth, an academic sculptor educated in the Munich Academy, and in his twenties, Josef started his own studio. Examples of his early activity as a sculptor are the statues of the Maria Addolorata and of the Virgin Mary in the Parish Church of Urtij√´i. His first wife, Annamaria Sanoner died after she gave birth to their fourth child in 1874. He married Felizitas Unterplatzer who gave birth to eleven other children. She also took care of his farm and was active as an antiquarian. Thirty years old, with the support of Felizitas, he visited the Academy of Munich (1876‚Äì1880) to learn the art of painting after he was impressed in Vienna by the genre painting of Franz von Defregger, The Dance in the Mountains. His teachers in Munich were Joseph Knabl, Ludwig von L√∂fftz and Feodor Dietz. From 1880 to 1884 he was a pupil of Defregger; becoming close friends, they took many painting trips through the villages of the Trentino. In Munich Josef Moroder was influenced by the genre and historical painting of Defregger and the realistic-idealistic painting movement of Wilhelm Leibl. From his numerous sketch books we can see how precisely he observed nature, landscape and specially the Tyrolean and alpine lifestyle in Val Gardena. Many of his paintings, watercolours and sketches of farmhouses, huts, people and portraits are a testimony of a lost alpine world which once was the 19th-century Tyrol. The populist-romantic novelist Maria Veronika Rubatscher was well acquainted with the artist and wrote his biography in 1930, which became a popular novel. One of his pupils was Ludwig Moroder-Lenert. Most of Josef's children, Johann Baptist, Friedrich (Rico), Alfons, Josef, Otto, Hermann, became valid sculptors. His son Alfons (1882‚Äì1960) settled in Milwaukee where he set up a business to sell altars for churches and statues of saints partially produced by him or imported from his native village, Urtij√´i.

They ended their pursuit of the project in 2013. They considered various sites, as early as 1999; the most extensive plan called for a facility with 250 hotel rooms in Cascade Locks, Oregon. The proposed site is within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and adjacent to a federally designated wilderness area, but within the city limits of Cascade Locks. (The Columbia River National Scenic Area specifically exempts economic development projects within city limits and supports such growth for cities on both sides of the Columbia River). The plan, which was opposed by Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber, but supported by the City of Cascade Locks, and the government of Hood River County, must be approved by the United States Department of the Interior, and would be the first (or seventh) off-reservation casino in the state.  Political context  The Siletz tribe advocated for an off-reservation casino in Troutdale as early as 1992, drawing opposition from then-governor Barbara Roberts. As early as 1998, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs owned property in Hood River, and were entertaining controversial plans to open a casino there or in Cascade Locks. The Warm Springs tribes have operated the Kah-Nee-Ta resort since the 1960s; that resort, located 11 miles from Highway 26, is not very accessible to Portland metropolitan area, leading the tribes to seek a more lucrative location. Then-governor John Kitzhaber opposed the plans, on two principles: that each tribe should have only one casino, and that tribal casinos should be on tribal trust land established before the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Federal law gave Kitzhaber the power to deny the tribe the Cascade Locks location, because it had not been held in trust prior to the 1988 law. He had no such power over the Hood River site or other land the tribes had held for a longer period of time. Kitzhaber ultimately overruled the Cascade Locks location, but the issue overshadowed the 2002 gubernatorial election of Ted Kulongoski. The tribes made record political contributions during that election. Kulongoski, who took no position on the issue during the election, received $40,000 for his campaign from Indian tribes. In 2001, the Confederated Tribes purchased an additional of land east of the city of Hood River, adjoining it already owned. The Confederated Tribes then pursued two separate plans for casinos in the gorge until 2004: one in Cascade Locks, the other on the Hood River property. The Hood River plan, which would have called for an eight-story casino, was opposed by Hood River residents. Hood River County Commissioner Carol York was also a strong advocate of the Cascade Locks location, rather than the Hood River location. The project has the support of Oregon Congressman Greg Walden (R), who represents this area in Congress. Also publicly supporting the project is Oregon Senator Ted Ferrioli (R) and former Oregon Governors Vic Atiyeh (R) and Ted Kulongoski (D). Kulongoski and the Warm Springs tribe entered an agreement in 2005 permitting the plans to proceed. Opposition to a casino in Cascade Locks has been led by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, and has included other organizations: the Oregon Restaurant Association, Friends of Columbia Gorge, NoGorgeCasino, a small but vocal group of residents and the Oregon Family Council. Congressman David Wu has also opposed the casino. The Grand Ronde group was the biggest campaign spender in the 2006 gubernatorial primary election, opposing Kulongoski and Kevin Mannix. Grand Ronde, which operates Spirit Mountain Casino, spent over $800,000 in that cycle. In the 2010 gubernatorial race, all four major candidates (including Kitzhaber, who was ultimately reelected that year) announced their opposition to the plan. The United States Secretary of the Interior would have to approve a casino for it to move forward. Secretary Dirk Kempthorne of the George W. Bush administration generally opposed off-reservation casinos, but did not make a decision; his successor was expected to consider the proposed casino, along with an off-reservation casino in La Center, Washington being proposed by the Cowlitz Tribe. In January 2011 the Interior Department approved a compact between the tribes and the state. The remaining steps as of 2011 would include the demonstration of compliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and approval from the governor. In 2011, the tribes announced plans to move the Kah-Nee-Ta resort closer to Route 26, as they continued their long-term pursuit of a casino in Cascade Locks. The Warm Springs tribes ended their pursuit of a casino in the gorge in summer 2013.

Under this agreement, ISC is responsible for the management and operation of the land titles, personal property, and corporate registries, the land surveys directory, geographic information, and access to certain government services for business. The Government of Saskatchewan manages the contractual relationship with ISC through the Office of Public Registry Administration at the Ministry of Justice. This Office contains the government-appointed registry officials responsible for oversight of each of the registries and the land surveys directory. Three government agencies came together to form ISC in January 2000: the Land Titles Office (which was then a part of the Department of Justice), the Personal Property Registry (also part of Justice) and the Surveys, Mapping and Geographic Information Systems division of the Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation. In 2008, the Vital Statistics Registry, which had been a part of the Department of Health, was transferred to ISC. In June 2013, the Vital Statistics Registry transferred to eHealth Saskatchewan. The Corporate Registry (formerly known as the Corporations Branch as part of the Ministry of Justice) became part of ISC in October 2010. In 2011, ISC launched Business Registrations Saskatchewan.

In the registry, the general public can find out who the owner of each title is and who has an interest registered against a title. An interest is a legal encumbrance that affects a title. Examples of interest holders are mortgage companies and utility providers, though many others exist.www.isc.ca/landtitles ISC records all changes of ownership in land and the interests that are registered against land. The corporation also maintains an up-to-date directory in which interests against Crown land may be filed. The provincial judgment registry, a database of legal writs and maintenance orders, is another registry that ISC maintains; the judgment registry is linked to the Land Registry as a means of registering those types of interests. =Personal Property Registry (PPR)= The PPR is another public registry that ISC maintains in which interests in movable types of personal property (like cars, snowmobiles and boats) may be registered. Buyers and lenders can search the PPR to ensure there are no outstanding liens or other kinds of interests registered against an item.

The plot revolves around a series of brutal decapitation murders in Boston, Massachusetts. Alfred Sole was the film's original director, but he passed on the project. Hughes was ultimately brought in to direct, and Night School was his final film. The music score was composed by Brad Fiedel. The film premiered at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in 1981. Night School was released theatrically in the United States on September 11, 1981, and was panned by critics upon release. In England, it became a video nasty.IMDB - Night School - Alternate Versions The film has developed a small cult following among slasher fans, and was given its first DVD release by Warner Archive with a remastered transfer in 2011. Plot Anne Barron is a teacher's aide at a daycare center in Boston. One evening, she is relaxing on the playground carousel when someone pulls up on a motorcycle, wearing a black motorcycle helmet. She is startled as the stranger pulls out a kukri and starts spinning the carousel. The terrified Anne goes around until the kukri hits her. Lt. Judd Austin is the policeman assigned to the case. As he gets to the scene, he sees the girl decapitated with her head in a nearby bucket. The distraught director of the center tells Judd that Anne worked there during the day and was attending night classes at Wendall College. At the hospital, Judd and his partner Taj discuss a similar case from the previous week, in which another girl was found decapitated with her head in a pond. They wonder if there's any connection between the two murders. At Wendell, the administrator Helene Griffin tells Judd that Anne was close to a girl named Kim Morrison. When asked if Anne had a boyfriend, Kim tells Judd that Anne was indeed involved with someone, but she doesn't know who. Judd enters Professor Millett's anthropology class to speak with him about Anne. The professor doesn't provide much information, but he introduces Judd to an exchange student named Eleanor Adjai. Eleanor leaves the school and goes to the local diner. There, she is creeped out by Gary, the busboy who appears to have mental issues. The waitress Carol asks Eleanor if she's in Millett's class and implies that he sleeps around, irritating Eleanor and she leaves. Gary follows her home. When she realizes this, she runs the rest of the way and quickly locks her door. She gets into the shower but someone tries to break in. Frightened, she gets out of the shower, only to find that it's Professor Millett, her boyfriend who had been locked out by accident. Kim works at the local aquarium. About to leave work, she takes off her diving suit and is decapitated by the figure in a motorcycle helmet. A woman who was previously looking at the turtles screams after she sees Kim's head fall into the tank. Judd pays a visit to Professor Millett and is surprised to see Eleanor, who explains that she is his research assistant. Judd then informs Millett that a second student of his has been killed and asks him if he has had any affairs with his pupils. Annoyed by the question, Millett tells Judd to leave. Eleanor and Millett get into an argument and she goes to the diner to be alone. The professor follows her, and she tells him that she is three months pregnant. He's sympathetic, although he still manages to flirt with Carol. After the diner has closed, Carol is left to clean up. When the power goes out, she heads to the basement to investigate. The killer appears and attacks her. Carol escapes, but is then caught in an alley and killed. The next day, Carol's head is found in a water- filled sink and her body in a dumpster. Judd and Taj go to Gary' house since he is now considered a prime suspect, but Judd doesn't believe he was involved. When Judd goes to Professor Millett's home again, he finds a collection of skulls taken from tribal headhunters from around the world. Eleanor doesn't see anything wrong with this. At Wendell, Helene tells Millett to stop sleeping around with his students and counsels student Kathy, who confesses that she too has been intimate with the professor. Helene invites the girl to spend the night at her house, resulting in the two sleeping together. Helene is killed when she gets up to answer the phone, and Kathy is killed shortly after discovering Helene's head in the toilet. Judd is on his way to speak to Helene when he sees the killer fleeing. He chases the killer to Professor Millett's apartment. Inside, the killer is revealed to be Eleanor. She confesses the killings to her boyfriend and justifies the crimes by comparing them to tribal rituals he teaches in his courses. As the police are approaching, Millett puts on the helmet and flees on his motorcycle to divert the suspicion from Eleanor. During a chase with Judd and Taj, Millett is struck by a car and killed. Eleanor attends his burial and the police believe the case has been solved, although it is implied that Judd suspects Eleanor was the killer and Millett sacrificed his life to protect her. However, the case is closed and Eleanor moves back to England. Cast *Rachel Ward as Eleanor Adjai *Leonard Mann as Lt. Judd Austin *Drew Snyder as Vincent Millett *Joseph R.

It was the second feature film to be near-exclusively shot in Boston, after The Brink's Job. The final sequence however, tacked on after principal photography, was filmed in New York City. Producer Ruth Avergon recalled of working with director Ken Hughes: \\"Ken had enormous energy ... I just loved working with him. He was a joy to work with. He really knew what he was doing. There wasn't a lot of second guessing. He knew what shots had to be taken for our budget. The production value that he gave us, along with Mark Irwin [cinematographer], was wonderful. I thought they really captured a nice look for the film.\\" ReleaseCritical response= Vincent Canby of The New York Times dismissed the film as \\"a not very scary story\\" in a short review. Variety called it \\"a low budget exercise in terror offering very little diversion or novelty for fans of the already gutted 'psychotic slasher' genre.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"aspires to something more, but ends up falling back on a half-dozen decapitations and the grizzly uncovering of the victims' heads.\\" He added, \\"If the script is a little faulty and obvious, Mark Irwin's cinematography almost makes up for it. Irwin works with a subtle palette and his 1981 Boston is suffused with the vivid dampness and ember glow of Jack the Ripper's London (without the fog).\\"Harrington, Richard (September 12, 1981). \\"Heads of the Class\\". The Washington Post. B7. Robert Brown of The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \\"Basic shortcomings in writing, performances and direction, combined with the unnerving relish with which the film carves up its hapless female victims, allow little scope for either genuine horror or a parody of the same.\\" George Anderson of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the film \\"one of the tamest ... horror flicks to date.\\" Retrospective assessment has noted the film's mixture of slasher films with Italian gialli films and police procedurals. Film scholar Adam Rockoff deemed the film \\"grim\\" and one of the \\"slickest-looking slasher\\" films. =Home media= Night School was released on DVD-R through the Warner Archive Collection on November 2, 2011. On October 24, 2017, Warner Archive released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in a remastered transfer. =Alternative titles= The film was initially released in Spain under the title Psicosis 2, in an attempt to mislead the public into assuming this was a sequel to Psycho two years before the actual sequel came out. This was part of a similar trend in Spain and Italy; other examples are films deceptively titled Alien 2, Tibur√≥n 3 (literally Jaws 3) or La Casa 3, standing for a third sequel to The Evil Dead.

This rock stratum is present below ground in much of West Virginia and neighboring Kentucky, and extends somewhat into adjacent western Maryland and southwestern Virginia. The name derives from the Greenbrier River in West Virginia. Greenbrier Limestone is in some places more than 400 feet (120 metres) thick, allowing it to trap large quantities of oil and gas. Since this carbonate rock erodes quickly in the region's wet climate, outcrops are not prominent and are often quarried. The Greenbrier Limestone is subdivided into six stratigraphic units. In ascending order, they are Denmar Limestone, Taggard Shale, Pickaway Limestone, Union Limestone, Greenville Shale, and Alderson Limestone. The limestones in this interval are predominantly skeletal grainstones or packstones. The Pickaway and especially the Union contain oolitic grainstones.

United States, 357 U.S. 301 (1958), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that one could not lawfully be arrested in one's home by officers breaking in without first giving one notice of their authority and purpose.. Background At 1:35 a.m., on March 25, 1955, Federal Bureau of Narcotics agents, serving an arrest warrant, arrested a heroin user, Clifford Reed, on a public street in Washington, DC, for various offences related to narcotics. While in custody, Reed informed federal narcotics agents that he had purchased 100 capsules of morphine from a drug dealer, Arthur R. Shepherd, via a middleman, William Miller, who was 17 years old at the time. Miller had had several run-ins with the law and had been convicted of a narcotics offence in 1953. Reed told agents that he was to meet Shepherd in the later morning hours to make another purchase. The agents then enlisted Reed to aid in the capture of Miller and Shepherd. Later, at about 3:00 a.m., an undercover agent carrying $100 in marked currency went to Shepherd's home with Reed by taxicab. Reed introduced the agent to Shepherd as a buyer. The agent gave Shepherd the money, and Shepherd promised that another 100 capsules would be procured from Miller and delivered to the agent's home. Shepherd went by taxi to Miller's apartment. The taxi was monitored by federal agents, along with Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police officers. Shepherd got out of the taxi and went into the apartment, which Miller shared with a woman, Bessie Byrd, who was involved in the operation. He entered the basement to remove the drugs from storage, but federal agents could not observe him there. A few minutes later, he came out of the basement and re-entered the cab. Shepherd was going back to Reed's apartment when the police officers pulled the car over, and he was then arrested and searched. The currency that was given to him by the agent was not found on his person, but he admitted to the officers that the 100 capsules of morphine found on the passenger seat were put there by him after the cab was pulled over. He claimed that the package of capsules was behind a fire extinguisher in the basement hallway, where he was sent by a \\"fellow\\" with Reed, who had promised him $10 for retrieving it. The federal agents and police then returned to Miller's apartment. At about 3:45, they knocked on the door, and a low voice was heard, saying, \\"Who's there?\\" The reply was \\"Police.\\" Miller opened the door, leaving the door chain on and asked what their purpose was. When the agent and officer did not respond, he attempted to close the door. According to the officer, \\"He took one look at me and tried to slam the door, at which time I grabbed the door and opened it. We put our hands inside the door and pulled and ripped the chain off.\\" They did not have a search warrant or an arrest warrant, and they did not demand admission into the home or express their purpose. Miller was not arrested until they entered his apartment. Bessie Byrd was arrested, and $34 of the money that Shepherd had been given was found on her person. During a search of the apartment, the remaining $66 was found, part in a hatbox in the closet and part under the covers of a bed. Trial and appeals Byrd, Shepherd, and Miller were charged with conspiracy to commit violations and violations of federal narcotics laws. At first, all three filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing that it was seized without probable cause. The trial court denied the motion, and they were convicted of all charges. They then appealed to The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which upheld their conviction: : That these facts spelled out probable cause to arrest Shepherd cannot be doubted. Shepherd did not deny one iota of the testimony which established the commission of the offence in the presence of the officers. His own statement putting him in the very place where the information of the officers attributable to Reed indicated he would go, together with what the officers had observed and the plan which was in process under their surveillance, brought the case squarely within the Court's ruling in the Scher case, and our own Shettel case. : Moreover, viewing the case as a whole, neither Shepherd nor his co-accused were helped when the only defence testimony identified him as a brother of Mrs. Byrd who admitted Shepherd to the apartment [100 U.S.App.D.C. 306] that morning. Both Miller and Mrs. Byrd denied to the officers that Shepherd had been at their apartment, but at the trial, a different version developed The only defence witness, Octavia Walker, said she and another woman and Mrs. Byrd, sometime after 1 A.M. went to a night club for drinks. Returning after 2 A.M. to the Byrd-Miller apartment, she said Miller was asleep, and the three women went into the kitchen to fix a 'snack.' About 2:30 A.M. Shepherd appeared, came into the kitchen and handed his sister $100 for 'safe-keeping,' saying it was money he had won gambling. After a brief stay, Shepherd left. Shepherd, even by the defence had definitely been placed in the apartment with Miller and Mrs. Byrd and with $100 which he left there. Perhaps neither judge nor jury believed he won the money gambling. : There is no substance to the claimed errors with reference to the conspiracy or the instruction as to 'aiding and abetting.' There was no merger of the substantive offences, indeed, they were separate and distinct, while the general agreement among the appellants was clearly deducible from the evidence and could be deemed to be continuous and persisting. : Nor is there merit to the claim that the argument by Government counsel so prejudiced the appellants that a fair trial was denied. Nor only was there a current failure then to object, but upon review we are satisfied there was no error. : What has been or will be said as to the facts will make clear that there is only one question in this case. Miller and Mrs. Byrd in advance of trial moved to suppress the use of the marked money, claiming it had been illegally seized. The seizure in turn depends upon the validity of their arrest. The supporting affidavit offered by these two appellants recited in part: :: 'That at about four (4) o'clock, A.M., on the morning of March 25, 1955, they were awakened in their apartment, located at Columbia Road, N.W., Washington, D.C., by the noise created by someone breaking in a doorway in the hallway, leading to their apartment (only), and that upon his cracking his door (with a chain thereon), to ascertain the origin of said noise, that officers Wilson, Pappas and four others did break the chain off of the door, and forcibly enter his apartment.' : Just what happened in exact detail at the doorway to apartment #1 and precisely what was said by the respective participants cannot be determined conclusively from the record before us. The whole episode must have involved only a few seconds. At the hearing on the motion, the only witnesses called, Officer Wurms and Agent Wilson, testified that Officer Wurms knocked on Miller's door, and when a voice from inside asked 'Who's there?', Wurms answered, 'Blue, police.' Miller opened the door and looked out. The officers immediately recognized him and Miller recognized them. 'Did he say anything when he opened the door?' 'Yes, sir, he didn't want to let us in.' 'What were his words?' 'I can't recall, but he wanted to know what we were doing there.' Miller tried to close the door. Officer Wurms tried to keep it open. 'He took one look at me and tried to slam the door, at which time I grabbed the door and opened it.' The door was not broken, but a door chain was.\\" Decision In a 7-2 majority opinion authored by Justice William Brennan, with a concurrence by Justice John M. Harlan, the Court ruled that the arrest and conviction of all three petitioners violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court's reasoning was that the statutory requirements of law enforcement having to notify a suspect of their authority and purpose were not met. Furthermore, Miller's reaction was reasonable, as the officers did not notify him of their purpose and authority. The mere fact that he attempted to shut the door on them did not necessarily mean that he already knew why they were at his house. The officers could not break the door down and arrest Miller because Miller did not receive any notice in the first place, making the arrest unlawful and the evidence the fruits of an illegal search: : But, first, the fact that petitioner attempted to close the door did not of itself prove that he knew their purpose to arrest him. It was an ambiguous act. It could have been merely the expected reaction of any citizen having this experience at that hour of the morning, particularly since it does not appear that the officers were in uniform, cf. Accarino v. United States, supra, 85 U.S.App.D.C. at 403, 179 F.2d at 465, and the answer \\"Police\\" was spoken \\"in a low voice,\\" and might not have been heard by the petitioner, so far as the officers could tell. : Second, petitioner's reaction upon opening the door could only have created doubt in the officers' minds that he knew they were police intent on arresting him. On the motion to suppress, Agent Wilson testified that \\"he wanted to know what we were doing there.\\" This query, which went unanswered, is, on its face, inconsistent with knowledge. The majority of the Court of Appeals denied the import of the query by inferring that Miller knew Wilson and Wurms personally and recognized them as soon as he opened the door. That inference has no support in the record. But, even if this inference were supportable, Miller's recognition of Wilson and Wurms as police officers would not have justified them, in light of other facts known to them, in being virtually certain that Miller actually knew the reason for their presence. The officers knew that petitioner was unaware of Shepherd's arrest; they knew that he was unaware that the currency was marked; they knew that he was unaware that their presence was pursuant to a plan, initiated by Reed's disclosures, to catch the petitioner in a criminal act. Moreover, they did not actually know that petitioner had made a sale to Shepherd and received the marked money, for Shepherd had not talked, and had not been seen to enter petitioner's apartment. The fact that the marked money was found in the apartment has no bearing upon the petitioner's knowledge of the officers' purpose, since he did not know that the money was marked. This Court said in United States v. Di Re, supra, at 332 U. S. 595: :: \\"We have had frequent occasion to point out that a search is not to be made legal by what it turns up. In law, it is good or bad when it starts, and does not change character from its success.\\" : The most that can be said is that the petitioner's act in attempting to close the door might be the basis for the officers being virtually certain that the petitioner knew there were police at his door conducting an investigation. This, however, falls short of a virtual certainty that the petitioner knew of their purpose to arrest him. The requirement is not met except by notice of that purpose, for the Government admits that the officers had no authority to break the petitioner's door except to arrest him. We must, therefore, conclude that the petitioner did not receive the required notice of authority and purpose. : We are duly mindful of the reliance that society must place for achieving law and order upon the enforcing agencies of the criminal law. But insistence on observance by law officers of traditional fair procedural requirements is, from the long point of view, best calculated to contribute to that end. However much in a particular case insistence upon such rules may appear as a technicality that inures to the benefit of a guilty person, the history of the criminal law proves that tolerance of shortcut methods in law enforcement impairs its enduring effectiveness. The requirement of prior notice of authority and purpose before forcing entry into a home is deeply rooted in our heritage, and should not be given grudging application. Congress, codifying a tradition embedded in Anglo-American law, has declared in ¬ß 3109 the reverence of the law for the individual's right of privacy in his house. Every householder, the good and the bad, the guilty and the innocent, is entitled to the protection designed to secure the common interest against unlawful invasion of the house. The petitioner could not be lawfully arrested in his home by officers breaking in without first giving him notice of their authority and purpose. Because the petitioner did not receive that notice before the officers broke the door to invade his home, the arrest was unlawful, and the evidence seized should have been suppressed. =Clark's dissent= Justice Tom C. Clark dissented, which Justice Harold H. Burton joined, expounding that the Court of Appeals had concluded that Miller knew what purpose the agent and the officer were there for, and he was attempting to destroy evidence by slamming the door. He also argued that slamming the door on officers was not a \\"normal homeowner's reaction\\" and that the Court ignored the \\"exigent circumstances\\" that was presented in the initial encounter. He wrote that the Court of Appeals: : agreed with the trial judge \\"that the attempt of the officers to arrest Miller at his doorway under the circumstances of this case was not unreasonable,\\" and found that the breaking of the door chain \\"in the course of his resistance [was] immaterial, and his arrest, immediately made, was justified.\\" 100 U.S.App.D.C. at 310, 244 F.2d at 758. Concluding that Miller without doubt was aware both of the officers' identity and purpose, the court upheld the refusal of the trial court to suppress the evidence, and found the proof of guilt \\"overwhelming and unanswerable.\\" : The majority, however, brushes aside these conclusions, explaining petitioner's action in slamming the door as \\"the expected reaction of any citizen.\\" This is something entirely foreign to my concept of the respect a law-abiding citizenry pays to its law enforcement officers. Nor can I accept the conclusion of the Court that the circumstances found by the Court of Appeals fall \\"short of a virtual certainty that the petitioner knew of [the officers'] purpose to arrest him.\\" His knowledge -- in the absence of an express admission by him -- can never be a \\"virtual certainty.\\" Rather than attempting to psychoanalyze petitioner, we should measure his understanding by his outward acts. The Court of Appeals found that they indisputably established petitioner's awareness of the police purpose. We should not disturb that finding. : The majority does not deal with the \\"exigent circumstances\\" of the case, because the Government makes no claim for thus \\"excusing compliance\\" with the statute. The Court of Appeals expressly based its opinion on the fact that the officers \\"were confronted by the need for a decision arising from the necessitous circumstances of the situation.\\" The position of the Government does not excuse us from evaluating the circumstances of the whole case. I believe that the Court of Appeals was eminently correct in its conclusion that \\"necessitous circumstances\\" here warranted the officers in entering the apartment. As that court pointed out, petitioner might have fled or hidden himself or destroyed the fruits of his crime, particularly in view of his background and the visit of his brother-in- law Shepherd only a few moments before. Certainly he soon would have learned of Shepherd's arrest. Moreover, his attempt to forcibly prevent the entry of the officers into his apartment required their immediate action. Any delay might well have precluded the arrest. Destruction of the marked money might have prevented the establishment of petitioner's guilt. As the Government points out, \\"split-second action [was] necessary.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 357 *Ker v.

Early life McEntee was born in Perth, Western Australia, and went to Christ Church Grammar School. Mother Lode During the early-1970s (exact year needed) Mark (Guitar & Vocals) teamed up with Howard Shawcross (Bass Guitar & Vocals), Peter Nelson (Drums) and formed the band \\"Mother Lode\\".

Howard and Mark share writing credits on the \\"A\\" side while Mark has solo writing credit for the \\"B\\" side. Pressed in Australia by the ASTOR Record Label (Run off wax # MA-7143) it came in a paper sleeve with a full band credit description for both sides. Recorded at Armstrong Studios in Perth, Western Australia, this particular and important early career single was pressed in very limited quantities and little is known about the life span of the band or other particulars of the group's recording or gig history. Due to the diverse and localized music scenes in various Australian metro areas this single was more than likely only distributed in the Perth/Western Australia area. (more information needed) (Record information sourced from the original vinyl single & sleeve from a private collection) Air Supply Prior to joining Divinyls, McEntee worked on the 1975 Australian production of Jesus Christ Superstar, where he met Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell who were performing in the musical. Hitchcock and Russell went on to form soft rock group Air Supply, and McEntee was part of the group's original line-up, along with Chrissie Hammond and Jeremy Paul. Divinyls McEntee was introduced to Chrissy Amphlett by Paul at a music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, Australia, with an intention to write songs and form a band that would be fronted by Amphlett. The three met again at a choral concert at the Sydney Opera House, where Amphlett and Paul were performing. In 1980, they formed the Divinyls, along with Bjarne Ohlin and drummer Richard Harvey. McEntee had played alongside Richard Harvey and Ian Belton in The Malcolm McCallum Band prior to forming Divinyls. In May 2001, the Divinyls' song \\"Science Fiction\\", written by Amphlett and McEntee, was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Amphlett and McEntee barely spoke after the band separated in 1996, but resumed contact when they were inducted into the 2006 ARIA Hall of Fame. The band performed at the induction ceremony, and eventually announced a new tour and album.Divinyls, Countdown (ABC TV) The reunited band toured in late 2006 and released a new single called \\"Don't Wanna Do This\\". In December 2018, McEntee announced the reformation of the Divinyls for an Australian tour to take place in early 2019, however the tour was cancelled several months later due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\", with the promoter's spokesperson declining to comment if the reason was low ticket sales. Personal life McEntee and Divinyls bandmate Chrissy Amphlett were romantically involved from 1982 to 1993. They had met in 1980, and began a relationship two years later when McEntee had split up with his first wife. Their relationship was highly volatile ‚Äì marred with drug and alcohol use and physical fights. However, the band's manager, Vince Lovegrove, later stated that the nature of their \\"weird\\" relationship was the \\"magic of Divinyls\\". As of 2013, McEntee lives on the outskirts of Perth with his partner, fashion designer Melanie Greensmith. The pair ran a clothing label, Wheels & Dollbaby, until Greensmith closed the business in 2017. McEntee also runs a small business called Macca's Vintage Aerodrome, that sells World War I and Pioneer radio-controlled aircraft.

Some services also operated in the Staffordshire area. History The company was originally started as Liyell Ltd trading as Midland Choice Travel established by ex-London Forest manager Tom Young and business partner Barrie Marsden in 1992 with two Leyland Leopard coaches and three Leyland Nationals in a lime green and yellow livery, from which the company got its name (LIme green YELLow). They first operated from a depot on Watery Lane, Willenhall owned by a Howell Galvanisers. The first bus services operated were route 171 (Walsall - Leamore - Bloxwich - Mossley, and route 700 (Perton - Codsall High School). The original intention had been to develop services in either Leicester or Telford but the directors were persuaded that the core of the new bus service network would best be the most lucrative route lifted from a major plan to develop and expand Midland Red North operations into the Black Country, route 171. \\"Midland Choice Travel\\", as the company was originally known, recruited ex-London Forest manager Steve Deveraux and Trent Buses manager Keith Shayshutt. Over the next few years the business thrived; during the 1993 West Midlands Travel bus strike a fleet of 30 buses were hired from across the country to cover services. Soon after the strikes finished, Liyell dropped the \\"Midland\\" part of the Choice Travel name with an enlarged logo. During the late 1990s, Choice Travel acquired the business of Metropolitan Omnibus (formed by a group of former Stevensons managers) and its network of routes throughout the Black Country on former Stevensons routes. The Metropolitan fleet of Mercedes and Dodge mini and midibuses soon sported the smart yellow of Choice, with the lime green and dark green exchanged for contrasting shades of blue. Former Stevensons MD and Metropolitan manager Julian Peddle bought a share in the company and it joined his \\"Status Bus & Coach Group\\" in 1999. As part of Choice Travel's commitment to public transport development, it embarked on a new partnership with Centro and Travel West Midlands to launch the new Showcase route branded \\"Superline\\". Superline ran along the main arterial route between Walsall-Leamore-Bloxwich and Mossley, using their own respective service numbers (Choice 171 and TWM 301). To demonstrate their commitment to the venture, Choice purchased four new low-floor Optare Excel buses for the route, displacing existing buses to other routes. Choice became the target of another buy-out when it was acquired by Stoke-on-Trent based D&G; Bus. This enabled Choice to further update its fleet with newer low floor Dennis Darts (sporting Plaxton, East Lancs and Marshall bodies) and some mid life Mercedes- Benz midibuses. A new livery of D&G; cream and blue was initially used. In March 2009, fellow Walsall and Wolverhampton bus operator A2Z Travel had its licence revoked. At the time, they operated numerous routes with over thirty buses in the area, many of behalf of Centro. An agreement was struck at the last minute, which saw several of A2Z's routes and buses transfer to Choice Travel in Wednesfield, in addition to the Operations Manager of A2Z. Any trace of A2Z Travel was removed and replaced with the new fleetname of Midland. Initially, this was used just on former A2Z route, but in mid-2009 it was decided to adopt this as the new fleetname. This coincided with a new look for the whole D&G; brand, of a two-tone red livery. A concentrated effort was then launched to repaint the whole fleet and install digital destination equipment in all buses, something which was completed by 2010. As part of this scheme, buses have also started being refurbished into a special Midland moquette. In March 2010, Midland obtained the operations and most buses of Oldbury based bus company Midland Rider. Operations were transferred to the Wednesfield depot, where for a short period the companies' operations were kept apart. Most of the Midland Rider buses however were not low floor and were soon withdrawn, with all Midland Rider services becoming Midland operated by the summer. Arriva takeover On 10 August 2012, it was announced that Midland had been acquired by Arriva Midlands. Midland's 110 staff will transfer to Arriva. Arriva plans to incorporate Midland's fleet of 61 buses into the Arriva fleet and operate it under the Arriva brand. The takeover came into effect on 23 September 2012. The Office of Fair Trading cleared the completed acquisition by Arriva Midlands North of the business and assets of Liyell trading as Midland in January 2013.http://www.stockmarketwire.com/article/4523589/OFT-clears-Arriva- Midlands-Liyell-deal.html Operations A Dennis Dart SLF of Choice Travel in blue and cream D&G; Bus and Coach livery The company was previously owned by Stoke-on-Trent based company D&G; Bus. The company also operates services in other parts of the West Midlands as well as Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire from its base in Wednesfield. The company operated mostly subsidised services, from Centro, Shropshire Council, Worcestershire County Council and Staffordshire County Council, with a handful of commercial routes operated. The company employed approximately 110 bus drivers. Fleet A Mercedes-Benz OH1416/Wright Urbanranger in Choice's original yellow and green livery in Wolverhampton As of June 2012, the fleet consisted of:Midland Bus - Fleet List * 41 Dennis Dart SLF (Bodied by Plaxton and Marshall) * 17 Optare Solo * 1 Optare Excel * 2 Dennis Trident 2(East Lancs Body) In the past the fleet was more varied. The original fleet consisted mostly of Leyland Nationals and Leopards, and Dodge minibuses were also popular. Choice's Managing Director, Tom Young, was never shy to experiment: unusual purchases were four Wright Urbanranger bodied Mercedes-Benz OH1416s, similar in body design to the comparable Endurance bodies on the Volvo B10B, and the fore- runner to the low floor version of the Mercedes-Benz O405, but which did not sell in large numbers following the advent of the low-floor bus. Young also purchased a pair of new step-entrance Northern Counties-bodied Dennis Darts for route 171; the ageing Leyland Nationals were withdrawn in favour of newer stock. The merger with Status Bus & Coach saw new types arrive, including Wright Handybus bodied Dennis Darts, Marshall bodied Dennis Falcons and former Ipswich Buses dual entrance Northern Counties bodied Dennis Falcons. Fleet additions in 2012 included two double-deck Dennis Trident 2 buses and three Scania OmniLinks, all from Nottingham City Transport. The OmniLinks were transferred to D&G; Bus, a sister company, in September 2012 in preparation for the takeover by Arriva.

She was one of the witnesses at the secret wedding ceremony of the King and Anne Boleyn which occurred on 25 January 1533. Family Anne was born in England sometime around 1496, although the exact date is not known. She was the only daughter of John Savage, Sheriff of Worcestershire, and his wife Anne Bostock. She had seven brothers, including Sir John Savage of Clifton.  Marriage and children  Anne married in April 1533, as his second wife, Thomas Berkeley, 6th Baron Berkeley (died 19 September 1534), son of Thomas Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley and Eleanor Constable. His first wife was Mary Hastings who died in early 1533 without having produced children. Their principal residence outside London was Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire. Thomas and Anne together had two children: * Elizabeth Berkeley (January 1534- 1 September 1582), married in 1559 as his first wife, Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, Lord Treasurer of Ireland and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth I of England. The marriage was childless and they separated in 1564. * Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley (26 November 1534- 26 November 1613), married firstly in September 1554 at Kenninghall, Norfolk, Catherine Howard, youngest daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Lady Frances de Vere. The marriage produced issue. He married secondly on 9 March 1597, Jane Stanhope. As lady-in-waiting Anne seems to have been a friend and close attendant of Anne Boleyn from before Anne's marriage to Henry VIII. Only four, or possibly five, witnesses attended the King's second wedding, and these included Anne.The Six Wives of Henry VIII, Alison Weir, p. 241; Anne Boleyn, E.W. Ives, p.211; Anne Boleyn, Joanna Denny, p.186; Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, v. no.327; The triumphant reigne of King Henry the VIII, Edward Hall, ii. p.222 This was on 25 January 1533, and was conducted in secrecy as Anne Boleyn was pregnant and Henry had not yet annulled his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Anne was said to have borne the train of Anne Boleyn at the wedding. Anne had been at court for several years and was a dependent of her brother John's widow, Elizabeth Savage, daughter of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester and a second cousin of Henry VIII, and Elizabeth's second husband, William Brereton. Brereton was then a groom of the Privy Chamber and one of the other guests at the secret royal wedding, along with Thomas Heneage and Henry Norris. Both Norris and Brereton would later be executed for alleged adultery with Anne Boleyn. With the fall of their allies, the Savages could have seen a decline in their fortunes, but it seems that they, and the newly widowed Elizabeth Savage, kept the friendship of Thomas Cromwell and therefore many of Brereton's estates were returned to his wife.Jane Boleyn:The Infamous Lady Rochford, Julia Fox, p.215-216 Anne was described as being of middling stature, with a comely, brown complexion, and much tender-hearted with her children.http://www.Tudorplace.com.ar Thomas Berkeley, Anne's husband, was one of several Boleyn allies who was created a Knight of the Bath at Anne Boleyn's coronation.Anne Boleyn, E.W.

Her royal mistress and companion, Anne Boleyn was executed less than two years later. Anne Savage died on an unknown date before 1546. In a letter to Cromwell dated 1 May 1535, Anne, then Dowager Baroness Berkeley: Complains of the delay of the master of the King's wards in sending out the writs concerning the office to be found after the decease of her husband.

He is considered one of the forerunners of the \\"Independent Foreign Policy\\", which sought to diversify Brazil's international relations and refused automatic alignments with any country or bloc. His concept of \\"Independent Foreign Policy\\" was based on the following objectives: total involvement in the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) and in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), with the aim of protecting the price of commodities and participating in the growth of international trade; disarmament and more peaceful competitive coexistence, as well as international economic cooperation for the growth of underdeveloped nations. The basic concept was that, whilst respecting the international norms of good practice, Brazil should retain the right to negotiate with all countries, in accordance with its own conventions. In 1943, San Tiago Dantas represented Brazil at the first Conference of Ministers of Education in the American Republics, in Panama. In 1951 he served as adviser to the Brazilian Delegation to the 4th Consultative Meeting of American Chief Ministers in Washington. In 1952 he became a member of the Permanent Arbitration Committee in The Hague. Between 1955 and 1958, he chaired the Inter-American Committee of Jurists, based in Rio de Janeiro.

The battle was actually a sudden attack on the Byzantine camp in the mountain gorge, which ended in the utter defeat of the Byzantine forces and the deaths of 7 of their commanders (strategoi). Following the defeat and retreat of the Byzantines, Vojislav ensured a future for Duklja without imperial authority,Cedrenus II, col. 275, and Duklja would soon emerge as the most significant Serb state. In memory of this victory, 7 October is commemorated as the day of the Military of Montenegro. Background Prior to the war, Duklja and the other principalities were subordinated to the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. However, around the start of the 11th century, Stefan Vojislav waged a series of successful attacks aimed at independence. The Byzantine army, led by the dux Michael, moved towards Duklja in order to suppress the revolts, and they set up camp in the area near Bar. Byzantine historian John Skylitzes described their invasion of Duklja (in Latin translation by Immanuel Bekker): { - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  Servis, ut fertur, dedita opera cedentibus ac intrare eum sinentibus, neque de reditu solicitum neque iusto praesidio angustias occupantem. ita ingressus campestria direptionibus incendiisque vastabat. at Servi fauces itinerum ac praerupta insidere et reditum eius praestolari.  :It is said that the Serbs had deliberately let them enter [Duklja], while he [Michael] took no care about their return, nor did he leave sufficiently strong guard in the gorges. After the incursion, he plundered and burned plains, while the Serbs took and kept the gorges and steep places along the road and waited for the return [of the Byzantine army]. } Battle Serbs massacre the Byzantines in the mountain passes, Madrid Skylitzes The battle took place in the mountainous area between Bar and Crmnica after midnight, on October 7, 1042. Prior to the battle a man from Bar entered the Byzantine camp and spread false information about a huge army, causing panic among the Byzantines. Stefan Vojislav, along with three of his sons, led the Serbs into battle. Their army slowly moved down the hills along with shouting and blowing horns and trumpets to exaggerate their size. The Byzantines, trapped in the mountainous area, were caught unprepared and after heavy fighting were routed. Some historical records say that two thirds of the Byzantine army were killed. Byzantine historian John Skylitzes (1040‚Äì1101) said that 60,000 Byzantines participated in the battle, but these records are considered inaccurate. Most historians agree that there were about 40,000 Byzantines. Serb numbers are unknown, but are considered to be greatly inferior to the Byzantines. Vojislav dispatched 50 Greeks to spread the news about it. The Strategikon described the outcome of the battle: { - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  ·ΩÅœÄŒø·øñŒøŒΩ ·ºêœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ§œÅŒπŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ Œ£Œ≠œÅŒ≤ŒøœÇ œÑ·ø∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÄŒ¨ŒΩœâ ŒîœÖœÅœÅŒ±œáŒØŒøœÖ ŒúŒπœáŒ±·Ω¥Œª œÑ·ø∑ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒøœÖ œÖ·º±·ø∑ Œµ·º∞œÇ ŒîŒπŒøŒ∫ŒªŒµŒØŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄœÄœéŒªŒµœÉŒµ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒ±·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºêœÄŒ≠Œ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÑŒµœÉœÉŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ± œáŒπŒªŒπŒ±Œ¥·ø∂ŒΩ ·ΩÑŒΩœÑŒ±.  :Thus the Travunian Serb [Vojislav] did in Duklja to the katepano of Dyrrhachium, Michael, son of logothete, and he destroyed his army that numbered more than 40,000. }  References  Category:Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty Category:Bar, Montenegro Category:Medieval Montenegro Category:1042 in Europe Bar Bar Category:Battles involving the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Battle of Bar"},{"id":"17941580","text":"Vladimir Zarev () (born 1947 in Sofia) is a contemporary Bulgarian novelist.

According to Ahmadiyya thought the name Yuz Asaf is of Buddhist derivation, and possibly from Yusu or Yehoshua (Jesus) and Asaf (the Gatherer). =Overview= Local Kashmiri traditions state that the Yuz Asaf was a prophet of Ahle-Kitab (People of the Book) whose real name was Isa ‚Äì the Quranic name for Jesus. The prophet Yuz Asaf came to Kashmir from the West (Holy Land) during the reign of Raja Gopdatta (c 1st century A.D) according to the ancient documents held by the current custodian of the tomb. According to Tarikh-i-Kashmir, a history of Kashmir written between 1579‚Äì1620, Yuzu Asaf was a Prophet of God who travelled to Kashmir from a foreign land. In 1747, a local Srinagar Sufi writer, Khwaja Muhammad Azam Didamari, stated that the Roza Bal is a shrine to a foreign prophet and prince, Youza Asouph. Ghulam Ahmad and Ahmadiyya belief Having stumbled upon research by Russian explorer Nicolas Notovitch, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, identified Yuz Asaf as the name that Jesus of Nazareth may have assumed following his crucifixion and migration from Israel. Ahmad further identified that the Roza Bal shrine located in Srinagar, Kashmir is the tomb of Jesus. These beliefs are discussed in the book Jesus in India, written by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. In these publications he proposed the belief that the tomb of Yuz Asaf in the Roza Bal shrine, located in the Khanyar district of Srinagar, Kashmir - was that of Jesus of Nazareth. Drawing on some Kashmiri oral traditions, as well as the Qur'an, Hadith, and accounts by explorers, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed that Jesus travelled eastwards to Srinagar, where he settled and married a woman called Maryam (Mary), and that Maryam bore Yuza Asif children, before he died aged 120 years. Ahmadiyya writers claim that Jesus' mother, Mary, is buried in the town Murree in Pakistan (see Mai Mari da Ashtan).Ahmaddiya magazine Review of Religions Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's use of various Hindu and Islamic sources have been deemed to be misunderstandings or distortions by various scholars of Buddhism including the Swedish scholar Per Beskow in Jesus in Kashmir: Historien om en legend (1981), the German indologist G√ºnter Gr√∂nbold, in Jesus in Indien - Das Ende einer Legende (1985) and Norbert Klatt, in Lebte Jesus in Indien?: Eine religionsgeschichtliche Kl√§rung (1988). Islamic views These views are considered to be blasphemous by the majority Sunni Islamic scholars and authorities who assert that Jesus is presently alive in Heaven. Local Muslim residents at the shrine believe Yuz Asaf was a Sufi saint. Indologist G√ºnter Gr√∂nbold in his Jesus in Indien assesses that the shrine was previously Hindu, before the Islamization of Kashmir and is possibly the grave of a Buddhist or Hindu saint rather than a Sufi, but either way has no connection with Jesus or with Christianity.Gr√∂nbold Jesus in Indien 1985 p.57 See also *Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam References ;Sources Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Srinagar Category:Kashmiri Sufi saints Category:Ahmadiyya ","title":"Yuz Asaf"},{"id":"17941621","text":"Jane Lambert is the former Australian High Commissioner to Malta with non- resident accreditation to Tunisia (2012-2016).

Proserpine, by Thomas Whitcombe. Admiral Lord Amelius Beauclerk (23 May 1771 ‚Äì 10 December 1846) was a Royal Navy officer. Early life Beauclerk was born on 23 May 1771, the third son of Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans (1740‚Äì1802) and his wife, the former Lady Catherine Ponsonby (1742‚Äì1789), daughter of William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough. He was baptised at St Marylebone Parish Church, London on 15 June 1771. He was entered on the books of the cutter in June 1782, and in 1783 was appointed to , bearing the flag of Vice-Admiral John Campbell on the Newfoundland Station. Afterwards he served in the West Indies under Commodore Gardner, and returned to England in 1789 as acting Lieutenant of . He was not confirmed as a Lieutenant until 21 September 1790, at the time of the Great Spanish Armament crisis. Promotion to captain In 1792 he went to the Mediterranean in the frigate , and on 16 September 1793 was made captain by Lord Hood and appointed to the command of (28 guns). In March 1794 he was transferred to (32 guns), and attached to the squadron under Admiral Hotham, blockading Toulon. Juno took part in the action of 14 March 1795, which resulted in the capture of the French ships and , and was one of the squadron, under Commodore Taylor, which convoyed the homeward trade in the following autumn, when the Censeur was recaptured by the French off Cape St Vincent on 7 October 1796. Frigate commands On his return to England, Lord Amelius was appointed to the frigate , of 44 guns and 251 men, and on the coast of Ireland, at the Action of 13 June 1796, captured the Proserpine, of 42 guns and 348 men, after a brilliant and well-managed action, in which Dryad lost only two killed and seven wounded, while Proserpine lost thirty killed and forty-five wounded. He also captured several privateers. In 1800 he was appointed to (40 guns), employed in the Channel and in attendance on the King at Weymouth. Ship-of-the-line commands Over the next ten years he commanded HM Ships , , and (all 74 guns) in the English Channel, and in 1809 had charge of the amphibious landing of Lord Chatham's army at Walcheren, and continued, during the operations on that coast, as second-in-command under Sir Richard Strachan. Admiral On 1 August 1811 he was promoted to rear- admiral, but during that and the two following years he continued in the North Sea, stretching in 1813 as far as the North Cape in command of a small squadron on the look-out for the American Commodore Rogers. In 1814 he commanded in the Basque Roads, and conducted the negotiations for the local suspension of hostilities. On 12 August 1819 he was advanced to vice-admiral, and from 1824 to 1827 was Commander-in-Chief at Lisbon and on the coast of Portugal. He became a full admiral on 22 July 1830, and was Commander-in- Chief, Plymouth from 1836 to 1839. Beauclerk was a fine professional officer who benefited from his family connections to secure early promotion. Port Beauclerc, Point Amelius, Point St. Albans, Beauclerc Island, Beauclerc Peak and Amelius Island, all in Alaska, are named for him. He died, unmarried, at his seat, Winchfield House, near Farnborough, Hampshire, on 10 December 1846. Honours and achievements Beauclerk became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1809, and was given the honorary rank of Colonel of Marines on 31 July 1810. He was appointed to the KCB on 2 January 1815, GCH on 29 March 1831, GCB on 4 August 1835, and First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to King William IV on 4 August 1839.

He flew for Cathay Pacific from 1989 until his death in 2005. Before flying for Cathay Pacific he flew for Missionary Aviation Fellowship in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. He also flew agricultural aircraft in South Australia and New South Wales.  Dive equipment  Shaw's first rebreather was an Inspiration closed circuit rebreather, with which he eventually dived to depths beyond its purported capability. This prompted him to not only purchase a Mk15.5 but to replace its analogue electronics with the digital ones of the Juergensen Marine Hammerhead, resulting in a specially modified POD designed to handle extreme pressures. The Mk15.5 was his rebreather of choice for dives deeper than . For extended dives in caves shallower than 150 m, Shaw used his Cis-Lunar since he believed it had superior redundancy capabilities but could not cope with extreme depths.  Diving records  On 28 October 2004, Shaw broke the following records at Bushman's Hole, South Africa: * Depth on a rebreather * Depth in a cave on a rebreather * Depth at altitude on a rebreather * Depth running a line He used a Mk15.5 with Juergensen Marine Hammerhead electronics and the following gas mixtures: trimix 4/80, 10/70, 15/55, 17/40, 26/25, air, nitrox50, 100% oxygen. The cave elevation was and the dive duration was 9 hours 40 minutes. On this record-breaking dive, Shaw discovered the body of Deon Dreyer, a South African diver who had died in Bushman's Hole ten years previously. The body was at a depth of .  Last dive  Shaw died on 8 January 2005 while endeavoring to recover the body of Deon Dreyer. Shaw recorded his dive with an underwater camera, which allowed researchers to determine that he suffered from respiratory issues due to the high pressure. Shaw ran into difficulties when the body unexpectedly began to float. Shaw had been advised by various experts that the body would remain negatively buoyant because the visible parts were reduced to the skeleton. However, within his wetsuit, Dreyer's corpse had turned into a soap-like substance called adipocere, which floats. Shaw had been working with both hands, and so had been resting his can light on the cave floor. The powerful underwater lights that cave divers use are connected by wires to heavy battery canisters, normally worn on the cave diver's waist, or sometimes attached to their tanks. Normally he would have wrapped the wire behind his neck, but he was unable to do so; the lines from the body bag appear to have become entangled with the light head, and the physical effort of trying to free himself led to his death. Three days later, both of the bodies floated up to near the surface as the dive team was retrieving their equipment.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVZ_XAXUWlw The dive on which Shaw died was the 333rd of his career. At the time of his world record setting dive, he had been diving for a little over five years.  Personal life  Shaw was a devout Christian. He and his wife, Ann, lived in Hong Kong, where they were members of a small Christian congregation.Diving into Darkness, pp. 2, 25.

The Book of Lemmas is a book attributed to Archimedes by ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra, though the authorship of the book is questionable. It consists of fifteen propositions (lemmas) on circles. HistoryTranslations= The Book of Lemmas was first introduced in Arabic by ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra; he attributed the work to Archimedes. In 1661, the Arabic manuscript was translated into Latin by Abraham Ecchellensis and edited by Giovanni A. Borelli. The Latin version was published under the name Liber Assumptorum. T. L. Heath translated Heiburg's Latin work into English in his The Works of Archimedes. =Authorship= The original authorship of the Book of Lemmas has been in question because in proposition four, the book refers to Archimedes in third person; however, it has been suggested that it may have been added by the translator. Another possibility is that the Book of Lemmas may be a collection of propositions by Archimedes later collected by a Greek writer. New geometrical figures The Book of Lemmas introduces several new geometrical figures. =Arbelos= The arbelos is the shaded region (grey). Archimedes first introduced the arbelos in proposition four of his book: The figure is used in propositions four through eight. In propositions five, Archimedes introduces the Archimedes's twin circles, and in proposition eight, he makes use what would be the Pappus chain, formally introduced by Pappus of Alexandria. =Salinon= The salinon is the blue shaded region. Archimedes first introduced the salinon in proposition fourteen of his book: Archimedes proved that the salinon and the circle are equal in area. Propositions #If two circles touch at A, and if CD, EF be parallel diameters in them, ADF is a straight line. #Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and let the tangents to it at B and at any other point D on it meet in T. If now DE be drawn perpendicular to AB, and if AT, DE meet in F, then DF = FE. #Let P be any point on a segment of a circle whose base is AB, and let PN be perpendicular to AB. Take D on AB so that AN = ND. If now PQ be an arc equal to the arc PA, and BQ be joined, then BQ, BD shall be equal. #If AB be the diameter of a semicircle and N any point on AB, and if semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AN, BN as diameters respectively, the figure included between the circumferences of the three semicircles is \\"what Archimedes called Œ±œÅŒ≤Œ∑ŒªŒøœÇ\\"; and its area is equal to the circle on PN as diameter, where PN is perpendicular to AB and meets the original semicircle in P. #Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, C any point on AB, and CD perpendicular to it, and let semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AC, CB as diameters. Then if two circles be drawn touching CD on different sides and each touching two of the semicircles, the circles so drawn will be equal. #Let AB, the diameter of a semicircle, be divided at C so that AC = 3/2 √ó CB [or in any ratio]. Describe semicircles within the first semicircle and on AC, CB as diameters, and suppose a circle drawn touching the all three semicircles. If GH be the diameter of this circle, to find relation between GH and AB. #If circles are circumscribed about and inscribed in a square, the circumscribed circle is double of the inscribed square. #If AB be any chord of a circle whose centre is O, and if AB be produced to C so that BC is equal to the radius; if further CO meets the circle in D and be produced to meet the circle the second time in E, the arc AE will be equal to three times the arc BD. #If in a circle two chords AB, CD which do not pass through the centre intersect at right angles, then (arc AD) + (arc CB) = (arc AC) + (arc DB). #Suppose that TA, TB are two tangents to a circle, while TC cuts it. Let BD be the chord through B parallel to TC, and let AD meet TC in E. Then, if EH be drawn perpendicular to BD, it will bisect it in H. #If two chords AB, CD in a circle intersect at right angles in a point O, not being the centre, then AO2 \\\\+ BO2 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ DO2 = (diameter)2. #If AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and TP, TQ the tangents to it from any point T, and if AQ, BP be joined meeting in R, then TR is perpendicular to AB. #If a diameter AB of a circle meet any chord CD, not a diameter, in E, and if AM, BN be drawn perpendicular to CD, then CN = DM. #Let ACB be a semicircle on AB as diameter, and let AD, BE be equal lengths measured along AB from A, B respectively. On AD, BE as diameters describe semicircles on the side towards C, and on DE as diameter a semicircle on the opposite side. Let the perpendicular to AB through O, the centre of the first semicircle, meet the opposite semicircles in C, F respectively. Then shall the area of the figure bounded by the circumferences of all the semicircles be equal to the area of the circle on CF as diameter. #Let AB be the diameter of a circle., AC a side of an inscribed regular pentagon, D the middle point of the arc AC. Join CD and produce it to meet BA produced in E; join AC, DB meeting in F, and Draw FM perpendicular to AB. Then EM = (radius of circle).

The district is mainly residential in character, and includes Davis Park, a triangular park created in 1890 and bounded by Main, Reynolds, and Broad Streets. The district as a whole is in size. It includes examples of Stick/Eastlake, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival architectural styles and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It includes 95 contributing buildings, one contributing site, and four contributing objects. A house on Broad Street The district is significant for its architecture, which includes many examples of Victorian architecture with rich detailing. The buildings in the district also reflect the institutions and people responsible with the development of Danielson. The town's growth began in 1809, when brothers James and Hezekiah Danielson built a cotton spinning mill. The house of Hezekiah, built about 1825, is the oldest building in the district. The village's growth was further fueled by other textile mills, the completion of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad through town in 1830, the establishment of other businesses, and the expansion of the textile mills from the 1850s onward. The houses in the Broad Street-Davis Park area were built by middle and upper-class residents, who chose the latest architectural styles and built large houses. The area also was above the river terrace, providing fine views and flood protection. and It includes the Old Killingly High School building, which is separately listed on the National Register, and two churches: the 1891 Gothic St. Alban's Church, and the 1960s Baptist Church, the latter of which is not historically significant.

Located in the vicinity of the crossing of Putnam Road and the Five Mile River, the area is the site of one of the earliest textile mills in Connecticut. The mills burned in 1861 and were not rebuilt, ending the village's economic reason to exist. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The entire site was purchased in 2015 by a historic building expert who has put the original parcel back together. It is now private property. The area was settled in the early 18th-century, and has an industrial history dating to the 18th century, when a gristmill known as Talbot's Mill was operating at the site. In 1814, local landowners combined with investors from Rhode Island to establish a cotton mill at the site. It was first known as Howe's Factory, after its managers, and was acquired by the Daniels family in 1845. By this time, the village had grown to include a store, blacksmith's shop, at least nine buildings for worker housing, and three separate mill buildings. The mill buildings burned in 1861, and were not rebuilt. The Daniels family sold the property in 1888, and its remnants were reduced to ruins by the early 20th century. Visible elements of the site include the early 19th century stone dam, and the stone house at the corner of Putnam and Stone Roads.

Main Streets in the town of Brooklyn (extending partly into the town of Killingly) in Windham County, Connecticut. The district encompasses a well-preserved 19th-century mill village. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The district is primarily located within the census-designated place of East Brooklyn and is within the village of Quebec.A map of the NRIS polygon vertices overlaid on a Census Bureau map shows that the district is located within and at the eastern edge of the East Brooklyn CDP. It consists of the weave shed built by the Quinebaug Mill Company and the surrounding residential area known as Quebec village.Hill Towns and Mill Villages , Quinebaug-Shetucket Heritage Corridor, Inc. The residential portions of the village are characterized by rows of brick mill worker housing, some in long rows of attached housing units, others in smaller combinations housing between two and four units. Stylistically the buildings range from the Greek Revival to the Queen Anne. The Quinebaug Mill was built by Amos D. Lockwood starting in 1851 on the Quinebaug River, near the site of an 1820 Tiffany Mill. The Quinebaug Mill became one of the largest and most complete cotton mills in Connecticut by the end of the 19th century. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire, but the weave shed and the houses for workers survived. The housing area, which dates back from 1881, was rebuilt as low- cost housing in 1984 and contains six brick row houses, each containing eight apartments, surrounding a green space. The historic district is considered to be a well-preserved example of a textile mill village, a type of company town that was common in 19th-century eastern Connecticut. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Windham County, Connecticut References Category:Brooklyn, Connecticut Category:Historic districts in Windham County, Connecticut Category:Killingly, Connecticut Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Company towns in Connecticut Category:Cotton mills in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Windham County, Connecticut Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"Quinebaug Mill‚ÄìQuebec Square Historic District"},{"id":"17941890","text":"The Dead Are Alive ( / The Etruscan Kills Again) is a 1972 giallo film by Italian director Armando Crispino, with music by Riz Ortolani, and starring Alex Cord, Samantha Eggar and John Marley.Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999).

It extends along Main Street, between the Five Mile River and Spring Street, including a few buildings on adjacent side streets, representing the area's growth as a commercial and civic center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The borough of Danielson is located just north of the confluence of the Quinebaug and Five Mile Rivers. Its early 19th-century development took place because of mills located mainly across the Quinebaug in Brooklyn, whose proprietors built worker housing in the Danielson area. The Norwich and Worcester Railroad was routed through that village in the 1830s, and the Danielson Manufacturing Company was established in Danielson at the point above the river confluence. The railroad in particular was important for the development of the central business district, which took place along Main Street both north and south of Railroad Square. There are no longer any railroad-related buildings in that area, which is now dominated by parking lots. and The historic district is in size, and includes more than 40 buildings. Most are commercial structures, one to three stories in height, and of masonry construction. Most were built between about 1850 and 1920, although some later additions, including the post office, are stylistically compatible examples of Colonial Revival architecture. Non-commercial buildings include the 1901 Classical Revival Bugbee Memorial Library, the 1855 Italianate Westfield Congregational Church, and the 1902 Gothic Revival Danielson Methodist Church. Killingly's town hall is located in the district, in an 1876 Gothic Revival music hall.

It is clustered around the junction of Main and Pleasant Streets, extending along Main to High Street. The area flourished in the mid-19th century, as a consequence of the railroad being routed nearby, serving area textile mills. The district, residential except for a church, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The village of Dayville was named after Capt. John Day, who owned the water privileges on the Five Mile River. With the opening of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad in 1830, Dayville also became a hub for freight transport for other manufacturing villages along the river. By 1849, the village had grown sufficiently in population to have its own church, the Dayville Congregational Church, a Greek revival building built by Alexander Blanchard. Blanchard's own house is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture built about 1845, featuring a temple front. John Day's house was also built around that time, and also features a temple front. The district also has fine examples of Italianate and Queen Anne architecture, often built for owners of area mills or other commercial enterprises. The Thomas Sayles House, built in 1866, also includes a period carriage barn. The Henry Hammond House, built about 1888, is a blend of these two styles, with Italianate brackets and turned porch balusters. A late example of the Queen Anne is the William Labelle House, built in 1912.

Built about 1850, it is a well-preserved example of an early wood-frame textile mill. The mill complex, which includes, a dam, pond, head race, and bridge, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Elliottville Lower Mill is located in what is now a rural setting of eastern Killingly, on Peep Toad Road where it crosses Whetstone Brook. The mill complex occupies , and consists of a single building, along with a mill dam, pond, raceway, and a rubble stone-arch bridge which carries Peep Toad Road across the brook. The mill is of modest scale, 2-1/2 stories in height with a gable roof, and is built of stone and wood framing. It is set across the road from the mill pond and dam. The mill was built c. 1850 by the Elliotville Manufacturing Company, whose larger main mill was upstream from this complex. It is a rare surviving example of a wood-frame textile mill, many of which were built but few of which survive, due to fires and/or later expansion of the premises. The Elliottville Manufacturing Company was formed in the 1830s by Killingly residents Thomas Pray and Henry Westcott, who built their first (\\"upper\\") mill upstream from this one in the 1830s. Some local histories claim that this building is an older structure originally used as a saw and grist mill, but its construction methods are consistent with surviving buildings at the site of the upper mill. In 1844 Pray and Westcott sold their enterprise to Albert Elliott and Nelson Eddy, with Welcome Bartlett joining as a partner later on. This mill, built by that partnership, was used for spinning and preparation of warps used in the upper mill. The company remained in operation through the 1880s. In the 20th century the mill building was adapted for use as a private residence and art studio.

History Mattel had previously tried to market Popy figures as Shogun Warriors in the late 1970s, before the line was cancelled, partially due to safety concerns. In 1982 Bandai decided to try themselves, and came up with the Godaikin range. The name is a combination of the Japanese words for \\"alloy\\" (gokin) and \\"big\\" (dai), and is presented as \\"GoDaiKin\\" on the packaging (however, within collectors' sources, the title case version is more commonly used). Popy selected ten of their most popular Deluxe (or DX) Chogokin figures for release in North America for 1982. These typically varied between 10 and 12 inches in height in robot mode, and came in large boxes with carrying handles on the sides. Bandai America had no American facilities for manufacturing the figures, instead shipping the toys from Japan in styrofoam to their New Jersey US Headquarters where they were placed inside the new boxes. The toyline's tagline was \\"An innovative series of super robots\\". Unlike most toys of the time, the figures did have their wide selection of spring-loaded weapons left intact for the Western releases, which had only mild variations from the Japanese releases. Bandai's decision to aim the toys at an older audience may have been a factor in allowing them to circumvent safety laws. The large size of the toys, the expense of their construction and the freight costs of shipping them over to America led to the toys being prohibitively expensive for many children (some having a retail price of around US $80), and sales were poor. For the second series of Godaikin figures, Bandai introduced a smaller range of figures alongside the next batch of Deluxes. The Standard Godaikin were all around 6 inches tall, and some were smaller versions of Deluxe figures released the same year. Some of these were actually DX Chogokin due to their features, but were bracketed as standard figures in America due to their size. Bandai also released some toys from the Big Scale Ships range to tie in with the figures. However, in the face of competition from cheaper lines such as Transformers and Gobots, Godaikin still failed to take off. Unlike these series, Godaikin had no tie-in media to promote it outside of a single promotional comic seen in 1986 catalog, as the robots were drawn from a wide number of diverse anime and tokusatsu series. Some of these had been shown in America previously in different forms, but none were actively tied into the Godaikin brand. The line would continue with infrequent releases for another couple of years, largely repackaging overstock from Japan, where the Super Robot market was suffering something of a decline. Godaikin figures regularly ended up reduced in an attempt to sell, and large numbers of unsold units were shipped on to Europe and Australia, where they were repackaged once more and sold as part of Bandai's Robo Machine and Machine Men ranges respectively. While a commercial failure, the line introduced many collectors to high quality Japanese toys, and now good condition examples fetch large amounts on the second-hand market.

She has created extensive teaching materials for Halkomelem, and is currently engaged in further research on the language, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Some of her key areas of interest are: syntactic theory, language typology and universals, the syntax/morphology interface, and the form and function of grammatical categories. Gerdts earned her Phd in Linguistics from the University of California at San Diego. Gerdts was editor of International Journal of American Linguistics from 2014-2019. She was a founding co-editor of the Northwest Journal of Linguistics, and currently serves on its editorial board. She also worked as an associate editor of Language, a journal produced by the Linguistic Society of America. In 2008, Gerdts was president of the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas.  Research and Works  Gerdts has researched and written extensively on Halkomelem and Korean, and proposed syntactic theory \\"Mapping Theory,\\" an offshoot of Relational Grammar. She has also created substantive educational materials on Halkomelem, including a talking dictionary and school materials for students and teachers in the First Nations Representatives and Nanaimo School District No. 68. = Mapping Theory = Gerdts proposed Mapping Theory in 1992 as an offshoot of Relational Grammar that takes into account the association between grammatical relations and morphosyntactic argument structure. There are no levels between grammatical relations and the argument structure, and instead of using a universal inventory of grammatical relations, Mapping Theory posits \\"morphosyntactically-licensed argument positions,\\" or MAPs.  Mapping Halkomelem Grammatical Relations (1993)  In this article, Gerdts gives a relational profile for Halkomelem. She starts by arguing that the relational profile of a language is related to its morphosyntactic argument structure and uses this as a starting point for Mapping Theory. She defines relational profile as an account of the systematic constructions in a language's grammar, emphasizing that grammatical constructions are not random. A relational profile for Halkomelem would be that it is a direct object-centered language, because \\"rules of the grammar pivot on the concept object, while the concept indirect object seems to be irrelevant.\\"Gerdts, Donna B.

Description and history The Cady-Copp House stands in the dispersed village of Putnam Heights, on the east side of Liberty Highway (Connecticut Route 21), roughly midway between Wilson Road and Aspinock Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and a center chimney. It is set in a wooded area back from the highway, and faces south. The interior is virtually unaltered since its c. 1745 construction, lacking any provision of modern amenities such as plumbing and electricity. The front facade is irregular in arrangement, with an entrance on the right side, flanked closely by sash windows. A third sash window is roughly centered in the left half of the front. The left side has a second entrance, set in a gabled vestibule. The Putnam Heights area was settled in 1708. Its first minister was dismissed in 1741, and a second was appointed in 1750. Sometime between these two dates, the Cady-Copp House was built by Joseph Cady for his daughter Damaris, who was marrying the Perley Howe, the second minister. After he died, she remarried the next minister. Damaris's son Sampson Howe sold the property to David Copp, whose family maintained ownership until the late 19th century.

Description and history The former Israel Putnam School is located east of the city's central business district, at the southwest corner of School and Oak Streets. It has a large central block with smaller flanking wings, and a matching two- story addition extending to the rear, built in 1922. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with limestone keystones and sills. The main entrance is at the center, recessed in an arcade of five arched openings, which extends into the nearly fully exposed basement level. Prior to the construction of this building, the students of Putnam's urban core were educated in a two- story wood frame building that had classes divided by grade. The city experienced a surge in growth around 1900, and that school as judged inadequate. This building was designed by John Chandler Fowler and Edward I. Wilson, both of Boston, Massachusetts but not apparently in formal partnership, and was completed in 1902. It was the city's first school building to include an auditorium, and was specifically designed with an imposing architectural facade to convey seriousness of purpose.

Amanti¬¥s music is characterized by the integration of jazz and pop idiom into classical music forms.  Life and career Amanti was born in Montreal (Canada) to Italian Parents that shortly after his birth decided to move back to Italy. There, Amanti took his first piano lesson age 4 and cello (age 8) and age 9, he started his studies first in cello and later Composition at the \\"San Pietro a Majella\\" Conservatory. All through his ten years studies he performed as soloist and with orchestra for the Italian national broadcast (Italian \\"Rai\\") and in venues such as Teatro San Carlo, S. William Walton¬¥s foundation and the Ravello Festival. As an active composer, Amanti had his first experience age 19 when he became part of the Composer¬¥s workshop (Italian \\"Bottega di Composizione\\"): a group of composition students founded by celebrated Italian composer Roberto De Simone which works were many times performed in the major theaters in Italy. In 2002, the legendary cellist Janos Starker invited Amanti to study with him at the Indiana University School of music in Bloomington USA. After two years studies, due to his newly discovered passion for improvisation, Amanti decided to deepen his curriculum studying Composition, jazz and improvisation with the composer, and jazz pedagogue, Dr. David Baker (composer). During this time, Amanti wrote many compositions and arrangements for different ensembles, searching to build the foundations for a dialogue between the jazz and classical tradition. After graduating in 2006 with both a Diploma in classical cello and a master's degree in \\"Jazz Studies\\" Amanti moved to Berlin (Germany), where he started to perform, solo and with his trio, in major jazz clubs and new music places. Shortly after, he was forced to put his performances career to rest due to a major arm injury, His started then to work for a major design company and their \\"Sound Branding\\" team, with different functions: creative producer, musical consultant and eventually composer for clients such as Audi, Siemens, Deutsche Post and Commerzbank just to name a few.

Constructed in 1874, it is one of the oldest surviving high school buildings in the state, and a distinctive local example of Gothic Revival architecture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history Putnam Town Hall is located across the Quinebaug River from downtown Putnam, on the west side of Church Street between Fenner and Ravine Streets. It is a large 2-1/2 story brick structure with a hip roof. The main focal elements of the building are two towers, one two stories in height at the front left corner, and a three-story tower at the front right, which has an elaborate gabled clock stage (but no clock), above which is a pyramidal roof. Most of the first-floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings, while those on the second floor are mainly rounded. Windows are set in pairs in the towers, and there are horizontal bands of ornamental brickwork, featuring bricks of varying color shades. The interior has undergone significant alterations due to its reuse as municipal offices, but some original trim and decorative features, as well as the basic layout, remain. The town of Putnam voted in 1873 to build a high school. It was completed the following year, and graduated its first class in 1876. The building was used by the town as its high school until 1911, when overcrowding prompted a move to a new facility (now no longer standing). The current high school, located on Woodstock Avenue, was opened in 1955. This building now houses municipal offices, but is one of the oldest surviving high school buildings in the state. It is also a distinctive local example of the Ruskinian Gothic style of architecture.

Throughout her life she worked for recognition of marginalised groups including women and MƒÅori, and she published extensively on New Zealand historical geography and on MƒÅori land issues.. Biography Evelyn Mary Dinsdale was born in Tauranga, New Zealand, on 5 December 1936. She was educated at Tauranga Primary School and Tauranga College, where she was one of the first non-MƒÅori to join the local kapa haka group.. She then went to Canterbury University College, earning a master's degree with first class honours in geography in 1959.Author's biography from A History of Tauranga County. After earning this degree, she took a postgraduate teacher training course from Christchurch Teachers' College and taught briefly at Te Kuiti high school, fulfilling the requirements of the post primary teachers' bursary that had funded her education. Dinsdale was awarded a Fulbright Travel Grant and a Smith-Mundt Grant from the United States government in 1960, freeing her to travel to Syracuse University, where she received her PhD in 1963 under the supervision of Donald Meinig.. Reprinted in Datum: Newsletter of the New Zealand Map Society, no. 23, November 2005.. While in America, she demonstrated long poi swinging on television.Rigby (2005) states that she appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, but her letters from the time (Evelyn's Letters from America, p. 181) only mention a local television show hosted by Phil Markert, and there is no other record of an Ed Sullivan appearance. Soon after her return to New Zealand, in 1964, she married Brian Stokes, changing her name to Evelyn Stokes; they had two children. Although Evelyn and Brian Stokes later divorced, Dr. Stokes continued to use her married name professionally for the rest of her career. Stokes was appointed to a lecturership with the Auckland University, and taught for a year for their Waikato branch before becoming a member of the geography department at Waikato University when that university was founded in 1964. At Waikato, she worked hard to promote MƒÅori studies and to integrate local MƒÅori communities into the university's activities,. and she continued to serve as a faculty member for nearly 41 years, the longest tenure among the Waikato staff.. In 1969 she was promoted to Senior Lecturer, and in 1975 to Reader. In the early 1970s, unusually for geography departments in New Zealand, the department at Waikato split into two, with physical geography moving to the Department of Earth Sciences; Stokes remained with the renamed Department of Human Geography and Environmental Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.. Johnson recalls her as \\"a wise but stroppy woman, someone who would have no truck with fools but who opened her heart, her mind and her home to those whose intellect and politics she respected\\", and she was known as the \\"kuia\\" (a MƒÅori word for a wise old woman) of the geography department. Stokes died on 15 August 2005 aged 68. Academic work Stokes was founding editor of the New Zealand Journal of Geography, which she formed from what was previously a pamphlet, the New Zealand Geographical Society Record, and for 10 years she served as its editor.. Two major areas of Stokes' academic publication were on the history of the Tauranga area of New Zealand and of the MƒÅori. She edited Te Raupatu o Tauranga Moana, a collection of written works related to the Tauranga area, her Masters thesis work was on settlements in the Tauranga area, and in 1980 she published a book on the history of Tauranga County which Bedford calls \\"the definitive history\\" of the area and for which she received the J. M. Sherrard \\"Major Award\\" in regional history. MƒÅori resource use more generally was the subject of over 30 of her papers. Another of Stokes' many interests was geography education at the secondary school level. She published a series of 20 papers aimed at the curricular needs for this level in both the New Zealand Journal of Geography and the New Zealand Geographer, and served from 1976 to 1987 as a member of New Zealand's National Geography Curriculum Committee. An early experience that shaped Stokes' feminist views was her service as a high school teacher, for which she was paid ¬£100 less per year than men with equivalent levels of experience due to her gender. With Anne Magee, Stokes helped establish gender studies and feminist studies at the University of Waikato in the late 1970s, and from an early date she pushed for feminist perspectives in geography. In 1987 Stokes and four colleagues published a \\"collective statement\\" on feminist geography in the New Zealand Geographer; Longhurst and Johnston provide a retrospective look at her work in this area.. Stokes also played an important part in building up the map collection of the University of Waikato: in 1964 she and Michael Selby transferred the New Zealand Geographic Society's collection to Waikato, she was the society's map librarian from 1966 to 1983, and she frequently added to the library with purchases from her travels abroad.. Robson writes that \\"without her Waikato may never have had a Map Library or, at least, it would have been only a much poorer one\\", and Bedford adds that \\"her passion for maps has kept a tradition of cartography very much alive for almost 40 years in Waikato's Geography Department\\". Bedford also states that \\"her publications are renowned for the meticulous and innovative cartography\\", and that her skills in this area were put to good use in her service on the editorial committee for the New Zealand Historical Atlas (1991‚Äì1997). Public service In Stokes' capacity as a member of the NgƒÅti Tahu Tribal Trust (on which she served from 1980 to 1991) she helped negotiate a major lease of MƒÅori land for the Ohaaki geothermal power plant, a change from previous practices in which the land ownership was transferred to the government.. She also worked closely with two other MƒÅori tribes, the NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa and the NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, whose chief Wiremu Tamihana was the subject of a major biography published by Stokes. For nearly 16 years, Stokes served as a member of the Waitangi Tribunal, the New Zealand government commission that adjudicates MƒÅori land claims with respect to the Treaty of Waitangi. Stokes' research on the history of Tauranga County related closely to her work on an important tribunal case on the confiscation of land in the Tauranga area, and her experience with the NgƒÅti Tahu and NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa helped guide her work with the Waitangi Tribunal on other cases involving geothermal resources. As part of the Waitangi Tribunal, Stokes worked on major reports on Pouakani, Muriwhenua, Te Maunga railways, Turangi township, Mohaka ki Ahuriri, Kaipara, and Hauraki, taking an important role in drafting the reports on these cases. Stokes served as well for many years on the New Zealand Geographic Board, the body charged with assigning official place names in New Zealand. During her tenure on the board, she helped guide it towards the restoration of indigenous names for places that had been renamed as part of the English colonisation of New Zealand.. Awards and honours In 1990, the University of Waikato awarded Stokes a personal chair \\"in recognition of her outstanding contribution to research and teaching\\". In the same year she was also awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2000 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to tertiary education and MƒÅori. She was the last woman in New Zealand to be made a Dame before that title was replaced by \\"Distinguished Companion\\" in 2001, until damehoods were reintroduced in 2009. In 2001 the New Zealand Geographical Society honoured her with the Distinguished New Zealand Geographer Medal and with life membership in the society;. she was the second academic to be so honoured. At that time, Garth Cant remarked that \\"no one within geography has made a more substantial and sustained contribution to the wholeness and wellbeing of this nation we call Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s than Dame Evelyn Stokes\\". A special issue of New Zealand Geographer (volume 61, issue 2, August 2005) was devoted to \\"Evelyn Stokes and Geography at the University of Waikato\\". Although the articles in it were written prior to Stokes' death, it was not published until soon after her death.. On her death, Stokes was honoured with a tangi, a formal three-day MƒÅori funeral ceremony, on Te Kohinga MƒÅrama marai. In 2006, the University of Waikato inaugurated a lecture series and doctoral scholarship in Stokes' memory. The first lecture in the series, by Malcolm McKinnon, president of the Professional Historians' Association of New Zealand / Aotearoa, was entitled \\"Mapping the Past: Evelyn Stokes and the History of Aotearoa\\". Stokes Peak, a mountain in the Kaimai Range directly above the Kaimai Tunnel near Tauranga, was named in her honour in 2010 by the New Zealand Geographic Board; however the name was discontinued in 2012 after objections from the NgƒÅti Hinerangi.Stokes Peak , Land Information New Zealand, retrieved 2010-09-09.

Built in 1907, it is a reminder of the importance of the railroad in the development of Putnam as a city, and is an architecturally distinctive example of Mediterranean-influenced design. The building, now in other commercial uses, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The former Putnam Railroad Station is located near the southern end of Putnam's central business district, between Main Street and South Main Street south of Front Street. It is oriented roughly north-south, with its east facade originally facing the railroad tracks, an area now overlaid by parking for the building. It is a 1-1/2 story brick building with a central gable-roofed section and flanking hip-roof sections at either end. Its terra cotta tile roof and colored brick give it a flavor of Mediterranean architectural styles. Putnam was one of the early centers of textile industry in eastern Connecticut, dotted with small mill villages along its waterways. The arrival of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad in 1840 spurred the development of downtown Putnam as an economic center, which was accelerated by the construction of additional rail lines in the following decades. One of its earliest stations to serve all of these lines, operated jointly by the Norwich and Worcester and the New York and New England Railroad, was located nearer Front Street. The present station was sited and designed to solve a number of problems that arose in the use of that station, and was completed in 1907. It was built by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which had consolidated management of all of the lines passing through the town. The station was used for passenger service until April 30, 1971, when Penn Central dropped the sole round trip from New London to Worcester since it was not included in the initial Amtrak system. Service from Hartford to Boston via Putnam on the former NY&NE; ended in 1955 when the Flood of 1955 washed out the bridge just south of downtown. The station has been converted to commercial use.

It is a vernacular post- and-beam frame structure, four stories in height, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Mashamoquet Brook parallels the road, descending in a southerly direction, and passes west of the building. The mill was probably fed by a headrace or underground channel. Its power equipment includes a 19th- century turbine mounted in a wooden frame in the basement, reinforced with cast iron tie rods. The second level of the mill houses equipment for gearing the turbine's power shaft down to equipment working speed. The third level houses milling equipment patented in 1888 and 1890.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Pomfret Town House is located in the village of Pomfret Center, on the west side of Town House Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure with a gable roof and clapboard siding. Its main facade features two entrances, each with simple molded surrounds, and five windows with plain framing. The interior is a large open space, clad in narrow wood flooring that covers original wide board floors. A small ell extends to one side, and there is a 19th-century privy on the grounds. The town of Pomfret was incorporated in 1713. For many years its town meetings were held in local churches and other buildings. In 1831, calls began to be made for a dedicated town hall for such meetings. Disputes within the community about where to locate the building prompted the town to retain a council composed of members from neighboring towns to decide the issue. The three-man council chose this spot, roughly midway between Pomfret Center and Abington, two of the town's larger villages. This building was erected in 1841 and was used for many years as the site of Pomfret's town meetings. It is now owned by the Pomfret Historical Society.

At one time it may have opened into a small chamber, but leaves, debris, and fill have erased any evidence of this. The cave looks much as it did in the late 18th century when the tale of Putnam and the wolf was codified. Today, the Wolf Den is accessible from a hiking trail off of Wolf Den drive in Mashamoquet Brook State Park, a + Connecticut state park, with two campgrounds, hiking, fishing, swimming, and picnicking.

Julius Theodore Melchers (1829‚Äì1908) was a German born American sculptor and teacher who immigrated to the United States leaving Prussia after 1848 and resided in Detroit, Michigan after 1855 .Baulch, Vivian M.

Melchers House (1897) by Donaldson and Meier is located at 723 Seyburn, in the Indian Village Historic District on which Julius carved the ornate gable. The likelihood that Melchers left Europe, as did so many other in and after the turbulent year of 1848 for political reasons is somewhat supported that he named his son (called, \\"Gari\\") after the famous Italian patriot and revolutionary Garibaldi. Birth and emigration Julius Theodore Melchers, was born in Soest, Westphalia, Prussia At age fifteen, while still in Prussia, Julius T. Melchers studied carving then studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris with Carpeaux and √âtex. Before moving to the United States he worked as a modeler at the Crystal Palace in London as well as carving ships figureheads.Gibson, Arthur Hopkin, Artists of Early Michigan: A Biographical Dictionary of Artists Native to or Active in Michigan, 1701-1900, Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1975 Children He had at least three children: one was Hettie Melchers, who married Julius Stroh of the Stroh brewing family in June 1883.

She is a prostitute who frequents the Boar's Head Inn in Eastcheap. Doll is close friends with Mistress Quickly, the proprietress of the tavern, who procures her services for Falstaff. Doll is noted for her wide repertoire of colourful insults and her sudden switches from wild tirades to sentimental intimacy and back again. In the play Doll is introduced by name when Mistress Quickly asks Falstaff whether he would like her company that evening. The Page later mentions to Prince Hal and Poins that Falstaff will be seeing her, primly referring to her as \\"a proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's\\", though Hal quickly concludes that she is probably \\"some road\\" (meaning a whore: accessible to anyone, as in the phrase \\"as common as the cart-way\\"). Doll is first seen about to be sick after drinking too much \\"canaries\\" (fortified wine from the Canary islands). When Falstaff arrives they exchange lewd banter about venereal disease. Informed that Ancient Pistol is at the door, Doll insists that he should not be allowed in because he's \\"the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.\\" After Pistol enters, Doll berates him with a string of insults: \\"I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away!\\" She then threatens him with a knife, and Pistol pulls his sword. In the ensuing fight, Falstaff and Bardolph force him out. After his display of fighting prowess, Doll becomes very solicitous to Falstaff, calling him a \\"whoreson little valiant villain\\". She sits on his knee and kisses him. She asks him what Prince Hal is like; Falstaff gives a rather unflattering picture of him, unaware that Hal and Poins are nearby. When they reveal themselves, Falstaff claims he was intentionally \\"dispraising\\" the prince in the presence of \\"the wicked\\". Hal professes to be shocked, describing Doll as a \\"virtuous gentlewoman\\", to the enthusiastic agreement of Mistress Quickly. But Falstaff says Doll is \\"in hell already, and burns poor souls\\" (a reference to the burning sensation of venereal disease).Ren√© Weis (ed), Henry IV, Part 2: Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 187. When Falstaff is called away to the war, Doll becomes tearful. He leaves, but then calls on her to join him. The seemingly pregnant Doll being arrested. Engraving by Richard Rhodes She next appears, apparently heavily pregnant, with Mistress Quickly. They are being arrested because Pistol has beaten up a man in a brawl in which they were involved. The man has since died. The officer says she will probably be whipped. Doll says that she should not be manhandled because she might have a miscarriage, but the arresting officer insists she has stuffed a cushion up her dress. Doll unleashes a stream of insults directed at the arresting officer's skinniness. After the death of King Henry IV, Falstaff learns about Doll's arrest and promises to have her released. But Hal, now king, refuses to listen to him. References in Henry V Though she does not appear in Henry V, Doll is mentioned several times, though in contexts which appear to be inconsistent with one another. Pistol marries Mistress Quickly, whose first name is Nell. He gets into an argument with Corporal Nym, who himself wanted to marry her, and tells Nym to go to the hospital ('spital) and find Doll in the ward for sexually transmitted diseases (\\"the powdering tub of infamy\\") and marry her: \\"Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,/ Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse\\". After the Battle of Agincourt he receives a letter, from which he learns that \\"my Doll is dead in the 'spital\\" from \\"malady of France\\", i.e. syphilis. It is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet or Mistress Quickly, since the next line says he has lost his home, implying that the woman referred to is the person he lives with. It is often amended to \\"Nell\\" in modern editions. The Quarto version says \\"Doll is sick\\", not \\"dead\\", leaves out the \\"my\\", and makes no reference to losing a home.Andrew Griffin, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583‚Äì1603, Ashgate, 2013, p.142 It has been suggested that a version of Henry V existed in which Falstaff appeared, perhaps married to Quickly (which he said he would do in Henry IV, Part 2). At the epilogue to Henry IV, Part 2 Shakespeare had promised another play to \\"continue the story, with Sir John in it\\", but Falstaff does not appear in existing versions of Henry V. If such a version existed Pistol may have married Doll. If this highly speculative hypothesis is true, when Falstaff was cut out, much of his part was reassigned to Pistol, but the passage apparently referring to Doll as his wife was accidentally left unchanged. Character Falstaff with Doll Tearsheet, print after Henry Fuseli Doll's name is obviously emblematic of her trade. A contraction of Dorothy, the name \\"Doll\\", with its connotation of \\"plaything\\", was often given to prostitute characters, as with Doll Common in Jonson's play The Alchemist.Alison Findlay, \\"Dorothy\\" and \\"Jane\\", Women in Shakespeare: A Dictionary, A&C; Black, 2014. Her surname is suggestive of her activities, as is that of the other \\"loose woman\\" mentioned in the play, Jane Nightwork. Stanley Wells and Eric Partridge say she is \\"so called, either because she tore the bed-sheets in her amorous tossings or because her partners did so while consorting with her\\".Stanley Wells & Eric Partridge, Shakespeare's Bawdy, Routledge, p.258. According to Ren√© Weis, Harold Bloom says that Doll's eccentric compliments to Falstaff (\\"thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig\\") complement Hal's own apparently affectionate insults, with the difference that Doll's are sincere, since \\"Falstaff the Bartholomew boar-pig has just proved himself to his doxy as being, in her words, a 'whoreson little valiant villain', and is fully to her taste. Falstaff the Manningtree ox, however, has just been unmercifully made game of by the Prince for running away at Gadshill in a fashion that could only, by everyone in the tavern company except Falstaff, be taken as showing downright cowardice.\\"Harold Bloom, Falstaff, Chelsea House, 1992, p.158. In other literature Doll appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play Falstaff's Wedding (1766), a comedy by William Kenrick, which is set in the period between the end of Henry IV, Part 2 and the beginning of Henry V. Doll and Mistress Quickly, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Robert Shallow and Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so Doll ends up married to Nym. James White's book Falstaff's Letters (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters from Quickly to Falstaff complain about his treatment of Doll.White, James, Falsteff's Letters, London, Robson, 1877, p.39. In Oliver St. John Gogarty's poem \\"Applied Poetry\\" Doll is invoked. The poet tells his beloved that she is filled with the beauties of springtime, and like the breeze that sways a field of buttercups, \\"As if Doll Tearsheet lay / And leapt again\\". When she expresses outrage at being compared to a whore, he explains, > But she was meant to show, (If Will gave lessons) That only women know The > human essence, And see beneath a part, Though clothed upon By Evil, the rich > heart Of gross Sir John; Which no one else perceived.Oliver St. John > Gogarty, Selected Poems, The Macmillan Company, 1933, p.135 Doll also appears as a character in Gustav Holst's 1925 opera At the Boar's Head. A soprano role, it was first performed by Constance Willis, conducted by Malcolm Sargent.Margaret Ross Griffel, Adrienne Fried Block, Operas in English: A Dictionary, Greenwood Press, Westport, 1999, p.37.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a front gable roof and a single-story hip-roofed front porch extending across the front. A long two-story wing extends to the west (left) of the main block. The corners of the building are pilasters, supporting a frieze and entablature at the cornice. A polygonal bay, added c. 1880, projects from the east side of the main block, and is decorated with brackets. The interior retains a number of original features, including wide pine floors and horsehair plaster walls. The house was built c. 1846 by George Pickering Nichols, who came from a family of early area settlers. It was occupied by the Nichols family for nearly a century. It was the centerpiece of a farm, portions of which were taken for construction of the highway, and other parts were sold off for development. After it was sold out of the family, it was converted into a two-family, but it has since been converted back to single- family use, with significant elements of its 19th-century appearance carefully reproduced.

With a construction history dating to 1760, it has a number of unusual features and form for a rurally sited house of that period, including unusually fine stonework in the chimney and stencilled plaster. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Captain Seth Chandler House is located in a rural setting of eastern Woodstock, on the east side of Converse Street, a short way north of its junction with Old Turnpike ROad (Connecticut Route 197). It is a two-story wood frame structure, with an unusual form and floor plan for its c. 1760 construction date. Its large chimney, instead of being centrally located, is set well back from the main roof ridge. The interior layout is consistent with a typical south-facing colonial house of the period, with a narrow winding stair on the south side of the chimney, and public rooms on either side. However, the roof gable (which would normally run east-west in such a configuration) runs north-south, and the main entrance, facing west in a three-bay gable end facade, opens into the southern parlor. A single-story ell is attached to the rear; it was added later in the 18th century, and may have originally been a separate structure. The interior is notable for its period woodwork and stenciled artwork on its walls. The land on which the house stands was purchased in 1760 by Captain Seth Chandler, and the first portion of the house, its west side, was probably built soon afterward. Chandler had just married, and the house was enlarged about 1780, in order to accommodate his large family (they had 11 children). It remained in the Chandler family until 1867, and then in the Converse family until 1983.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. At the time, it included 61 contributing buildings out of a total of 78 buildings, and it included 2 other contributing sites. General description Windham Center is a village in the New England town of Windham in northeast Connecticut. The District is centered on the village green. During the town's first 125 years, this district was the most thickly settled part of the surrounding area. The village was selected as the seat of Windham County, when the latter was created in 1726, and prospered from the legal activity around the courthouse that was constructed. In the following three decades Windham Center grew to be a prosperous administrative, commercial and agricultural center. The village green today is bordered by the Congregational Church, the Post Office, a former inn, multiple houses, and the original Greek Revival style Windham Bank (built in 1832), which was converted to the Windham Free Library in 1896. Four streets issue from the green: Scotland Rd (Route 14) to the east, Windham Center Road (Route 203) to the south, Plains Road to the west, and North Road (Routes 14 and 203) to the northwest. The village remains essentially rural. Windham was the home of two of Connecticut's Revolutionary pioneers, Eliphalet Dyer and Jedediah Elderkin; of craftsman J. Alden Weir; and of legal scholar Zephaniah Swift. The first volume of Swift's work, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1795), was the first legal treatise in America and concerns the constitution of the state and differences between English and American common law.

Later studies confirmed this split to be one of the main causes for the eventual demise of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad. Hitler persisted in this division of Army Group South for strategic reasons: acquiring the oilfields in the Caucasus region and cutting Soviet supply transports along the Volga through Stalingrad. On July 23, 1942 Hitler met with Chief of staff Lutze and SA Obergruppenf√ºhrer J√ºttner at the Werwolf headquarters. They discussed several events but the key discussion surrounded Directive Number 45, which was a continuance of Operation Braunschweig. In this meeting Hitler stated several directives that, ‚ÄúArmy Group A take the Caucasus and Baku (Operation Edelweiss), while Army Group B was supposed to conquer Stalingrad and, if possible, Astrakhan (Operation Heron ‚Äì Fischreiher because of the fish in the Volga River). Army Group North was instructed to conquer Leningrad (Operation Fireworks because of artillery fire).‚Äù).‚Äù* Domarus, Max. Speeches and proclamations, 1932-1945.

It is currently operated as a bed and breakfast. The main house on the property is a two-story brick structure built c. 1760, altered in the late 19th century and again in the 1920s, giving it a Colonial Revival appearance. When the property was developed as a country estate in the 1920s by Eleanor Clark Murray (who gave the property its name), it included significant landscape design by William Jackson, a noted New York City landscape designer. Despite a significant period of neglect in the 20th century, the property has one of the most extensive collections of specimen trees in the state. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history Gwyn Careg is located in a rural setting of southern Pomfret, on the west side of Wolf Den Road a short way south of United States Route 44. The surviving of a once larger estate include the main house, gatehouse, barn, and the remains of an early 20th- century greenhouse, as well as a designed landscape containing formal and informal elements. The main house is a frame building, built about 1760, which underwent extensive alterations in the 1890s and 1920s. Those alterations included refacing the exterior in brick veneer, which has been painted. This structure has been encrusted with additions, including an east-facing gabled section that is its principal facade to the street. It is set just north of the original main block, whose gable end houses the main entrance. The gardens in which the house stand include a formal terraced area which descends from the house to a man-made lake, and a Spanish style walled garden just south of the house. The latter garden is surrounded by a stuccoed stone wall up to in height, and features a variety of perennial plantings. The terraced garden historically was adorned with statuary and urns containing plantings, but these features have been lost, as was the original boathouse on the lake. The property was surveyed in 1991 by the Connecticut Botanical Society, in which 27 specimen trees were identified; this is one of the largest collection of such trees in the state.

Arnold, 533 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2008), is a United States court case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require government agents to have reasonable suspicion before searching laptops or other digital devices at the border, including international airports.United States v. Arnold, 523 F.3d 941 (9th Cir. 2008), amended on denial of rehearing en banc, 533 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2008). This decision has caused worry and some controversy among Fourth Amendment advocates, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Especially troubled are those that legitimately store sensitive business, legal, or customer data; who worry that federal agents might leak information found from laptop searches. Several legislators have discussed and introduced measures to counter the ruling in order to provide more protection to travelers, but none have become law. Background to the case On July 17, 2005, Michael Arnold arrived at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) after spending a three-week vacation in the Philippines. After retrieving his luggage, Arnold proceeded through the checkpoint at customs. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer Laura Peng saw Arnold waiting in line and selected him for secondary questioning. Peng questioned Arnold, and began inspecting his luggage, noting a laptop computer and several computer accessories. Peng instructed Arnold to turn on the computer so she could see if it was functioning. CBP Officer John Roberts was called to assist with the inspection while the computer was booting up. Among the icons displayed on the computer's desktop, two were named \\"Kodak Pictures\\" and one was named \\"Kodak Memories\\". Peng and Roberts opened these folders, began viewing the photos, and noted one that depicted two nude women. At that point special agents from U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were called. Arnold was detained and questioned by the ICE agents for several hours. They further examined the computer and equipment, and found numerous images of what they believed to be child pornography. Arnold was released, but his computer was seized by the agents. Federal agents obtained a warrant two weeks later. Arnold was charged with (1) knowingly transporting child pornography,18 U.S.C. Section 2256(8)(A). (2) knowingly possessing a computer hard drive and compact discs which both contained more than one image of child pornography, and (3) knowingly and intentionally traveling in foreign commerce and attempting to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a person under 18 years of age.18 U.S.C. Section 2423(f).18 U.S.C. Section 2423(c) . Arnold filed for a motion to suppress, and argued that the government required reasonable suspicion to conduct the search. This motion was granted by the District Court, ruling in Arnold's favor. The Government promptly appealed the case, and stated that the border doctrine took precedence over the Fourth Amendment's protection from unreasonable search. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's ruling, holding in favor of the Government. Arnold was represented in the District Court and before the Ninth Circuit by Marilyn E. Bednarski and Kevin J. LaHue, of Kaye, McLane, Bednarski, & Litt. ArgumentsReasonable search= The crux of Arnold's argument is that a laptop is very similar to a person's home and the human mind, much more so than an ordinary container for data. His argument is based on the notion that a laptop has the ability to store a greater amount of data and personal documents, much like those stored in one's home. He continued to argue that because a laptop is able to record ideas, e-mail, internet chats, and web-surfing habits, it is very similar to the \\"human mind.\\" Under these arguments he sought the protection of the Fourth Amendment, which states that \\"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ... \\". Arnold also raised the exception that the government's searches are limited in cases where they are of a \\"particularly offensive manner,\\" and argued that such was the case when CBP officers seized and searched his laptop. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief in support of Arnold.EFF, Amicus brief in United States v. Arnold. The amici included the EFF and the Association of Corporate Travel Executives (ACTE). The brief argued that the government's position and current practice subjects travelers to unconstitutional invasive searches of laptops and other devices. Their argument is similar to that already made by Arnold, and they contended mainly that a computer is different from a gas tank, suitcase, or other closed container because laptops routinely contain some of the most personal information about a person's life. Moreover, the amici were concerned that a search would reveal information that is already protected under other statutes, including privileged legal communications, reporters' notes from confidential sources, and trade secrets. In summary, the main points of the brief are that: (1) people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information stored on their laptop computers; (2) searches of personal electronic information devices ... are particularly invasive of personal privacy; (3) the volume of information stored on computers means that the privacy invasion of a laptop border search is enormous; (4) personal computers often contain information that the individual does not know about, or has even sought to erase; (5) laptop computer searches are indistinguishable from \\"general searches;\\" (6) there is a real risk of unconstrained \\"pretext\\" searches; and (7) the first amendment protects many of the contents on laptop computers. The final point raised the worry that indiscriminate searches of information stored on laptops will discourage people from storing sensitive data, thus causing a chilling effect on speech. > A personal computer is among a person's most private belongings. Laptop > computers are virtual extensions of the mind, used to record and share our > thoughts, feelings, and activities; indeed, \\"they are postal services, > playgrounds, jukeboxes, dating services, movie theaters, daily planners, > shopping malls, personal secretaries, virtual diaries, and more.\\" ... [a]s a > result, our laptop computers contain as much information about us as our > homes contain - perhaps more. Overall, the amici were concerned that unchecked compliance with the border doctrine would infringe too far on a citizen's First and Fourth Amendment rights. In their view, the doctrine did not provide the protection that it was meant to enact, as technology now provides ways to maneuver around it. \\" ... a smuggler's 'container of choice' for electronic contraband is the internet. They may simply email it to themselves or post it online to avoid customs searches. A ruling that overturns the decision would not undermine the government's ability to protect its borders.\\" =Border doctrine= In response to Arnold's motion to suppress, the government argued two points. Firstly, the Fourth Amendment did not require reasonable suspicion because of the border doctrine. Secondly, even if reasonable suspicion were required, it was present. The government argued that the United States has a duty to take measures to ensure the safety of its interior. Past cases have stated that \\"it is axiomatic that the United States, as sovereign, has the inherent authority to protect, and a paramount interest in protecting, its territorial integrity.\\" In United States v. Ramsey, the court stated that \\"searches made at the border ... are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border ... \\" . In the case of Arnold, the point that linked these two conclusions together was the notion that international American airports are the functional equivalent of a border, as stated in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States.. Reference was also made to a history of searches of closed containers such as a briefcases, purses, wallets, pockets, pictures, film, and other graphic material. These items are the equivalent of a closed container, and have traditionally been searched at the border without particularized suspicion. It is acknowledged that some limits have been made, specifically a traveler's alimentary canal. Such limitations are made when searching a person, not their objects in possession, in the interest of human dignity and privacy, which the Fourth Amendment protects. JudgmentReasonable search= The Court addressed the argument that the search of Arnold's laptop was carried out in a particularly offensive manner, and was so destructive that it required particularized suspicion. The court acknowledged that there was no precedent to declare when a border search should be deemed unreasonable. The Supreme Court has left open the question of the circumstances that make a search particularly offensive, and thus unreasonable. However, the Court pointed out that Arnold never claimed that his laptop was damaged in any way during the government's search. Even without a clear scale to determine how offensive a search may be, the Court dismissed the reasoning of the District Court that particularized suspicion was needed in the case of Arnold. The District Court-based this decision on previous cases that related to search of the human body, not of property. =Border doctrine= The Court distinguished searches at American airports because they are considered border searches, and occur at the \\"functional equivalent of a border\\". Previously, the Supreme Court had stated that: To address Arnold's claim that a laptop is like a home, and therefore requires Fourth Amendment protection, the court dismissed his argument as without merit. Its decision is based on previous Supreme Court judgments that have denied Fourth Amendment protections to property which is also \\"capable of functioning as a home.\\" . Lastly, the Court addressed a comparison to United States v. Ickes, 393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005). In that case, a man's van was stopped and searched as he was driving from Canada into the United States. The court upheld the border search doctrine, and the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the concerns and followed the reasoning that carving out a First Amendment exception to the border doctrine would (1) protect terrorist communications \\"which are inherently 'expressive'\\"; (2) create an unworkable standard for government agents who \\"would have to decide - on their feet - which expressive material is covered by the First Amendment\\"; and (3) contravene the weight of Supreme Court precedent refusing to subject government action to greater scrutiny with respect to the Fourth Amendment when an alleged First Amendment interest is also at stake.\\" By this reasoning, the Court justified the government's interest in preventing unwanted persons and effects as greater than a person's desire to conceal the contents of their baggage. The decision of the District Court was overturned, ruling in favor of the government.  Subsequent developments  Death of Arnold = On February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States notified Arnold's counsel that it had denied Arnold's petition for writ of certiorari.Docket for 08-6708 Arnold v. United States Attorneys for Arnold filed a motion to de-publish the Ninth Circuit opinion (which was denied).United States v. Arnold, Appellee Arnold's Motion to De-Publish Opinion (Mar. 3, 2009). In their motion, Arnold's counsel explained that two days after being informed of the Supreme Court's refusal to hear his appeal, Arnold committed suicide. = Controversy = This ruling has caused much controversy and discussion among First and Fourth Amendment rights activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU, ACLU Welcomes Introduction of Travelers' Privacy Protection Act in Both Chambers of Congress (Sep. 29, 2008). and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Electronic Frontier Foundation: US v. Arnold One of the primary points of controversy is the court's ruling that a laptop is no different from any other type of container. Just as Arnold has argued, critics argue that a laptop contains far more sensitive and personal data than any ordinary container. They continue to state that a laptop search is so revealing and invasive that the Fourth Amendment requires agents to have some reasonable suspicion to justify the intrusion. The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed their disappointment in its statement: > The opinion is almost certainly wrong to classify laptop searches as no > different from other property searches. Fourth Amendment law constrains > police from conducting arbitrary searches, implements respect for social > privacy norms, and seeks to maintain traditional privacy rights in the face > of technological changes. This Arnold opinion fails to protect travelers in > these traditional Fourth Amendment ways. Other critics have cited that there are some documents and data that need to be legitimately kept secret or discreet, and are worried that there is nothing to prevent the officials involved in a search from disclosing this sensitive data. They give examples of trade secrets, acquisition plans, plans for a new product, security data about private customers.Mitchell Zimmerman, Privacy Alert: Gov't Rummaging Through Your Laptop's Contents? No Problem If You're Re-Entering USA, Says Ninth Circuit (Apr. 30, 2008). The concern is that officials in the process of searching may copy and leak this information without consent. Most are unwilling to trust government officials and employees to not misuse what they seize or negligently disclose confidential information. = Department of Homeland Security policies after Arnold = On August 1, 2008, the Washington Post reported that Department of Homeland Security policies allow federal agents to \\"take a traveler's laptop computer or other electronic device to an off-site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing.\\" Further, \\"officials may share copies of the laptop's contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation, data decryption or other reasons.\\" Senator Russell Feingold called these policies \\"truly alarming\\" and said that he intends to introduce legislation soon that would require reasonable suspicion for border searches, as well as prohibit profiling on race, religion, or national origin. Meanwhile, Ryan Singel of Wired.com recommended placing one's electronics and papers \\"in a first class U.S. mail envelope and stamp it‚Äîor even better mail it to yourself before the trip,\\" Ryan Singel, Border Laptop Searches? No Reason Needed, Wired.com (Aug. 1, 2008). since 'officers may not read or permit others to read correspondence contained in sealed letter class mail (the international equivalent of First Class) without an appropriate search warrant or consent'. However, this only applies to articles in the postal system, not to letters carried by individuals or private carriers such as DHL, UPS, or FedEx.U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Policy Regarding Border Search of Information (Jul. 16, 2008). =Travelers Privacy Protection Act= Senator Feingold, fellow Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, and Democratic Representative Adam Smith announced on September 26, 2008, that they had proposed a law to limit the searches of laptops or other electronic devices to cases where United States Customs and Border Protection officials have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity. The so-called Travelers' Privacy Protection Act would allow border agents to search electronic devices only if they had reasonable suspicions of wrongdoing. In addition, the legislation would limit the length of time that a device could be out of its owner's possession to 24 hours, after which the search becomes a seizure, requiring probable cause. This bill was introduced, but never became law due to the starting of the new 111th session of Congress.GovTrack.us, S. 3612: Travelers' Privacy Protection Act of 2008.

Its religious congregation was organized in 1731, and was originally called the Mortlake Society. Its first meeting house, built in 1734, was known as the Second Church in Pomfret. The present church as built in 1771-74; the town of Brooklyn was incorporated in 1786.

The building was restyled in 1845, relocating the entrance to a new tower on the side, building a full second floor at the gallery level, and replacing the box pews and pulpit. All of the interior changes were reversed in the late 20th century, restoring it to its original form. The tower, whose steeple was replaced after the New England Hurricane of 1938, was retained.

Today the term is sometimes confused with the European Quarter, as the area has come to be dominated by the institutions of the European Union and organisations dealing with them, although the two terms are not in fact the same, with the Leopold Quarter being a smaller more specific district of the municipalities of the City of Brussels, Etterbeek, Ixelles and Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. The West European City, Google Books The Leopold Quarter traditionally encompassed the area immediately south of the inner ring road, between the Namur Gate and Louvain Gate. Today it lies roughly between the ring road, Leopold Park, /, and /.Demey, 30 The district was created in 1837, soon after Belgian independence, as a prestigious residential area for the elite of the new Belgian capital, and was named after King Leopold I. The Globalized City, Google Books It remained the most prestigious residential address in the capital until the early 20th century when many of its former residents began to relocate to Brussels' newly developing suburbs. Starting at that time, but accelerating rapidly only after the 1950s, it increasingly became a business/institutional area and is today dominated by the EU's facilities. The quarter contains the European Parliament (with its building known as the Espace L√©opold) and other EU offices. Brussels and Europe, Google Books It is also a major financial district of Brussels. The Brussels-Luxembourg Station was formerly known as the Leopold Quarter Station before undergoing major rebuilding. Travel Brussels, Belgium, Google Books HistoryConstruction= The area south-east of the second walls of Brussels was largely rural until the 19th century. In the last years of Austrian rule, plans were mooted to build a new residential district outside of the crowded city walls, in the area which became the Leopold Quarter. When the walls were torn down in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, a plan was adopted to transform the area formerly occupied by the walls into a boulevard, which is today the inner ring road of Brussels. In the wake of the Belgian Revolution in 1830, the new members of the Belgian upper class hoped to create a new prestigious residential area in the capital. An official plan for the quarter was drawn up by Tilman-Francois Suys in 1838. The area was designed to emanate from Brussels' Park located behind the palace. The area was laid out on a grid in a traditional classical pattern. The Leopold Quarter was quickly developed and already had 500 residents by 1847. By 1853, the population had reached 3,212, most property owners or landed gentry with domestic staff.Demey, 43. Other typical residents included civil servants, military officers, members of liberal professions, embassy staff, and representatives of foreign companies. Saint Joseph's Church on Fr√®re Orban Square A railway station called Leopold Quarter Station (French: ) was built, along with a large square at the end of /, between 1854‚Äì1855. The station is today known as Brussels-Luxembourg Station, while the square is still known as Luxembourg Square. They had not been included in Suys' original plans, as the railroad was a new development in the 1830s in Belgium. Designed by Gustave Saintenoy, the station and the railway came to be a defining feature of the area's geography. In those days, the outer edge of the area was defined by the Maalbeek river valley, but in the 1850s plans were drawn up to build a bridge across it to connect Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat to the new military parade ground on the Linthout Plateau (today Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark).Demey, 49. The Eggevoorde Estate had dominated the Maelbeek valley since the Middle Ages, but portions had been sold off in the following centuries. In 1851, a portion was sold off in exchange for shares in the Zoological and Horticultural Society, and the area became what is today Leopold Park. The park was intended to be a home for scientific and leisure activities. Horticultural gardens and a zoo were created along with a community hall, a reading room, and a caf√©-restaurant. However, the zoo was poorly managed and the management company went bankrupt in 1876. The horticultural gardens on the other hand were quite successfully managed by Jean Linden, and they became a commercial and scientific success story until 1898, when they were sold. The City of Brussels bought the old Zoological gardens and they were converted into a public recreational park containing a variety of diversions, including the Museum of Natural Sciences. In 1884 Ernest Solvay and Paul H√©ger, professors at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles began a project to create an expanded university campus in the park. Several of the university's new institutes were created in the park, and stand to this day, including the original site of the Solvay Institute of Sociology. =20th century= The area is dominated today by medium rise office blocks dating from the last 50 years. The population of the area peaked around 1900.Demey, 72. By 1930 the population had declined by 30%. Railway connections, and then the rise in car ownership, allowed the wealthy residents to live further from the city in more open suburbs. The increasingly old fashioned mansions in the area, which were generally designed for use by families with the help of domestic servants, became increasingly difficult to maintain. Property developers started building apartments in the area in the 1920s and increasingly in the 1930s, initiating a gradual change in its architectural character.Demey, 428. Slowly at first, companies began purchasing unused mansions and adapting them to their use. Then after the Second World War, several insurance companies and colonial organisations began a trend toward demolishing the 19th century mansions and townhouses, and replacing them with new modern office blocks.Demey, 74. With changes to the road infrastructure of the inner ring road for the 1958 World's Fair the area became even more attractive to companies, being located between Brussels' administrative centre and the residential suburbs further out. With the growing economy, and then the arrival of the first European Institutions in the late 1950s, the area became a major target for property developers when building office space for institutional and corporate use. Brussels had no development plan, and did not enforce existing legal restrictions, so most remaining residents left during this time as it had become completely transformed from a formerly quiet residential area into a congested centre of transport and business.Demey, 75. =Recent redevelopment= In 1987, the old Leopold brewery was torn down in anticipation of the construction of what would become the Espace L√©opold, which was unofficially intended to house the European Parliament. Political and legal wrangling had continually delayed a final conclusion regarding the unofficial seat for the parliament. However, as Brussels hoped to keep all of the official institutions in Europe, provision was made for the construction of a suitable facility (see Brussels and the European Union). The construction of the massive facility changed the face of the district again, putting the above ground railway tracks of the Leopold Quarter train station below ground and renaming it as the Brussels-Luxembourg Station. The Place du Luxembourg, with what remains of the old Gare du Quartier L√©opold building centre, and the European Parliament behind. Place du Luxembourg retains some of the more traditional architectural elements of the Leopold Quarter, while the parliamentary complex dominates the now largely institutional area.

It was built in 1786 by Hasbrouck, grandson of Jean Hasbrouck, one of the original Huguenot settlers of the New Paltz area in the late 17th century, after he had moved out of the family home, two miles (3.2 km) to the south in what is today the Huguenot Street Historic District. A descendant of his lives in the house today, and it is believed to be the only 18th-century stone house in the New Paltz area continuously owned by the family that first built it. Hasbrouck's house shows sophistication and refinement befitting a large landholder who served as town supervisor and later in the American Revolutionary War. It is the culmination of the Dutch/Belgian-style stone houses that had been built all over Ulster County during the preceding century. His descendants found the house somewhat confining and, over several different generations, modified it in ways that reflected the changing tastes of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Property The house is located on a lot on the west side of the street. There are several outbuildings from the former farm, no longer in use for their original purpose. Its original section is the front block, a one-and-a-half-story with thick load-bearing stone walls. A porch covers the front entrance between two of the three pairs of windows; the upper story has two large, wooden gabled dormers added later, between the three small shed dormers remaining from the original house. In the rear is another later addition, a section called the \\"outlet\\", after the Dutch \\"uitlayt\\", a one-story stone enclosure wide across the entire rear section, with its own basement. The interior of the main block follows the standard 18th-century center-hall plan, with the kitchen on one side and the parlor on the other. The outlet is partitioned into five rooms, three connecting to the kitchen side of the house and two to the parlor. In the rear of the lot are three farm buildings: a granary that has since itself been converted into a house, a greatly deteriorated chicken coop, and a modern barn used for storing firewood. There is also a baseball field used for local Little League games on the southwest corner. None of those are considered contributing resources. An old well house behind the kitchen side is, as is the stone wall on the front and north side of the property. HistoryThe Hasbroucks in the 18th century= The land on which the house stands was originally part of Jean Hasbrouck's vast holdings in the area that is today the town and village of New Paltz and the surrounding lower Wallkill Valley. He died in 1714, thirteen years before the birth of Jacob Hasbrouck's youngest son, Jacob Jr., in 1727. Jacob lived in the family homestead with his father, as his older brothers moved out to the land their father had already planned to divide between them in his will. Jacob Jr. was originally to receive only cash and bonds, on the assumption he would inherit the family house, but shortly after the will was drawn up in 1747 Benjamin Hasbrouck, the oldest son, died in a fall from a horse. The document was quickly revised to give the younger Jacob title to the lands between the Wallkill and the mountains known today as the Shawangunk Ridge, considered the best in the Hasbrouck tract. Jacob the elder died in 1761 and the lands and house became his son's. The year afterward he served the first of two stretches as town supervisor. He continued to work with the other descendants of New Paltz's original Duzine (\\"Dozen\\") on the further subdivision and development of the original lands. In the early 1770s he returned as supervisor again, stepping down in 1776 when the war began as he had already been commissioned as a captain of the Second New Paltz Company of the Third Regiment of the Ulster County Militia. Three years later, he was promoted to major, and would forever after be known by that title in family histories to distinguish him from his father and his son, Jacob J. Hasbrouck. According to Hasbrouck family tradition, Major Hasbrouck built the house in 1786 for Jacob J., the younger of his two sons, to live in after he died, while his brother Josiah lived in the old house. The Major moved in to spend his later years there, no longer extensively involved in either farming the property or land deals, although an assessment done for the 1798 federal Direct Tax, when he still owned both houses, rated him the wealthiest man in New Paltz. He died in 1806, and passed the house to Jacob J. and his growing family. =19th century= The younger man needed more space, and built the rear extension known as the \\"outlet\\", from the Dutch uitlayt, a common term for that kind of extension in Dutch architecture. It was 12 feet (4 m) wide, running the entire width of the house and continuing the slope of the roof. Jacob left his initials in the plaster of the north wall interior. A neoclassical-styled archway was the main portal between the outlet and the main house. These renovations were complete by 1810. In 1825, Jacob J. Hasbrouck moved out to a brick farmhouse two miles (3.2 km) along the Wallkill to retire; his son, Maurice, took over the main stone house and devoted himself primarily to the farm, as most of the family's land had been subdivided and sold. He undertook no major renovations other than whatever routine maintenance the house needed, and moved out in 1870 when his own son, Abram, married and needed the space as his grandfather had before him. The house, by this time, was almost a century old and badly needed to be restored. The original Hasbrouck land parcels had long been divided up, leaving only , and the family had moved on to other sources of income. By the mid-19th century, tax assessments suggest that the stone houses that had symbolized their earlier wealth were losing their appeal as younger homeowners embraced newer styles. Abram's most visible changes, begun in 1876, were the two front window gables, adding a Picturesque aspect to the house, and an update to the front entranceway and the accompanying hall, although it is uncertain from the house today exactly what changes were made. The porch roof may have been changed to its flat hipped style, more consistent with tastes of the time. =20th century= Upon his death in 1910, the house passed to his daughter, Laura, and the woman he married after her mother had died. After her stepmother died in 1924, Laura began to spend more of her time at a house in the nearby village, reflecting the completion of the early aspirations of the Hasbroucks and other Duzine members. She sold half of the remaining land for houses after Route 32 was built through the property in the late 1920s. Eight years later, in 1932, she married and moved to Ossining, leaving the house to caretakers and returning to it only on weekends. Aware of the historic significance of the house, she became active in early local preservation efforts, and encouraged her caretaker, a Danish stonemason, to do some restoration work. He redid the walls (particularly the joints, removing any trace of earlier efforts) and the chimneys and fireplaces. Laura also had him build a new staircase inside, and remove the plaster ceilings to restore a more authentic original appearance to the house. In 1944, she sold the rest of the property save the two acres (8,000 m¬≤) around the house. The north end was remodeled into a caretaker's residence, although it had to be rebuilt to its original appearance after a fire destroyed it. Laura Hasbrouck died childless in 1964 and willed it to Richard Relyea Hasbrouck, a descendant of Maurice Hasbrouck's brother Huram, specifically to keep it in the family, since he had two sons already. He only found out when the estate's lawyer called and said he had to start paying taxes on the property. The newest Hasbrouck, like earlier residents, renovated the house to suit the needs of his family and his time. An interior frame wall was added to conserve heat in the old house, and a new kitchen was built. Thirty years after moving in, in 1994 one of the partitions in the outlet was removed to create a larger bedroom. He bought the with the old farm buildings on it, bringing the property to its current size. Aesthetics According to architectural historian Neil Larson, the house represents the culmination of Ulster County's traditional stone houses. Originally built on a European model for urban areas, they had been small rectangles similar to the Jean Hasbrouck House and the other older Huguenot Street homes, sometimes with their sides facing the street as in that neighborhood's Bevier House. As the children of the Duzine moved out into the surrounding lands, the houses evolved into farmhouses with a three-room plan, since builders could take advantage of larger lots. Using this form may have been a conscious choice on Major Hasbrouck's part to preserve his ancestral culture, since some of his contemporaries later built themselves homes in more English-influenced styles like Josiah Hasbrouck's Locust Lawn. The builder of Major Hasbrouck's house formalized this, providing a facade with continuous horizontal lines uniting all the family spaces. There are none of the vertical interruptions seen on other stone houses. The stones chosen were carefully dressed, although not to the point of making an ashlar pattern. The kitchen wing to the north was placed asymmetrically, to highlight its difference in function. Inside, the house was more in accord with traditional stone house, at least in its early years, in having little decoration save the doors and trim, since the Major despite his wealth and fame would have wanted to appear humble and pious. His son's efforts to change this by adding a decorated archway, plastering over the ceilings and using charcoal to marbleize some of the walls suggest he was uncomfortable with the already dated style of the house as well as its physical limitations to his family. A similar impulse may have been behind Maurice Hasbrouck's additions of distinctly contemporary features to the house later in the 19th century.

The old steam ferries were too small, too slow and burned too much coal for the company's liking; instead they opted for a new diesel ferry to be built. Construction started on the docks of Tinnoset in 1955 by Glommens Mek. Verksted, with completion the following year. Storegut became the main ferry for Norsk Transport, with Rjukanfoss and Ammonia as reserves‚ÄîStoregut was dimensioned to handle all the transport on her own. The older ships burned two and a half times the fuel, used an extra 25 minutes on the crossing, so in 1969 Rjukanfoss was stranded and dismounted. Heritage The ferry remained in service until the closing of the ferry service, after which she became docked at Tinnoset in an operational state, along with Ammonia. She is used as part of the heritage railway or for chartered trips.

The history of Batumi is inextricably bound with that of Adjara. Founded on the site of the Hellenic colony of Bathys, it was a small fortified town in the medieval kingdom of Georgia. In the 17th century, Batumi was conquered by the Ottoman Empire which relinquished its control of the town to the Russian Empire in 1878. It was under the Russian rule that Batumi became a major port city on the crossroads of Eurasia. After the successive Ottoman and British occupations at the end of World War I, Batumi and its region passed to the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1920. After the Sovietization of Georgia in 1921, Adjara was granted the status of an autonomous republic and Batumi became its capital. Along with Poti, Batumi is one of Georgia's most important ports. It is also an important cultural and political center. Early history Batumi is purported to be located on the site of one of the Greek colonies on the coast of Colchis. Its environs the ancient Greeks named Bathus Limen or Bathys Limen (i.e., \\"deep harbor\\", a description rightfully applicable to the gulf on which Batumi itself stands),Room, A.

The earliest archaeologically confirmed settlement on the territory of present-day Batumi dates to the 8th-7th century BC. It is located along the Karolitskhali River and centered on a hillock which is now popularly referred to as Tamar's Fortress after the medieval Georgian queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213). A number of unearthed imported items, fragments of amphorae among them, testify to the Greek influence there. The locale was a home to a Roman military fort during the reign of Hadrian (r. 117-138 AD), but was deserted for the fortress of Petra constructed under Justinian I (r. 527-565) on the site of the present-day Tsikhisdziri to the north of Batumi. Medieval Batumi The medieval history of Batumi, or Batomi as Georgians called it down to the early 20th century, is unremarkable and the town is scarcely mentioned in the contemporary sources. However, it reemerges in both Georgian and European accounts in the 15th century. The Venetian diplomats, Giosafat Barbaro and Ambrogio Contarini, call Batumi Vati or Vathi. Barbaro reports it being one of the two ports of the lord \\"Bendian\\" (the other being Sebastopolis, i.e., modern-day Sukhumi), while Contarini describes it as a maritime town centered on a fortress. The \\"Bendian\\" of Barbaro is apparently a corruption of Bediani, the title of the Dadiani princes who governed several western Georgian provinces under the increasingly nominal authority of the kings of Georgia. A curious incident occurred in 1444 when the Burgundian flotilla, after a failed crusade against the Ottoman Empire, penetrated the Black Sea and engaged in piracy along its eastern coastline until the Burgundians under the knight Geoffroy de Thoisy were ambushed during their landing raid at Vati/Batumi. De Thoisy was taken captive and released through the mediation of the emperor John IV of Trebizond. Ottoman control An Ottoman navy frigate in the port of Batum during the Crimean War. c. 1854 Ottoman troops in Batum A naval battle between the Russian and Turkish vessels off Batumi in 1878 After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the late 15th century, the town and district of Batumi passed to the Georgian noble house of Gurieli, Princes of Guria. In the reign of Kakhaber II Gurieli (1469‚Äì1483), the Ottomans occupied Batumi, but did not hold it. They returned in force a century later after the decisive defeat which they inflicted on the combined army of Georgian rulers at Sokhoista in 1545. Batumi was reclaimed, first by the prince Rostom Gurieli in 1564, who lost it soon afterwards, and again in 1609 by Mamia II Gurieli. However, the Ottoman naval blockade imposed on the western Georgian coast forced Mamia II into surrendering Batumi and Adjara to the Ottoman control in the treaty of 13 December 1614. Under the Ottoman government, the city was known as \\"Batoum\\" and was made a center of a sanjak that stretched from the Chrorokhi-Adjaristskali basin to Tsikhis-Dziri to the north of the city. With the Ottoman conquest the Islamization of the region, hitherto Christian, began and would be completed by the end of the 18th century. The Georgian geographer Prince Vakhushti (1696‚Äì1757) describes Batoum as a town with an excellent citadel, while the French consul Adrien Dupr√©, who visited the area in 1807, reports it being a large village with the population of 2,000 living in the houses scattered along the bay and in the nearby forests. Batoum had an active port, which was also a big center of the Caucasian slave-trade. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, the Russian imperial general Dmitri Osten-Sacken made an unsuccessful attempt to penetrate to Batoum by the valley of the Ajaris-Tskali, but he only reached Khulo, far east of Batoum. During the following two decades, the Ottoman government consolidated their hold of the Batoum area by eliminating the power of the Khimshiashvili, a local family of Muslim Georgian beys.Allen, WED. \\"The March- Lands of Georgia,\\" The Geographical Journal 74 (1929), pp. 142-3. In 1863, the Ottoman government decided to make Batoum a principal town of the Lazistan province and began the construction of a new town to north-west of the extant harbor. A new fort Burun-Tabiya was also built at the cape of Batoum. By 1872, Batum had the population of around 5,000. It was ruled by a chief administrator, mutasarrƒ±f, who was directly subordinated to the governor- general (wali) of Trabzon. The town was a home to the Italian, Russian, and Persian consulates and an increasingly lively trading center. Yet, it was a typical Asian town, with scattered houses and muddy streets. In spite of the tight Ottoman control, the Russian interest toward Batoum did not fade. In 1876, a thorough reconnaissance of the area was made by a Georgian scholar and colonel in the Russian service, Prince Giorgi Kazbegi, who left the only general account of the region available at that time. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the Ottomans had Batoum heavily fortified and successfully resisted the Russian amphibious attempts at capturing the town. However, an eventual defeat in the war forced the Sublime Porte to cede Batoum and Adjara, among other territories, to the Russian Empire in the Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878. This clause was confirmed, following dramatic negotiations, by the final act of the Congress of Berlin in July 1878. In exchange for acquiescing in a Russian acquisition of Batoum, the British Foreign Secretary Marquess of Salisbury persuaded the Russian diplomats to declare Batoum a free port, fortifications, naval arsenal, or naval station being forbidden.Medlicott, William Norton (1963), Congress of Berlin and After, pp. 102-3. Routledge, . Imperial Russian rule Port of Batumi in 1881 On 25 August 1878, the Russian army under General Dmitry Ivanovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky entered Batoum, and the Ottoman marshal Dervish-Pasha surrendered him a city key in Aziziye Square (modern-day Freedom Square). The town was declared a free port until 1886. It functioned as a center of a special military district until being incorporated in the Government of Kutaisi on 12 June 1883. Finally, on 1 June 1903, with the Okrug of Artvin, it was established as the region (oblast) of Batumi placed under the direct control of the General Government of Georgia. Batum was officially granted the city status and the right to elect the city council (duma) on 28 April 1888. On 2 September 1888, Gavronsky elected the first mayor of Batum. On 25 January 25, 1895, Prince Luka Asatiani, former mayor of Kutaisi, was elected a mayor of Batum. He was re-elected in 1898. He presided over several modernizing projects such and suddenly died in 1902. He was succeeded by Prince Ivane Andronikashvili, who remained on this post until 1916 when he moved to Tiflis. The expansion of Batumi began in 1883, with the construction of the Batumi-Tiflis-Baku railway completed in 1900 by the finishing of the Baku-Batumi pipeline. Henceforth Batumi became the chief Russian oil port in the Black Sea. The town expanded to an extraordinary extent and the population increased very rapidly: 8,671 inhabitants in 1882, and 12,000 in 1889. By 1902 the population was 16,000, with 1,000 of them oil refinery workers. War, Communism and Independence Batumi, winter of 1911 Early in the 1900s, Batumi became a focus of Social Democratic agitation, leading to a mass strike at the Rothschild oil refinery in March 1902. Stalin arrived in late 1901 setting up base in Ali, the Persian tavern. He got a job at the Rothschild's refinery. 1 January 1902 (Julian calendar ): Stalin made a speech to 30 party members shouting \\"We mustn't fear death! The sun is rising. Let's sacrifice our lives!\\"Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 76. 4 January: Stalin set the refinery on fire, the workers put it out meaning they are due a bonus which is refused. Stalin got a printing press from Tiflis and called a strike. 17 February: the strikers win a 30% pay increase. 26 February: 389 radical workers are sacked. Stalin calls a second strike. 7 March: strike leaders arrested. 8 March: Stalin leads demonstrations outside the police station demanding their release. The prisoners are moved to a transit prison. Governor general Smagin agrees to meet the demonstrators. 10 March: A mob tries to storm the prison but a renegade tips off the Cossacks and troops who fire on them though some prisoners escape. The events culminated in rioting in which the future Soviet leader Joseph Stalin played a role. The clashes with police left 15 dead, 54 wounded, and 500 in prison.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 79.Jones, Stephen F.

Harvard University Press, 12 March: the dead workers are buried triggering a 7,000 strong demonstration surrounded by Cossacks and gendarmes who ban songs and speeches.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 82 In 1910, the Russian authorities decided to dismantle the Mikhailovsky naval fortress at Batumi. In the period of 1912‚Äì1913, a gunboat was stationed permanently to keep a check on arms smuggling. Although the project to dismantle the Batum fortifications had not been completed by the beginning of World War I in 1914, the port still remained vulnerable to the powerful Ottoman-German vessels SMS Breslau and Goeben, which shelled Batum, without much effect, on December 7 and 10, respectively. Further, Batum's docks lacked the repair shops necessary for supporting and servicing any considerable naval force. In January 1915, the Batumi Naval Detachment was established to support the Russian ground operations against Trebizond.Allen, W.E.D. & Muratoff, P. (1953), Caucasian Battlefields: A History of The Wars on The Turco-Caucasian Border 1828‚Äì1921, p. 295. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ottoman military officer Enver Pasha, 1918, Batumi Unrest during World War I led to Turkey re-entering on 12 February 1918. On 3 March 1918, now Soviet Russia granted the Muslim population of Batumi, Kars and Ardahan the right of self-determination under the Ottoman suzerainty. The Transcaucasian delegation attempted to reverse the clause on the Trabzon conference of 14 March-5 April 1918, but failed to achieve any results. On 14 April 1918, the Ottoman army annexed Batum. The two subsequent rounds of negotiations between Turkey and Transcaucasian republics were held from 11‚Äì26 May and from 31 May to 4 June 1918, when Turkey forced the newly independent Democratic Republic of Georgia into surrendering Batum, Ardahan, Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki. In the context of anarchy spreading in the Caucasus, the Ottoman occupation was relatively well accepted by large parts of the local population, as demonstrated by available testimonies.Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, ‚Ä≥The Ottoman Occupation of Batumi, 1918: a view from below‚Ä≥, Caucasus Survey, 4:2, 2016, pp. 165-182. Early in 1919, the British took over and appointed General James Cooke-Collis as the governor of Batumi. They also created the Batumi council under the presidency of the Russian cadet Prlidian Maslov. On 14 April 1919, the governor disbanded the council and left the city in July 1920, ceding the entire region to Georgia. Demonstration in Batumi in 1917 Batumi was briefly occupied by Turkey during the Soviet invasion of Georgia in March 1921. On 18 March 1921, the city was recovered by Georgian troops, who then ceded its control to the arriving Soviets. Finally, in the treaty of Kars, Kemal Atat√ºrk ceded Batumi to the Bolsheviks, on the condition that it be granted autonomy, for the sake of the Muslims among Batumi's mixed population. Thus, it became the capital of the Adjar ASSR within the Georgian SSR. During the 1924 August Uprising in Georgia, Batumi remained relatively quiet. On 31 August 1924, the local cell of the anti-Soviet underground organization was destroyed; its leaders, including major general Giorgi Purtseladze (then the chief of staff of the Batum fortifications), were shot. During World War II, the city sent 12,258 soldiers in the Soviet army, and 4,728 never returned home. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Aslan Abashidze was appointed head of Adjara's governing council and subsequently held onto power throughout the unrest of the 1990s. Whilst other regions, such as Abkhazia, attempted to break away from the Georgian state, Adjara maintained an integral part of the Republic's territory. However, due to a fragile security situation, Abashidze was able to exploit the central government's weaknesses and rule the area as a personal fiefdom. In May 2004, he fled the region to Russia as a result of mass protests sparked by the Rose Revolution in Tbilisi. Present day Batumi in 2007 Batumi today is the main port of Georgia. It has the capacity for 80,000-tonne tankers to take materials such as oil. This oil originates from Azerbaijan and is shipped all over the world. Smaller oil exports also come from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Additionally the city exports regional agricultural products. Since 1995 the freight conversion of the port has constantly risen, with an approximate 8 million tonnes in 2001. The annual revenue from the port is estimated at between $200 million and $300 million. Since the change of power in Adjara, Batumi has attracted several international investors with real estate prices in the city trebling since 2001. Kazakh investors have reportedly invested $100 million to purchase more than 20 hotels in the Adjara region of Georgia. Construction of a number of new hotels will be launched in Adjara's Black Sea resorts starting from 2007. Batumi was also host to the Russian 12th Military Base. Following the Rose Revolution, the central government pushed for the removal of these forces, and in 2005 an agreement with Moscow was reached. According to the agreement, the process of withdrawal was planned to be completed in a course of 2008, but the Batumi base was officially handed over to Georgia on 13 November 2007, ahead of planned schedule.Russia Hands Over Batumi Military Base to Georgia.

The Alumni House, formerly known as the Bright House, is a 19th-century building located on the College of William & Mary's campus in the middle of historic Williamsburg, Virginia.Alumni House history ‚Äì wm.edu . Accessed April 22, 2008. The home was originally situated on a farm called \\"New Hope\\" owned by Samuel Bright and his family and at that time on the outskirts of the town. History At one time original portions of the house were thought to date back to 1871, but recent research has pushed the date back some years. A newly found watercolor of the campus, however, revealed that the Alumni House is probably an antebellum structure. \\"A long-lost panoramic watercolor of Williamsburg painted by a Union mapmaker, Robert Knox Sneden,\\" was found and dates from August 1862 after the Battle of Williamsburg during the American Civil War. Some of Sneden‚Äôs watercolors have proven to be inaccurate, as may be the case of this watercolor, which was drawn several years later from a sketch Sneden had prepared when on campus in 1862. The Italianate towers in his sketch of the college building are accurate, but Sneden misnamed The Brafferton and the President's House, also on the front campus, apparently confusing them with the front buildings at the Governor's Palace. At the far right of the Sneden watercolor is possibly the Bright House. On the two-story building Sneden drew a cupola in the Italianate style then in vogue (as in the 1859 version of William & Mary's main college building), but the cupola might indeed have been an embellishment. If the home depicted is the Bright House then the building was probably built sometime in the 18950s. The Alumni House would be one of only several buildings on the College's campus to have witnessed, first-hand, a Civil War battle in Williamsburg. During the house‚Äôs existence, it has been home to the William & Mary Kappa Alpha Order fraternity from 1925-1943. The College purchased the home in 1946 and until the late 1960s was the home to some faculty members. By that time the building's interior was converted into apartments. The Bright House became the Alumni House in 1972 after the Society of the Alumni, (now the W&M; Alumni Association) embarked on a campaign to raise funds for renovations. Despite the modifications, the house's exterior still retains a mid-19th century identity. The Alumni House was expanded and renovated with celebrations marking the new facility held on Homecoming on Oct. 25, 1997. Construction will begin in 2018 on a major new addition to Alumni House that will add 35,000 square feet to the current building's nearly 20,000 square feet. The new facility, however, will retain and preserve the character of the 19th-century home. There will be a new entrance and reception area, event space to accommodate up to 800 people, a lounge and business center and outdoor improvements such as a new terrace, enclosing garden area and plaza.

Eurotechno refers to the musical soundtrack by English group Stakker for their 1989 experimental short film of the same name. The original film was an avant-garde experiment in the audiovisual videola genre and features rapidly shifting colourful computer graphics, reflecting the influence of rave culture. Although the visuals of the film were primarily the work of Stakker members Marek Pytel, Mark McClean and Colin Scott, the musical soundtrack was largely the work of Brian Dougans, later of The Future Sound of London. The 25-minute soundtrack was recorded using a Roland TB-303, and reflects the fast-shifting momentum of the film by incorporating fragmented elements of acid house, Chicago house and Detroit techno that shift after their brief appearances, thus contributing to an intricately layered style. The film was released by Virgin Video Music in 1989 and became influential on other film-makers, although the soundtrack itself did not initially receive its own release. Over the years, the music proved influential on other producers, including Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. The latter released the soundtrack on CD and vinyl for the first time in January 2003 on his Rephlex label, which had been inspired by the music. The album received positive reviews for its early acid techno sound and was hailed as innovative. It was followed by another release of early Brian Dougans music, Sessions 84-88, later that year. Film Eurotechno was a 1989 film created by video artists Stakker, made up of Mark Mclean, Marek Paytel and Colin Scott. The 30-minute film was an early example of the audiovisual videola genre, where sound and vision are created concurrently to become components of the same work. One of the British rave scene's earliest visual projects, the film was a \\"massive statement\\" that explored possibilities for audio-visual presentation, and featured colourful graphics, such as multi-coloured polygons, cut-and-pasted and edited with quick shifts. Future Music regard it as \\"one of those early, computery, weirdy, acidy colourful things.\\" Incorporating microcinematography from Sinclair Stammers Post Production, the film's innovative usage of colourisation was achieved using the CVI, Quantel Mirage and Quantel Encore. Music Technology magazine referred to the film as \\"audio-visual avant-garde.\\" Although Scott felt the film was built on \\"fairly random editing,\\" Pytel argued it to be a \\"formalist\\" work. The music and sound for Eurotechno was credited to Brian Dougans, McClean and Scott, with Dougans responsible for performing the music. He found a Roland TB-303 ‚Äì a synthesiser pivotal to acid house music ‚Äì in the basement of his college, and proceeded to feature it heavily in the production of the film's soundtrack. With its origins in the early days of Madchester, it was one of the producer's earliest projects. Dougan's 1988 acid house hit \\"Stakker Humanoid\\", regarded as one of the earliest examples of acid house to break into the mainstream, also originated from the producer's work with Stakker, and was described as a companion project. Released on VHS by Virgin Video Music in 1989, Eurotechno went on to become a \\"dance-culture classic\\" and a pioneering video for \\"bedroom digital production,\\" even influencing a television advertisement for Pot Noodle. The advertisement, which aired in 1992, was controversial for inducing seizures on several viewers. Composition The music on Eurotechno incorporates the Roland TB-303. The music of Eurotechno reflects the fragmented, fast-cut editing of the film by incorporating quick jumps between musical styles, including elements of Chicago house, Detroit techno, European dance music and foreshadows of Ibiza house. The 25-minute soundtrack is split into 21 tracks, with intentionally jarring edits between musical sections ensuring no recognisable patterns or beats last for much longer than a brief appearance. One journalist described the result as \\"a conveyor belt of sounds.\\" The soundtrack is intricately layered, and throughout the music are \\"squelchy\\" Roland TB-303 sounds, pounding grooves, build-ups and breakdowns, 'searing' techno and acidic bass lines. The sounds of the soundtrack reflect the acid house scene of the era. The liner notes of the album release refer to it as an acid techno record. The 21 tracks throughout the soundtrack are not individually titled, instead being numbered as different parts of \\"Eurotechno\\" on the album release. According to Andy Beta of Pitchfork, the frequencies in the music quickly distort into four-on-the-floor rhythms, but soon undergo \\"permutations\\" with \\"harsh powertools buzz\\" surrounding and cutting them. He compared the frenzy of \\"clashing sounds\\" to Carl Stalling cartoons, due to the soundtrack's preference for \\"the most absurd squiggles, rubbery yanks, and rhythmic juxtapositions possible within the different patches of synth sound and editing capabilities.\\" He described tracks 7-10‚Äìthe longest on the album‚Äìas forming the \\"core\\" of the soundtrack, with metallic, droning keyboards and unabated beats. Track 9 features an ambient style with TB-303 \\"squirts basso,\\" while track 10 features noises and processed vocals akin to early 808 State. Album release and reception Despite never originally receiving its own release, the music in Eurotechno proved influential. The music's tendency to eradicate recognisable patterns after a brief appearance proved influential on later day producers such as Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Bogdan Raczynski. For instance, track 9 has been cited as a predecessor to Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II. Aphex Twin's record label Rephlex was also influenced by the soundtrack, and agreed to re-release it after a period of unavailability. They remastered the music from the original tapes and, on 28 January 2003, released it for the first time on CD and vinyl. Rephlex soon followed it with a compilation of other Brian Dougan productions from the era, Sessions 84-88. The Wire called Eurotechno \\"an orgiastic 25 minute sequence of build ups, breakdowns, 303s and four to the floor beats.\\" They praised Rephlex for \\"rescuing this unique moment in the history of rave from its original fate.\\" Vice wrote that Replhex's reissue of the soundtrack was \\"[f]ar from an exercise in nostalgia,\\" and instead \\"more like a labor of love.\\" They referred to the soundtrack as an influential \\"acid lover's paradise\\" and wrote that, despite its short length, the album is \\"perfect for anyone looking to own a slice of dance-music history.\\" Christine Hsieh of Remix wrote that Eurotechno \\"still sounds fresh, new and innovative.\\" She commented that the release is \\"no nostalgic nod to the past,\\" but instead \\"a testament to the timeless quality of solid electronic music.\\" In a positive review for Pitchfork, Andy Beta noted the influence of the music on contemporary producers, and wrote that: \\"Either as a history lesson through the classic Acid noises of a decade back, or as just a good ol' mix, Eurotechno is still quite quick and efficient work, even for a time machine.\\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted that the release would appeal to dedicate fans of Dougans' later project The Future Sound of London. He wrote that while Eurotechno was \\"curious\\" and \\"very much of-its-time\\" in 1989, and had remained \\"not really all that deathless,\\" it maintained a \\"certain thrill\\" and was \\"good enough fun.\\" He felt parts of the music would anticipate Ibiza house. I. Khider of Exclaim! felt that, as an item of \\"audio anthropology,\\" Eurotechno is \\"fun and interesting to listen to.\\" Nonetheless, they wrote that the lack of \\"breadth\\" within the tracks meant that listeners would find it hard to engage with the music: \\"Just when the mind is about to wrap itself around a sumptuous rhythm or sound, a new track intrudes, resulting in a rather detached listening experience.\\" Uncut referred to the soundtrack as \\"[h]istoric stuff\\" in a three-star review.

This was Venus's fifth Wimbledon title and her seventh Grand Slam singles title overall. This was also the second time she won a Grand Slam tournament without losing a set. The top four seeds, Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankoviƒá, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova were in contention for the WTA No. 1 ranking. Ivanovic retained the top ranking despite losing in the third round to Zheng Jie. Jankoviƒá, Sharapova and Kuznetsova also lost in the first four rounds, it marked the first time in Wimbledon history that none of the top four women's seeds had advanced to at least the quarterfinals. Zheng's feat of reaching the semifinals made her the first Chinese player of either sex to reach a Grand Slam singles semifinal, and the first wild card ever to reach the semifinals of the women's singles event at Wimbledon. Zheng's win against Ana Ivanovic in the third round also made her the lowest-ranked player (ranked 133rd) to defeat a reigning world No. 1.

This article describes completely randomized designs that have one primary factor. The experiment compares the values of a response variable based on the different levels of that primary factor. For completely randomized designs, the levels of the primary factor are randomly assigned to the experimental units. Randomization By randomization, that is to say the run sequence of the experimental units is determined randomly. For example, if there are 3 levels of the primary factor with each level to be run 2 times, then there are 6! (where ! denotes factorial) possible run sequences (or ways to order the experimental trials). Because of the replication, the number of unique orderings is 90 (since 90 = 6!/(2!*2!*2!)). An example of an unrandomized design would be to always run 2 replications for the first level, then 2 for the second level, and finally 2 for the third level. To randomize the runs, one way would be to put 6 slips of paper in a box with 2 having level 1, 2 having level 2, and 2 having level 3. Before each run, one of the slips would be drawn blindly from the box and the level selected would be used for the next run of the experiment. In practice, the randomization is typically performed by a computer program. However, the randomization can also be generated from random number tables or by some physical mechanism (e.g., drawing the slips of paper). Three key numbers All completely randomized designs with one primary factor are defined by 3 numbers: * k = number of factors (= 1 for these designs) * L = number of levels * n = number of replications and the total sample size (number of runs) is N = k √ó L √ó n. Balance dictates that the number of replications be the same at each level of the factor (this will maximize the sensitivity of subsequent statistical t- (or F-) tests). Example A typical example of a completely randomized design is the following: * k = 1 factor (X1) * L = 4 levels of that single factor (called \\"1\\", \\"2\\", \\"3\\", and \\"4\\") * n = 3 replications per level * N = 4 levels √ó 3 replications per level = 12 runs =Sample randomized sequence of trials= The randomized sequence of trials might look like: X1: 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3 Note that in this example there are 12!/(3!*3!*3!*3!) = 369,600 ways to run the experiment, all equally likely to be picked by a randomization procedure. Model for a completely randomized design The model for the response is Y_{i,j} = \\\\mu + T_i + \\\\mathrm{random\\\\ error} with * Yi,j being any observation for which X1 = i (i and j denote the level of the factor and the replication within the level of the factor, respectively) * Œº (or mu) is the general location parameter * Ti is the effect of having treatment level i Estimates and statistical testsEstimating and testing model factor levels= * Estimate for Œº : \\\\bar{Y} = the average of all the data * Estimate for Ti : \\\\bar{Y}_i - \\\\bar{Y} with \\\\bar{Y}_i = average of all Y for which X1 = i. Statistical tests for levels of X1 are those used for a one-way ANOVA and are detailed in the article on analysis of variance.

It crosses the Dungeness River. The bridge was first constructed by the Seattle, Port Angeles, and Western Railway, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the Milwaukee Road) in 1916. Because of the ready availability of timber, the bridge was built of wood. This first bridge was replaced in 1930. The new bridge was also built of timber, and like its predecessor, is a through Howe truss 156 feet long and 22 feet high. Two wooden trestles are on the east and west approaches. After the Milwaukee Road's bankruptcy, the bridge was left abandoned. In 1992, volunteers began to work on the bridge and replace planking and created a bike trail. In 1995, the property surrounding the bridge was purchased by the Washington State Audubon Society, which then created the Dungeness River Center and a park, called Railroad Bridge Park. The bike path through the park and over the bridge is connected to the Olympic Discovery Trail, a rails-to-trails initiative. The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places due to its being one of the last timber Howe through-truss railroad bridges still remaining in Washington. In February 2015, due to high winds and rainfall, the Bridge's center collapsed. The repaired and improved bridge was reopened in March 2016. References Notes Bibliography *Soderberg, Lisa.

He represented Japan at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where he won gold in the team competition. Fujimoto won fame by continuing to compete in the team event right after severely injuring his right knee during his floor exercise. He scored 9.5 on the pommel horse and 9.7 on the still rings with the badly damaged knee, dismounting from the rings from eight feet above ground and keeping his balance after landing on his feet. One source has described the scene thus: that he \\"raised his arms in a perfect finish before collapsing in agony\\". video\\"Shun Fujimoto - a pioneer in taking one for the team\\" , official website of the 2008 Summer Olympics That account, however, is erroneous. Video of Fujimoto‚Äôs rings routine, including the dismount and immediate aftermath, is easily accessible on the internet, and it is unambiguously clear that, despite the physical agony of performing his routine and landing, he did not collapse after completing his dismount. Instead, immediately upon his landing, as Fujimoto‚Äôs knees bent to absorb the shock, his right knee started to give way, wobbling and almost collapsing. But he controlled his balance, taking a very slight hop on his left foot, bringing his feet together, straightening his legs and body to a fully upright position, and raising his arms to complete the landing posture. He then turned and walked from the apparatus, and down the steps from the competition platform. He was limping markedly, but made it back to his seat without ever collapsing.See, e.g., https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=4-tTphePDgY. Nevertheless, the dismount aggravated his already serious injury, dislocating his broken kneecap and tearing ligaments in his right leg. Doctors ordered him to withdraw from further competition or risk permanent disability.\\"A bad break for a courageous athlete\\", CNN\\"If Perspiration Could Be Quantified\\", Time, August 15, 1988 One doctor stated: :\\"How he managed to do somersaults and twists and land without collapsing in screams is beyond my comprehension.\\"\\"A bad break for a courageous athlete\\", CNN Fujimoto stated that he had not wanted to let his team down by revealing his injury.\\"A bad break for a courageous athlete\\", CNN His completing of the pommel horse and rings events enabled the team to win gold, defeating the team from the Soviet Union by a narrow margin.\\"Fujimoto caps Japanese success\\", BBC, September 29, 2000 Later, when asked whether he would do what he did again, he replied frankly, \\"No, I would not.\\"The Joy of Six: great Olympians The Guardian, 7 Aug 2008 Fujimoto's performing in spite of serious injury was humorously alluded to in The Simpsons episode, \\"Lisa's First Word\\".

He was praetor peregrinus in 189 BC, responsible for Roman interests in foreign affairs; and consul in 186 BC.Livy, 37, 47, 50 In his consulship the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was passed, reforming the mystery cult of Bacchus in Rome and among her close allies on the Italian mainland. In Livy's account, this was a reaction to various abominable crimes committed by members of the cult, and its threat to the Roman state.Livy, 39, 6, 11, ff; cf Valerius Maximus, 6, 3. ¬ß 7; Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, 33 More likely, the legislation represents an attempt by Postumius and the senate to impose traditional Roman values and collective authority over a well organised, unofficial civil and religious association that seemed dangerously popular, widespread and potentially subversive. The legislation followed close after a particularly traumatic and turbulent period in Rome's history;During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed by Rome, but on a much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself.

It transports natural gas from the Czech‚ÄìGerman and Austrian‚ÄìGerman borders to the German‚ÄìFrench border. History Construction started in 1975 when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France formed a partnership (Mittel-Europ√§ische- Gasleitungsgesellschaft) for transportation of Russian natural gas to France and southern Germany. The pipeline was commissioned in 1980. The pipeline cost ‚Ç¨634 million. In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez, now Engie and E.ON ‚Ç¨553 million each due to collusion on the MEGAL pipeline. Commission officials claimed there was a deal between the two groups‚Äô predecessor companies ‚Äì Gaz de France and Ruhrgas ‚Äì not to sell gas sent via MEGAL into each other's home markets dating from the mid-1970s. The Commission alleged that the companies maintained these arrangements after European gas markets were liberalised despite knowing that the 1975 deal violated competition rules. They are the second largest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first on the energy sector. The decision is contested by both companies, who argue that the business rules in 1975 differed from those of today. In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded arrangements according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005. Technical description The pipeline system is long. It comprises two interconnected pipelines‚ÄîMEGAL Nord and MEGAL S√ºd. The MEGAL Nord pipeline consists of two parallel pipelines with a length of and from Waidhaus to Medelsheim. It is operated at a pressure of 80 bar (1,160 psi), which is secured by three compressor stations. The capacity of the pipeline is 22 billion cubic metres (777 billion cubic feet) of natural gas per year, or a little more than 60 million cubic metres (2 billion cubic feet) per day. The -long MEGAL S√ºd pipeline between Oberkappel and Schwandorf is operated at a pressure of 67.5 bar (979 psi), which is secured by two compressor stations. The connecting pipeline between MEGAL Nord and MEGAL S√ºd is long and it is connected in Rothenstadt and Schwandorf. The MEGAL pipeline crosses the Trans Europa Naturgas Pipeline and the Remich pipeline at Mittelbrunn, the SETG (pipeline from the German-Dutch border) at Gernsheim, and the pipeline going to the Ruhr Industrial Area at Rimpar. Ownership The pipeline is owned by Open Grid Europe (51%) and GRTgaz Deutschland (subsidiary of GRTgaz ‚Äì 49%). It is operated by Open Grid Europe.

It was formed in 1949 as a traditional Welsh singing choir and is based in Pwllgwaun, a suburb of Pontypridd. The choir performs frequently both in Pontypridd and overseas, and has visited Poland, Ireland, the United States and Germany. It has a long-term link with Liederkranz Oberensingen, a male choir from Oberensingen, a northern suburb of Pontypridd's twin town, N√ºrtingen, in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, southwest Germany. It has also performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and took part in the HTV male choral competition. The choir is currently broadening and improving its repertoire to provide a wide-ranging concert program. A member of the National Association of Choirs, the Welsh Association of Male Choirs and the Welsh Amateur Music Federation, it is also a past winner of the HTV Male Choral Competition and at the National Eisteddfod of Wales. HistoryFoundation and early years= C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd was founded following a meeting of a small group of men at the Educational Settlement of the town's YMCA on 19 November 1949. During its early years the choir was known as the Pontypridd Educational Settlement Male Choir. Gwilym T Jones, who at the time was a conductor and pianist, became its first conductor. He had previously conducted choirs including Cwmparc Male Voice Choir, Royal Welsh Male Choir and Treorchy and District Male Voice choir. In 1926, he began conducting for Pontypridd and District Male Voice Choir. Two years later he also began conducting for Llanharan Male Voice Choir. The choir was formed on 29 November 1949 by a group of 19 choristers under the name of \\"The Pontypridd Educational Settlement Male Choir\\". Gwilym T Jones was appointed conductor and Miss Agnes Wilson accompanist. The first concert was performed in June 1950. The following year the choir started entering competitions, and were awarded first prize at the Llanharan \\"Semi National\\" Eisteddfod, and were again placed first two weeks later at Glynneath. Llanharan \\"Semi National\\" Eisteddfod C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd awarded First place The choir were involved in celebrations of the centenary of the composition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau and the bicentenary of the Old Bridge, Pontypridd. Stuart Burrows was the guest artiste at a concert in 1959, and in the same year Harry Secombe and Geraint Evans appeared together for the first time, with W.J. Evans (Geraint's father) conducting the choir. The choir's first concert was a private one for the Cilfynydd Old Age Pensioners in the summer of 1950. In November of that year the choir performed in the Shelley Hall at their first annual concert. A month later the choir gave the first of its 14 consecutive Christmas night concerts at the old Graig Hospital. It became a tradition that the choir was entertained to Christmas cake and tea by the Hospital Administrator. The concerts stopped with the reconstruction of the hospital in 1965. The first competition the choir entered was a semi-national eisteddfod held at Llanharan on 23 June 1951. They were awarded first prize and there was a report about them in the Pontypridd Observer. By the time of the choir's second annual concert in November 1951, they were known as the Pontypridd and District YMCA Male Voice Choir. They made their first BBC recording in June 1956. It featured in a programme about the centenary of the composition of the music for Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau and the bicentenary of the building of the Old Bridge. A major concert was also held as part of the celebrations in the Town Hall. This was the last concert that Gwilym T Jones conducted. He died on 31 December 1956 and a plaque to his memory was unveiled in the Shelley Hall in September 1957. Following his death, William J. Evans, father of the opera singer Sir Geraint Evans, was appointed leader of the choir in January 1957. Previously, he had formed the Handel Glee Party in 1932 that won prizes at eisteddfodau. He had also formed the Cilfynydd Philharmonic Choir in 1950. Under his guidance, Pontypridd and District YMCA Male Voice Choir's performances attracted large audiences. The choir performed alongside Sir Harry Secombe and Sir Geraint Evans at the Town Hall Theatre, Pontypridd in November 1959. They won several first prizes at semi-national eisteddfodau. The following year the choir relinquished its connection with the YMCA and its title became the Pontypridd Male Choir. However, by the time William J Evans retired as conductor in January 1964 the choir was known as C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd. His successor as musical director in 1964 was Miss Joyce Durston, the choir's accompanist since 1957. Dorothy Ingram (n√©e Davies) was appointed accompanist. Joyce had led the choir during William Evans' illness, and had previously been the conductor of the Christie Singers, a choir of 24 girls. The choir won the semi-national eisteddfod at Cardigan in May 1964, their first eisteddfod appearance under her conductorship. They went to Germany on their first foreign tour in September 1965 and gave a series of concerts in N√ºrtingen, the twin town of Pontypridd, as guests of the Liederkranz Oberensingen, a male voice choir. The following year, the Liederkranz made a return visit to Pontypridd. In 1966 the choir came second in the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Newtown. The choir's tours continued; during their early foreign tours, they received a request in August 1968 from West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger to perform at his private palace, Bebenhausen Palace near Stuttgart. The performance was later shown on television. =1970s and 80s= 1970 was the 21st birthday of the choir and a celebration dinner at the Tabernacl Chapel was arranged in November, with patrons Sir Geraint Evans and Stuart Burrows, together with president P. Raymond Jones and vice presidents and civic dignitaries attending. A telegram of congratulation from Stuart Burrows was read out. In 1972, C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd was one of twelve choirs to perform at the 1,000 voices concert at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1973 the choir took part in the H.T.V. Male Choral Competition. Twelve choirs were in the opening knock-out round and the finalists were Cwmbach and Pontypridd. In the final in the H.T.V. Studios, Pontypridd won. In June 1973, members of the choir were invited to appear on stage with Marlene Dietrich after she heard them sing outside the New Theatre, Cardiff, where she was appearing. Later that month they competed against twelve other male choirs from Wales, and became the first choir to win a choral competition on television. They were presented with the HTV trophy and a cheque for ¬£250. 1973 was the choir's silver jubilee year. In 1974 they won the competition for male choirs between 40 and 70 voices at the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Carmarthen, their first victory in this event. It was also the first time in the event's history that a choir led by a woman conductor won. In 1975 a Polish choir, \\"Zzk Henjau\\", visited Pontypridd. Pontypridd choir visited Poland in 1976 as guests of \\"Zzk Henjau\\". Joyce Durston resigned in November 1977, and Dorothy Davies Ingram (accompanyist since 1964) became musical director and Jonathan Gulliford succeeded her as accompanist. Dorothy had previously been a member of the Shelley Singers. She made her debut as the choir's musical director at the Festival of 1,000 Voices at the Afan Lido, Aberavon in December 1977. The choir won the Knight of St. David Memorial Bowl at the Rhymney Valley Eisteddfod, and retained it the following year. In 1989 Dorothy became the first woman to conduct the 1,000 voices in the Royal Albert Hall and after 11 years as conductor to C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd, changed her role to become deputy conductor and accompanist, with Jonathan Gulliford becoming director of music. 1989 was also the choir's 40th anniversary. As part of the celebrations the choir appeared in a gala concert with Liederkranz Obersingen of N√ºrtingen in July at the Hawthorn Leisure Centre. Also in 1989, Dorothy Davies-Ingram decided to change her role, and became both deputy conductor and accompanist, while Jonathan Gulliford became director of music. =Recent times= The John Tree Award scheme, contributed to by R.T.J. Tree, choir president, was launched in 1991. The objective of the scheme is to link local schools and the choir. Annual prizes are awarded to musicians/singers at Pontypridd schools, based on talent. Award winners take part in the choir's annual celebrity concert. More recently, C√¥r Meibion Pontypridd have participated in tours. They travelled to the United States in the year of their 50th anniversary in 1999 and returned four years later. They hosted a five-day visit by Liederkranz Obersingen in 2005 to celebrate a 40-year history of friendship between the two choirs. In 2008 the choir staged successful concerts in Cyprus, and this year they will again visit N√ºrtingen.

History From The Mayor of MacDougal Street: \\"As for the jug band, that came about more or less by accident. One weekend Max Gordon, the owner of the Village Vanguard, was in Cambridge for some reason, and he walked by the Club 47 and saw this huge line of people waiting to get in to see the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. In his mind's eye he transposed this queue to 7th Avenue South, where he had his room, and visions of sugarplums started dancing in his head. So when he got back to New York, he called Robert Shelton and said, \\"Are there any jug bands around town?\\" Bob said, \\"Well, yeah, but what you really ought to do is get hold of Dave Van Ronk and have him put one together.\\" So he did, and I did. I called up a bunch of friends, and we formed the Ragtime Jug Stompers. Sam Charters was back in town, so he was our Pooh- Bah and Lord High Everything Else‚Äîhe sang, arranged, and played washtub bass, washboard, jug, and occasionally would lend a hand on guitar. Barry Kornfeld played banjo and guitar. Artie Rose was on mandolin, and also played some fine Dobro. Finally, Danny Kalb, who had been a student of mine, played lead guitar and some very nice harmonica. (We also made him sing bass on \\"K.C. Moan,\\" because he was the youngest and none of us wanted to do it.) It was a very flexible band because the musicians were all good enough to double or triple on various instruments, plus it had all the possibilities offered by kazoos and that sort of thing, so it was capable of more than one kind of sound.\\" It was re-released on CD in Japan in 2003 by Universal.[ Allmusic entry for reissue.] Accessed May 31, 2009 Reception Writing for Allmusic, music critic Richard Meyer wrote \\"This wild and unrestrained collection of blues, jazz and blues standards makes Van Ronk's Red Onion album sound positively subdued.

It is not intended to be all-inclusive.  Concerned fields  *Statistics *Experimental design *Estimation theory  Glossary  * Alias: When the estimate of an effect also includes the influence of one or more other effects (usually high order interactions) the effects are said to be aliased (see confounding). For example, if the estimate of effect D in a four factor experiment actually estimates (D + ABC), then the main effect D is aliased with the 3-way interaction ABC. Note: This causes no difficulty when the higher order interaction is either non-existent or insignificant. * Analysis of variance (ANOVA): A mathematical process for separating the variability of a group of observations into assignable causes and setting up various significance tests. * Balanced design: An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations. * Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. Note: the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization. * Center Points: Points at the center value of all factor ranges. * Coding Factor Levels: Transforming the scale of measurement for a factor so that the high value becomes +1 and the low value becomes -1 (see scaling). After coding all factors in a 2-level full factorial experiment, the design matrix has all orthogonal columns. Coding is a simple linear transformation of the original measurement scale. If the \\"high\\" value is Xh and the \\"low\\" value is XL (in the original scale), then the scaling transformation takes any original X value and converts it to (X ‚àí a)/b, where a = (Xh \\\\+ XL)/2 and b = (Xh‚àíXL)/2. To go back to the original measurement scale, just take the coded value and multiply it by b and add a or, X = b √ó (coded value) + a. As an example, if the factor is temperature and the high setting is 65¬∞C and the low setting is 55¬∞C, then a = (65 + 55)/2 = 60 and b = (65 ‚àí 55)/2 = 5. The center point (where the coded value is 0) has a temperature of 5(0) + 60 = 60¬∞C. * Comparative design: A design that allows the (typically mean-unbiased) estimation of the difference in factor effects, especially for the difference in treatment effects. The estimation of differences between treatment effects can be made with greater reliability than the estimation of absolute treatment effects. * Confounding: A confounding design is one where some treatment effects (main or interactions) are estimated by the same linear combination of the experimental observations as some blocking effects. In this case, the treatment effect and the blocking effect are said to be confounded. Confounding is also used as a general term to indicate that the value of a main effect estimate comes from both the main effect itself and also contamination or bias from higher order interactions. Note: Confounding designs naturally arise when full factorial designs have to be run in blocks and the block size is smaller than the number of different treatment combinations. They also occur whenever a fractional factorial design is chosen instead of a full factorial design. * Control group: a set of experimental units to which incidental treatments are applied but not main treatments. For example, in applying a herbicide as one treatment, plots receiving that treatment might be driven over by a machine applying the herbicide but treatments not receiving the herbicide would not normally be driven over. The machine traffic is an incidental treatment. If there was a concern that the machine traffic might have an effect on the variable being measured (e.g. death of strawberry plants), then a control treatment would receive the machine traffic but no herbicide. Control groups are a way of eliminating the possibility of incidental treatments being the cause of measured effects. The incidental treatments are controlled for. Compare treatment groups. A treatment that is only the absence of the manipulation being studied is simply one of the treatments and not a control, though it is now common to refer to a non-manipulated treatment as a control. * Crossed factors: See factors below. * Design: A set of experimental runs which allows you to fit a particular model and estimate your desired effects. * Design matrix: A matrix description of an experiment that is useful for constructing and analyzing experiments. * Design of Experiments: A systematic, rigorous approach to engineering problem-solving that applies principles and techniques at the data collection stage so as to ensure the generation of valid, defensible, and supportable engineering conclusions http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section3/pmd31.htm * Design Point: A single combination of settings for the independent variables of an experiment. A Design of Experiments will result in a set of design points, and each design point is designed to be executed one or more times, with the number of iterations based on the required statistical significance for the experiment. * Effect (of a factor): How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect. A treatment effect may be assumed to be the same for each experimental unit, by the assumption of treatment-unit additivity; more generally, the treatment effect may be the average effect. Other effects may be block effects. (For a factor A with two levels, scaled so that low = -1 and high = +1, the effect of A has a mean-unbiased estimator that is evaluated by subtracting the average observed response when A is -1 from the average observed response when A = +1 and dividing the result by 2; division by 2 is needed because the -1 level is 2 scaled units away from the +1 level.) * Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. See Errors and residuals in statistics. Note: experimental designs typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error. * Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied. For example, an experimental unit can be a ** PC board ** silicon wafer ** tray of components simultaneously treated ** individual agricultural plants ** plot of land ** automotive transmissions ** etc. * Factors: Process inputs that an investigator manipulates to cause a corresponding change in the output. Some factors cannot be controlled by the experimenter but may affect the responses. These uncontrolled factors should be measured and used in the data analysis, if their effect is significant. Note: The inputs can be discrete or continuous. ** Crossed factors: Two factors are crossed if every level of one occurs with every level of the other in the experiment. ** Nested factors: A factor \\"A\\" is nested within another factor \\"B\\" if the levels or values of \\"A\\" are different for every level or value of \\"B\\". Note: Nested factors or effects have a hierarchical relationship. * Fixed effect: An effect associated with an input variable that has a limited number of levels or in which only a limited number of levels are of interest to the experimenter. * Interaction: Occurs when the effect of one factor on a response depends on the level of another factor(s). * Lack of fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Note: Including replication in a designed experiment allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error. * Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors. * Nested Factors: See factors above. * Orthogonality: Two vectors of the same length are orthogonal if the sum of the products of their corresponding elements is 0. Note: An experimental design is orthogonal if the effects of any factor balance out (sum to zero) across the effects of the other factors. * Paradigm: a model created given the basic design, the hypothesis and the particular conditions for the experiment. * Random effect: An effect associated with input variables chosen at random from a population having a large or infinite number of possible values. * Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Note: Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Note: Random error is also called experimental error. * Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a designed experiment such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs. Note: The importance of randomization cannot be over stressed. Randomization is necessary for conclusions drawn from the experiment to be correct, unambiguous and defensible. * Regression discontinuity design: A design in which assignment to a treatment is determined at least partly by the value of an observed covariate lying on either side of a fixed threshold. * Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Note: Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error. * Resolution: In fractional factorial designs, \\"resolution\\" describes the degree to which the estimated main-effects are aliased (or confounded) with estimated higher-order interactions (2-level interactions, 3-level interactions, etc.). In general, the resolution of a design is one more than the smallest order interaction which is aliased with some main effect. If some main effects are confounded with some 2-level interactions, the resolution is 3. Note: Full factorial designs have no confounding and are said to have resolution \\"infinity\\". For most practical purposes, a resolution 5 design is excellent and a resolution 4 design may be adequate. Resolution 3 designs are useful as economical screening designs. * Response(s): The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s). * Response surface: A designed experiment that models the quantitative response, especially for the short-term goal of improving a process and the longer-term goal of finding optimum factor-values. Traditionally, response-surfaces have been modeled with quadratic-polynomials, whose estimation requires that every factor have three levels. * Rotatability: A design is rotatable if the variance of the predicted response at any point x depends only on the distance of x from the design center point. A design with this property can be rotated around its center point without changing the prediction variance at x. Note: Rotatability is a desirable property for response surface designs (i.e. quadratic model designs). * Scaling factor levels: Transforming factor levels so that the high value becomes +1 and the low value becomes -1. * Screening design: A designed experiment that identifies which of many factors have a significant effect on the response. Note: Typically screening designs have more than 5 factors. * Test plan: a written document that gives a specific listing of the test procedures and sequence to be followed. * Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments. * Treatment combination: The combination of the settings of several factors in a given experimental trial. Also known as a run. * Treatment group: see Control group * Variance components: Partitioning of the overall variation into assignable components.

Playing career Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Curry joined the Virginians during the season, and pitched in just two games, both of which were complete game losses. The first game was a 4-5 loss to the Philadelphia Athletics on August 6, and the other game was a 2-9 loss to the Brooklyn Grays on August 8. He never pitched in the major leagues again, and his spot in the pitching rotation was occupied by Pete Meegan for the remainder of the season. Umpire career Curry began his major league umpiring career in , a year after his playing career had ended, when he signed with the National League. He umpired 39 games that first season, and 51 games the following season, also with the National League. For the season, he umpired in the American Association, also a major league at the time, and umpired 61 games, all of which, as were his first two seasons, were as the sole umpire on the field, as was the practice. That season in the Association saw Curry make a controversial call, yet it led to the institution of an official rule which still lasts to this day. The play in question happened in a game that pitted the Louisville Colonels against the Brooklyn Grays, when during the game, Louisville's Reddy Mack crossed home plate after a teammate had hit safely. After Mack had crossed the plate, he deliberately interfered with Brooklyn's catcher long enough so that two other Colonels had also crossed the plate. Since Mack had prevented the catcher from making any further plays, Curry ruled that the first baserunner after Mack to score was out, and then disallowed the other run that followed. The rules stated, at the time, that a baserunner could not interfere with a fielder, but Mack argued that since he had scored, he was no longer a baserunner, therefore he was not in violation of any rules. Curry's decision, although not in the rules, demonstrated that the evolution of the game's rules sometimes has to be made at the moment to protect the game's integrity. The rule that came from this decision is now Rule 7.09(e). The next season Curry umpired at the major league level was in in the National League, calling a career-high 110 games, 16 as the field umpire when both major leagues began to experiment with a two- umpire system, one behind the catcher, and one behind the pitcher. In , Curry returned to the Association and umpired 56 games. After that season, he did not return to the majors again until when he umpired 62 games in the National League, 52 of them in the field. His six-year career totals include 382 games, with 72 in the field, and he was behind the plate for a no-hitter on August 29, 1885, when Charlie Ferguson of the Philadelphia Quakers threw his gem against the Providence Grays.

His volunteer work in the First World War subsequently forced him to stop practising at the bar. After the end of the war, for his work at the peace conference Atkinson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. Atkinson re-established his practice and was made Director of Public Prosecutions in March 1930. His period in office is generally seen as a success, and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1932. Following his retirement, Atkinson served as chairman of the Central Price Regulation Committee, dying on 26 December 1957. Life Atkinson was born in Shortlands, Kent,1911 England Census one of five children of Henry Tindal Atkinson, a county court judge, and his wife, Marion Lewin. His sister, Maud Tindal Atkinson, became a noted artist and illustrator. After studying at Harrow School, Atkinson matriculated to Trinity College, Oxford, where he was known by his friends as \\"Tatters\\". After gaining a third in classics and a second in modern history in 1899 and 1901 respectively, he joined the Middle Temple, where he was called to the Bar in 1902. Atkinson built up a substantial practice on the South Eastern Circuit dealing with local government and taxation cases. In 1913, he was elected to the Bar Council, where he served until 1921. During the First World War, he was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 12 November 1917, attached to the Royal Naval Air Service, but reporting to the Air Section of Naval Intelligence. Commission as lieutenant, RNVR. This first appointment did not last long, transferring on 23 November to the secretariat of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee. He transferred to the nascent Royal Air Force in 1918 as a captain, and he was an acting major from 19 April 1918 to 31 May 1919. Acting major. He ceased to be actively employed with the RAF on 17 June 1919. Transfer to inactive list, RAF.

His fears lessened over time, particularly after he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1932 King's Birthday Honours. Appointment as KCB. At the start of the Second World War he helped prepare the defence regulations, and was directly involved in all the spying cases. Atkinson retired in 1944 and became chairman of the Central Price Regulation Committee, where he remained until its dissolution in April 1953.

Reinsnes) (born 4 October 1904, died 12 March 1976) was a Norwegian politician (Norwegian Labour Party), mayor of the Sortland municipality, county mayor of Nordland, and a member of the Storting. Petter Ovald Karlsen (later Petter Carl Reinsnes) was born in the Reinsnes district of Sortland municipality. He was elected into Sortland municipal council in the fall of 1931, and became mayor in 1935. He was removed from office by the Nazis in 1941, during the German occupation of Norway, and in 1944 he was forced to escape to Sweden. When the war was over, he returned to the Sortland municipality, and worked as mayor until 1959. His party, the Norwegian Labour Party, lost the municipal election in 1959, and Reinsnes consequently lost his position as mayor. Reinsnes retained his position on the municipal council. After the election in 1963, he was chosen to become the mayor again, and kept this position until 1975. He was also chairman of Nordland county council from 1945 to 1960, deputy county mayor from 1966 to 1970 and county mayor of Nordland in 1971. From 1954‚Äì1957 Reinsnes served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway. He was then voted into Parliament in 1957 and remained there for two periods (eight years). During both terms, Reinsnes was a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign and Constitutional Affairs and the Enlarged Committee on Foreign and Constitutional Affairs. He campaigned for the construction of an agriculture school in Vester√•len, and he was a chairman for Vester√•lens power group from the start in 1939 until his death in 1976. In the 1960s, he took the initiative to connect the islands in Vester√•len by a bridge. The And√∏y and Kvalsaukan Bridges were opened in 1974, and Sortland Bridge was opened in 1975. Hadsel Bridge was opened in 1978, after his death. He was a chairman in Vester√•lsbruene A/S from 1970 until his death. Reinsnes was also engaged in work to obtain an airport for Vester√•len. Stokmarknes Airport was opened in 1972. Reinsnes was awarded th King's Medal of Merit in gold a short time before his death. He died 12 March 1976 of cancer.

Originally known as the Georgia Tech National Alumni Association, it was chartered in June 1908 and incorporated in 1947. Its offices have been in the L. W. \\"Chip\\" Roberts, Jr. Alumni House on North Avenue since 1979. Its first presidents (starting in 1921) were William H. Glenn, followed by L. W. Robert, Jr. and Y. Frank Freeman. The current president of the alumni association is Dene Sheheane. Sheheane succeeds Joseph Irwin who previously held the position since 1999. Other notable presidents include Cherry L. Emerson, Bobby Jones, and Frank A. Hooper. As of September 2019, there were approximately 166,000 living alumni of Georgia Tech. Since 2006, Georgia Tech alumni have given between $30 million to $40 million a year, providing about 30 to 40 percent of the institute's development funds. Georgia Tech is ranked third in alumni giving among public universities, and 26th overall. History The L. W. \\"Chip\\" Roberts, Jr. Alumni House, the office for the Georgia Tech Alumni Association since 1979. Georgia Tech was founded in 1885 and opened in 1888, and the first two graduates matriculated in 1890. Attempts at forming an alumni association had been made since 1896, until a charter was applied for by J. B. McCrary and William H. Glenn on June 28, 1906 and was approved two years later by Fulton County on June 20, 1908. The organization published its first annual report in 1908, but was largely dormant due to the pressures of World War I. The organization played an important role in the 1920s Greater Georgia Tech Campaign, which consolidated all existing alumni clubs and funded a significant expansion of Georgia Tech's campus. In 1923, the alumni association created one of its most popular programs, an alumni placement service. In 1932, the service was reorganized and run by Dean George C. Griffin and Fred W. Ajax until budget cuts returned forced the program's return to the alumni association in 1949. The alumni association's placement service is now known as \\"JacketNet Jobs\\". In 1947, prompted by the Georgia Board of Regents' critical lack of funding for the school, the association organized the annual Alumni Roll Call, which asked graduates to donate according to their ability; the fundraiser continues to this day. The association won numerous awards for the performance of the Roll Call from the American Alumni Council; this included the organization's highest award, the Alumni Service Award, in 1967 for the development and operation of the Joint Tech-Georgia Development Fund. Also in 1947, the association polled all existing alumni on whether the school should change its name from the Georgia School of Technology to the Georgia Institute of Technology; the alumni voted 5,113 to 1,495 in favor of the change, a result that Georgia Tech president Blake R. Van Leer took to the Georgia Board of Regents to convince them to allow the name change. The alumni association (and association president Fred Storey in particular) was influential in the finding and selection of Georgia Tech president Edwin D. Harrison in 1957. Publications The Fall 2002 cover of the Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine The alumni association produces a monthly magazine that chronicles the accomplishments of Georgia Tech, its faculty and its alumni. Initially founded in 1923 as the Georgia Tech Alumnus under editor Albert H. Staton, who left to work in industry; his place was taken by R. J. Thiesen who was editor of the magazine until 1951. In 1969, the publication had a circulation of 20,000. The publication is now the Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine. A companion publication to the Alumni Association Magazine was established in 1965 as a quarterly newsletter and named Tech Topics. This publication won national Newsletter of the Year in 1967.

It includes a protein component, fluids, and vitamin and mineral supplementation. PSMF diets can last for up to 6 months, followed by a gradual increase in calories over 6‚Äì8 weeks. Efficacy People on the diet reduce body fat, but the diet is not generally effective in helping achieve durable weight loss. Description A PSMF attempts to spare the dieter the health risks of a complete fast by introducing the minimum amount of protein necessary to prevent muscle-wasting effects, while still eliminating fats and carbohydrates. Typically, depending on activity level, 0.8‚Äì1.2 g of protein per pound of lean body mass (not total body weight) is consumed. Protein beyond this minimum amount is also eliminated, as the body would use it for energy. Further lean body mass (muscle, organs, etc.) are spared through resistance training and limiting aerobic activity. HistoryThe Last Chance Diet= The concept of \\"protein-sparing modified fast\\" (PSMF) was described by George Blackburn in the early 1970s as an intensive weight-loss diet designed to mitigate the harms associated with protein-calorie malnutrition and nitrogen losses induced by either acute illness or hypocaloric diets in patients with obesity, in order to adapt the patient's metabolism sufficiently to use endogenous fat stores as well as to preserve the protein contained in the body cell mass. The \\"liquid protein\\" PSMF diet described in the book The Last Chance Diet in 1976, motivates that the liquid protein diets of varying composition became widely popular. Three years later, in 1979, Isner published a report of 17 deaths associated with low-quality liquid protein VLCD, due to heart-related causes. These serious effects caused a substantial concern about the safety of clinical use of PSMF and VLCD. As a result, a review was published that highlighted the differences with these low-quality liquid protein diets and emphasized the importance of close medical monitoring during the fast and refeeding periods. =Modern PSMF diets= Instead of hydrolyzed collagen, modern medically-supervised PSMF diets include foods of higher biological value, such as meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and/or tofu. PSMF is used as a treatment for highly motivated patients to achieve rapid weight loss and usually is administered for 6 ‚Äì 16 weeks. Before an individual starts a PSMF diet, their doctor should order an electrocardiogram, to check for signs of heart disease and also will prescribe specific vitamins minerals and electrolytes to be taken daily as long as the diet persists.

She was the first ship to carry the name Verity. She was ordered in January 1918 from John Brown & Company of Clydebank with the 13th Order for Destroyers of the Emergency War Program of 1918‚Äì19. Construction HMS Veritys keel was laid on 17 May 1918 at the John Brown & Company Shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. She was launched on 19 March 1919. She was 312 feet overall in length with a beam of 29.5 feet. Her mean draught was 9 feet, and would reach 11.25 feet under full load. She had a displacement of 1,140 tons standard and up to 1,550 full load. She was propelled by three Yarrow type water tube boilers powering Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines developing 27,000 shp driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of 34 knots. She was oil-fired and had a fuel capacity of 320 to 350 tons. This gave a range of between 3500 nautical miles at 15 knots to 900 nautical miles at 32 knots. She shipped four BL 4.7 in (120-mm) Mk.I guns, mount P Mk.I naval guns in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two forward and two aft in super imposed firing positions.

He is a novelist in English, a poet in Scottish Gaelic, the translator into English of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Rainer Maria Rilke, and an innovative and controversial critic of Scottish and international literature. His work in Gaelic also appears under the name Cr√¨sdean MacIlleBh√†in. Whyte first published some translations of modern poetry into Gaelic, including poems by Konstantinos Kavafis, Yannis Ritsos and Anna Akhmatova. He then published two collections of original poetry in Gaelic, Uirsgeul (Myth), 1991 and An Tr√†th Duilich (The Difficult Time), 2002. In the meantime he started to write prose in English and has published four novels, Euphemia MacFarrigle and the Laughing Virgin (1995), The Warlock of Strathearn (1997), The Gay Decameron (1998) and The Cloud Machinery (2000). In 2002, Whyte won a Scottish Research Book of the Year award for his edition of Sorley Maclean's D√†in do Eimhir (Poems to Eimhir), published by the Association for Scottish Literary Studies. He has also compiled some anthologies of present-day Gaelic poetry and written critical articles and essays. Biography Whyte was born in Glasgow (Scotland) in October 1952, educated there by Jesuits at St Aloysius College, and took the English studies tripos at Pembroke College, Cambridge between 1970 and 1973. He spent most of the next 12 years in Italy, teaching under Agostino Lombardo in the Department of English and American Studies at Rome's La Sapienza university from 1977 to 1985. Whyte returned to Scotland to complete a Ph.D. in Gaelic literature under scholar and poet Derick Thomson (Ruaraidh MacTh√≤mais (1928-2012).Glasgow University Library, Special Collections, Thesis 9396. From 1986 to 1989 he was lecturer in the Department of English Literature of the University of Edinburgh, then from 1990 to 2005 he taught in the Department of Scottish Literature of the University of Glasgow, rising from lecturer to reader. Whyte took early retirement in 2005 and moved to live in Budapest, where he writes full-time. Since 2013, he has spent several months each year in Venice.  Poetry in Scottish Gaelic  In 1982, Derick Thomson began to feature in the quarterly review Gairm, of which he was the editor, Whyte's translations into Gaelic of poets including Cavafy, Ritsos, Ujeviƒá, M√∂rike, Akhmatova and Tsvetaeva.See Gairm (An Raitheachan G√†idhlig) issues 123 (1983), 134 & 135 (1986), 142 (1988), also Derick Thomson ed. B√†rdachd na Roinn-E√≤rpa an G√†idhlig (European Poetry in Gaelic) (Glasgow, Gairm 1990) pp.24, 44-48, 74-76, 80-83, 85, 98-116. Whyte's first collection of original poetry, Uirsgeul/Myth, in Gaelic with the author's facing English translations, was joint winner of a Saltire Award when published by Gairm in 1991. \\"We may expect substantial original work from his pen,\\" announced Derick Thomson, in the second edition of his Introduction to Gaelic Poetry.Derick Thomson An Introduction to Gaelic Poetry (second edition) Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press 1989. An Tr√†th Duilich (Callander, Diehard Press 2002) is a Gaelic-only collection, containing a pivotal sequence about an urban adolescence troubled by religious and sexual guilt, and a dramatic cantata focusing on the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, constructed by sculptors Nicola and Giovanni Pisano in 1277-1278. Dealbh Athar (Dublin, Coisc√©im 2009) offers forthright treatment of the poet's sexual abuse by his father, its consequences, and the attendant family circumstances, with translations into Irish by Gr√©ag√≥ir √ì D√∫ill. The title sequence in Whyte's fourth collection, Bho Leabhar-Latha Maria Malibran / From the Diary of Maria Malibran (Stornoway, Acair 2009) assumes the voice of the celebrated opera singer (1808-1836) as, in a country retreat not far from Paris, she reflects on her life, her career and her problematic relationship with her father, also an opera star. A combative epilogue affirms the importance of not confining poetry in Gaelic to themes and topics directly related to the society and history of those who speak the language. Whyte's fifth collection, in Gaelic only, An Daolag Sh√¨onach (The Chinese Beetle) (Glasgow, Cl√≤ Gille Moire 2013), brings together uncollected poems for the years from 1987 to 1999, and a rich crop of new work from 2004 to 2007. Since 2006, Whyte has published a series of longer poems in the yearly anthology New Scottish Writing (Glasgow, Association for Scottish Literary Studies) with facing English translations by Niall O'Gallagher, which have met with considerable acclaim. Tom Adair wrote in The Scotsman of 'Ceum air cheum' / 'Step by step' that 'This poem alone makes the book worth twice the asking price',The Scotsman, 13 October 2007. while Colin Waters in The Scottish Review of Books found Whyte's treatment of his relationship with older poet Sorley MacLean (Somhaire MacGill-Eain (1911-1996)) a 'most memorable contribution ... Powerful emotion coupled with the skill to pull off its depiction.'  Fiction in English  Whyte's first novel, Euphemia MacFarrigle and the Laughing Virgin (London, Gollancz 1995], is a satire on sectarian discrimination, anti-gay prejudice and gay self- repression, and the religious establishment, set in Glasgow. A group of pious Catholic women stockpile condoms and the Catholic archbishop is afflicted by a farting virus while, in a suburban convent, everything is done to hush up the mystery of no fewer than three virgin births. Whyte followed this with the life story of a 17th-century Scottish warlock ‚Äì a male witch ‚Äì recounted by himself in an absolutely matter of fact style. His tale is framed by an introduction from an endearingly pedantic place-names specialist and an epilogue by this man's gay nephew. The warlock, whose name we never learn, can change himself into different animals, and even changes sex when his love for a rival witch named Lisbeth makes this essential. The Warlock of Strathearn (London, Gollancz 1997) is the first Scottish novel in which his congregation hangs the minister on the instructions of a heretic, rather than the other way round. Whyte's third novel is called The Gay Decameron. Ten gay men assemble for a dinner party in a flat in Edinburgh's New Town. Gradually, the reader comes to know each of their stories and the intricate web of love and desires that links them. One of the party becomes engrossed in an Oriental tale, which is interspersed with the contemporary narratives. Dealing with these men's joys and hopes, their victories and tragedies, with the AIDS epidemic in Scotland and interactions with families and on the workplace, Whyte offers a detailed and intimate panorama of gay lives in a largely Scottish context. Whyte's fourth novel, The Cloud Machinery (London, Gollanz 2000) is set in early 18th century Venice. After more than a decade of disuse, the theatre at Sant'Igino once more hosts a programme of operas and comedies. The men and women responsible for mounting the season, however, have to contend with the memories and consequences of what happened on the night the theatre closed down. As in his second novel, Whyte interweaves magical happenings with the narrative, but this time the tone is infinitely lighter. This novel was translated into Italian as La macchina delle nuvole (Milan, Corbaccio 2002) and into German as Die stumme S√§ngerin (Berlin, Kindler 2002, paperback Frankfurt-am-Main, Fischer 2005).  Translating poetry  Whyte's first publication, in 1980, was a full English version of the long poem in Italian 'The Ashes of Gramsci' by Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1965).Bananas 23 (October 1980, special poetry edition). It was followed by versions of 'Riches' in 1992 and of the 'Lament of the Mechanical Digger' in 1998.Modern Poetry in Translation New Series 1 (1992) pp.67-89 and Edinburgh Review 99 'Translations: Altered States' (1998) pp.75-87. In 1994, jointly with Marco Fazzini, Whyte translated an anthology of fourteen contemporary Italian poets for Lines Review.Fourteen Italian Poets for the Twenty-First Century, Lines Review 130 (September 1994). In 1998, he translated 'Window on Catalonia', a selection of essays, short stories by Quim Monz√≥ and Sergi P√†mies and poems by Gabriel Ferrater, Maria-Merc√® Mar√ßal and Narcis Comadira for Chapman magazine.Chapman 88 (1998) 'Window on Catalonia' pp.3-59. He has contributed to two of the Scottish Poetry Library's bilingual series volumes of 25 poems, At the End of the Broken Bridge (from Hungarian) in 2005 and Light off Water (from Catalan) in 2007.Both Edinburgh and Manchester, Scottish Poetry Library and Carcanet (2005 and 2007 respectively). He has recently emerged as a translator of the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva (1892-1941), with selections of lyrics in PN Review 197 & 199, the sequence of poems 'With a Woman' on a lesbian relationship with Sofia Parnok in Edinburgh Review 134, and 180 poems written between November 1918 and May 1920 in Moscow in the Plague Year (New York, Archipelago Press 2014). In the late 1990s, Whyte increasingly spoke out against the pressure from magazine editors and publishers to produce his own English versions of the poems he was writing in Gaelic. He articulated his position in the polemical essay 'Against Self-Translation', the substance of a talk delivered in Reykjavik in December 2001 and published in Translation and Literature in 2002.Translation and Literature Vol. 11. Part 1 (Spring 2002) pp.64-71. This was his major contribution to one of the liveliest debates concerning Gaelic writing over the last two decades. The younger Gaelic poet Niall O'Gallagher subsequently emerged as the principal translator of Whyte's poetry into both English and Scots.  Other writings  Whyte's readiness to discuss his reading positions as a gay man meant he took a leading role in applying insights from queer studies to readings of Scottish texts. He edited a collection of essays entitled Gendering the Nation in 1995. Two of his most controversial contributions, 'Fishy Masculinities', on the gender ideology of Neil Gunn's fiction, and 'Queer Readings, Gay Texts' on Walter Scott's Redgauntlet and Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, elicited full- length attempts at refutation in the pages of the Scottish Literary Journal.See Christopher Whyte ed. Gendering the Nation: Studies in Modern Scottish Literature (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press 1995) pp.49-68 and Eleanor Bell and Gavin Millar eds Scotland in Theory: Reflections on Culture and Literature (Amsterdam, Rodopi 2004) pp.147-165. The essays attempting refutation were by Richard Price and Gavin Millar. In 1990, Whyte published a 'coming out' interview with Edwin Morgan,'Power from things not declared' in Edwin Morgan Nothing not giving messages (Edinburgh, Polygon 1990) pp. 144-187. marking the 70th birthday of the man who would become Scotland's first national poet, and breaking a critical silence which had persisted for the better part of three decades. In a seminal essay on Hugh MacDiarmid's long modernist poem 'A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle', Whyte applies an interpretive grid inspired by Roland Barthes' reading of Balzac in S/Z.'Construction of Meaning in Hugh MacDiarmid's A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle' in Studies in Scottish Literature XXIII (1989) pp.199-238. He applied the theories on the ideology of carnival of Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin to a range of festive poems in Scots dating from the 15th to the 18th centuries, as well as offering a new look at Robert Burns' most celebrated poem in 'Defamiliarising Tam O' Shanter'.Essays published in Studies in Scottish Literature XXVIII (1995) pp.178-203 and XXIX (1996) pp.133-157, and in the Scottish Literary Journal 20 (1) (1993) pp.5-18. Whyte's work has been seminal in bringing into the public domain substantial manuscript materials by Sorley MacLean (Somhairle MacGill-Eain 1911-1996), arguably the most significant Gaelic writer of the 20th century. His edition with commentary of the love sequence D√†in do Eimhir was joint winner of the National Library of Scotland award for Research Book of the Year in 2002. His edition with commentary of An Cuilithionn 1939 and Unpublished Poems was launched during a conference to celebrate the centenary of the poet's birth held at the Gaelic College, Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig, in Skye in June 2011.

A literal translation of the dessert's name is \\"Sigh of the lady from Lima\\". Origin The origins of the dessert are in the middle of the nineteenth century in Lima, Peru. Its history starts with the wife of poet Jose Galvez, Amparo Ayarza, who invented the recipe. Galvez gave it its name because it is sweet and light \\"like a woman's sigh\\". The dessert is based around manjar blanco, the Peruvian name for what is known as dulce de leche elsewhere in South America, itself coming from blancmange, a dish from the Middle Ages. Blancmange came to Peru from Spain. It consisted of a thick cream made of milk, sugar, almond flour and some Iberian ingredients. An even older recipe had it made of chicken breast boiled in milk, almonds and thickened with flour and was meant as a bland food for the sick and weak. The other element of the Suspiro de Lime√±a is meringue, also brought to Peru by the Spaniards. The dessert is consumed mainly in Lima and in other Peruvian cities. It is a staple of Peruvian restaurants abroad. Preparation The manjar blanco layer of the dessert is made with whole milk and sugar boiled until thick and caramel colored to which are added egg yolk and sometimes, but not necessarily vanilla essence. The merengue top layer is made from egg whites and port wine syrup (made from port wine and sugar boiled together until thickened) and is sprinkled with cinnamon.

Overview USC is a member of the Association of American Universities, joining in 1969. The University of Southern California houses professional schools offering a number of varying disciplines among which include communication, law, dentistry, medicine, business, engineering, journalism, public policy, music, architecture, and cinematic arts. USC's academic departments fall either under the general liberal arts and sciences of the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences for undergraduates, the Graduate School for graduates, or the university's 17 professional schools. Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences The USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the oldest and largest of the USC schools, grants undergraduate degrees in more than 130 majors and minors in the humanities, social sciences, and natural/physical sciences, and offers doctoral and masters programs in over 20 fields. USC College is responsible for the general education program for all USC undergraduates, and houses a full-time faculty of approximately 700, more than 6,500 undergraduate majors (roughly half the total USC undergraduate population), and 1,200 doctoral students. In addition to 30 academic departments, the College also houses dozens of research centers and institutes.

USC developed the nation's first Doctor of Pharmacy degree (PharmD) in 1950 and it was among the first schools of pharmacy to establish a clinical curriculum, beginning in 1968. Those were radical advances at the time but are now considered foundational training for all pharmacists throughout the US. The School also helped transform the pharmacist's role from a traditional dispenser of medicines to a direct provider of patient care. USC led a key pilot project in the 1970s to explore prescriptive authority for pharmacists that, in 1981, led to California being the first state to enact legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe drug therapy in collaboration with physicians. USC then played a key role in the successful legislation in California that recognized pharmacists as healthcare providers in 2014. Consistently the top-ranked private school of pharmacy, the School continues to be an innovative force in pharmacy education to meet the needs of a changing world, launching the nation's first PharmD/MBA dual degree in 1990, the first PhD in pharmaceutical economics and policy in 1994, the first professional doctorate in regulatory science in 2008, and a translational science graduate program that merges science with clinical expertise. USC is the only private school of pharmacy on a major health sciences campus. This affords its students a unique environment of professionalism and opens the doors for clinical opportunities immediately on campus, including those at the Keck Hospital of USC, USC Norris Cancer Hospital, and the four pharmacies owned and operated by the School. USC School of Pharmacy students also find a rich professional and social atmosphere on the Health Sciences Campus, interacting with colleagues and faculty from various health profession schools. = Sol Price School of Public Policy= The mission of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy is to improve the quality of life for people and their communities, in Southern California and abroad.

As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998. In 2001, the film school added an Interactive Media Division studying stereoscopic cinema, panoramic cinema, immersive cinema, interactive cinema, video games, virtual reality, and mobile media. In September 2006, George Lucas had donated $175 million to expand the film school, the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million). = School of Architecture= The Department of Architecture was established at USC within the Roski School of Fine Arts in 1916, becoming the first of its kind in Southern California.

This postcard depicts a girl trying to see her future husband in the mirror on Hallowe'en night. Ellen Hattie Clapsaddle (January 8, 1865 - January 7, 1934) was an American illustrator/commercial artist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Not only is her style greatly admired and well recognized, today she is recognized as the most prolific souvenir/postcard and greeting card artist of her era.Picking Through Old Postcards, Helaine Fendelman and Joe Rosson, Scripps Howard News Service Childhood Clapsaddle was born during the Civil War period in the small farming community of South Columbia in Herkimer County, New York, near Columbia, New York on January 8, 1865.http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/clapsadle.htm She was the child of Dennis L. and Harriet (Beckwith) Clapsaddle. From an early age she loved to draw‚Äîshe is said to have been a shy and delicate child who displayed artistic ability and was highly encouraged by her parents to develop her skills in art. Clapsaddle was the great-granddaughter of the American Revolutionary War hero, Major Dennis Clapsaddle. Education Clapsaddle attended a one-room school until the 8th grade. She then boarded in Richfield Springs, Otsego County, New York, and attended the local Richfield Springs Seminary, a local academy (later known as high schools) in Richfield Springs that prepared young ladies for higher education, today known as a college. She graduated in 1882. Her parents and teachers highly encouraged her to pursue a career in art. She may have applied and received a scholarship to attend a selective private college for two years, the Cooper Institute known as the Cooper Union Institute for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City. Only highly recognized individuals are chosen to attend this college and all attend on scholarship. There is no documentation, yet found, that she ever went there. Upon the completion of her studies, around 1884, she returned to her parents' home in South Columbia, NY. She placed an ad in a local newspaper to offer private painting lessons and began her career of teaching art out of her home. Art Clapsaddle started by giving art lessons in her home in South Columbia. At the same time she created her own landscapes and was commissioned to paint portraits of families in Richfield Springs. She also submitted her work to publishers in New York City and became a recognized commercial artist. She was a freelance artist and her illustrations were often used in advertising and on porcelain goods, calendars, paper fans, trade and greeting cards. Clapsaddle's greatest success was in the development of her artwork into single-faced cards that could be kept as souvenirs or mailed as postcards and she specialized in designing illustrations specifically for that purpose. Artistic designs had become highly prized particularly during the peak of production of the \\"golden age of souvenir/postcards\\" (1898‚Äì1915) for their great marketing possibilities. Clapsaddle is credited with over 3000 designs in the souvenir/post card field. Themes Several of the themes in her artwork command high interest given the variety and occasions for their use. *Valentine's Day- with or without children *St. Patrick's Day- more than 80 different cards *Fourth of July- showing George Washington, Uncle Sam, Lady Liberty, eagles, cannons, flags, the liberty bell, fireworks, Revolutionary War figures, nautical subjects, etc., *Halloween- some of the most highly prized by collectors *Christmas - including transportation designs as a theme with Irish families in automobiles of that period on the highways, or airplanes in the skies and even on dirigibles. Recent discoveries Her identity and background seem to have remained obscure, but looking into her ancestry has yielded some information. \\"...Ellen Hattie Clapsaddle was destined to become the most prolific postcard and greeting card artist of her time.\\"The Art of Ellen Clapsaddle by Baby Janet \\"...renowned for her gift of painting adorable children, one of the most famous and sought after artists (of souvenir/postcards) ... her artwork has universal appeal...\\"http://www.Victorianparlourpostcards.com \\"...her art expressed an innocence and joy of life that emanated from the child-like happiness deep within her.\\" \\"...her distinctive style allows many connoisseurs of her art the ability to recognize the details of her artwork.\\" \\"...her designs reflect the entire spectrum of seasonal and holiday themes, drawing upon folklore, traditions, games and nursery rhymes.\\" \\"Reproductions of her illustrations frequently appear on contemporary vintage-style decorative accessories as well.\\"Pamela Wiggins More than half of the estimated over 3,000 signed souvenir/postcards, as Ellen H. Clapsaddle, as well as the unsigned ones, show illustrations of children in their full innocence and sweet faces while the rest show scenes that are more general. Many of them include children of different races and cultures of the world. Collectors have come to recognize the quality and charming nature of her personal style and work without question or dispute. Not only are the \\"original\\" single-faced cards sought after by collectors, the large numbers of them that have survived for over 100 years, whether signed or unsigned, attest to the longevity of the appeal of her artwork. In particular, her \\"mechanical\\" cards or anything else with her name on it, or not, are highly sought after by collectors of her work. One of her card designs from 1910, Midnight Angel, was chosen by the United States Postal Service for the 1995 traditional Christmas Stamp.https://www.mysticstamp.com/Products/United-States/3018/USA/ In recent years, more than 100 years later, her artwork is still as popular today as it was when it first appeared in the commercial art world. Her work is so admired that it is generating new types of items to display her artwork since the copyright notices have expired, such as: * Clapsaddle Private Collections on CDs containing more than 300 of her souvenir/postcards; * Downloadable ClipArt; * Art Poster Prints as unframed art in enlarged versions of 29\\" x 20\\" available for framing; 4) Publications recently printed with images of her work for the modern collectors to use as a guide in obtaining some of the original ones; * Iron-on Appliqu√©s for transfer to items of clothing; * Reproduction postcards as new issue; * New art by contemporary artists like a Large Santa Claus and a Patriotic Santa in a 40\\" x 26\\" frame; * New popcorn and cookie tins as well as reproductions of advertisements bearing her artwork. Some private collectors have amassed more than 1,600 original Clapsaddles, as her souvenir/postcards are commonly known. The original cards have appeared in local and state trade shows for years and many websites have large numbers available where the number varies from 900 to 1,000 cards are offered surpassing the numbers available for other artists of similar work. A few years ago, the Richland Springs local newspaper announced the display of some of her work locally, especially a 1900 calendar. She received a great deal of praise in the daintiness of the designs, the originality of the work, and the little verses that illustrate her drawings. Recently, a memory book for wedding occasions, called \\"The New Wedding Album\\" illustrated by Clapsaddle and published by Eaton & Mains, has come to light. It is made in half-silk and white paper boards and it is decoratively stamped in silver with floral motifs. A long-time collector, Elizabeth Austin, created a \\"checklist\\" of Clapsaddle's souvenir/postcards for other collectors so they can identify the ones they do not have. The late Ellen Budd expanded on the list with many missing cards and has published them as a reference work (see the Bibliography section below). Her name has been famous for decades in her hometown area of Richfield Springs, NY, and in the collecting circles where many collectors have specialized strictly in the collection of just her work and her work alone. Career Clapsaddle's father died on January 5, 1891, and she and her mother went to live with an aunt in Richfield Springs. Clapsaddle spent her next fourteen years not only giving art lessons, but also creating and selling illustrations, landscapes, and portraits commissioned by local wealthy families, and freelance artwork that she submitted to various publishers through the mail out of an art studio in downtown Richfield Springs. Initially, two of her designs were accepted by the International Art Publishing Company in New York City to be used as souvenir/postcards that became an immediate success as bestsellers. After that initial purchase of two designs, several others followed and they retained her to work along with other artists. Because she became their premier illustrator due to the popularity and successful marketability of her designs, the company invited her to move to the city around 1895. Soon, by 1901, the International Art Publishing Company also offered her a paid 2-year trip to Germany for her and her mother. While in Germany, she refined her art talent by working directly and closely with the German engravers who were the actual manufacturers of the products offered for sale. Her designs started to appear in various forms like Valentines, souvenir/postcards, booklets, watercolor prints, calendars, and trade cards and other objects in the world of advertising. By this time, Germany was the center of the high-end publishing world and many publishers in the United States depended on them for the final products that were shipped to the U.S. Clapsaddle was with her mother, when she died on March 2, 1905. The death of Mrs. Harriet Clapsaddle occurred at 'Derthick Cottage last Friday and the funeral was held Monday afternoon, Rev. Edmond G. Rawson officiating. Mrs. Clapsaddle has been in poor health for a longtime and had been tenderly cared for by her daughter, Miss Ellen Clapsaddle. The deceased was the widow of -the 'late Dean Clapsaddle and was born in the town of Columbia about 65 years ago. http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201905-1906%20pdf/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201905-1906%20-%200086.pdf Clapsaddle spent some years in Germany, funded by the International Art Publishing Company, and then returned to New York well before her mother's death in 1905. It is said that she established the Wolf Company backed by the Wolf brothers‚Äîa full subsidiary of the International Art Publishing Company of New York City. She was the first and only female souvenir/postcard artist of the era to establish her own enterprise. She was the sole artist and designer for this company. More documentation is being south for this, At that time, few women were even employed as full-time illustrators. For 8 years she and the Wolf brothers enjoyed their success and there seemed to be no limit to the growth potential in the souvenir/postcard industry. (Some sources suggest that she was employed by the Wolf brothers). Nevertheless, confidence in the boom and high return in profits in this specialized area of commercial art during this boom period, led her and her partners to invest heavily in the years that followed in many Germany engraving and publishing firms. She returned once again to Germany to work with the engravers and publishers they used because they had the best printing plants. The postcard and greeting card business was doing well, and Clapsaddle was making good money most of which she invested in German printing firms. World War I By 1914, the war broke out. The majority of the souvenir/postcard publishers in the United States depended on German supplying firms but once they became disconnected from them, they had to go out of business. Many German factories suffered total destruction from bombings and all of Clapsaddle's recent original artwork may have been lost along with the investments in those firms because of the destruction of the records and messages going back and forth between the continents that never arrived or were never answered. Clapsaddle, is on the passenger list on the ship OSCAR II, document can be found on ancestry dot com. She returned in 1915. News of her safe arrival was posted in her hometown newspaper, the Richfield Springs Mercury, July 29, 1915 \\"People generally will be interested in knowing that the artist, Miss Ellen Clapsaddle, who is a native of this place, has returned from Berlin, where she has spent several years, and has notified her friends of her safe arrival in New York.\\" http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201915-1916.pdf/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201915-1916%20-%200250.pdf Although the United States did not enter the war until 1917, Clapsaddle was safe at home in her two homes in NYC and in Richfield Springs . Post-war With the end of the war in 1919, Miss Clapsaddle was looking forward to returning to Germany. She has spent the time from 1915 on, working and living in New York City, and visiting her second home in Richfield Springs NY, as evidenced by the many newspaper posts such as this in her hometown newspaper, the Richfield Springs Mercury. On April 9, 1920, Clapsaddle, who spent the winter months in New York City, moved to her home in the Chase House on Lake Street.http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201959-1960%20pdf/Richfield%20Springs%20NY%20Mercury%201959-1960%20-%200522.pdf In 1920, she was living in an apartment in Manhattan at the elegant Prince George Hotel, as stated in the 1920 census, as per the U.S Census. It was reported that on Saturday, May 28, 1921, she sailed for Germany. On Jan 14 1922, 9 months later, she returned to NY on the ship George Washington. Between 1920-30 she visited Richfield Springs, but less frequently as per this news insert: 1930 Ellen Clapsaddle after an absence of several years is making a short visit in town . Miss Clapsaddle is a well known artist here, and has resided in Europe and New York City.http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%20Disk3/Cooperstown%20NY%20Otsego%20Farmer/Cooperstown%20NY%20Otsego%20Farmer%20&%20Republican%201929%20-%201930%20Grayscale/Cooperstown%20NY%20Otsego%20Farmer%20&%20Republican%201929%20-%201930%20Grayscale%20-%200738.pdf In 1930 she was living as a lodger in Manhattan, at 125 East 30th St. as per the U. S. Census Later, she was admitted to the Peabody Home for Aged and Indigent Women on Pelham Parkway in New York City in January 1932. One wonders if her finances suffered because of the depression...or if she were there, simply due to being aged. One day short of her 69th birthday in 1934 she died; services were held in her home town; she was buried next to her parents on January 12, 1934 Interment She died on January 7, 1934.

It is a stone Italian villa-style house built in the mid-19th century. In 1977 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the only surviving example of the early residential architecture of Detlef Lienau. Built for Francis Cottenet, a wealthy New York merchant, it was later owned and renovated by Cyrus West Field, John Jacob Astor III and Manhattan College. It remains a private residence. History Francis Cottenet, the first resident and owner of the property, came to the U.S. from France in 1822 and started an import-export business, Cottenet & Co., in New York. After 30 years, he contracted Detlef Lienau, one of a number of European-born architects working in America, to design a riverside villa for him. It was originally located on , the sole house between the Albany Post Road (now US 9) and the river in what has since become the Ardsley-on-Hudson section of Irvington. Lienau insisted on French stone to be true to the appearance of its Continental models. Cottenet called on him again to remodel and expand the house in the late 1850s, just a few years after moving in. The locally based Lord and Burnham Company built the conservatory. The resulting structure was often pointed out to passengers on steamships going up the Hudson, with the implication that it was the ideally tasteful home of a man of wealth. After Cottenet's death in 1884, it passed to another wealthy local, Cyrus West Field, who had to sell a year later due to some unexpected financial setbacks. During his brief ownership, he placed in the deed restrictions on the property's future use, banning it from being used for certain purposes, such as industry, education, or sale to \\"disreputable\\" individuals. These remain in place, and ensure that it has been used only as a residence ever since. His buyer was John Jacob Astor III, who lived out the few years remaining in his life on the property. During that time, he managed to spend $100,000 on improvements, and built the stone gateway that still stands at Route 9 (now known as Broadway). His heirs sold the house to Manhattan College, which spent the next few years trying to clear Field's restrictions from the deed and convert the home to institutional use. Failing, the college sold to Amzi Lorenzo Barber, the \\"Asphalt King\\", a pioneer in paving as well as other businesses that would become prominent in the coming century. He sold off most of the surrounding acreage, clearing the way for the development of Ardsley-on-Hudson. Since then, Nuits has been the home of Robert Hewitt, Jr., engineer John Wiley, Gillies Coffee Company owner James Henry Schmelzel, and investment banker Martin W. Dolan. A restoration which took almost 20 years was completed in 2000, and it was extensively renovated from 2000 to 2015. As of June, 2009, the property - which was bought in 2000 for $4.3 million - was being offered for sale for the price of $12.285 million,http://www.coldwellbankermoves.com/Property/PropertyDetails.aspx?PropertyID=980331&WT.MC;_ID=371810000000000 and in May 2015 was listed for $14.75 million.Mancuso, Anne. (May 1, 2015) \\"A Mansion Where an Astor Lived\\" The New York Times alt=An older, hand-tinted postcard showing the house from a different angle Building Nuits is built in a sophisticated interlocking arrangement of cubes built of smooth-faced Caen stone, stones laid so tight that even over a century after it was originally laid it is impossible to put a penknife between them. The roofs are low-pitched with overhanging bracketed eaves. The arched main entrance is located in the middle of the south elevation, a three-bay facade with central tower and balustraded balcony with hooded window above. It has been compared to the entrance John Notman designed for Princeton University's Nassau Hall after that structure was damaged by an 1855 fire. Verandas run the length of the south side. On the east the most notable feature is an octagonal, conical- roofed conservatory that was added a few years later, and likewise the north elevation has had a billiards room, now used as a family room, added to it. The west, which overlooks the nearby Hudson River, is unchanged. Inside, the entrance leads to a central hall that runs the length of the house. To its east is a library with French doors; opposite is the main living room. There is only one outbuilding, a caretaker's cottage that was added later. It is considered a contributing resource to the property's historic character.

Treating the coupling of the structure deformations and the fluid flow poses a number of challenging problems for numerical simulations (the elastic boundary changes the flow of the fluid and the fluid moves the elastic boundary simultaneously). In the immersed boundary method the fluid is represented on an Eulerian coordinate and the structure is represented on a Lagrangian coordinate. For Newtonian fluids governed by the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, the fluid equations are : \\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial{u}({x},t)}{\\\\partial{t}} + {u}\\\\cdot abla{u}\\\\right) = - abla p + \\\\mu\\\\, \\\\Delta u(x,t) + f(x,t) and in case of incompressible fluids (assuming constant density) we have the condition : abla \\\\cdot u = 0. \\\\, The immersed structures are typically represented as a collection of one- dimensional fibers, denoted by \\\\Gamma . Each fiber can be viewed as a parametric curve X(s,t) where s is the parameter and t is time. Physics of the fiber is represented via the fiber force distribution F(s,t) . Spring forces, bending resistance or any other type of behavior can be built into this term. The force exerted by the structure on the fluid is then interpolated as a source term in the momentum equation using : f(x,t) = \\\\int_\\\\Gamma F(s,t) \\\\, \\\\delta\\\\big(x - X(s,t)\\\\big) \\\\, ds, where \\\\delta is the Dirac function. The forcing can be extended to multiple dimensions to model elastic surfaces or three-dimensional solids. Assuming a massless structure, the elastic fiber moves with the local fluid velocity and can be interpolated via the delta function : \\\\frac{\\\\partial X(s,t)}{\\\\partial t} = u(X,t) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega u(x,t) \\\\, \\\\delta\\\\big(x - X(s,t)\\\\big) \\\\, dx, where \\\\Omega denotes the entire fluid domain. Discretization of these equations can be done by assuming an Eulerian grid on the fluid and a separate Lagrangian grid on the fiber. Approximations of the Delta distribution by smoother functions will allow us to interpolate between the two grids. Any existing fluid solver can be coupled to a solver for the fiber equations to solve the Immersed Boundary equations. Variants of this basic approach have been applied to simulate a wide variety of mechanical systems involving elastic structures which interact with fluid flows. Since the original development of this method by Peskin, a variety of approaches have been developed to simulate flow over complicated immersed bodies on grids that do not conform to the surface of the body. These include methods such as the immersed interface method, the Cartesian grid method, the ghost fluid method and the cut-cell method. Mittal and Iaccarino. refer to all these (and other related) methods as Immersed Boundary Methods and provide various categorizations of these methods. From the point of view of implementation, they categorize immersed boundary methods into continuous forcing and discrete forcing methods. In the former, a force term is added to the continuous Navier-Stokes equations before discretization, whereas in the latter, the forcing is applied (explicitly or implicitly) to the discretized equations. Under this taxonomy, Peskin's original method is a continuous forcing method whereas Cartesian grid, cut-cell and the ghost-fluid methods are discrete forcing methods.

The simulator was released on January 1, 2008 after having been under development for more than six years. Gameplay The main purpose of Space Shuttle Mission 2007 is to allow the gamer to experience real historical NASA Space Shuttle missions from liftoff (T-00:01:50:00) to landing. Initially, Space Shuttle Mission 2007 was released with a set of 11 missions but as time passed, the development team has been releasing new missions as free add-ons. The missions include satellite deployment and servicing (including the Hubble Telescope), building and servicing the International Space Station, extra-vehicular activities and landing at Kennedy Space Center and Edwards Air Force Base. A typical mission starts on the launch pad at KSC right after the astronauts have entered the cockpit. After that, the user goes through the preflight, liftoff, ascent, on-orbit, de- orbit, approach and landing phases. Most of the time is spent on orbit where the user is expected to perform the mission as described in the briefing screen and as instructed by the on-screen checklists and audio communications from the MCC. Landing is performed manually following Houston instructions and realistic guidance and navigation information presented on the 9 forward panels MFD and the fully collimated HUD. The action during all mission phases can be viewed from several \\"cameras\\": external view, first person, floating camera and Mission Control Center information screens. After completing the mission successfully from start to end, the virtual Astronaut receives a mission badge which is displayed in the Astronaut Achievements section. The Space Shuttle Mission 2007 simulates Space Shuttle systems, including the general-purpose computer, remote manipulator system, auxiliary power unit, hydraulic, CCTV, electrical, propulsion, navigation, APDS (docking system), communications, and payload bay. These are intended to allow for a realistic interaction between the user and these systems throughout the mission. As the mission evolves, the simulator presents the user with an on-screen context- related checklist, indicating which systems to operate and how. In the easiest difficulty mode, the simulator indicates individual switches with flashing arrows, in addition to the checklists. In more advanced difficulty modes, the user is expected to use printed checklists to complete the mission. The user spends most of the time in a realistic and complete 3D virtual cockpit, manning several \\"stations\\": commander, pilot, mission specialist 1, mission specialist 2, and a mission specialist middeck position. The 3D virtual cockpit is especially effective due to the support of TrackIR:PRO head- tracking device, Matrox TripleHead2Go multiple monitor support and the Vuzix virtual reality stereoscopic goggles. The in-cockpit and other environmental sounds are simulated including the engines, RCS, alarms, and cockpit cooling \\"humming\\". The user can zoom into various panels in a 2D view or directly select the various systems from the main menu, in real time and press buttons, turn knobs, flip switches as the mission requires. There is also constant and context-relevant mission-related audio communications between the Mission Control Center and the Space Shuttle guiding the user through the mission. Extra-vehicular activities are conducted in first-person view. In certain missions, the virtual astronauts will also drive the Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture satellites for maintenance. The latest mission add-on is the STS-47 Spacelab mission. In this mission, the user can visit the Spacelab-J and float inside the lab in Zero-G.

The crisis deepened when armed clashes broke out between the two armed forces in the border area on June 10, 2008. During the conflict, France provided logistical, medical and intelligence support to Djibouti, but did not participate in direct combat. Background Map of the disputed Ras Doumeira region The currently in force 1900 boundary agreement specifies that the international boundary starts at Cape Doumeira (Ras Doumeira) at the Red Sea and runs for 1.5 km along the watershed divide of the peninsula. Furthermore, the 1900 protocol specified that Ile Doumeira (Doumeira Island) immediately offshore and its adjacent smaller islets would not be assigned sovereignty and would remain demilitarized. Djibouti and Eritrea had twice previously clashed over the border area. In January 1935, Italy and France signed the Franco-Italian Agreement wherein parts of French Somaliland (Djibouti) were given to Italy (Eritrea). The actual border at Ras Doumeira (a hill) though was never fully demarcated save for a broad agreement that the northern slopes of hill were Italian and the southern slopes were French and this arrangement sufficed whilst France and Italy remained in control of the area. However, the question of ratification has brought this agreement, and its provision of substantial parts of Djibouti to Eritrea into question. In April 1996 the Djiboutian government accused Eritrean forces of having made a 7 km incursion into its territory following a clash at the Djiboutian border post of Ras Doumeira. Within two days these claims had grown into accusations that the Eritrean government harbours a territorial claim to part of Djibouti‚Äôs northern coastline. The allegations were then made by the foreign affairs, Mohamed Moussa Chehem, to his perplexed Eritrean counterpart, Petros Solomon, who was on an official visit to Djibouti the following day. Mr Solomon subsequently met with the Djiboutian president, who also raised the alleged incursion. In a series of contradictory accounts, the Djiboutian authorities said that they had dispatched 600 troops to the area. On April 18, Mr Solomon stated categorically in a press statement that ‚Äúthere has never been any clash or incident in Doumeira‚Äù, adding that the Eritrean government was ‚Äúsurprised and saddened‚Äù by the allegations. Eritrean movements in Ras Doumeira region In January Eritrea reportedly requested to cross the border in order to get sand for a road, but instead occupied a hilltop in the region. On April 16, Eritrea is reported by Djibouti to have set up fortifications and dug trenches on both sides of the Djiboutian border near Ras Doumeira. Djibouti, in a letter to the UN calling for intervention, claimed new maps put out by Eritrea showed Ras Doumeira as Eritrean territory. Eritrea denied it had any problems with Djibouti. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said on May 15 that the row was a \\"threat to the peace and security of the whole Horn of Africa\\" and said Ethiopia would secure their trade corridor through Djibouti in the event of a conflict. Ethiopia has relied on Djibouti for access to the Red Sea since Eritrea's independence. Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki denied sending troops into the area and added they do not have any problem with Djibouti. Armed clashes Djiboutian troops with light armoured cars near the border On June 10, 2008, according to Djibouti, several Eritrean troops deserted their positions, fleeing to the Djiboutian side. Djiboutian forces then came under fire from Eritrean forces demanding the return of the deserters. Djibouti called up soldiers and police who had retired since 2004 in response to the fighting. Eritrea dismissed accounts from Djibouti as \\"anti-Eritrean\\". A statement from Eritrea's Foreign Ministry said it would not \\"get involved in an invitation of squabbles and acts of hostility\\" and claimed Djibouti was trying to drag Eritrea into its \\"concocted animosity\\". According to French Colonel Ducret, French soldiers in Djibouti provided logistical and medical assistance to the Djibouti army as well as providing them with intelligence. Clashes between the two forces reportedly continued for several days before Djibouti's military announced on June 13 that fighting had subsided, but on the same day, President Guelleh, was quoted by the BBC as saying that his country was at war with Eritrea. 44 Djiboutian soldiers were killed and 55 wounded during the fighting. According to Djiboutian estimates, 0 Eritrean soldiers were killed, 100 captured, and 21 defected. Djiboutian President Guelleh declared: \\"We've always had good relations. But they aggressively occupied part of our country. This is an aggression we are resisting\\". By 2008 the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimated the army was 18,000 strong (with Eritrean army strength estimated at the same time as 200,000). International reaction * Arab League: The League of Arab States held an emergency session in response to the fighting and called for Eritrea to withdraw from the border region. * France: French Defense Minister Herv√© Morin held discussions with Djibouti's Defense Minister Ougoureh Kifleh Ahmed, promising to strengthen the French military presence in the country in case there is \\"an escalation in the current border row.\\" Also to reaffirm the \\"very great concern of France\\" over the recent border incidents, Morin, according to diplomatic sources, has \\"reassured his counterpart of the full support\\" of his government, at the same time calling for a \\"diplomatic\\" settlement of the issue. The two nations have a mutual defense agreement. The French foreign ministry said it was highly concerned about the fighting. The French defense ministry announced they were increasing their military presence in Djibouti and increasing their support for Djibouti's army following the border clashes. The announcement also said France was \\"preparing to deploy a forward logistics base and a land force near the zone where the clashes took place\\", adding that \\"its military has stepped up air surveillance over the border to monitor the activities of Eritrean forces.\\" Reports also indicate that additional naval forces are being moved to the region as well as an additional team of military surgeons. However, leaked cables showed the French were very worried Djibouti would invoque its defense agreement and so France \\"was quick to provide significant rear-area logistical support to Djibouti in order to avoid a Djiboutian request to engage in combat per the Agreement\\" and in 2011 the French renegotiated their defense cooperation with Djibouti. * United Nations: France did not support Djibouti's request for a United Nation Security Council resolution, France's ambassador to Djibouti Dominique Decherf opted instead for a regional resolution of the conflict involving the African Union or the Arab League. However, the United States offered its full support to Djibouti and backed a resolution condemning firmly Eritrea's aggression. On December 23, 2009 the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1907 was adopted, it imposed arms embargo on the country, a travel ban on its leaders, and it froze the assets of some of the country's political and military officials. The United Nations Security Council called on both sides to exercise maximum restraint and re-establish dialogue. * United States: The United States State Department issued a press release condemning Eritrea's \\"military aggression\\" saying it represented \\"an additional threat to peace and security in the already volatile Horn of Africa\\" and calling for Eritrea to accept third party mediation on the border dispute. Eritrea responded to the statement accusing the U.S. of instigating conflict in the region. The American embassy in Djibouti advised citizens against traveling to the northern Djibouti where Ras Doumeira is located for safety reasons. * African Union: The Peace and Security Council of the African Union urged Eritrea and Djibouti to exercise the utmost restraint and to resolve the dispute through dialogue including fully cooperating with an AU mission sent to the area. However, Eritrea, unlike Djibouti, had not yet accepted the mission. Bereket Simon, special adviser to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia told Reuters \\"Ethiopia firmly believes that such unwarranted action should be stopped immediately and peaceful and diplomatic solution must be sought for the problem.\\" Aftermath On June 24, 2008, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting at their headquarters in New York to hear a briefing of the situation, as well as statements from the Prime Minister of Djibouti Mohamed Dileita and the ambassador of Eritrea. A UN fact-finding mission was sent to the region and issued a report saying the standoff between Djibouti and Eritrea could \\"have a major negative impact on the entire region and the wider international community\\" noting while Djibouti has pulled out of the disputed area Eritrea has not. The fact-finding mission was not allowed into Eritrea by the Eritrean government. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1862 on January 14, 2009, urging dialogue between the two countries to solve the issue peacefully. The council welcomed Djibouti's withdrawal to positions before June 10, 2008, and demanded Eritrea make a similar withdrawal within five weeks of the resolution.Security Council Urges Djibouti, Eritrea To Resolve Border Dispute Peacefully , UN, 14 January 2009. On 23 December 2009, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea for providing support to armed groups undermining peace and reconciliation in Somalia and because it had not withdrawn its forces following clashes with Djibouti in June 2008. The sanctions were to imposed an arms embargo, travel restrictions and a freeze on the assets of its political and military leaders. In early June 2010, Djibouti and Eritrea agreed to refer the matter to Qatar for mediation, a move that was praised by the African Union. In March 2016, 4 Djiboutian prisoners of war captured during the border war were released by Eritrea eight years after the conflict. Following the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Qatar withdrew its peacekeeping forces from the disputed territory. Shortly after, Djibouti accused Eritrea of reoccupying the mainland hill and Doumeira Island. In September 2018, it was announced that Djibouti and Eritrea agreed to normalize their relations.

His music is characterised by slow tempos, minimalist arrangements, underpinned by piano and a rich baritone vocal. As of 2018 Adey has released three studio albums and various EPs and singles. Adey released his critically well received debut album All Things Real in 2006 through independent record label Grand Harmonium Records. Music journalists often categorise his piano, vocal led songs as folk and singer-songwriter, but also acknowledge a harder, less generic, left of mainstream approach; No Ripcord's Simon Briercliffe writes \\"His voice is rich and carries on long after it's comfortable, at times far louder and more in your ear than is comfortable, leaving you hanging on every word.\\" Writers generally warmed to the album's introspective songs and well chosen covers. US journal for improvised and progressive music 'Signal to Noise' heralded the album as \\"haunting folk into straight-up epic territory.\\" Many reviews picked up on the integration of hi- fidelity crossed with a lo fi, homemade approach. Sunday Times critic Mark Edwards: \\"The secret lies in the gap between Adey‚Äôs main influences: on the one hand, the mournful, home-made alt-country of Oldham and Smog; on the other, the pristine atmospheres of the Blue Nile and Talk Talk.\\" Critic Leon McDdermott (Glasgow Herald) writes \\"Adey channels the spirit of Smog, minus Bill Callahan's caustic take on dysfunctional relationships; elsewhere, there are hints of the late Jeff Buckley's mournful tenderness.\\" Grand Harmonium released lead single \\"Find the Way\\" (31.06.06), containing two new acoustic recordings of \\"Find the Way\\" and \\"Mississippi\\". Mississippi: Remixed, a download only EP, featuring Kramer, A Marble Calm, Black Sheep and Sweet Billy Pilgrim was released (14.05.07). The Marble Calm remix was also released on 12\\" vinyl via Tonefloat Records. A limited 7\\" single and download, \\"Burning Fields\\" b/w \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" followed in September 2007. Adey (with full band) played several festivals around Europe in 2007, and in August 2007 headlined his debut UK tour. In 2010, a new Steve Adey track (excerpt) was featured in an advert for Mercedes-Benz. A five-song EP entitled These Resurrections was released in May 2011. A new studio \\"long player\\" The Tower of Silence was released in November 2012 to positive critical response. The Tower of Silence made The Sunday Times Album of the Week and Q Magazine cited the album as \\"beautiful and grandly\\". MusicOMH garnered the album \\"a meticulously crafted, sparse and funereally paced soundscape on which every note seems to have to earn its place; an eerie, sweeping soundtrack of grand orchestration.\\" A new album of covers entitled \\"Do Me a Kindness\\" was released on 4 August 2017. The album includes takes on David Bowie, Nick Cave, Bob Dylan, PJ Harvey and more. History2003‚Äì06: All Things Real= All Things Real was recorded between September 2003 and April 2005, at Longformacus Parish Church, and a rented cottage in Longformacus, Scottish Borders. The recording was \\"fixed\\" and mastered by Calum Malcolm. The album consists of both original compositions and cover versions of Bob Dylan's Shelter from the Storm and Will Oldham's I See a Darkness. All Things Real was critically well received. Sunday Times journalist Mark Edwards on Shelter from the Storm: \\"You'd have to be a fool to cover one of Dylan's best-loved songs. Either that, or a singer with the presence ‚Äî and presence of mind ‚Äî to slow it right down, exposing the beauty of every syllable.\\" Ian Mathers from Stylus Magazine: \\"Never has Dylan‚Äôs ‚Äúcreature void of form\\" sounded so wracked, so stricken.\\" The album includes the song 'Mary Margaret O'Hara', a tribute to the Canadian singer/actress Mary Margaret O'Hara. An initial album recording, featuring choral singers and members of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra was abandoned, due to the wrong feel and a less personal sound. =2012: The Tower of Silence= It was announced via Steve's official website over the summer of 2012 that a new album will be available from September as a special LP bundle direct from the artist. An official release was to follow in November through the Grand Harmonium label. Adey worked on The Tower of Silence for several years, mostly mixing and editing early band recordings that were \\"laid down\\" in a church. No computers were used and Adey wanted to mix to tape in \\"an old school\\" style. \\"The songs were all written at the piano, but from that point, the direction and possible trajectory could be anything.\\" Each song was approached differently, although the overall sound of the album is seamless and has a continuous mood. A full string section was employed during the initial recording. The sound is more \\"live\\" with more emphasis on a stronger \\"band feel.\\" Album two was recorded, for the most part in a church, using the natural acoustic and room noise. The album received critical acclaim across the board, including positive reviews from The Sunday Times, Q Magazine and Uncut Magazine, who also included the track \\"Laughing\\" on a best of 2012 covermount CD. Influences Writers consistently reference Smog, the Blue Nile and Talk Talk as influences. In various interviews, Adey has said that the Bonnie Prince Billy, a.k.a. Will Oldham albums I See a Darkness and Master and Everyone are very important and influential records. Also, Oldham's 'I See a Darkness' was covered on All Things Real. Uncut magazine cited that \\"Adey is clearly in thrall to the folk fatalism of Will \\"Bonnie Prince Billy\\" Oldham along with Dylan and the knotty American pre-war minstrels that inspired him.\\" Talk Talk lead man Mark Hollis is a major influence. Hollis released his only solo, eponymous album in 1997. Adey commented the album was \\"Uncompromising and in a different league.\\" Recording Adey has previously engineered and mastered recordings for classical labels, recorded various types of music from heavy rock to folk, both in the US where he lived for several years, and his current home city of Edinburgh. He has recorded and self-produced both solo albums All Things Real and The Tower of Silence.

The regatta takes place in June and attracts top crews from around the UK.British Rowing Almanac - All years Racing takes place on the 1500-metres downstream course that stretches from St Mary's Island until just short of Reading Rowing Club clubhouse. The regatta takes place on Saturday and Sunday in June and its importance stems from its date, being immediately before entries close for Henley Royal Regatta. Reading Amateur Regatta was established in 1842 although it had a chequered history until the 1870s, when Reading Rowing Club was founded and revived interest in it.Reading Amateur Regatta - History Section Its re-establishment was also encouraged by the founding of the Reading Working Men's Regatta on the lower lock reach above Sonning Lock in 1877. Another hiatus occurred after World War I, but thenceforth the regatta grew from strength to strength requiring various adaptations to accommodate the entry level. This resulted in a review in 1999 which saw two-lane racing reintroduced on a 1500 metres course by changing from launch to bank umpiring. An ironical conclusion perhaps as in 1844 a ferryman had spent four months in Reading Gaol for attacking an umpire and tipping him into the river with a punt pole in retaliation for disqualification in the previous year's regatta.

Reisman. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2007. pg. xix During this period, Islamic theology was encouraging of thinkers to find knowledge.Bakar, Osman. The History and Philosophy of Islamic Science. Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society, 1999. pg. 2 Thinkers from this period included Al-Farabi, Abu Bishr Matta, Ibn Sina, al- Hassan Ibn al-Haytham and Ibn Bajjah. These works and the important commentaries on them were the wellspring of science during the medieval period. They were translated into Arabic, the lingua franca of this period. Islamic scholarship in the sciences had inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further. However the Islamic world had a greater respect for knowledge gained from empirical observation, and believed that the universe is governed by a single set of laws. Their use of empirical observation led to the formation of crude forms of the scientific method. The study of physics in the Islamic world started in Iraq and Egypt. Fields of physics studied in this period include optics, mechanics (including statics, dynamics, kinematics and motion), and astronomy. Physics Islamic scholarship had inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method. With Aristotelian physics, physics was seen as lower than demonstrative mathematical sciences, but in terms of a larger theory of knowledge, physics was higher than astronomy; many of whose principles derive from physics and metaphysics.. Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History. New Haven:Yale University Press. pg 57 The primary subject of physics, according to Aristotle, was motion or change; there were three factors involved with this change, underlying thing, privation, and form. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle believed that the Unmoved Mover was responsible for the movement of the cosmos, which Neoplatonists later generalized as the cosmos were eternal. Al-Kindi argued against the idea of the cosmos being eternal by claiming that the eternality of the world lands one in a different sort of absurdity involving the infinite; Al-Kindi asserted that the cosmos must have a temporal origin because traversing an infinite was impossible. One of the first commentaries of Aristotle's Metaphysics is by Al-Farabi. In \\"'The Aims of Aristotle's Metaphysics\\", Al-Farabi argues that metaphysics is not specific to natural beings, but at the same time, metaphysics is higher in universality than natural beings. Optics Cover of Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics One field in physics, optics, developed rapidly in this period. By the ninth century, there were works on physiological optics as well as mirror reflections, and geometrical and physical optics.Dallal, Ahmad. Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010. pg. 38 In the eleventh century, Ibn al-Haytham not only rejected the Greek idea about vision, he came up with a new theory.Dallal, Ahmad. Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History. New Haven:Yale University Press. pg 39 Ibn Sahl (c. 940-1000), a mathematician and physicist connected with the court of Baghdad, wrote a treatise On Burning Mirrors and Lenses in 984 in which he set out his understanding of how curved mirrors and lenses bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl is credited with discovering the law of refraction, now usually called Snell's law.K. B. Wolf, \\"Geometry and dynamics in refracting systems\\", European Journal of Physics 16, p. 14-20, 1995.R. Rashed, \\"A pioneer in anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on burning mirrors and lenses\\", Isis 81, p. 464‚Äì491, 1990. He used this law to work out the shapes of lenses that focus light with no geometric aberrations, known as anaclastic lenses. Ibn al-Haytham (known in Western Europe as Alhacen or Alhazen) (965-1040), often regarded as the \\"father of optics\\"R. L. Verma, \\"Al-Hazen: father of modern optics\\", Al-Arabi, 8 (1969): 12-13 and a pioneer of the scientific method, formulated \\"the first comprehensive and systematic alternative to Greek optical theories.\\"D. C. Lindberg, \\"Alhazen's Theory of Vision and its Reception in the West\\", Isis, 58 (1967), p. 322. He postulated in his \\"Book of Optics\\" that light was reflected upon different surfaces in different directions, thus causing different light signatures for a certain object that we see. It was a different approach than that which was previously thought by Greek scientists, such as Euclid or Ptolemy, who believed rays were emitted from the eye to an object and back again. Al-Haytham, with this new theory of optics, was able to study the geometric aspects of the visual cone theories without explaining the physiology of perception. Also in his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham used mechanics to try and understand optics. Using projectiles, he observed that objects that hit a target perpendicularly exert much more force than projectiles that hit at an angle. Al-Haytham applied this discovery to optics and tried to explain why direct light hurts the eye, because direct light approaches perpendicularly and not at an oblique angle. He developed a camera obscura to demonstrate that light and color from different candles can be passed through a single aperture in straight lines, without intermingling at the aperture.David C. Lindberg, \\"The Theory of Pinhole Images from Antiquity to the Thirteenth Century,\\" Archive for History of the Exact Sciences, 5(1968):154-176. His theories were transmitted to the West. His work influenced Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Vitello, who built upon his work and ultimately transmitted it to Kepler. Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n tried to disprove the widely held belief that light is emitted by the eye and not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars for us to see them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.Taqƒ´ al-Dƒ´n. KitƒÅb N≈´r, Book I, Chapter 5, MS ‚ÄòO', folio 14b; MS ‚ÄòS', folio 12a-b Astronomy The Islamic understanding of the astronomical model was based on the Greek Ptolemaic system. However many early astronomers had started to question the model. It was not always accurate in its predictions and was over complicated because astronomers were trying to mathematically describe the movement of the heavenly bodies. Ibn al-Haytham published Al-Shukuk ala Batiamyus (\\"Doubts on Ptolemy\\"), which outlined his many criticisms of the Ptolemaic paradigm. This book encouraged other astronomers to develop new models to explain celestial movement better than Ptolemy.Dallal, Ahmad (1999), \\"Science, Medicine and Technology\\", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York In al- Haytham's Book of Optics he argues that the celestial spheres were not made of solid matter, and that the heavens are less dense that air. Rosen, Edward. (1985). \\"The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres\\". Journal of the History of Ideas. Vol 46(1):13-31. Al-Haytham eventually concludes that heavenly bodies follow the same laws of physics as earthly bodies.Duhem, Pierre. (1969). \\"To Save the Phenomena: An Essay on the Idea of Physical Theory from Plato to Galileo\\". University of Chicago Press, Chicago. Some astronomers theorized about gravity too, al-Khazini suggests that the gravity an object contains varies depending on its distance from the center of the universe. The center of the universe in this case refers to the center of the Earth.Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), \\"Statics\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 614-642 Routledge, London and New York MechanicsImpetus= John Philoponus had rejected the Aristotelian view of motion, and argued that an object acquires an inclination to move when it has a motive power impressed on it. In the eleventh century Ibn Sina had roughly adopted this idea, believing that a moving object has force which is dissipated by external agents like air resistance.Sayili, Aydin. \\"Ibn Sina and Buridan on the Motion the Projectile\\". Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences vol. 500(1). p.477-482. Ibn Sina made distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called \\"mayl\\"), he claimed that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. So he concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. This conception of motion is consistent with Newton's first law of motion, inertia, which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.Espinoza, Fernando. \\"An Analysis of the Historical Development of Ideas About Motion and its Implications for Teaching\\". Physics Education. Vol. 40(2). This idea which dissented from the Aristotelian view was basically abandoned until it was described as \\"impetus\\" by John Buridan, who may have been influenced by Ibn Sina. =Acceleration= In Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ text Shadows, he recognizes that non-uniform motion is the result of acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, this idea closely resembled the concept of momentumNasr S.H., Razavi M.A.. \\"The islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia\\" (1996). Routledge Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion, Abu'l-BarakƒÅt al-BaghdƒÅdƒ´ contradicted this and developed his own theory of motion. In his theory he showed that velocity and acceleration are two different things and force is proportional to acceleration and not velocity. =Reaction= Ibn Bajjah proposed that for every force there is always a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal it is still an early version of the third law of motion which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.Franco, Abel B.. \\"Avempace, Projectile Motion, and Impetus Theory\\".

The Emishi were an indigenous people of North Japan, who were considered hirsute barbarians by the Yamato Japanese. Life Aterui was born in Isawa, Hitakami-no-kuni, what is now Mizusawa Ward of ≈åsh≈´ City in southern Iwate Prefecture. Nothing is known of his life until the battle of Sufuse Village in 787. In 786, Ki no Asami Kosami was appointed by the Emperor Kanmu as the new General of Eastern Conquest and given a commission to conquer Aterui. In June 787, Kosami split his army in two and sent them north from Koromogawa on each side of the Kitakami River hoping to surprise Aterui at his home in Mizusawa. Burning houses and crops as they went they were surprised when Emishi cavalry swept down from the hills to the East and pushed them into the river. Over 1,000 armored infantry drowned in the river weighed down by their heavy armor. In September Kosami returned to Kyoto where he was rebuked by the emperor Kammu for his failure. Another attack in 795 was unsuccessful as well and it was not until 801 that any Japanese general could claim success against the Emishi. In that year Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, who had previously been appointed to the positions of Supervisory Delegate of Michinoku and Ideha and Governor of Michinoku, General of the Peace Guard and Grand General of Conquering East- Barbarians (Sei-i Taish≈çgun), was given a commission by Emperor Kanmu to subjugate the Emishi. He and his 40,000 troops were somewhat successful as he reported back to the emperor on September 27, \\"We conquered the Emishi rebels.\\" But still the Emishi leaders Aterui and More eluded capture. In 802, Tamuramaro returned to Michinoku and built Fort Isawa in the heart of Isawa territory. Then, on April 15, he reported the most important success of all in this campaign: The Emishi leaders Aterui and More surrendered with more than 500 warriors. General Sakanoue delivered Aterui and More to the capital on July 10. Despite General Sakanoue's pleadings the government, \\"cut them down at Moriyama in Kawachi Province\\". This was a major moment in the history of the Emishi conquest. Before this time, the Japanese had adhered to a policy of deporting captured women and children to Western Japan then enticing their warrior husbands and fathers to join their families in their new homes. Captured warriors had not been killed either. The executions of Aterui and More are thought to have been responsible for the fierce resistance by the Emishi over the next hundred years or so. The Yamato Chotei acted this way probably out of fear for Aterui military prowess, and according to some Japanese, Aterui was deported outside of the capital before his execution due to the North-East Deamon's Gate (kimon) superstition from Onmy≈çd≈ç, and so it would have been an attempt by Emperor Kanmu to protect the Capital against the ghost of Aterui. The head of King Aterui was buried at Katano-jinja, a shrine who may have been linked with Aterui's ancestors, by sh≈çgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, out of respect for his enemy. Annual private ceremonies have been held for King Aterui by the Shinto priests for the last 1200 years. For many Japanese, he was long demonized as the \\"Lord of the Bad Road\\" (ÊÇ™Ë∑ØÁéã Akuro-≈ç). \\"Aku\\" can also be mean \\"ferocious\\" and \\"strong\\", not only \\"evil\\".

The son of Sir Philip Howard and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Newton, 1st Baronet, he received no legacy from his debt-ridden father. Through the influence of his cousin, Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Morpeth in 1698 and Carlisle in 1701. He won the contested election at Carlisle despite being abroad in France, attempting to persuade the Earl's brother William to return to England. Harley considered Howard, during his brief time in the House of Commons, a Whig; but he was defeated at the contested election of 1702, despite his cousin's continued support. Howard was commissioned a lieutenant-colonel in the newly raised Edward Fox's Regiment of Marines and traveled with them to Europe, but he resigned his commission by the end of the year. Howard's later life is obscure, and seems to have been financially troubled. His exact date of death is not known, but his executors were granted probate on 14 May 1711.

The BQM-145A was designed to precede airstrike packages into a target area and relay reconnaissance information in real time. Design and development Production BQM-145As were to have a metal airframe, but the initial two prototypes were built with plastic composites, with initial flight in May 1992. The program then collapsed in 1993 due to technical difficulties and funding cutbacks. Six BQM-145As with plastic-composite airframes then under construction were later completed, with first flight of a composite BQM-145A in 1997. Operational history Apparently Northrop Grumman has continued to use the BQM-145As for other experiments. Some sources claim they have been evaluated for unmanned strike missions, and paintings have been circulated showing a BQM-145A fitted with a \\"high-power microwave (HPM)\\" generator in the nose to fry adversary electronic equipment. It has been confirmed that BQM-145As have been flown in the US on test flights carrying HPM payloads. The BQM-145A has some broad similarities to the Scarab, with a similar configuration except that it has twin air intakes on either side of the fuselage, just forward of the wing roots. Like the Scarab, it has no landing gear. It is powered by a Teledyne CAE F408-CA-400 (Model 382-10C) turbofan engine, with 4.4 kN (455 kgp / 1000 lbf) thrust. It can be air launched from a standard fighter aircraft such as the F-16 or the F/A-18.

The Goldeneye is a \\"tail-sitter\\" or \\"pogo\\" machine that takes off and lands straight up. It is a stumpy-looking machine with four tailfins, each with landing gear on the fintip, and a wing that pivots, allowing it to be aligned with the aircraft centerline in cruise flight and at a right angle to the centerline in hover flight. The Goldeneye is built of graphite and fiberglass composites, and has a low radar, infrared, and acoustic signature. It is powered by a 28 kW (38 hp) Wankel-rotary engine from AV Engines Ltdhttp://www.uavenginesltd.co.uk/ in the UK. It has an autonomous flight control system with GPS-INS navigation.

The building was constructed between 1962 and 1964 and designed by Danforth Toan. The building drew attention as the first building in the area constructed in the Brutalist style, and alongside the Sciences Library, Graduate Center, and List Art Building, is one of the campus's four significant examples of Brutalist architecture. The library houses Brown University's East Asian Collection, which started in 1961 after Charles Sidney Gardner donated about 30,000 volumes, most of them Chinese. In 1965, a Federal grant led to the formal establishment of the East Asia Language and Area Center, which has since become the East Asian Studies Department.

About Triangle Beers TBC did not plan to be cast as a Belgian style brewery when they developed their first beer, the Belgian Strong Golden Ale; rather, they wanted to enter the market with something notable and different.Four cheers for local breweries - Diversions The goal of TBC was to produce balanced, full-flavored, yet highly drinkable Belgian and American style ales. TBC was distributed across North Carolina, primarily in the Triangle Area (Durham, Orange, and Wake Counties) but as far as Asheville and Charlotte. TBC did not pasteurize any of its beers. TBC also produced a small amount of cask ale in firkins for use at special events. TBC was one of the first NC breweries to offer its flagship beers in cans. On April 30, 2016, Triangle closed due to operations issues and heavy competition from the growing North Carolina micro and craft brewing industry. IndyWeek  Durham beer pioneer Triangle Brewing Company talks why it's closing List of beers *Triangle Belgian-style Golden Ale is the TBC's flagship beer, and continues to be brewed year-round. It is 8% ABV, fermented at warmer temperatures than the other ales to further develop the significant yeast complexity, lightly filtered, and uses TBC's proprietary Belgian yeast strain. *Triangle American- style Xtra Pale Ale is the TBC's second year-round beer, meant to be a session beer at 4.5%. It is a straw-colored, hoppy American craft brewery style of Pale Ale, using Washington grown Palisade, Centennial and Magnum hops. It uses the TBC's proprietary American yeast strain. *Triangle Belgian-style White Ale is the TBC's Summer seasonal offering, a wheat beer that is totally unfiltered, made with white wheat, with limited use of hops and incorporating the traditional spices - orange peel and coriander. 5% ABV. It uses TBC's Belgian yeast. *Triangle Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel is a seasonal offering of another complex, yeasty beer, at 7.2% ABV. The style is characterized by a large head, moderate maltiness, fruitiness, and warmth from the alcohol content. There has been a bourbon-barrel-aged version. It uses TBC's Belgian yeast. *Triangle Imperial Amber is a heavily hopped Double Red ale, around 90 IBUs, and is 8.2%ABV. It uses very high amounts of malt to balance the very high level of bitterness, resulting in the high alcohol content as well. It uses TBC's American yeast. *Triangle Stout is a winter seasonal in the Foreign Stout style using chocolate and other dark roasted malts, resulting in a deep ruby color appearing almost black, and flavor notes similar to coffee. It is 5.6%ABV. It uses TBC's American yeast. *Triangle Mild Ale is a British-style seasonal using domestic and imported malts to get at the complex nutty flavor of the style, meant to be a session beer.

Background The Lomwe are one of the four largest ethnic groups living in Malawi and have history of migration across the Mozambique‚ÄìMalawi border. Many Lomwe moved into Malawi towards the end of the 19th century and got mixed with the Chewa, in the 1930s due to tribal wars in Mozambique. The Elhomwe language spoken in Malawi is to a large extent a Mihavane dialect while in some districts like Thyolo there are traces of Kokholha dialect. Just like all major tribes of Malawi, the Lhomwes are not natives of Malawi but the Akafula also known as the Mwandionelapati or Abathwa, were the original natives of Malawi. The Malawian government has taken a step in preserving the language by broadcasting news in Elhomwe language on its MBC radio 1. The establishment of the cultural organisation Mulhako Wa Alhomwe by the late President of Malawi, Bingu wa Mutharika, on 25 October, 2008, was another milestone. The Mulhako Wa Alhomwe has its headquarters at Chonde in Mulanje District. It was set up to preserve Lhomwe customs, beliefs and language. It has a library and a school of Elhomwe. Although the Elhomwe dialect spoken in Malawi is not mutually intelligible with other dialects of Lomwe spoken in Mozambique it shares many similarities including vocabulary. For instance one could note the similarities in the following word forms: otchuna (Emakhuwa), onthuna (Lmeetto), and ohuna (Elhomwe) meaning \\"to want\\". Similarly the word for \\"women\\" is anamwaani (Emakhuwa and Elhomwe), anumwane (Lmeetto). ReferencesBibliography *Boerder, R.B. (1984) Silent Majority: A History of the Lomwe in Malawi.

He is known for his unique staging of films that cover all aspects of the art of motion pictures from their inception to the present. His programs are shown in his 40-seat theatre \\"The Cineforum\\". Hartt has been described as \\"one of Canada's foremost authorities on the art, business, culture and history of motion pictures.\\" (Montreal Mirror), Stated Robert Furmanek of THE 3D Film Archive, \\"I am delighted to hear that Reg Hartt will be presenting a course on 3D Filmmaking. I can think of no one better suited to discuss the amazing and groundbreaking stereo cinematography of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\\" Stated Academy Award honored animation director and producer Chuck Jones, \\"In preserving and presenting our films as we meant them to be seen Reg Hartt is doing great work for the art of animation.\\" (Letter to Hartt). Hartt created his CineForum in Toronto as a \\"living, breathing work of art.\\" (Ed Keenan, Toronto Star). Hartt has been described as \\"everything Jane Jacobs wrote about in THE DEATH AND LIFE OF GREAT AMERICAN CITIES.\\" (Laura Lind, EYE weekly). British painter Peter More describes Hartt's CineForum as \\"the best place on earth in which to view a movie.\\" Hartt has made a lifetime study of THE I CHING and THE NEW TESTAMENT by practicing the ideas taught in both daily. His CineForum welcomes strangers. \\"Reg Hartt is a Crazy-Wisdom-Yogin. He is living absolutely the life he is teaching. As a Buddhist, that is the highest compliment I can pay.\\" --Jerzy Zaborski. Reg Hartt is recognized as one of the top fifty male speakers of all time. \\"The best part of a Reg Hartt program is what he has to say.\\"--Jane Jacobs. \\"My mother loved Reg Hartt.\\"--James Jacobs. Reg Hartt purchased an authorized replica of The Turin Shroud. After acquiring ever available book and DVD Hartt now speaks authoritatively about the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. States Hartt, \\"THE TURIN SHROUD gives us the image of a corpse suspended vertically in the air, which is impossible but which nonetheless is. It captures the instant just before life returned to that dead body. As Dame Isabel Piczek has stated, \\"The Turin Shroud shows as an Event Horizon, a moment just like the original Big Bang during which everything was created but also a moment when everything was created again.\\" Early career Beginning in 1965, Hartt originally screened his films in rented locations. These included the Bathurst Street Church and the Spadina Hotel, as well as Sneaky Dee's, Rochdale College and locations on Queen Street West and Mirvish Village. From 1970 to 1975 he served as Director Of Cinema Studies at Toronto's Rochdale College. He has lectured at art galleries, colleges, museums, schools, theatres and universities across Canada and in The United States. The Cineforum Since 1992 he has shown the movies in his house on Bathurst Street. The screening room is his front parlour. A neon sign reading \\"Cineforum\\" placed in the front window indicates his presence. An inscription in ancient Greek over the front door reads \\"abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\\" Hartt's characteristic black and white typewriter-text-with-film-stills advertising posters are ubiquitous around downtown Toronto to the point where they were used as part of the background of a comic book cover.The Punisher 2, Marvel Comics (2004) He can be seen occasionally riding his bicycle with a big stack of them in the front basket.Hartt states, \\"I enjoy street postering. It's exercise. I see the city. I meet people.\\" Cineforum Alumnae Many artists, musicians & writers have passed through the doors of Cineforum. A few of these include: Laval-raised alt/country troubadour Petunia has released over ten albums and tours North America and Europe regularly. A multi-talented bilingual artist, his rarely seen unreleased 16mm film \\"El Rallado\\" was shot in and around Cineforum and the city of Toronto, and includes footage of Hartt's late Father. Petunia resided at the house for some time, helping to create/inspire the painting on the veranda, steps, and facade of the leading up to the house on Bathurst St. He is now based in Vancouver and Los Angeles and returns regularly to Toronto. His most recent release is 2016's 'Dead Bird On The Highway'. Scots/Canadian musician/writer/poet The Mad Dalton (aka Pierre Dalton / Peter GW Sumadh) arrived at Cineforum late one summer having recently returned from Scotland and with an Allen Ginsberg biography in his hand. He had been lured to Cineforum by a poster he'd seen for a screening of Jean Cocteau's \\"Blood Of A Poet\\" and, being homeless at the time, Hartt invited him to stay & he remained for over a year. He occupied the \\"sloping room\\" on the upper floor of the house, working as a projectionist and assisted in running Cineforum for a time while Hartt focused on writing \\"The Epic Of Gilgamesh\\". He accompanied Hartt during his only visit to New York City and met Al Aronowitz and Shamus Culhane as well as shows in Guelph, Montreal, and Kitchener-Waterloo. There he witnessed the infamous riot where the crowd rushed the stage culminating in a male audience member kissing Hartt on the lips. Though now based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Sumadh returns to Cineforum regularly for readings and live performances calling his time there: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the single best education I could have ever possibly imagined, validating all I had believed yet it made me re-think everything too...\\". Film presentations The films he screens are generally old and tend to the bizarre; typical programs include \\"the anarchist surrealist hallucinatory film festival\\" featuring works of Man Ray, Salvador Dal√≠ and Luis Bu√±uel, or \\"the sex and violence cartoon festival\\", featuring racy Bugs Bunny cartoons including some of the infamous Censored Eleven. Other offerings include \\"Kid Dracula\\" (Murnau's Nosferatu set to Radiohead's Kid A) and a clean print of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will. Although met with controversy, his screening of Triumph of the Will is understood to be educational and has been described as such by Bernie Farber (former executive director of the Canadian Jewish Congress), and author Jane Jacobs, among others.The Telegraph Journal, Saint John, New Brunswick, September 20, 1995 His collection includes many rare items and he has also screened rare films by Winsor McCay and Mike Jittlov.REF The Kensington Drum, April 1995 Past presentations have included guest programmers. The complete Zatoichi film franchise series was hosted by Grey Coyote of Paradise Bound Music. Charlie Huisken of This Ain't the Rosedale Library is a frequent guest programmer, as was Jamie Ross, Andre Skinner of Canteen Knockout. Nima Hoda did an in-depth look at the music of Bernard Herrmann for Jason and the Argonauts. Hartt is known for delivering inspired addresses on the subject of Jesus Christ, cartoons, or anecdotes concerning his varied life experiences as a prologue to, or during the breaks in his longer programs. His residency at Rochdale College, where he was director of cinema studies, is the topic of a spoken word performance, and he has hosted some of the city's most notorious poetry readingsEye Magazine, May 13th, 1993 Well known by many of Toronto's residents, Hartt has been host to many famous artists and writers, including writer John Robert Colombo, film historian Elwy Yost, rock journalist Al Aronowitz, Jane Jacobs, science- fiction writer Judith Merril, British artist Peter Moore, Canadian animator John Kricfalusi, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Grim Natwick, Shamus Culhane, Bernard B. Brown, and Pierre Berton, who gave his last public reading at the Cineforum. Legal problems In May 2017, Hartt was charged two counts of possessing child pornography, two counts of accessing child pornography and one count of ‚Äúmaking available‚Äù child pornography. Hartt denied the charges, claiming that the images were likely downloaded by a stranger who used the wifi during one of his screenings. Police with a search warrant also found 250 images ‚Äúthat could be found in pornography museums around the world or reputable bookstores around the world,‚Äù according to Hartt. Those charges were dropped early in Hartt's case. Hartt notes that artists and educators have a right under the law in Canada to access, study and make use of such material for artistic and educational purpose provided that use is not harmful to persons under 16 (Criminal Code of Canada). Hartt has been under vicious and sustained attacks through the use of smear posters since 2000. This has been documented in THE GLOBE AND MAIL and elsewhere. \\"In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.\\" Martin Luther King, Jr. Reg Hartt knows all about the silence of his friends.  Quotes  Quotes about *‚ÄúSomeone ought to do it, but why should I? Someone ought to do it, so why not I? Between these two sentences lie whole centuries of moral evolution.‚Äù--Annie Besant. For Reg Hartt the answer has always been, \\"Why not I.\\" \\"Reg Hartt is the only man in Toronto who stands up.\\"--Ed Keenan, Toronto Star. *‚ÄúReg Hartt is what living in a metropolis is all about. He personifies the city as a meeting place of ideas, as a feast of experience and discussion and debate, as a triumph of the original and provoking over the banality and soporific.‚Äù ‚Äì Michael Valpy, The Globe and Mail *‚ÄúSome audience members were visibly distressed by the frequency and force of Hartt‚Äôs interjections into the program but it is clearly his chosen way of doing things, and the payoff in information is worth it. He has many good stories to tell: about Oswald the Lucky Rabbit‚Äôs transformation into Mickey Mouse, Disney‚Äôs most enduring character; about the furor that greeted the creation of Tweety Pie, which subsided only when the artists painted him yellow; and much valuable technical information for the animation students. He has some interesting tales about Mel Blanc, Warner Brothers' resident genius of voice acting, as he continues the series with a full scale look at the Warner work of Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and others. It‚Äôs the best work of its kind you will see anywhere because, except in rare oases in the United States and Eastern- Europe, they don‚Äôt make them like that anymore.‚Äù ‚Äì Paul McGrath, The Globe and Mail *‚ÄúSurrealism is an art movement that requires and deserves explanation, and Hartt did that well.‚Äù - Barend Keifte, The Muse. St. John's, Newfoundland (July l5, 1988) *‚ÄúSome time ago I attended a showing of the Nazi propaganda film, Triumph of the Will, in a program put on by Reg Hartt (who) prefaced the film with an excellent commentary on the frightening skill with which expert propagandists can manipulate and fool unwary, credulous or self-deceived viewers. I thought the program was eminently educational, indeed almost a necessary form of education in the sense that it so vividly and effectively inoculated viewers against accepting propaganda at face value. The program went way beyond the all-too-common hassle over good versus bad propaganda because it was anti-propaganda of any sort: anti-manipulation. ‚Äì Jane Jacobs, activist, author, urbanologist *\\"I am a friend of Reg Hartt. So is anyone who can appreciate a man who teaches the way Neal Cassady drove a bus. I mean that, where you have style wrapped around content and tied with a ribbon of beat improvisation, there you have angels. Harvey Pekar was an angel. And I‚Äôve never met anyone with wings who did not have an ego. Nor is this an easy town for a man who is larger than life, and does not to suffer fools. You might like to know that the friends of Reg Hartt included the non-fool-suffering Jane Jacobs, who knew a thing or two about what, and who, makes life worth living in the city; that‚Äôs good enough for me.\\"--Joe Fiorito, Toronto Star, (Sept. 15, 2010) *‚ÄúThe Cineforum, indeed the whole house, is itself a work of art, a living, breathing work of art,‚Äù Hartt says. That it is...His Cineforum is a tribute to the virtues of the unplanned, the uncorporate, the uncertified, the unregulated. What a treasure to live in a place where a character like Hartt can make a place for his passions and his art and where anyone can go and share them.Toronto‚Äôs government constantly proclaims its belief in the Gospel of Jane Jacobs. But bureaucrats can‚Äôt see the value in the kind of fascinating, eccentric home Hartt keeps. Instead, they try to shut him down in the very year they are loudly celebrating the 100th anniversary of Jacobs‚Äô birth. If they understood the first thing about Jacobs‚Äô work, they would let Hartt continue to develop his own.\\"--Ed Keenan, Toronto Star (June 27, 2016) *\\"By providing a free forum for curious Torontonians to consume and talk about art, it has in its modest way enriched the cultural life of the city. Any law that would erase this unique landmark on purely bureaucratic grounds is an ass of exactly the sort Jacobs fought so fiercely against.\\"-- Editorial, Toronto Star (June 28, 2016). *\\"Reg Hartt) the founder of a landmark alternative theatre in downtown Toronto is refusing to back down in the face of a poster-bullying campaign that seems designed to bring violence upon him and his associates.The poster campaigns range from overt incitements to violence.\\"--Oliver Moore, The Globe And Mail (Feb. 24, 2012). *\\"Media accounts of the Cineforum are invariably written from an intensely personal perspective, because visiting the Cineforum is an intensely personal experience, where the audience, no matter what size, is always treated as the individuals that they are, and not as a homogeneous group of people with a single thought. Unsurprisingly then, one of the CineForum‚Äôs longtime supporters was Jane Jacobs, the late activist who promoted individual communities within an urban mosaic.\\"--David Wencer, Heritage Toronto, (Jan. 14, 2013) *\\"The Cineforum is a tiny theatre that screens silent films, Bugs Bunny cartoons, and the Wizard of Oz synced up with Pink Floyd. Not many Torontonians have visited, but chances are good that they know about it. Reg Hartt advertises the Cineforum with basic white posters, and the posters are everywhere. The first time you visit the Cineforum is never what you expect. The floors creak and the lighting is old, yellowish and dim. Down the front hallway is a kitchen, cluttered but clean. You may feel the uneasiness of having trespassed in a stranger‚Äôs home, because that‚Äôs also what the Cineforum is. Reg Hartt has ignored zoning bylaws and has put the Cineforum in his living room. ‚Äú[The Cineforum] is part Gertrude Stein‚Äôs salon and part Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory wrapped in a Toronto version of Henri Langlois‚Äôs original Paris Cin√©math√®que‚Äù, says Hartt... Hartt faces a new challenge: he has become the target of a slander campaign. Anonymous posters started appearing in Toronto, first targetting Hartt, then also targetting one of the other residents of the Cineforum. The latter were most troubling, as they accused the individual in question of secretly videotaping drug dealers and giving the address of the Cineforum. Feeling that they might be attacked, Hartt says he felt that closing the theatre was necessary. ‚ÄúWhen I looked at those [posters], the starkness of them, I said, no, you gotta shut down, you can‚Äôt take any chances. I was shut down for two days. That gave me time to think. In that time that I was shut down, I reflected and thought about all the people I‚Äôve known over the years, and how I didn‚Äôt fight I would be letting them down, and realized sometimes you just have to stand up.‚Äù Hartt has responded by, again, calling and writing to every politician he can. Hartt has also put up his own posters, hundreds of them, defending himself from the charges and inviting people to come to the Cineforum again. It all seems at odds with the popular perception of Toronto: we are supposed to be polite, distant, and a little awkward. Hartt, in his stubbornness, doesn‚Äôt fit into this mold. Yet he is part of Toronto, and Toronto is better because of it.. ‚ÄúI have a bit of the fighting Irish in me‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù--Eric Brauer, June 21, 2012. *‚ÄúReg Hartt has had an amazing impact given the size of the venue and the esoteric nature of the programming. He‚Äôs had an incredible impact on the city. No one else is doing it. No one else has ever done it.‚Äù‚ÄìRob Salem. *‚ÄúReg Hartt has a feel for film unique in this country‚Ä¶genius level.‚Äù‚ÄîElwy Yost. *My knowledge of silent films, German and French cinema, came an awful lot from Reg Hartt‚Äôs Cineforum. At first he showed films at Innis College, then he had a place on Mercer St. for a while. Reg showed some really incredible silent films, from Phantom of the Opera to D.W. Griffith‚Äôs films. His strength was putting incredibly good soundtracks on the films. He has a really good ear for movie music and back in the good old days when it was all analog, he would splice them together himself. https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2013/04/05/a_drink_with_shirley_hughes_director_toronto_silent_film_festival.html *A city that sees value in rules, but no value in letting Reg Hartt bend them, has no right to claim Jane Jacobs‚Äô legacy.\\"--Edward Keenan, Toronto Star. *\\"Some audience members were visibly distressed by the frequency and force of Hartt‚Äôs interjections into the program but it is clearly his chosen way of doing things, and the payoff in information is worth it.

He is someone who does not rely on government grants, subsidies or institutional protection to generate his film activities. He depends entirely on his intelligence, talent and resourcefulness.

Surajkund (literal meaning is 'Lake of the Sun') is an artificial Kund ('Kund' means \\"lake\\" or reservoir) built in the backdrop of the Aravalli hills with an amphitheatre shaped embankment constructed in semicircular form. It is said to have been built by the king Surajpal of the Tomara dynasty in the 10th century. Tomar, a younger son of Anangpal Tomar - the ruler of Delhi, was a sun worshipper and he had therefore built a Sun temple on its western bank. Surajkund is known for its annual fair \\"Surajkund International Craft Mela\\", 2015 edition of this fair was visited by 1.2 million visitors including 160,000 foreigners with more than 20 countries participating in it. It is an important biodiversity area within the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor stretching from Sariska Tiger Reserve to Delhi. Historical place around sanctuary are Badkhal Lake (6 km northeast), Anangpur Dam (16 km north), Damdama Lake, Tughlaqabad Fort and Adilabad ruins (both in Delhi), Chhatarpur Temple (in Delhi).ASOLA BHATTI WILD LIFE SANCTUARY , Department of Forest, Delhi Government It is contiguous to the seasonal waterfalls in Pali-Dhuaj-Kot villages of Faridabad,‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§°‡•à‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡§æ ‡§ù‡§∞‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä the scared Mangar Bani and the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. There are several dozen lakes formed in the abandoned open pit mines in and around the area. Another 'kund' by the same name as 'Suraj Kund' existed in Sunam city, tahsil and sub-division of the Sangrur District in Punjab. This was sacked by Mahmood Ghaznvi or Taimur Lane. The temple is now in ruins. Topography Surajkund is located near the Surajkund village between the villages of Baharpur and Lakkarpur in Faridabad district of Haryana. The lake's drainage basin is part of the Aravalli hill ranges. It is fed from the north western side by a local nullah (stream) that initially feeds the Anagpur dam on the upstream, this dam was built by Samrat Anangpal Tomar. The storage in the tank or lake has been seriously affected since the catchment area contributing flows into the Surajkund (lake) from villages such as Anangpur, Lakkarpur, Ankhir and Meola Maharajpur has been used for extensive mining and for large habitations, which has disturbed the drainage system and thus obstructed the gravity flow of rain water from the basin into the reservoir. This situation is stated to have also affected the flora and fauna of the area. ;Stone Age link In the Aravalli hill ranges, which spreads over Delhi and Haryana, where the Surajkund and the Anagpur Dam are located, ancient Stone Age relics have been revealed. The Aravallis, which strike out in two directions from Delhi exhibits a topography of low and rugged hills. The stratigraphy in the area is considered to consist of reddish rocks and scrub and has the luxuriance of the Stone Age progression. Stone Age material have been unearthed in the region at 43 sites on the road from Delhi to Surajkund and south of the Suraj Kund-Faridabad road, Anangpur hills and Ankhir pahari on the road on the low ridge from Faridabad to Surajkund. The Stone Age relics comprise Microliths and lower Paleolithics. From a study of the prehistoric findings along the ridges of Surajkund reservoir, Anagpur Dam, and around Delhi and adjoining parts of Haryana, it has been inferred that the southern hilly area of Delhi and Haryana was environmentally suited for pre- historic man to settle here.Singh p.185 History According to bardic tradition (a tradition steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country) the Yadav kings who initially lived near the Aravalli hills shifted to the Surajkund area near Lal Kot, which was built by the Yadavs. Lal Kot was renamed as Qila Rai Pithora, after Prithvi Raj Chauhan (the second last Hindu king of Delhi). Archaeological excavations have revealed existence of a Sun temple here based on ruins that can be seen even now. Certain carved stones were recently recovered from the reservoir. Some stones have also been re-used in subsequent restoration works. Some historians also claim it was named after King Surajpal himself who built it. It is also said that Suraj Pal built this lake for his daughter. During the Tughlaq Dynasty rule of Feroz Shah Tughlaq (1351‚Äì88), the reservoir was refurbished by rebuilding the steps and terraces with stones in lime mortar. On the western bank of the reservoir, a garhi (cave like structure) was built close to the ancient site of the Sun temple. Though historians have not specifically alluded to this tank, it is also said that it was built in 686 AD by Suraj Pal (after whom the tank is probably named) son of Anang PalI. It is in the form of a segment (semi circular) with the chord on its west side. Another theory for the name 'Suraj' suffixed to the kund (lake) is that it was named after the Sun Temple that existed on the east side of the lake. Even though the Tomar dynasty vanished in the 12th century, the Surajkund has not been affected. It attracted the attention of the Haryana Government to develop the area as a tourist spot by introducing an annual crafts 'Mela' or \\"fair\\" titled \\"Surajkund Crafts Mela\\" in the precincts of the lake, which over the years has attracted wide publicity and become an iconic event. Structure A panoramic view of the entire Surjakund lake during the dry season The reservoir has been built in the shape of the rising sun with an eastward arc. It is enclosed within a steep embankment made in semi-circular shape made of stepped stones. Rain fall was intercepted here to create a reservoir of diameter to meet the water shortage in Delhi. It has an area of . The reservoir provides a grand spectacle, and in the past it was the hunting forest resort. It abounds in dancing peacocks. The reservoir is filled up during every monsoon season but remains dry during summer, before the onset of the monsoon rains. The tank underwent major repairs in the 1920s during the British times. Other attractions A natural spring called the Siddha-Kund, held in reverence, is seen about to the south of Surajkund, which is frequented by pilgrims. =Surajkund hot springAnagpur Dam= Two kilometres (1.2 mi) away to the south west of Surajkund, there is more ancient Anagpur Dam of the 8th century. =Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary= Asola Bhatti Wild Life Sanctuary is on the Southern Ridge of the northern terminal of Aravalli Hills, close to the Surajkund.

Eustace Loraine was the first child of Rear-Admiral Sir Lambton Loraine, 11th Baronet and his wife Frederica Mary Horatia (n√©e Broke). His younger brother Percy was born in 1880. He was the great grandson of Rear Admiral Sir Philip Broke a distinguished naval officer.\\"The Accident.\\" Times [London, England] 6 July 1912: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 May 2014. Service in Africa Loraine was gazetted as a Second Lieutenant on 5 July 1899 with the Grenadier Guards. He was promoted to Lieutenant in May 1900 a month after his arrival in South Africa where he served until May 1902 when he returned to England. He served as adjutant, Grenadier Guards from July 1905 until September 1906. Promoted to Captain in July 1907 he was selected for the West African Frontier Force in October 1908. He later served in Nigeria on the headquarters staff in Lagos and as a section commander on Colonel Trenchard's 1907 / 1908 expedition to the Munshi tribe. In 1909 whilst Loraine was still in Nigeria, reports reached him of Louis Bl√©riot's flight across the English Channel. This news stirred Loraine's curiosity and he decided to find out more about flying. Pioneer aviator The War Office was content to pay for Loraine's flying training and he was seconded from the Grenadier Guards in order that he might learn to fly. Loraine successfully completed his flying training and was granted Royal Aero Club certificate number 154 which was dated 7 November 1911.Great Britain's Earliest Aviators at content- delivery.co.uk Loraine was in correspondence with Trenchard, who was serving in Ireland, and he kept Trenchard informed about his progress as an aviator. On one occasion in Spring / Summer 1912, Loraine wrote to Trenchard urging him to learn to fly. Trenchard was greatly impressed by Loraine's words which read \\"You've no idea what you're missing, ... Come and see men like ants crawling.\\" At that time Trenchard was looking for a new direction and after reading Loraine's letter he decided to try to learn to fly. Trenchard went on to command the Flying Corps in France during World War I and then serve as the Royal Air Force's first Chief of the Air Staff. At some stage in 1911 or early 1912, Lorraine was attached to No. 2 Company of the Air Battalion which was based at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. On 13 May 1912, with the establishment of the Royal Flying Corps, No. 2 Company was redesignated No. 3 Squadron RFC and Loraine remained at Larkhill. Death Memorial to Captain Loraine and Staff-Sergeant Wilson in original location Less than two months later and exactly 13 years since he joined the Army, Loraine and his passenger Staff Sergeant R H V Wilson were flying a Nieuport Monoplane out of Larkhill on a routine morning practice sortie. They were executing a tight turn when the aircraft fell towards the ground and crashed. Wilson was killed outright and although Loraine was speedily transported to Bulford Hospital in a horse-drawn ambulance, he succumbed to his wounds only a few minutes after arriving at the Hospital. Loraine and Wilson were the first Flying Corps personnel to die in an aircraft crash while on duty. Later in the day an order was issued which stated \\"Flying will continue this evening as usual\\", thus beginning a tradition. The site of the crash at Greenlands Bottom, near the old intersection of the A344 and the A360 roads and less than a mile west of Stonehenge, is now known as 'Airman's Cross'. A stone cross memorial was placed in the middle of the grass island at the junction. The inscription reads: 'To the memory of Captain Loraine and Staff-Sergeant Wilson who whilst flying on duty, met with a fatal accident near this spot on July 5, 1912. Erected by their comrades'. On 25 June 2012 the memorial was removed from its roadside position to make way for a new roundabout leading to a new visitors' centre at Stonehenge. It was kept in storage in Royal Engineers' barracks at Perham Down until it was re-erected within the area of the new Stonehenge visitors' centre, which opened in December 2013.

This is the first novel in a trilogy featuring former MGB Agent Leo Demidov, who investigates a series of gruesome child murders in Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. Themes This novel, the first in a trilogy, takes inspiration from the crimes of Andrei Chikatilo, also known as the Rostov Ripper, the Butcher of Rostov, and the Red Ripper. Chikatilo was convicted of and executed for committing 52 murders in the Soviet Union, though his crimes occurred after the Stalin era. In addition to highlighting the problem of Soviet-era criminality in a state where \\"there is no crime\\", the novel explores the paranoia of the age, the education system, the secret police apparatus, orphanages, homosexuality in the USSR, and mental hospitals. The second and third books in the trilogy, titled The Secret Speech (April 2009) and Agent 6 (July 2011), respectively, also feature the protagonist Leo Demidov and his wife, Raisa. Awards Child 44 has been translated into 36 languages. Additionally, it was nominated for 17 international awards and won seven. In 2008, it was named on the long list for the Man Booker Prize, nominated for the 2008 Costa First Novel Award (former Whitbread), and received the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger award for best thriller of the year from the Crime Writers' Association. It was also shortlisted for the Desmond Elliott Prize for a first novel in 2008, and Smith was awarded the 2008 Galaxy Book Award for Best New Writer. In July 2009, he won the Waverton Good Read Award for first novel and the Galaxy Book Award for Best Newcomer. In January 2011, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan listed it in their Book Club 100 Books of the Decade. Reception The New York Times called Child 44 a \\"tightly woven\\", \\"ingeniously plotted\\", \\"high-voltage story\\". The Sunday Telegraph praised it as a \\"memorable debut\\": \\"the atmosphere of paranoia and paralysing fear is brilliantly portrayed and unremittingly grim\\". Kirkus Reviews gave it a starred review, calling it \\"smashing\\"; \\"nerve-wracking pace and atmosphere camouflage wild coincidences\\". In an Observer review, Peter Guttridge praised it as a \\"thrilling, intense piece of fiction\\". Another New York Times reviewer called it \\"an adequate police procedural\\", and a review of the paperback edition in The Guardian said \\"the story is exciting, but the characters and dialogue are underdeveloped, and the prose studiously bland\\". This view was mirrored by a further review for The Guardian, by Angus Macqueen, who stated that while \\"this is a compelling detective story\\", \\"the desire for the plot to encompass every element of Soviet history eventually overrides any sense of artistic seriousness\\". Macqueen did state that the novel \\"remains a real achievement\\" and that it delivers \\"all the pleasures of a brilliant airport read\\". Film adaptation In April 2007, it was announced that Ridley Scott had optioned the film rights. Fox 2000 bought the project, and in 2009, a film based on the novel was announced, with Scott originally attached as director and producer. Ultimately the film Child 44 (2015) was produced by Scott and Michael Costigan and directed by Daniel Espinosa. Child 44 stars Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Charles Dance, and Joel Kinnaman.

Mexican wine and wine making began with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, when they brought vines from Europe to modern day Mexico, the oldest wine-growing region in the Americas. Although there were indigenous grapes before the Spanish conquest, the Spaniards found that Spanish grapevines also did very well in the colony of New Spain (Mexico) and by the 17th century wine exports from Spain to the New World fell. In 1699, Charles II of Spain prohibited wine making in Mexico, with the exception of wine for Church purposes. From then until Mexico‚Äôs Independence, wine was produced in Mexico only on a small scale. After Independence, wine making for personal purposes was no longer prohibited and production rose, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many other European immigrant groups helped with the comeback of wine in Mexico. However, the Mexican Revolution set back wine production, especially in the north of the country. Wine production in Mexico has been rising in both quantity and quality since the 1980s, although competition from foreign wines and 40% tax on the product makes competing difficult within Mexico. Mexico is not traditionally a wine-drinking country, but rather prefers beer, tequila and mezcal. Interest in Mexican wine, especially in the major cities and tourists areas (along with the introduction into the US on a small scale), has grown along with Mexican wines‚Äô reputation throughout the world. Many Mexican companies have received numerous awards. Various wine producers from Mexico have won international awards for their products. There are three major wine producing areas in Mexico, with the Baja California area producing 90% of Mexico‚Äôs wine. This area is promoted heavily for enotourism with the ‚ÄúRuta del Vino‚Äù (Wine Route), which connects over fifty wineries with the port of Ensenada and the border and the annual Vendimia harvest festival. History of wine making in Mexico Vineyard in Ezequiel Montes, Quer√©taro Vineyard in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato According to legend, Hern√°n Cort√©s and his soldiers quickly depleted the wine they brought with them from Spain celebrating the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521. Because of this, one of Cort√©s‚Äô first acts as governor was to order the planting of grapevines throughout New Spain. In the early colonial era, ships arriving to Mexico and Spain‚Äôs other colonies carried grapevines. In certain areas, Spaniards found a native type of grapevine, but it did not lend itself well to winemaking. However, vines from Europe grew very well here, and they were planted in monasteries and haciendas in the states of Puebla, Coahuila, Zacatecas and others. In 1597, Casa Madero was founded by Lorenzo Garc√≠a in the town of Santa Mar√≠a de las Parras (Holy Mary of the Grapevines) as the oldest winery in the Americas. This area of Coahuila soon became a major wine producer due to its climate and good supplies of water. The vines that were established here were later exported to the Napa Valley in California and South America. Vineyards in the Americas, especially New Spain were successful enough that wine exports from Spain to America plummeted. Because of this, Charles II decided to prohibit the production of wine in Spain‚Äôs colonies, especially Mexico, except for the making of wine for the Church in 1699. That prohibition stayed in force until Mexico‚Äôs Independence. However, many missionaries refused to abide by the edict and continued to produce wine for normal consumption on a small scale. One of these was Jesuit priest Juan Ugarte, who planted the first vines in Baja California when he arrived at the Loreto mission in 1701. From the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th, most wine production was done by clergy. The Santo Tom√°s Mission, founded in Baja California by Jesuit priests in 1791, reactivated larger scale production of wine in Mexico. In 1843, Dominican priests began growing grapes at the nearby Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe del Norte mission, located in what is now called Valle de Guadalupe. This valley is one of the few in the world, along with others such as the Napa Valley and the Rhone Valley, in which premium wine grapes can be grown. In the 1850s, as part of Mexico‚Äôs Reform War, many of the Church‚Äôs land holdings were taken by the state. Most of the small wineries tended by missionaries were eventually abandoned. In 1888, the former lands of the Santo Tom√°s Mission were sold to a private group, which established the first large-scale commercial winery and the earliest winery in continuous operation, called Bodegas Santo Tom√°s. Initially, the wine made by the group was sweet and of low quality. Freixenet wine cellar in Quer√©taro During the period of Mexican history known as the Porfiriato (1880‚Äì1910), wine production in Mexico increased and spread to other regions of the country. In the Baja California area in 1904, Russian immigrants known as Molokans, a pacifist religious group fleeing service in the Tsar's army, purchased of land and began producing wine grapes. They encouraged others to do the same, helping the area acquire a reputation for making good wine. However, winemaking was set back by the Mexican Revolution as many lands were abandoned by their owners or destroyed by the rebels. Wine making in Mexico began to experience a comeback in the 1980s, with wine production peaking at four million cases a year in the latter part of the decade. However, the 1980s also opened Mexico‚Äôs small wine market to foreign competition, which hurt it. Baja California, which produces 90% of Mexico‚Äôs wine, only sells about 1.5 million cases a year today, but the quality of this wine is generally higher. Since the 1980s, wine production, especially in Baja California, has been steadily improving with better tending of vineyards and incorporating modern advancements in winemaking. Most wineries here are young, established only since the 1980s and 1990s, but some enthusiasts are calling the Valley of Guadalupe area the ‚Äúnext Napa Valley.‚Äù The wine industry is growing rapidly and the quality of the wine is improving. Mexican wine can be found in 38 countries in the world and many vintages have won international awards. Wine consumption in Mexico today Wine stand at a market for artisanal foods in the Parque Lincoln of Polanco, Mexico City. Despite Mexico‚Äôs Spanish heritage, it is not a major wine-drinking country; beer and tequila are far more popular than wine. Average wine consumption per capita is only two glasses a year. The Mexican government imposes taxes of 40% per bottle, making it hard to compete with beer and tequila. However, consumption of wine in Mexico is growing, with imports of wine in 2005 being nearly four times higher than ten years before. Most wine is consumed in major cities such as Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Puebla, and is also commonly found in the tourist areas, such as Canc√∫n and Cabo San Lucas. Most of the wine consumed in Mexico is imported from Europe, Chile, Australia and New Zealand, with about forty percent coming from domestic wineries. However, wine consumption continues to grow with one factor being increased interest in it by the middle classes, especially in Mexico City. As the reputation of Mexican wines increases, preference for native wines is also increasing in Mexico. At one time, no sophisticated restaurant in Mexico City would serve Mexican wine. Today, newer restaurants always include selections from Mexico on their wine lists. While wine drinking is not widespread in Mexico, the consumption of brandy, or distilled wine, is. Brandy is the most widespread distilled liquor in Mexico. It is even more popular than rum or tequila. Mexico is the fourth largest consumer of brandy in the world behind the Philippines, Germany and Equatorial Guinea. The last of Mexico's tariffs on imported brandy were lifted in the first decade of the 21st century, with sales and consumption expected to rise. Wine producing areas and vintages in Mexico Nearly are planted to grapes in Mexico. Principal white wine grapes include chenin blanc, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and viognier, and reds include all five Bordeaux varietals plus Grenache, tempranillo, dolcetto, syrah and petite sirah. States that produce table grapes (light purple) and wine (dark purple) There are three areas in Mexico where wine grapes are grown. The North area includes Baja California and Sonora; the La Laguna area is in Coahuila and Durango and the Center area consists of Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and Quer√©taro. Most of these areas have a fairly warm climate, which tend to make Mexican wines spicy, full-bodied and ripe; however, Northern Baja California's humid winters, dry warm summers and sea breezes allow for most of the same varietals produced in California. The La Laguna region is the oldest wine-making area of Mexico, and straddles the states of Coahuila and Durango, with grapes thriving in the Parras Valley. This valley is a microclimate in the desert area of these states at an altitude of 1,500 meters. The valley has warm days, cool nights and low humidity which inhibits insect and fungus damage to the vines. Mountain springs provide sufficient water in this arid part of Mexico. The temperature difference of between day and night is also beneficial to the grapes. The valley primarily produces reds based on Bordeaux such as cabernet sauvignon, Shiraz, merlot and Tempranillo. Some whites are produced as well. More than 400 families come to the Parras Valley in August and September for the annual grape harvest called ‚Äúla vendimia.‚Äù The most important winery here is Casa Madero, the oldest winery in the New World, founded in 1597 as Hacienda San Lorenzo. This label includes a range of varietals, with its chardonnay, chenin blanc and Syrah winning awards. Its brandies are considered among the best in Mexico. Another important winery here is Bodegas Ferrino, founded by a 19th- century Italian immigrant near the town of Cuatro Ci√©negas. Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California Another interesting winery is located in Tarahumara country at the edge of the Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, in a small valley named Cerocahui. In 1680, Father Juan Mar√≠a de Salvaterra arrived here to establish a mission. Later, Jesuits brought cuttings of French and Spanish vines. When the Jesuits were forced out of Mexico in the 18th century, the Cerocahui vineyards were destroyed except for a few cuttings secretly kept and grown by the Jos√© Mar√≠a S√°nchez family. These vines were cared for by the family until the late 20th century, when the last of the family died without heirs. The gardener for the family saved cuttings from the vines and with the Misi√≥n Hotel and planted them at what was the Girls Boarding School. Since then the town has had over 4,000 vines under cultivation and a winery has been established at the hotel. Bottle of L.A. Cetto Petite Sirah 2006. The Center region consists of areas in Quer√©taro, Zacatecas and Aguascalientes. Most vineyards are found at an altitude of , and most of the wine produced here is of the sparkling variety. However, other types such as Sauvignon blanc, St. Emilion, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir can be found as well. The best- known vintner here is the Mexican operation of Spain‚Äôs Freixenet winery. This label is known for dry sparkling wines called ‚Äúvinos espumosos‚Äù (sparkling wines), which come in satiny black bottles and based on Dom P√©rignon‚Äôs champagne fermentation methods. Some still red wines are also produced. Another major producer is Compan√≠a Vin√≠cola Los Eucaliptos in the town of Ezequiel Montes. A locally known label is Vinos Hidalgo La Madrile√±a in the San Juan del R√≠o region. Los Azteca Hacienda Mexicana dates back to the 18th century which recently became a winery. Another vintner called La Ronda specializes in growing grapes to make Kosher wine sold in certain markets in Mexico City. Most vineyards in Zacatecas are in the municipalities of Ojocaliente and Valle de la Macarena. This area has very cool winters and fairly cool summers, which combined with its moisture-holding clay soils is best for fast-maturing grapes with a high sugar content. A number of European red varieties such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot are grown here as well as American varieties such as zinfandel, Black Spanish and Lenoir. Some white grapes also do well here. Wineries here are smaller operations than in other parts of the country, with the best known local label being Casa Cachola just outside Valle de las Arcinas. Adobe Guadalupe wine cellar in Baja California The North zone produces ninety percent of Mexico‚Äôs wines today, with almost all of that coming from three regions not far from the port city of Ensenada: the San Antonio de las Minas zone, which includes the Valley of Guadalupe, the San Vicente Valley and the Santo Tom√°s Valley. This area is noted for its deep granite soils, warm sunny days, and nights cool due to breezes from the nearby Pacific Ocean. The area is ideal for both red and white wines, and one of the few locales in the world that can grow grapes for world-class wines. Grapes for Baja California wines are also grown in areas in neighboring Sonora state. The varieties of red wine produced in the Baja California region are Cabernet Sauvignon, Ruby Cabernet, Zinfandel, Grenache. and Mission. The white wines are Chenin Blanc, Palomino, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, S√©millon, Saint Emilion, and Malaga. There are three major wine producers in this area, Vinos L.A. Cetto in the Calafia Valley, Vinos Pedro Domecq and Bodegas de Santo Tom√°s in the Santo Tom√°s Valley. All have had wines that won international competitions including the Double Gold won by L.A. Cetto at the San Francisco International Wine Competition in May 2009. Many of these wines are now exported to Europe, the U.S. and Canada, and most wineries offer tours and wine tasting. Most of Mexico‚Äôs wine innovation occurs in the Ensenada area, in the form of the so-called ‚Äúboutique‚Äù producers such as Casa de Piedra, whose first vintage was produced in 1997. This operation only produces one white, called Piedra del Sol and a red called Vino de Piedra. Another small producer is Vi√±a de Liceaga, which produces reds. Don Miller owns a ranch and winery called Casa Adobe Guadalupe with a wine school here to help small producers make a profit and draw tourists. There is even one organic wine producer by the name of Do√±a Lupe. Enotourism and festivals in Mexico Vineyard in Valle de Guadalupe Enotourism in Mexico is centered on the Norte region, although wine festivals exist in the other wine-producing regions. The ‚ÄúRuta del Vino‚Äù (Wine Route) connects the wine producing areas of the municipality of Ensenada, such as the Valley of Guadalupe, the Valley of Llano Colorado, Valley of Santo Tom√°s and the Valley of San Vicente with the port city of Ensenada and the border cities of Tijuana and Tecate. The Route connects over fifty wineries, along with upscale restaurants, hotels, museums and other attractions of this part of Baja California state. The route is marked by ‚ÄúRuta del Vino‚Äù signs on the roads and highways to promote the area for enotourism, especially from the U.S. border. Bottles of Mount Xanic. Another major tourism draw is the Fiesta de la Vendimia (Vintage Festival), which takes place in Ensenada and the Valley of Guadalupe every year in August. The festivals include wine tasting and contests, winery tours, fishing tournaments, cook-offs, gourmet food and concerts. These events are sponsored and/or organized by the area‚Äôs wineries. Since the event occurs in the summer, afternoon temperatures can hover around . Some of the events include ‚ÄúNoche de Cofradia en Ensenada‚Äù, which features wine and food tasting from about thirty wineries and restaurants, matching local wines with local culinary specialties. The annual Malagon Family Celebration is held on a ranch, vineyard with winery and bed and breakfast. This event includes a horse show, live music, food and wine. The Concurso Internacional Ensenada Tierra del Vino wine competition is also held in the city. Perhaps the most unusual event is at Bibayoff Winery with Russian music, dancers, food and wines. However the drug war, which mostly takes place in border cities like Tijuana, has hurt this tourism to the area significantly as many U.S. tourists do not want to pass the border towns to get to the relatively calm wine valleys of Baja California. LA Cetto winery in Guadalupe Valley The Parras Valley in Coahuila has held its Feria de la Uva y el Vino (Festival of Grapes and Wine) since 1945, centered on the town of Parras de la Fuente. The event showcases the area's wines as well as other local products such as handcrafts, candies, denim clothing and food. This event is generally held in June. In the Center area, Tequisquiapan, Quer√©taro sponsors an annual cheese and wine festival called the Feria Nacional del Queso y de Vino in the month of June. This event draws local, national and international participants to compete for prizes and provide samples to visitors. This part of Quer√©taro is not only in wine country, but very near the center of where most Mexican cheeses were developed. Wines featured at this event are sparkling wines, but chardonnays, sauvignon blanc, merlots, pinot noirs and cabernets are also available for tasting. Wines from other parts of Mexico and the world also appear here. A more local celebration in the same area is Quer√©taro's version of the Vendimia first harvest festival which occurs at various wineries in the state in July. The most notable events occur at the Vi√±edos La Redonda Winery near Tequisquiapan with music, wine tasting and competitions, gourmet food and a handcrafts exposition. Winefests in other parts of the country include the Cabo San Lucas Wine and Food Fest and the Guadalajara Winefest in November, as well as the GastroVino wine and food fest in Todos Santos, BCS in April..

Some of his best-known songs with Moby Grape are \\"Mr. Blues\\", \\"Come In The Morning\\", and \\"Lazy Me\\" from the first Moby Grape album (1967),Review of Listen My Friends! The Best of Moby Grape History Bob Mosley spent his adolescence in San Diego, where he graduated from Kearny High School. One of the first bands that he organized in San Diego was called The Misfits, who had one single on Imperial Records (Imperial61054) and one on Troy Records (Troy222) in the early 1960s. After playing with the Joel Scott Hill Trio, he relocated to San Francisco where he played with The Vejtables for a brief period. Mosley has had a varied musical career, including a prominent but interrupted role in Moby Grape during the 1967-1971 period, and the commencement of a solo career in 1972. The following year he formed the Darrow Mosley Band with Chris Darrow (formerly of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Kaleidoscope) and issued one album, \\"Desert Rain.\\" In 1977 Mosley played with Neil Young in a band called The Ducks, with Jeff Blackburn (guitar/voc) and John Craviotto (drums/voc), which had a brief life during that year. Mosley's career has been plagued by the challenges of schizophrenia, as was the case with Moby Grape bandmate Skip Spence. Both musicians were homeless for several years. Mosley's schizophrenia was first diagnosed after he left Moby Grape in 1969, following the release of Moby Grape '69. Mosley shocked the remaining band members by leaving the band to join the Marines. It was during basic training with the Marines that Mosley was first diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. He was discharged from the Marines nine months after basic training. In 1996, three of Mosley's fellow band members, Jerry Miller, Peter Lewis and Don Stevenson, in part reformed Moby Grape with the objective of helping Mosley recover emotionally and financially. Bob Mosley describes the circumstances as follows: \\"In 1996, Peter Lewis picked me up along the side of a San Diego freeway where I was living, to tell me a ruling by San Francisco Judge Garcia gave Moby Grape their name back. I was ready to go to work again\\" in relation to the circumstances ultimately leading to the recording of True Blue. Earlier attempts by Moby Grape band members to help Mosley out of homelessness had been less successful. One such attempt is described by Peter Lewis as follows: \\"We went to find Bob, and there he was, living in this cardboard box. He had these friends, the squirrels and the lizards that he had. And I brought this guitar, cost me a hundred bucks, you know, and I left that with him and a tape of Moby Grape songs and a tape recorder with batteries in it and some extra batteries. So the next weekend, I came back, and there was no guitar, but the cassette case... He had tried to tear all the tape out of it and had left it, you know, down there in the bushes. And that's all that was left. Bob was gone, you know,\\" as per article by Paul Conley. The reformation was troubled for some time as Mosley believed Stevenson was trying to kill him. Stevenson eventually left the band. Mosley's bass preference is a Fender Precision bass. Unlike bandmate Skip Spence, whose musical output largely ceased within a few years of the onset of schizophrenia, Bob Mosley has been able to continue to write songs and record music for much of his life.

Description The Paatsjoki River flows from Lake Inari in Finland and for most of its duration, it marks the border between Russia and Norway. On the river there are several Norwegian and Russian hydroelectric stations. The operations of the stations is governed by several international agreements (Agreement between the Soviet Union and Norway on 18 December 1957 about the usage of hydroelectric installations on the Paatsjoki River, Agreement from 29.04.59 about regulating the control of Lake Inari concerning hydroelectric installations and the Kaitakoski Dam between the Soviet Union, Finland, and Norway.) About 85% of the electricity produced by the series of Russian hydroelectric stations is exported abroad. The hydroelectric system operates automatically. The Russian hydroelectric installations belong to Territorial Generating Company ‚Ññ 1, based in Saint- Petersburg, Russia. Hydroelectric stations Kaitakoski (Russia), J√§niskoski (Russia), Rajakoski (Russia), Hevoskoski (Russia), Skogfoss (Norway), Melkefoss (Norway), Borisoglebskaya (Russia) form the series of hydroelectric installations on the river. In total, all the hydroelectric stations have a power of 275.9 Megawatts, and produce 1475 GWh per year . The list is in downstream order, from Lake Inari to the Barents Sea.  Kaitakoski hydroelectric station The Kaitakoski hydroelectric station () in Russia on the Paatsjoki River () began operation in 1959. The power station is owned and operated by TGC-1 power company. At the uppermost three stations, the river is entirely in Russia.  J√§niskoski hydroelectric station The J√§niskoski hydroelectric station () () was constructed from 1938 to 1942, at that time on Finnish territory. Because Finland ceded territory to the USSR after the Continuation War, the power station is now on Russian territory. The power station was created to provide electrical energy for nickel mining in Petsamo. The power station was destroyed during World War II in 1944. After the war, the power station was rebuilt by Finnish firm Imatran Voima (today Fortum) on a contract with the USSR, and reentered operation in 1950. The power station is owned and operated by TGC-1 power company.  Rajakoski hydroelectric station Beginning operation on 25 May 1956, the Rajakoski hydroelectric station () is a Russian hydroelectric station on the Paatsjoki River (). The station was built by Finnish firm Imatran Voima on a contract with the USSR. The power station is owned and operated by TGC-1 power company. It is located around from the border to Norway and from the border tripoint at Muotkavaara.  Hevoskoski hydroelectric station The Hevoskoski hydroelectric station (, ) on the Paatsjoki River (), was built between 1956 and 1970. The border goes in the river here, but the hydroelectric station is located on Russian territory. The power station is owned and operated by TGC-1 power company. Skogfoss hydroelectric station The Skogfoss hydroelectric station on the Paatsjoki River is a Norwegian hydroelectric station built in 1964. The border is in the river, but the station is on the Norwegian side (). Melkefoss hydroelectric station The Melkefoss hydroelectric station, built in 1978, is a Norwegian hydroelectric station on the Paatsjoki River. The border is in the river, but the station is on the Norwegian side (). Borisoglebsky hydroelectric station Built between 1960 and 1964, the Borisoglebsky hydroelectric station () on the Paatsjoki River is a Russian hydroelectric station () built under a water derivation system. The power station is owned and operated by TGC-1 power company. The border is in the river, but the station is on the Russian side. Named after the locality Borisoglebsky, Murmansk Oblast.

Inspired by her mentor, choreographer Martha Graham, Dudley helped bring her movement inspired by social ills to the American Dance Festival at Connecticut College in the 1950s. Biography Dudley was born in New York City on April 3, 1912. She was the daughter of Pendleton Dudley and Hermine Jahns, and attended the Walden School in New York City. While attending the Walden School, Dudley was inspired by artists, creative thinkers, and dancers to pursue her passion for dance. Following her graduation from the Walden School, Dudley went on to study dance with Hanya Holm, Louis Horst, and Martha Graham. In 1935, Dudley first met Martha Graham at the Bennington Summer Course and performed in a piece titled \\"Panorama\\" with the Martha Graham Company. It was not until 1936 that she performed as part of its main stage company. During her time with the dance company, Dudley was inspired by Graham's work rooted in political ideas and its fast movements. It was also during this time that she was inspired to write about her experiences during the Great Depression as a performer.  Dudley-Maslow-Bales trio  In 1942, Dudley and Sophie Maslow both students of Martha Graham formed a dance a trio with William Bales. The trio performed all over the United States including cities such as, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Washington D.C.\\"Dudley, Maslow, Bales Company Booklet\\", Linda Lear Center Connecticut College, Box 2 of American Dance Festival Papers Collections A piece titled Vagary was staged and performed in 1949 at The American Dance Festival. John Martin, of The New York Times said of Dudley's performance in 1949, \\"At any rate, she moves so beautifully and with such superhuman control that just to watch her is in itself a delight, let the intention be what it will.\\" The choreography of the trio was and is still seen as representative of the 1940s as it featured folk music and captured the American spirit of the era. Writer David Wood argues that Jane Dudley's \\"choreography was always a pleasure to perform, but more for the doing of the movement itself than its content or its form.\\" In 1954, the trio split up and Dudley continued to choreograph and shape American dance.  Solo career  Following the trios end, Dudley returned to Bennington College in the 1960s and by 1968, she had become the artistic director for Betsheva Dance Company. Two years later, in 1970, Dudley moved to London and continued performing as director of the London Contemporary Dance School. She married and later divorced filmmaker Leo Hurwitz with whom she had one son. Jane Dudley died in September 2001 at the age of 89 in London. NotesReferences * Chujoy, Anatole.

Legally designated as a part of County road ≈Ω1040, it runs between the Remetinec Roundabout and the Zagreb bypass, acting as an important thoroughfare both for commuters from southwestern suburbs of Luƒçko and Stupnik and for travellers coming to the city by A1 motorway. The avenue experiences high amounts of seasonal traffic in summer resulting in traffic jams sometimes spanning the whole length of the avenue. The daily traffic has also been rising in recent years due to former bedroom communities in Zagreb County from the 1990s becoming new outer suburbs in the 2000s. Novi Zagreb neighborhoods Blato, Botinec and Lani≈°te are located directly south of the avenue. The intersection with Lani≈°te Road was recently converted into an interchange.  Route description  Jadranska Avenue, the approach toward the Remetinec Roundabout The primary entrance to the six-lane Jadranska Avenue is through the Remetinec Roundabout. The three- to four-lane roundabout receives traffic from the grade-separated Adriatic Bridge accessway in the north, the Dubrovnik Avenue from the east, and the Remetinec Road in the south. Jadranska Avenue is also accessible from the nearby neighbourhood of Kajzerica through a westbound one-way ramp, located near the local Spar supermarket and McDonald's restaurant, which in turn are accessible from the nearby surface streets to the north which can be accessed by the means of RIRO interchanges on the bridge accessway. Jadranska Avenue continues by lightly curving in a southwest direction away from the center of Novi Zagreb. Noise barriers are installed alongside the avenue, on the south side between the Remetinec Roundabout and Lani≈°te Street interchange. Approximately from the eastern terminus, the avenue intersects the Lani≈°te Street at a diamond interchange. The four-lane street continues south to provide access to the neighborhood of Lani≈°te, the Remetineƒçki Gaj Street, and Arena Zagreb. The northern leg of this interchange has not been built , as the northward extension would have to cross the river Sava towards Jarun, so it functions more as a trumpet interchange. Bridge over the Sava-Odra floodwater canal After the interchange, the roadway widens to eight lanes. A gas station opened in February 2008 and owned by OMV Croatia is open 24 hours a day and offers a convenience store westbound from the Lani≈°te Street interchange. Directly west of the OMV gas station, there is an at-grade intersection that connects to a nearby roundabout in the south, which in turn connects the Jaru≈°ƒáica Street (providing access to Remetinec as well as western parts of Lani≈°te) as well as another street that leads to an intersection of the Remetinec Road (extended in 2008), the Karlovac Road, and the Brezovica Road, connecting the suburbs of Remetinec, Blato, and Botinec, respectively. The aforementioned Jadranska Avenue intersection also has a northern outlet, marked Local Route L10054, that leads north towards the University Hospital (currently inoperative) and the Zagreb Golf & Country Club. This intersection is the only at-grade intersection of Jadranska Avenue. The avenue continues along a straight line trailing the northern border of Blato for another before bridging the Sava-Odra floodwater canal by the means of a long viaduct. After the bridge, the road enters a collector/distributor road setup, which accompanies it through the last few interchanges. Two RIROs provide entry and exit to the Karlovac Road in Blato, Luƒçko, Hrvatski Leskovac and the Brezovica city district. Immediately thereafter, the Luƒçko stack interchange with the Zagreb bypass is located. Noise barriers are also planned to be installed at the Luƒçko interchange.  History  Jadranska Avenue was conceived as an expressway approach for the Zagreb-Karlovac highway (today part of A1), the first highway in Croatia. Together with the Karlovac expressway, its construction cost 110 million Yugoslav dinars. It was built in 1972 as an extension of Dubrovnik Avenue (then called Boris Kidriƒç Avenue after the eponymous Yugoslav political figure) and it spanned from the Dubrovnik Avenue and Adriatic Bridge intersection to the old Luƒçko Interchange, without any exits. The avenue was wide and had three traffic lanes in each direction, similar to the A1 lane setup, which also features a 28-meter pavement with three lanes in each direction, but one of them is marked as a hard shoulder. At the time, the Zagreb bypass was in planning stages and the Luƒçko Interchange only provided access to Luƒçko and the old Karlovac Road through two RIROs (still used today) and the large stack interchange was built and opened for traffic as late as 1979. Like most Croatian highways, the expressway was planned with a design speed of in mind.

It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill to the town of Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice. Interest in restoring the canal began in 1972, and navigation was restored to the first with the re-opening of Lower Kyme lock in 1986. The Sleaford Navigation Trust has been working towards restoring the whole waterway, and succeeded in purchasing the Sleaford end of the river bed in 2004. A short section at Sleaford was opened in 2010, following the installation of a lift bridge. Nearby, Navigation House, which served as the clerk's office, has been restored as a visitor centre about the canal, and the adjacent seed warehouse has been turned into The National Centre for Craft & Design. History The River Slea rises to the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of illegally collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent. With influential local landowners such as Sir Jenison Gordon of Haverholme Priory and Sir Christopher Whitchcote of Aswarby wanting to improve communications to the area, a proposal to link Sleaford by canal to Grantham was considered in 1774, but was replaced by a scheme to provide a navigable link along the Slea and the Kyme Eau to the Witham in 1783. Following a public meeting in Sleaford on 16 January, a committee was formed to promote the scheme, and in order for it to be profitable, negotiations began with the Commissioners of the River Witham, to reduce the tolls on that river for traffic to and from the Slea. Although initially rebuffed, the committee persisted, and the Commissioners eventually agreed to terms. At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as the channel was inadequate, and there were fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three attempts were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost ¬£9,979. The plans obtained the support of Sir Joseph Banks, a baronet who was a patron of the natural sciences, and had been the President of the Royal Society since 1778. The fourth attempt to obtain an act of Parliament was successful, probably due to his influence. The Act was passed on 11 June 1792, creating The Company of Proprietors of the Sleaford Navigation, which was empowered to make and maintain a Navigation from Sleaford Castle Causeway, through the town of Sleaford, along the course of Sleaford Mill Stream and Kyme Eau, to the River Witham, at or near Chappel Hill. It had authority to raise ¬£13,000 in capital for the project, with an additional ¬£6,500 if necessary. Most of the money was raised within Lincolnshire, with half of the shares being bought by people living in Sleaford. Six proprietors were elected to serve on a committee, which expressed its thanks to Joseph Banks at its first meeting. By the end of 1793, ¬£16,000 had been raised to fund construction. The Horncastle Canal was being constructed at the same time, and the two companies negotiated to find an engineer who would oversee both projects. They approached Henry Eastburn, but he did not accept, and so William Cawley from Mickle Trafford in Cheshire was appointed. Five locks were required to negotiate the mills, and there were additional locks at Lower Kyme and near Flax Dyke, in the parish of Ewerley. They were built as broad locks, , and the total fall from Sleaford was . Six contracts with a total value of ¬£4,000, for the construction of locks and bridges, were awarded to John Dyson Sr., who worked with Peter Tyler and John Langwith. Defects were reported with the lock at Haverholme in 1794, and when the opening of the canal was announced, Dyson produced advertisements which stated that the canal would not open unless he was paid for the work he had carried out. The company responded that the only place to sort out such disagreements was in a law court, and the opening went ahead on 6 May 1794. The enabling act specified that the terminus would be at Castle Causeway, from where it would follow the southern mill stream to pass through the south bridge, and then along the Sleaford millstream through Old Sleaford and New Sleaford. Financial difficulties meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, and instead the company built a wharf to the east of what is now Carre Street in Sleaford. =Operation= The road bridge just below Haverholme Lock Trade on the navigation was adequate, but the company was hampered by the overrun in the cost of construction. Dividends were paid to shareholders in 1795, 1817, 1818 and 1824, but profits had improved by 1826, and regular dividends were then paid. Between 1836 and 1856, they ranged from five per cent to eight per cent. Rather than the proprietors collecting the tolls, they were let to toll collectors. In 1816, John Keyworth paid ¬£1,010 for the privilege, while by 1839, Joshua Bower had to pay ¬£1,590. This practice ceased in 1851, as receipts fell. While the navigation prospered, there were plans to extend it. The first plan was for an extension to the west to Wilsford, suggested on 1827. Six years later J. Rofe and his son revived the idea, first proposed in 1774, for a link from Sleaford to Grantham. In the same year, a Sleaford trader attempted to get the navigation extended to its authorised terminus at Castle Causeway, but the company stated that at the time of construction, only ¬£700 had been left for the final to the causeway, and as that would not have been enough, they had provided a suitable wharf at the present terminus. While none of these extensions were pursued, plans for the installation of a weighing machine on the wharf in 1837 escalated, and resulted in a residence for the clerk of the canal and a weighing office being built. A crane was installed in 1841, but success was soon threatened by the coming of the railways. =Decline= A railway from Grantham to Sleaford opened in 1857. This was extended to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from ¬£981 in 1858 to ¬£168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from ¬£40 to ¬£10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also the date of the final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so. Although officially closed, both Finch Hatton and the Witham Commissioners chose to retain the locks, and the lower of the navigation from Ewerby Waithe Common to the River Witham remained navigable until the 1940s. Lower Kyme lock was then replaced by a sluice, which prevented navigation until a lock was reinstated in 1986. Restoration The flood gates at the entrance to the Navigation, designed to close as levels in the River Witham rise In 1972, Ronald Russell produced the book Lost Canals of England and Wales, in which he had compiled details of 78 canals then considered to be derelict. This acted as a catalyst for several restoration schemes, including one for the Sleaford Navigation. This plan initially centred on the canal head in Sleaford, and promoted by the Sleaford Civic Society. On 4 November 1977, the Sleaford Navigation Society was formed, with the wider aim of restoring navigation to the whole canal, and publishing research into other Lincolnshire navigations. The society managed to gain the support of the Anglian Water Authority for their plans in 1980, which resulted in the restoration of the Kyme Eau lock, re-opened in November 1986. With the raising of a low footbridge and the construction of a winding hole at South Kyme, the first of the waterway were returned to navigation. In 1991, work commenced on Cobblers lock, and was completed by 1994, although it has not been fitted with gates as the banks of the section above it need strengthening before the water levels can be raised. Funded by a Derelict Land Grant, the engineering consultants Binnies carried out a feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative structure for the project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures of the canal, campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding for the restoration of the warehouse and the former offices of the canal company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal. The former seed warehouse now forms part of The Hub, housing the National Centre for Craft and Design, which is supported by the Arts Council and is one of the leading centres for the promotion and exhibition of international craft and design in the UK. In 2004, the Navigation Trust was able to buy the bed of the river between Carre Street in Sleaford and Bone Mill, which included the lock and its island at Cogglesford Mill. Lower Kyme lock was refurbished in the winter of 2008. The upper gate is a vertical guillotine gate, and the mechanism required 350 turns of a handle to raise the gate, and another 350 to lower it again. New lock gates were fitted, and a new geared mechanism requiring fewer turns made the lock easier to operate. Around of the waterway from Sleaford to Cogglesford Mill lock were reopened, following the construction of a lifting bridge in the town centre. This was installed in late December 2008, although the hydraulic operating gear was not fitted until January 2010. Work was also carried out to construct a new slipway on Eastgate Green, to allow trailed boats to be launched onto the town section. This involved careful planning to avoid damage to 27 mature trees, and the widening of of the bank to create a mooring point. Funding was provided by Lincolnshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, and Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd (WREN), which administers the Landfill Communities Fund. An official opening of the new bridge and facilities took place on 3 July 2010, when three boats were launched from the slipway. Members from canoe clubs at Boston and Sleaford attended. Course Remains of the Lock chamber at Cogglesford Mill. The upstream gate has been replaced with a sluice to maintain the head for the mill, which is still in use. The upper terminus of the canal was at Navigation Yard, near Sleaford town centre. Navigation House, the former residence of the clerk, is now a Grade II listed building, and has been refurbished. It houses an interpretation centre where visitors can learn of the history of the canal. The River Slea between Navigation Yard and Bone Mill lock is owned by the Canal Trust. A short distance below the terminus, a new steel lift bridge crosses the canal, after which a stream leaves the east bank. This is the old course of the river, which rejoins the canal below Cobblers lock. The first lock is from Sleaford, and allowed boats to pass Coggesford Mill, an 18th- century watermill which has been restored, and is still used to grind flour. It is managed by North Kesteven District Council. The railway line from Lincoln to Spalding crosses next, after which Dyers Mill or Bone Mill lock is reached, from Sleaford and overshadowed by the A17 Sleaford bypass bridge. Corn Mill lock is situated from Sleaford, and the buildings of Holdingham Mill are Grade II listed. They include a small hexagonal toll house, which was used by the lock keeper. Next is Paper Mill lock, after which the canal follows a more easterly direction, to reach Haverholme lock after . Nearby was Haverholme Priory, founded by Gilbertine priors in 1139. The Grade II listed ruins are of a much later date, being part of a Tudor style country house built in 1835 by H. E. Kendall. The bridge over the canal, built in 1893, is also Grade II listed. At , Cobblers lock is reached, which has been the limit of navigation since 1986. Just beyond it, there is a pumping station on the south bank and the canal make a right-angle bend, to skirt Ewerby Waithe Common, after which there is another right angle bend by Ferry Farm, where Ferry Bridge now carries Ferry Lane over the canal. After a short distance, there is a bend called Heckington Tunnel, where a section of the Car Dyke, a Roman waterway which ran for , heads off in a southerly direction, with the Midfodder Drain running parallel to it. Somewhere here, the name of the river changes from the Slea to the Kyme Eau. The village of South Kyme follows, with its four-storey fortified tower, built in the 14th century for Sir Gilbert d'Umframville. It is high, and was surrounded by a moat. Two road bridges and a footbridge cross the navigation in the village. Damford Grounds, a low-lying area of fenland, lies to the north of the village, and Damford Drain, the main drainage ditch, is pumped into the river by a pumping station on the west bank. After passing Terry Booth Farm on the east bank, the 18th century buildings of which are Grade II listed, and a farm with the same name on the west bank, Lower Kyme lock is reached, from Sleaford. The Twenty Foot Drain and its pumping station join the river as it makes another sharp turn to the east, to reach a set of flood doors and Chapel Hill bridge, beyond which is the River Witham, flowing south-east to Boston.

They are all characters who have appeared either in the Librarian television films, or the Librarians series. Recurring charactersFlynn Carsen (Noah Wyle)= A nerdish bookworm, Flynn is brilliant beyond compare. By the time he was 31 years old, he had earned 22 academic degrees‚Äî12 Bachelor‚Äôs degrees, 6 Master‚Äôs degrees, and 4 doctorates‚Äîincluding four degrees in Egyptology, a doctorate in Comparative Religions, and a Ph.D. in Cryptology. In the beginning of The Quest for the Spear, his Egyptology professor signs off on his 23rd degree. (The precise degree is not known, but it must be either a master‚Äôs degree or a Ph.D, because he already possesses a B.A., a B.S. or both in the relevant field.) Practically addicted to learning, Flynn would have continued being a perpetual student had Professor Harris not awarded him the degree mid-term, making it impossible for him to sign up for another course for six months. Observing that Flynn did not know the names of any of his fellow students, the professor insisted that he get some real-world experience. Upon receiving a magical invitation, Flynn (asking how did they do that?) applied for a job as a librarian in the New York Metropolitan Library. He was successful in his job interview and was recruited into an ancient clandestine order of Librarians who have protected a range of historical and often magical items (such as the Ark of the Covenant) for centuries. Flynn is a polymath, highly intelligent and resourceful. He often gives voice to his speed-of-light thinking, which can be confusing‚Äîand annoying‚Äîto bystanders. A natural gift and years of study have made his powers of observation and deductive skills comparable to those of Sherlock Holmes. His ordinary skills (which did not qualify him for the job) include knowledge of the Dewey decimal system, the Library of Congress, research paper orthodoxy, web searching, and the ability to set up an RSS feed. En route to his first mission, Flynn managed to decode the previously untranslated Language of the Birds in just over seven hours, a feat that no other Librarian (save the one who created the book) had been able to accomplish. Flynn rapidly evolves into a brave hero, not easily overwhelmed by the supernatural. When Flynn was still quite young, his father was shot by an unknown assailant. It took many years for Flynn to identify the murderer and discover the reasons behind it. He took clarinet lessons when he was young, and when he was nine years old he attended a book signing of Stephen Hawking where he began to argue with Hawking about the correctness of the central thesis of the book. His geeky bookishness is coupled with a razor-sharp wit that unfortunately has a habit of manifesting itself at the worst times. Flynn really hates being corrected. He is a bit awkward meeting women, and his mother is constantly trying to set him up on dates. Over his first 10 years as Librarian, he is too busy globe-trotting and fighting evil to maintain a relationship, and after the deaths of two great loves he stays clear of emotional entanglements until he meets Colonel Eve Baird in the first episode of the TV series. By the end of the third and last movie, he has fully embraced his destiny as the Librarian. During The Librarians series he is forced to step back from his usual duties when Charlene and Judson displace the Library in time and space in a desperate effort to protect it from evil forces (\\"And the Crown of King Arthur\\") Through its Annex, the Library prompts Flynn to track down three people‚ÄîEzekiel Jones, Cassandra Cillian and Jacob Stone‚Äîwhom the Library invited to apply at the same time it recruited Flynn, 10 years before. None of them applied. Once found‚Äîand convinced of their callings‚Äîthey form a team of Librarians and assume Flynn‚Äôs usual responsibilities of retrieving and protecting supernatural artifacts and guarding the Library and humanity from evil, while he dedicates himself to finding the Library and learning how to bring it back. Flynn returns when the situation requires his expertise‚Äîor when he needs them. There is a running joke throughout the series: No matter what the situation, when Flynn announces or introduces himself with the words ‚Äú I am The Librarian.‚Äù he is accepted as a person with a right to be there, no matter how inappropriate the context. Cassandra, Ezekial and Jacob try this repeatedly, but it does not always work for them. In the last episode of The Librarians, it saves the world. =Charlene (Jane Curtin)= The humorless, no-nonsense library administrator who interviews Flynn for the job of 'The Librarian'. Flynn was granted the position after he was able to tell Charlene very specific things about her only a few minutes after their first meeting, based solely on his keen observation (among them, having mononucleosis, being divorced two months before, owning three cats, and breaking her nose as a child) and after answering a single question from an unseen Judson, ‚ÄúWhat's more important than knowledge?‚Äù with his mother‚Äôs wise words: ‚ÄúThe things that make life worth living can not be thought here (pointing to his head), they must be felt here (hand over heart).‚Äù In her role as administrator, Charlene is a consummate bureaucrat, threatening to dock Flynn's pay should he break something and insisting that he keep his receipts if he wishes to get refunds for the expenses of his adventures. She keeps a straight face when Flynn makes jokes. In her words, she does not \\"do funny.\\" Dean Devlin speculated that Charlene had in her youth served as the Guardian to a Librarian, as Nicole did. This was officially made part of her history in the episode \\"... and the Fangs of Death.\\" In the TV series' first episode, \\"And the Crown of King Arthur\\", after Dulaque's attack on the Library, Judson and Charlene cast a spell to sever the Library from this plane in order to protect it. In the season three episode \\"And the Fangs of Death\\", Charlene has retired to a remote Incan temple and wants nothing to do with the Library. Carsen seeks her out, and she agrees to return to help defeat Apep, but the next day her servants are dead and she's missing. Carsen finally finds her in Shangri-La in the episode \\"And the Fatal Separation\\". He discovers that she's been hiding among Sterling Lam's collection of supernatural beings and artifacts. Fearing that Apep could use her to access the Library, she's planning on sacrificing herself, severing her connection to it by giving up her immortality. Finally, Jenkins sends her to another plane of existence, where she rejoins Judson. Among her last words is the injunction to keep receipts. In the next episode, she talks with Flynn through a mirror. (Note: Charlene's recent divorce is first mentioned in the movie \\"The Quest for the Spear\\", In the movie, \\"Curse of the Judas Chalice\\", Charlene reveals more about her divorce, saying her duty to the Library is what cost her her marriage, and calling her ex-husband \\"Gaston\\". This may well be a fake name for Galahad. It is revealed in the episode \\"And the Fatal Separation\\" that Galahad loved her and that she chose Judson. In the episode \\"And the Eternal Question\\", Jenkins (aka Galahad) tells Cassandra that his true love (whom we later find out is Charlene) chose another AFTER he \\"had already pledged his heart to her for all eternity\\", which is a strong indication that he and Charlene had married before she chose to remain eternally with Judson and the Library). =Judson (Bob Newhart)= Judson, as he is introduced in the first film, has previously served as 'The Librarian' and now acts as a mentor to those who take up the mantle. He has a tattoo from a time he served in the Marines and is very handy in a fight. He enjoys buying things on eBay and loves flying kites. He is able to use mirrors, Television screens and a technique resembling astral projection to communicate with the Librarian anywhere in the world, frequently at less-than-convenient times and places. He dies after the third film, five years before the first episode of the TV series. Flynn keeps his portrait, draped with crape, next to his desk. He tells Eve that Judson is still there in spirit; she is shocked to find this to be the simple truth when Judson appears in the full-length mirror that stands near his portrait. It is hinted in the film Curse of the Judas Chalice that Judson may be the original founder of the Library, although he finds the suggestion that he might be more than 2000 years old \\"insulting\\". In season four of the series, however, it is confirmed that he is the original Librarian, that Charlene was his Guardian, and they performed the Tethering ritual that is one of the story arcs in that season. When the Serpent Brotherhood invades the Library, Judson and Charlene conduct a ritual that severs the Library from our plane of existence and sends it into the void. Towards the end of season three, Charlene goes to join him wherever he has gone after dying. =Margie Carsen (Olympia Dukakis)= Flynn‚Äôs mother, Margie, is constantly worried about her son and encourages him to get a job, find a bride, and be happy. She plays MahJong, likes to give surprise birthday parties and enjoys singing karaoke. She was delighted to meet Nicole at the end of the first film. It is revealed in the series premiere of \\"The Librarians\\" that she has died and that Judson helped Flynn through his mourning. Introduced in Quest for the SpearEdward Wilde (Kyle MacLachlan)= Edward Wilde was the 'Librarian' before Flynn, and he was considered to be very good. He worked with Nicole for two years during which time she fell in love with him. During an adventure in the Antarctic involving the Serpent Brotherhood, Wilde had to build an igloo to shelter himself and Nicole. He made it appear to Nicole that he had been killed by the Serpent Brotherhood, but in reality Edward staged his own death to ally himself with the Brotherhood in an effort to steal the Spear of Destiny and take control of the world. =Nicole Noone (Sonya Walger, played by Rachel Nichols in the TV series)= Nicole is an adventurer who works for the library as the Librarian's Guardian, and usually serves as the brawn to the Librarian's brains. She is the youngest of three siblings and the only girl. Her mother is English, and her father is South American (Argentine), but she never bothered to learn Spanish. She never had any pets, and her favorite stone is jade.The Librarian: Quest for the Spear She is fearless, loves adventure, and is an excellent fighter. She developed feelings for the previous Librarian, Edward Wilde, and felt an overwhelming sense of guilt when he was apparently killed. Judson told Flynn to \\"trust no one\\", a pun of Nicole's surname Noone. In The Librarians it is revealed that Nicole got trapped five hundred years in the past while going after H.G. Wells' Time Machine with Flynn. She becomes angry and bitter that Flynn never returned from her. Now immortal, Nicole acts as the primary antagonist of the fourth season, causing the death of Jenkins, the dissolution of the Library and a rift between the Librarians. After the Library is restored, Flynn uses an artifact to go back in time to the moment that Nicole first became immortal in order to right his wrong of never going back for her. Flynn convinces Nicole that she needs to remain in the past and still have her adventures, but this time to have them for the Library instead of against it. Nicole agrees, stating that she realizes now she is the Guardian of the Library itself instead of Flynn and promises that she will see Flynn again in five hundred years. When Flynn returns to the future, he finds that time has been altered and all of the evil that Nicole caused has been undone. Only Flynn and Baird ever remember Nicole's evil actions. Introduced in Return to King Solomon's Mines\\"Uncle\\" Jerry (Robert Foxworth)= Jerry was a close friend of Flynn's father, whom he met in 1967, He knew both of Flynn's parents when they met and began courting. Jerry is wealthy and runs a global import-export business. In the course of an adventure to discover King Solomon's Mines, Flynn discovers that Jerry had always been jealous of Flynn's father. He wants to use the power of the Mines to turn back time so he can win the affections of Margie Carsen: He feels that she was stolen from him. It turns out Jerry was the unknown figure who shot Flynn's father, after Carsen refused to tell Jerry about the Mines. =Emily Davenport (Gabrielle Anwar)= Emily is an archaeologist who holds twenty-five degrees, three more than Flynn, and can argue convincingly about ancient history, Biblical texts, and geography. Emily teams up with Flynn to search for King Solomon's Mines, and may still be in Africa trying to prove that the Queen of Sheba actually ruled most, if not all, of Africa. Introduced in Curse of the Judas ChaliceProfessor Lazlo / Vlad (Bruce Davison)= An elderly, crippled man who is a brilliant professor at the University of Bucharest. Seemingly harmless, he is taken hostage by the villainous Kubichek, who wants Lazlo to lead him to the Judas Chalice. Later it is revealed that he is none other than Dracula/Vlad the Impaler himself. After drinking from a victim infected by Cholera hundreds of years ago, he became weakened, assuming an almost-human, crippled form. Since then, he has searched for the Judas Chalice, hoping to reawaken his evil powers. After drinking from the Judas Chalice, Dracula regains his powers and battles Flynn and Simone Renoir. Flynn is able to trick Dracula with the Judas Chalice and then impale him through the heart with a stake made from an aspen tree, the same kind of tree from which Judas Iscariot hung himself. Dracula dies, releasing the souls of all of his victims and burning to ash in the process. =Simone Renoir (Stana Katic)= A gorgeous young New Orleans jazz-club singer, who uses her hypnotic performances to charm an off-guard Flynn. Turned into a vampire some 400 years ago, Simone considers it her two-fold destiny to find the man who condemned her soul to walk the night forever and exact vengeance, and to help protect one of the clues leading to the Judas Chalice. She teams up with Flynn to outwit those hoping to find the Chalice and use it for their evil agendas. While protecting the Chalice, Simone recognizes Professor Lazlo as her sire. Lazlo turns out to be Dracula. He restores his powers with the Chalice, leading to a battle between Dracula, Flynn and Simone. Though Simone is defeated, Flynn kills Dracula using a stake made from an aspen tree. With Dracula, her sire, dead, Simone's soul is finally able to find peace. Simone rejects Flynn's offers to return to New York with him or to turn Flynn so that he can spend eternity with her. Instead, Simone chooses to watch the sunrise for the first time in centuries with Flynn, allowing herself to be killed by the sunlight so that she can finally rest in peace. =Sergei Kubichek (Dikran Tulaine)= A former KGB agent and Secretary of Defense for the Russian Federation, Kubichek longs to restore the order and power of the former Soviet Union. He is the mastermind of a risky plot to secure the Judas Chalice, resurrect Vlad Dracula, and use him to create an army of invincible vampire soldiers. Unfortunately, the plan backfires when Professor Lazlo reveals himself to be Count Dracula and he is vampirized as a result. Nonetheless, he retains his goal to revitalize the Soviet Union. He is later killed by a grenade at the hands of Ivan, who is killed in the process. Introduced in The LibrariansEve Baird (Rebecca Romijn)= A counter-terrorism agent who is selected by the Library as the first Guardian in 10 years. She is generally given her rank and called \\"Colonel Baird\\". The source of her first name is revealed in \\"And Santa's Midnight Run\\": She was born at midnight on Christmas Eve. =Jacob Stone (Christian Kane)= An Oklahoma oil-rigger and genius with an IQ of 190. An autodidact, he has extensive knowledge of ancient and modern history, world cultures, art and architecture (including the relevant sciences). He speaks 9 languages and can read more than a dozen more. He taught himself to read Greek at night, presumably as a child. He has honorary degrees at universities on four continents. He is ‚Äúthe first one they call when they discover a new piece of art and the one they‚Äôre afraid to call because I‚Äôm the best in the world at discovering a fake.‚Äù For 20 years he has written scholarly works using pseudonyms representing 7 carefully constructed identities, including Dr. Oliver Thompson, James McKelvie, and Griffin Griffould. He was invited to interview for the position of the Librarian 10 years ago (when Flynn was successful), but did not respond to the invitation because he felt obligated to help keep his family's oil-drilling business afloat. He was a \\"Librarian- in-training\\", working alongside Ezekiel Jones and Cassandra Cillian, until being promoted at the end of \\"And the Loom of Fate\\". He is currently banned from the Vatican Museum for attempting to rearrange the art there while under the influence of the Apple of Discord. In ‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath the Stones‚Äù he encounters his father, Isaac Stone, sole proprietor of Stone Family Rigging and Pipeline. Isaac has run the business into the ground, partly because of his alcoholism and gambling. Isaac is sexist, shows contempt for Native American culture and cuts corners in dangerous ways. He constantly belittles Jake, who didn‚Äôt tell his father the truth about himself because he knew that Isaac would see anything less than chasing the family business as a betrayal. The lies Isaac told to get this drilling project going unleashed Okonote, a deadly shapeshifter: ‚ÄúSo many lies from one man,‚Äù the creature says. Jacob reveals himself to his father, who says ‚Äú You're my son and I love you,‚Äù and hugs him. Jacob instantly recognizes the shapeshifter, saying that his father would die before he ever told him that. He leaves without confronting his real father, but back at the Library, he changes the byline on the article he is writing to his real name.. =Cassandra Cillian (Lindy Booth)= A mathematician and scientist with synesthesia - the special gift of auditory and sensory hallucinations linked to memory retrieval. She also has a touch of magic, Cassandra is a rare case with which all five of her senses can be connected to her memories at any given time. Her synesthesia is originally supposed to be caused by a brain tumor, described as being the size of a grape. It is lethal, but it is under control at the beginning of the series. She was invited to interview for the position of Librarian 10 years ago (when Flynn was successful), but was in the hospital at that time. She was a \\"Librarian-in-training\\", working alongside Ezekiel Jones and Jacob Stone, from the end of the pilot until being promoted at the end of \\"And the Loom of Fate\\". In ‚ÄúAnd the Cost of Education‚Äù she is intrigued by college life because she was too sick to attend. In that episode, she is pulled into another world where she is invited to join the Lake, a secret organization of women who realized long ago that magic and science would become one. She has seen their forum on line. They offer her the chance to learn, study and grow with them, but she declines to join them because of her loyalty to her work as a Librarian. Jenkins tells her to be on her guard: In the age-old debate about what to do about magic, the Lake has always been ‚Äúambitious.‚Äù Cassandra reveals to Ezekiel and Jacob in ‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath the Stones‚Äù that, knowing the tumor will eventually kill her, she has chosen a specific day to die. In the episode \\"And the Eternal Question\\" she is forced to have the tumor removed and as a result her mathematical abilities are greatly enhanced, and she gains the power to communicate telepathically. =Ezekiel Jones (John Kim)= A world-class thief who supposedly looks out for no-one but himself. He is also a \\"master of technologies.‚Äù He was invited to attend the interview process to become the 'Librarian' 10 years ago (when Flynn was successful), but he is a loner and decided not to attend the interview because he believed he received the letter by mistake. He was a \\"Librarian-in-training\\", working alongside Cassandra Cillian and Jacob Stone, from the end of the pilot until being promoted at the end of \\"And the Loom of Fate\\". Ezekiel and his sisters were raised by their adoptive mother to be thieves. She doesn't take him seriously until ‚ÄúAnd the Christmas Thief,‚Äù when the Saint of Thieves compliments Ezekiel on his exploits. She then demands to know where her cut is. He explains that he has used his ill-gotten gains to support charities and help people in need; that is why the Library invited him. In the season two episode \\"And What Lies Beneath the Stones,\\" Jones confesses that after his first big score he was recruited by MI6 to use his skills as a thief on behalf of the British government; he is embarrassed about this. =Jenkins / Galahad (John Larroquette)= The new quartet's reluctant, sometimes cantankerous caretaker; he has worked at The Library's branch office, known as 'The Annex', \\"for longer than anyone knows,\\" and has extensive knowledge of ancient lore. He is seen to have a connection to Dulaque, as revealed in \\"And the Apple of Discord\\". It is later explained that they are both immortal because of a spell Dulaque cast 1,000 years earlier after the fall of Camelot. He was known during King Arthur's reign as Sir Galahad, as revealed in \\"And the Loom of Fate\\". He has known Morgan le Fay (Alicia Witt) for centuries and considers her to be his archenemy, as he blames her for Arthur's death. In ‚ÄúSome Dude Named Jeff,‚Äù he confirms that he is the illegitimate son of Lancelot du Lac. In \\"And The Graves of Time\\", he gives up his immortality to bring Nicole Noone back to life after she's killed by a revengeful Rasputin. He's at first unprepared to handle the many shortcomings of being an older human, (poor eyesight and hearing, the need to eat) but soon comes to accept that this is his life now for however long that may be. His immortality is returned in \\"And the Echoes of Memory\\" when Flynn persuades Nicole to work for the Library instead of against it and thereby changes history. =Dulaque / Lancelot du Lac (Lancelot of the Lake) (Matt Frewer)= The mysterious immortal leader of the Serpent Brotherhood. In the episode \\"...And the Apple of Discord\\" it is heavily implied that he is either Sir Lancelot du Lac or Sir Hector de Maris when one of the members of the Conclave calls him \\"The son of Ban\\". Dulaque was established as Sir Lancelot in the episode \\"And the Loom of Fate\\". =Lamia (Lesley-Ann Brandt)= Dulaque's second-in-command in the Serpent Brotherhood. Believes that bringing magic back and achieving power will allow them to make the world a better place. She is a skilled martial artist and sword fighter. Dulaque kills her in \\"And the Loom of Fate\\".

The correct title for the railways in Prussia was at first the Royal Prussian State Railways (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Staatseisenbahnen). In 1896 it became the Prussian-Hessian State Railways (Preu√üisch-Hessische Staatseisenbahnen) and after the First World War, the Prussian State Railway (Preu√üische Staatsbahn). The individual divisions or \\"royal railway divisions\\" (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahndirektionen) were abbreviated to KED and later ED.

It was last assigned to the 44th Operations Group, stationed at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. The 66 MS was equipped with the LGM-30F Minuteman II Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with a mission of nuclear deterrence. With the end of the Cold War, the 66th was inactivated on 1 September 1993. HistoryWorld War II= Established in early 1941 as a B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment squadron; trained under Third Air Force in the southeastern United States. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, engaged in Antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), being assigned to VIII Bomber Command in England during the summer of 1942. One of the first B-24 Liberator units assigned to the ETO. Engaged in very long range strategic bombardment missions over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany, attacking strategic targets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Among the targets attacked were submarine installations, industrial establishments, airfields, harbors, shipyards, and other objectives. Detachment deployed to Twelfth Air Force in Algeria in June 1943 to help facilitate the Allied invasion of Sicily by bombing airfields and marshalling yards in Italy. The detachment also participated in the famous low-level raid on the Ploie»ôti oil fields in Romania on 1 August 1943. Most of the detachment returned to England at the end of August, however some crews and aircraft remained in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) and flew very long range attacks over Italy, Romania, Austria, and Sicily and supported Allied ground forces in Sicily as well as attacking Axis forces in Italy supporting the Salerno Invasion of Italy. All aircraft and personnel returned to England in October. Returned to VIII Bomber Command operations, and supported the Allied Invasion of France in June 1944 by attacking strong points in the beachhead area and transportation targets behind the front lines. The group aided the Caen offensive and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. Dropped food, ammunition, and other supplies to troops engaged in the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. Attacked enemy targets during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945, by striking bridges, tunnels, choke points, rail and road junctions, and communications in the battle area. The squadron attacked airfields and transportation in support of the Western Allied Invasion of Germany, and flew a resupply mission during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. Combat operations concluded with the German Capitulation in May 1945. Returned to the United States in June 1945, being reassigned to Second Air Force and redesignated as a B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bombardment squadron. Trained with B-29s and planned to deploy to the Western Pacific, however the Japanese Capitulation in August canceled deployment plans. Assigned to Kansas as part of Continental Air Forces (later Strategic Air Command) but inactivated in July 1946 as part of the general demobilization of the AAF. =Strategic Air Command= Reactivated in 1947 under SAC as a paper unit; not manned or equipped and inactivated in 1949 due to budget constraints. Reactivated in 1950 and used as an Operational Training Unit for B-29 aircrews and maintenance personnel being deployed to for Far East Air Forces during the Korean War. Replaced the propeller-driven B-29s with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1953, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in late 1959, being phased down for inactivation in 1960. =Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Squadron= Reactivated in 1962 as a SAC ICBM missile squadron. Trained with the 850th SMS in HGM-25A Titan I operations in 1962, being made operational with LGM-30B Minuteman I missiles in 1963. Upgraded to the LGM-30F Minuteman II in 1972. Remained on Cold War nuclear alert until in response to President Bush's directive to stand down the Minuteman II. Dissipated launch codes and pin safety control switches at 15 launch control facilities.

Buildings in this district are on or near three sequential east-west streets (Amsterdam, Burroughs, and York) on the two blocks between Woodward Avenue and Second Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. District definition The New Amsterdam Historic District was recognized by both the National Register of Historic Places and the City of DetroitLocal designations from the City of Detroit as a historic district in 2001. Specific buildings in the general area are included in the designation; these buildings are located at 435 and 450 Amsterdam Street, 41-47, and 440 Burroughs Street, 5911-5919 and 6050-6160 Cass Avenue, 6100-6200 Second Avenue, and 425 York Street. In addition, the city designation includes 6001 Cass Avenue. General history Burroughs Adding Machine, now the Henry Ford Health Headquarters Major railroad infrastructure, known as the Milwaukee Junction, was built in the 1890s to facilitate industrial expansion in the city of Detroit.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, and the American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 2002, . pp. 168-169. To take advantage of the rail line, industrial plants were built in this area on both sides of Woodward Avenue, with the automotive industry prominently involved. Part of this area east of Woodward is now the Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District, while the area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District. Some commercial buildings were also built in this area, particularly along Cass. Although not part of the New Amsterdam Historic District, part of the early industrial character of the area was formed by the enormous Albert Kahn-designed Burroughs Adding Machine factory at Second and Burroughs, which is now the Henry Ford Health Systems administrative offices. Structures The district features several historically significant buildings. Some of these are: =Unknown (435 Amsterdam Street)= 435 Amsterdam under renovation.

The language used in the family's household was Sami, and Per, who was the youngest of five, didn't know Norwegian when he began school.

In the following ten years, he would take a leave of absence for further studies, three of the times in countries other than Norway. For the 1915-1916 school year, he studied at Askov Folk High School in Denmark. In the fall of 1917, he studied the violin in Oslo. From 1919 to 1920, he studied at Woodbrooke College in Birmingham, England. The year after, he was at the Institut du pantheon de France in Paris, where he first discovered Henri Bergsons philosophy. Even in his first published article in 1917, he was fighting for Sami language training in schools. At a conference in 1919 he was the architect behind a resolution that required: # That the Sami language should be studied for the first three school years. # That all teaching about Sami religion should be done in the Sami language. # Introducing Norwegian as a foreign language. He followed up the idea with an article in 1923, and with a detailed report on The parliamentarian school commission (1923‚Äì1926). In 1937, together with headmaster M.

Early career Hughes began his career in 1950 as an assistant account executive in a Detroit advertising agency. Over the years, he moved up the ranks to Radio and Television Director, supervising all broadcasting aspect for agency clients, and working as a writer, producer, director and commercial spokesman. He wrote over 100 musical commercials for his clients over his ten years with the firm. In 1960, Hughes left the advertising field and became involved in the start-up of Detroit classical music station WQRS (now WMGC-FM). During his time there, he won awards from the Associated Press for news commentary, and from the University of Detroit for program excellence. To television In 1963, Hughes moved to the television side of the business when he joined WXYZ-TV as Director of Advertising and Community Affairs. While at the station, he produced and narrated two major sales presentations which won successive sales promotion awards from the National Association of Broadcasters. They also attracted the notice of WPIX in New York City, which he first joined in 1968 as Director of Sales Development. \\"What's your opinion? We'd like to know.\\" In 1969, less than a year into his stint with WPIX, he began delivering on-air editorials for the station. Over the next 26 years ‚Äì serving at various points as Vice President of Community Affairs, Vice President/general manager, and Senior Vice President ‚Äì Hughes essentially became the face and voice of WPIX, and was dubbed \\"The Dean of Television Editorialists in New York City.\\" His closing catch phrase, \\"What's your opinion? We'd like to know,\\" became familiar to generations of New Yorkers, as well as becoming a permanent part of the lexicon. He also read letters from viewers on various editorials, under the heading of \\"WPIX Editorial Feedback.\\" After finishing each letter, he would conclude with, \\"And that ends that (comment/excerpt/opinion/quote).\\" During the 1970s, when WPIX was fighting to survive amid a long and costly license challenge, Hughes' editorials reached a peak. They were shown 28 times a week, including during 10 prime time spots a week, and were seen by an average of more than 1¬Ω million viewers. Several of his editorials were reprinted in such publications as the Congressional Record, The Christian Science Monitor and other local newspapers and magazines. One editorial even served as the basis for an Op-Ed column in The New York Times, and another was cited in a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court. Hughes won several Emmy Awards for his editorials, as well as numerous awards from such organizations as the New York State Broadcasters Association and San Francisco State University. He served for several years as a trustee of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Hughes also produced and narrated hour-long documentaries for WPIX, called Editorial Report. One of them, \\"The Lifer's Group: I Am My Brother's Keeper\\", won a Peabody Award in 1977. It was the first television program to introduce the public to the work of the Lifer's Group at Rahway State Prison (now East Jersey State Prison) with juvenile offenders; one year later, the subject was picked up and made famous nationwide through an unaffiliated production company's \\"Scared Straight!\\" In addition to his editorials, Hughes delivered a Christmas message that aired prior to the start of The Yule Log. Two versions of the message were recorded, both of them depicting Hughes surrounded by a wreath of holly, and backed by an instrumental version of Silent Night. The messages were recorded in 1974 and 1979; the latter version aired until WPIX dropped The Yule Log in 1989. Hughes retired from active station management in 1982, though he continued to deliver editorials for channel 11 until his final retirement from the station in 1995, with his last editorial airing on December 31 of that year. Later years After retiring from active management at WPIX, Hughes moved to Durham, North Carolina, and founded a telephone ministry called The Church of One-at-a-Time. He also taught Bible study and Scripture at Duke University and other places. In 2001, he wrote a book called The Book of Genesis, and had his own web magazine called The Blockhead Journal. He continued to be involved in the public affairs side of television, both contemporaneous with his WPIX editorial duties and after his final departure from that station. He hosted public affairs shows for WLFL and documentaries for WTVD. Hughes was married twice to the former Margo Rundles. After remarrying, he quipped, \\"We were divorced, but it just didn't work out.\\" He also was father to two daughters from a previous marriage, one an artist and author and the other an ordained minister.

In the English language, castagna is chestnut. Many Castagnese emigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century. Most inhabitants ended up in Utica, New York. It is also home to the Abbey of Santa Maria di Corazzo. History The mountainous territory of Castagna, located in Sila Piccola, has belonged for many centuries to the University of Scigliano, a farmhouse of Cosenza, in the province of Calabria Citiore. It was once called \\"Trempa della Castagna\\". The inhabitants mainly come from the Diano hamlet of Scigliano.Francesco Antonio Accattatis, History of Scigliano , edited by Isidoro Pallone, Cosenza: Brenner, 1965. With the dismemberment of Scigliano in 1807, Castagna was assigned to the municipality of Soveria Mannelli, and together with Soveria in 1816, it became part of the newly established province of Calabria Ulterior Second, with the capital at Catanzaro. On September 23, 1832 Castagna, together with the village Colla, separated from Soveria Mannelli to form an independent municipality, which however did not have a long life. After the unification of Italy, in fact, the provincial council of Catanzaro, finding that the municipal revenues were not enough to cover even the compulsory expenses, in the session of September 25, 1867, he proposed the suppression and the union of the territory of the capital \\"Castagna\\" to the municipality Carlopoli, and of the hamlet \\"Colla\\" to the municipality Soveria Mannelli. Contrary to expectations, on August 23, 1869, the entire municipal territory was assigned to Carlopoli, including \\"Colla\\". The latter fraction, 15 km from Carlopoli and 3.5 km from Soveria, however, returned to Soveria Mannelli with effect from 1 January 1871. Castagna was part of the Diocese of Martirano until 1818 when, due to the effects of the Pontifical Bull De Usori, following the agreement between the Holy See and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Diocese of Martirano was suppressed and aggregated to the Diocese of Nicastro. In September 1986, following the revision of the Italian dioceses according to the criterion of civil provinciality, while the parishes of Panettieri (with whom the inhabitants of Castagna shared the parish priest for centuries) passed from the diocese of Nicastro (which, on the occasion, changed its name to \\"Diocese of Lamezia Terme\\") in the Archdiocese of Cosenza-Bisignano, the parish of Castagna passed from the diocese of Nicastro to the Archdiocese of Catanzaro- Squillace, because the municipality of Carlopoli belonged to the latter diocese. Subsequently, by decree of 18 September 1989 of the Holy See, the parish of Panettieri has also been added to the diocese of Catanzaro- Squillace, although the municipality of Panettieri is in the province of Cosenza. In the second half of the 19th century, Emilio Leo created the first Calabrian textile industry in Castagna by exploiting the driving force of the Corace waters; later Leo moved to Soveria Mannelli and in the latter town Lanificio Leo, a factory founded in 1873, continues in the production of fabrics using the ancient nineteenth-century machinery.

Romulus was probably a local deacon, priest, or bishop of the 1st century. According to tradition, he was a disciple of Saint Peter and had been converted to Christianity by the apostle. This tradition states that Romulus became the first bishop of Fiesole and was martyred during the reign of Domitian along with four companions: Carissimus, Dulcissimus, Marchis(i)anus, and Crescentius. He was not named as a bishop or martyr in documents dating from 966; however, a document from 1028 names him as such. From then on, Romulus was considered a martyred bishop of Fiesole, and his companions were named as Carissimus, Dulcissimus, Marchis(i)anus (Marchiziano), and Crescentius. Their feast day was listed as July 6 in the 1468 Florentine edition of the Martyrology of Usuard, and in the 16th century, his name began to appear in the Roman Martyrology, where he was named as a disciple of Saint Peter. As Antonio Borrelli remarks, sometime between the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the eleventh, Romulus was \\"upgraded\\" from being considered a Confessor of the Faith to a martyr, possibly by a local abbot named Teuzo. An 11th-century legend associated with him, considered \\"worthless\\", makes him an illegitimate son of a woman named Lucerna, who had a child with her father's slave, who was named Cyrus. Like the Romulus of ancient Roman legend, this Romulus was also abandoned and suckled by a she- wolf. He was captured, baptized and raised by Saint Peter and Peter's companion Justin. Romulus then evangelized much of central Italy and was put to death by the governor Repertian. The most ancient image depicting Romulus is the 1440 polyptych in Fiesole Cathedral, where he is represented with Saints Alexander, Peter and Donatus.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The area along Piquette was an important center for automobile production in the early 20th century. Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, Cadillac, Dodge, and Regal Motor Car had plants in the area, as well as suppliers such as Fisher Body.\\"Huge fire destroys century-old warehouse in Detroit\\" from USA Today. In 1910, the two largest automobile producers in the world, Studebaker and Ford, were located next door to each other on Piquette. Although the area is largely empty and derelict now, as recently as the 1950s there were 50,000 workers employed in plants in the district.  General history  Two smaller buildings on Piquette Avenue near Woodward in the Historic District. Major railroad infrastructure, known as the Milwaukee Junction, was built in the 1890s to facilitate industrial expansion in the city of Detroit.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, and the American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 2002, . pp. 168-169. The heart of Milwaukee Junction was Piquette Avenue, although industrial plants were built in this area on both sides of Woodward Avenue, with the automotive industry prominently involved. The area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District, while a portion of the area east of Woodward is now the Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District.

The Autocar Service Building is located on the southwest corner of Piquette and Brush. It is currently owned by the City of Detroit Parks and Recreation Department. = E-M-F/Studebaker Plant (201 - 285 Piquette) = Studebaker Plant in 2003 The Studebaker Plant was located on the north side of Piquette, between Brush and John R. The building first housed Wayne Automotive in 1906. In 1908, Wayne merged with Northern Motor Car to form the E-M-F Company. The owners of E-M-F formed a manufacturing and distribution partnership with Studebaker, and eventually Studebaker took control of E-M-F (and the plant) in 1910. Studebaker continued to manufacture automobiles in the plant until 1925.Everitt-Metzger-Flanders/Studebaker Auto Plant from Detroit1701 After Studebaker left the plant, Chrysler used it until the mid-1960s as a parts facility. The building was used in part for warehousing after that, as well as home the Piquette Market, a meat wholesaler.Studebaker History In June 2005, the plant was completely destroyed in a fire. As of 2008, a shelter for homeless veterans was planned for the site.\\"City Breaks Ground On Veteran Housing\\" from WDIV When Studebaker began production of the two models of the Rockne, the larger \\"75\\" was produced in South Bend, beginning December 15, 1931; and the smaller \\"65\\" went into production at the old E-M-F plant on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, February 22, 1932. This Piquette Avenue plant was the same plant at which the 1927 and 1928 Erskine models had been built. Rockne's were also produced at Studebaker's Walkerville, Ontario plant. The 1933 Rockne line was reduced to one line, the \\"10\\". The Rockne \\"10\\" was an update of the \\"65\\". When Studebaker went into receivership on March 18, 1933, it was decided to move production of the Rockne to the Studebaker plant in South Bend. The Rockne \\"10\\" was built in South Bend from April through July, 1933.\\" = Ford Piquette Avenue Plant (461 Piquette) = Piquette plant.

During the Great Depression, Fisher suspended production and the building was used as a soup kitchen and homeless shelter.Samantha Cleaver, \\"Body and soul: The story of Fisher Body 21,\\" Metro Times, August 13, 2008 The plant was used as an engineering design facility from 1930‚Äì1956; during World War II, the factory produced P-80 Lockheed Shooting Star Planes, Vought F4U Corsair Shipboard Fighters, and some assemblies for B-25 Mitchell bombers. After 1956, the plant was used to build Cadillac limousine bodies; GM closed the plant in 1984. After GM left, several paint companies used the building; it closed for good in 1994.Fisher Body 21 from Forgotten Detroit In 1999, as a result of unpaid property taxes, the building became the property of the City of Detroit and was re-addressed as 6051 Hastings St.  References  Category:Historic districts in Detroit Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Unused buildings in Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District"},{"id":"17945185","text":"This list of environmental websites includes websites, blogs, podcasts and other web-based platforms associated with environmental issues.

History The Ministry of Agriculture was established on 20 November 1913. In 1996, it was renamed Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation. One of its goals is to address sustainability in agriculture such as better ways to do agricultural irrigation. In 2016, an agency from Switzerland was put in charge of inspecting Egypt's imported wheat. Egypt imports the most wheat of any country and around 40% of the average Egyptians' income is spent on food. Farmland As of 2000, small farms (between 5 and 6 feddans) accounted for most (49.61%) of the agricultural land ownership in Egypt. 34.72% of farm holdings were of 1 feddan or less. The hope is that with desalination plants, new wells and better infrastructure farmers will be able to grow more wheat. In April 2018 Egypt purchased wheat from local farmers but not at a price farmers found sustainable. Land reclamation A land reclamation project began in 2015, near the town of Farafra. Large government and private investment and initiatives in farming the Sahara Desert have sometimes ended with little to show. In June 2017, it was announced 1.7 million feddans had been reclaimed and according to the Egyptian Prime Minister, Sherif Ismail, this work would continue. It was President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who, in May 2017, asked for the armed services to begin reclaiming land by demolishing illegally erected structures on land not owned by builders or squatters.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Fiesole and is dedicated to Saint Romulus. History The first cathedral of Fiesole was situated lower down the hill than the present one, and had been built, according to the tradition, over the site of the martyrdom of Saint Romulus of Fiesole. In 1028 the present cathedral was founded by Bishop Jacopo the Bavarian to replace it, as he wished it to be inside the city walls. The old cathedral was converted into a Benedictine abbey and became known as the \\"Badia di Fiesole\\". It was rebuilt in 1466 by a disciple of Filippo Brunelleschi. Its fa√ßade, dating from the 11th century, is still preserved. It contains notable early works by Mino da Fiesole. The abbey was closed in 1778. Description The exterior is Romanesque. The cathedral is built on the basilica floorplan with a nave and two aisles separated by stone columns which have capitals decorated with figures and animals. It has a raised presbytery over the crypt and a trussed ceiling. The picturesque battlemented campanile was built in 1213. The church was restored in 1256. The plain and majestic interior The interior has little decoration, apart from the marble altar (1273) and two frescoes, depicting Saint Benedict (c. 1420) and Saint Sebastian by Pietro Perugino (late 15th century). In the presbytery is a polyptych of the Three stories of Saint Nicholas, by Bicci di Lorenzo, commissioned in 1450. In the Salutati Chapel is the funerary monument of bishop Leonardo Salutati, executed by Mino da Fiesole.Toscana: Duomo di Fiesole In the Canon's Chapel is a marble altar by Andrea Ferrucci (1492‚Äì1494). In the counter-fa√ßade is a huge statue of Saint Romulus by Giovanni della Robbia (1521). The crypt's small columns have 11th century capitals, perhaps taken from the original construction. The decoration includes late Gothic medallions on the vault, while on the left wall is a cycle of the Stories of St. Romulus by the school of Domenico Ghirlandaio. The bishops' funerary chapel has a 13th-century icon attributed to one \\"Master of Bigallo\\", portraying the Madonna and Child (1215‚Äì1220).

In 2008, \\"Good Good\\" was the second single from Ashanti's fourth studio album The Declaration (2008). It was released through The Inc., Universal, and Written Entertainment. The song's lyrics revolve around sexual innuendo with the phrase \\"Good Good\\". American singer-songwriter Kehlani re-used the concept in her 2015 song of the same name. According to Ashanti, Nelly developed the idea during a recording session. She sings about her lover through the lyrics: \\"Ladies don't believe half what you hear, cause it's all a waste of time/ If you know you got that good, good good, everything will be just fine.\\" \\"Good Good\\" also features Ashanti discussing \\"her abilities to please in bed\\". Her mother and manager Tina Douglas referred to it as a \\"feel-good record\\", and said that Ashanti requested that the composition have a \\"bounce\\".

In an article for International Women's Day, Da'Shan Smith of Billboard included it in its list of songs about female empowerment. From the same publication, a separate reviewer praised Ashanti's confidence and vocals. A writer for Rap-Up, Steve Jones of USA Today, and a contributor for Metacritic cited it as the strongest track from The Declaration. Praising the track as \\"bouncy [and] attitude-laden\\", Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star felt that it should have been the album's lead single. In a more negative review, Brett Johnson, writing for the Associated Press, said Ashanti's \\"sexy-soul\\" songs, \\"Good Good\\" and \\"Body on Me\\", contradict the album's \\"good-girl balladry\\", \\"Mother\\" and \\"Shine\\". Commercially, \\"Good Good\\" peaked at number 30 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs Billboard chart on September 27, 2008, and remained on the chart for 20 weeks.  Promotion  A music video, directed by Melina Matsoukas, was released to promote the single, and features Nelly as one of the lead characters. While discussing the visual, Ashanti said that it focused on reality versus fantasy with influences from pin-up models. She felt that the video's message was about how to keep your significant other through sex appeal, citing a scene in which she cleans the house while wearing high heels, diamonds, and sunglasses as an example. It received positive reviews from critics. In an article about the video, a contributor for Uproxx wrote: \\"Is it just me or Ashanti keeps getting sexier?\\" A reviewer from Rap-Up praised its art direction, and identified it as Ashanti's strongest release at that point.

Development Originally named the \\"Robotic Rotary Wingman\\", a requirement was issued in the spring of 2002, specifying a robot rotorcraft to be armed with missiles, unguided rockets, guns, and nonlethal directed energy weapons, and with the capability of attacking masked targets. The UCAR was to cost $4 million to US$8 million, and have operating costs 10% to 40% of those of an AH-64 Apache. Operational cost reductions were expected to be achieved at least in part by reducing the number of personnel required to maintain and operate the machine. =Design bids= Contenders for the UCAR contract included Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky. Boeing teamed up with companies like Axiom, BAE Systems, and Rockwell Scientific to refine and develop its UCAR design.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/ucar.htmhttps://boeing.mediaroom.com/2002-10-22-Boeing- Announces-Strategic-Partners-for-Unmanned-Combat-Armed-Rotorcraft-Program Two finalists, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin were selected in the summer of 2003 to come up with a detailed design; ironically, neither company had ever built a full-production rotorcraft. The Northrop Grumman design used the twin- two-blade-rotor \\"eggbeater\\" scheme usually associated with Kaman helicopters - in fact Kaman has teamed with Northop Grumman on the project - while the Lockheed Martin design used a four-blade rotor with a \\"no-tail-rotor (NOTAR)\\" jet exhaust in the tail to cancel torque.https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2004-09-29-Lockheed-Martin-UCAR-Team- Successfully-Tests-Candidate-Sensor- Technologieshttps://news.lockheedmartin.com/2004-09-27-Bell-Designs- Innovative-Compound-Helicopter-Concept-for-Lockheed-Martin-UCAR- Programhttps://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-adds- sikorsky-to-unmanned-combat-armed-rotorcraft-team Both were \\"stealthy\\" designs with weapon stores in internal bays; both eliminated the tail rotor, which is the noisiest element on a conventional helicopter. The Northrop Grumman eggbeater was to be able to fly at more than 295 km/h (160 knots) and at an altitude of up to , with an endurance with auxiliary fuel tanks of 10 hours and a range of up to . Northrop Grumman envisioned two variants: an attack variant, the baseline version, optimized for low-altitude operation and carrying a nav-attack sensor suite; and a scout variant, optimized for high- altitude operation and carrying a SAR payload and communications relay. The Lockheed Martin proposal provided similar performance but less endurance; the baseline payload configuration included a SAR. A single contractor was to be chosen to develop two X-vehicle prototypes. It was to lead to a \\"B-model\\", closer to an operational machine, with a warload of from , including nonlethal directed-energy weapons. Outcome The Army seemed very enthusiastic about the program, but then pulled out abruptly late in 2004, citing more immediate demands on aviation funding.

This implementation, also known as ISC DHCP, is one of the first and best known, but there are now a number of other DHCP server software implementations available. Clients may solicit an IP address from a DHCP server when they need one. The DHCP server then offers the \\"lease\\" of an IP address to the client, which the client is free to request or ignore. If the client requests it and the server acknowledges it, then the client is permitted to use that IP address for the \\"lease time\\" specified by the server. At some point before the lease expires, the client must re-request the same IP address if it wishes to continue to use it. Issued IP addresses are tracked by dhcpd through a record in the dhcpd.leases file. This allows the server to maintain state over restarts of the dhcp service, which could otherwise lead to duplicate IP addresses being issued when server issued the same IP address again while another client still has the right to use it. This reference implementation of DHCP is developed by the Internet Systems Consortium and is supported on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Solaris. Remote access to a running instance of dhcpd is provided by the Object Management Application Programming Interface (OMAPI). This API allows manipulation of the internal state of a running instance of the dhcpd server or client. On the server side, this interface allows editing of registration information for managed nodes. Uses on the client include fetching configuration information, releasing and renewing leases, and changing which interfaces are managed by the DHCP client. ISC DHCP is in wide distribution; however, it is very mature software. ISC is developing a new DHCP software system, which is intended to eventually replace it. This software, Kea, includes a DHCP server only (so, no client or relay yet) and is supported on the same platforms as ISC DHCP. It is distributed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL2.0). ISC DHCP adopted the Mozilla Public License (MPL2.0) with the release of 4.4.1.

Although being produced by the MPA, the only film companies in the United States that included this PSA on their DVDs were Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and select films released by Buena Vista Pictures. It shows a man committing theft of various objects, and compares these crimes with the unauthorized duplication and distribution of copyrighted materials, such as films.

In popular culture The advertisement has been parodied in Internet memes, including those using the phrase \\"You wouldn't download a car.\\" The IT Crowd episode \\"Moss and the German\\" spoofed this advertisement near the start of the episode. The Greens-European Free Alliance, in association with Rafilm, released their own version of the film to oppose the media industry and government views on existing copyright laws, as well as to educate the public on alternative views about intellectual property.

History The station was opened by the Waterford and Limerick and Limerick and Foynes railways, then absorbed into the Great Southern and Western Railway. In 1924 the Railways Act passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State moved the station to the Great Southern Railway. In 1925, another merger led to management by the Great Southern Railways. Then it was moved to the CI√â by the Transport Act 1944 from 1 January 1945, on nationalisation. The station was closed to passenger traffic by CI√â on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. Freight trains continued to pass through Adare until the line was mothballed by Irish Rail in 2001. There have been no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weed-spray train last visited the line. The last movement on the line was an inspection car, which travelled the line on 9 January 2003. In an interview on Limerick's Live 95 fm on April 18, 2011, Kay McGuinness, Chairperson of Shannon Foynes Port Company, said that they are confident that the rail link could be reopened for ‚Ç¨7 million, which was considerably less than initially quoted price of ‚Ç¨30 million by Irish Rail following the involvement of consultants and it was now a do-able project.

It was positioned as the four-door Celica, with a similar focus on luxury found on larger Toyota hardtop sedans, like the Toyota Crown and the Toyota Cresta. It was the counterpart of the Corona EXiV. Its design sought to emulate the hardtop four- door coup√© styling of large American and European sedans, resulting in a small, low cabin with longer front and rear ends. The ED's B-pillar stood up in the middle with no purpose other than to hinge the rear door on; it was not attached to the roof side of the cabin. The ED achieved huge sales in Japan, and other Japanese manufacturers introduced the Mazda Persona, Nissan Presea, and Mitsubishi Emeraude around the same time. \\"ED\\" is the initials of \\"Exciting\\" and \\"Dressy\\". When the Carina ED was discontinued, the Toyota Brevis appeared for the market segment served by the Carina ED. __TOC__ First Generation (1985-1989) ST160 series  The first generation was a new design direction, emphasizing styling and comfort over practicality and economy. The Celica platform was used and attention was placed on handling and performance. Fog lamps were made standard August 1987. The 1S-ELU was replaced by the 2.0 L 3S-FELU, and May 1988, the 1S-iLU was replaced by the 1.8 L 4S-FiLU. When the first Carina was introduced in 1970, it was identified as a four-door Celica, but sold at a different Toyota Japan dealership called Toyota Store as a Corona-sized sedan with the performance-enhanced image of the Celica. The Corona was exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Celica was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store. The introduction of the Carina ED represented a reintroduction of the performance reputation of the Celica, once again as a four-door version. Toyota Carina ED 1.8 X (ST160, Japan) The hardtop approach was also used on the yet smaller Corolla/Sprinter platform, called the Corolla Ceres and the Sprinter Marino; these cars were offered for consumers who wanted the luxurious approach offered by the Toyota Crown hardtop and sedan, as well as the Mark II (four-door sedan), Cresta (4-door hardtop) and Chaser (four-door hardtop and performance enhancements) but at a lower price and reduced tax liability based on the vehicles size and engine displacement. Second Generation (1989 - 1993) ST180 series The restyled second generation was introduced 1989 and luxury equipment content increased. Four-wheel steering appeared on the top level offering and styling was updated more closely resemble the twin introduction of the Toyota Corona EXiV, and shared it appearance with the Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina. Electronic fuel injection was made standard on all engines offered. The car was the last true hardtop as the next generation had a complete B pillar extending all the way to the roof. Third Generation (1993 - 1998) ST200 series Toyota Carina ED (Japan) The four wheel drive system introduced on this generation was borrowed from the Toyota Celica GT-Four. Four wheel steering was available. The trim level designations were 1800V, 2000X, 2000GT and 2000GT-4WD. As a result of styling changes, sales improved in comparison to the second generation. A driver side airbag appeared September 1995, as well as speed sensitive door locks and climate control air conditioning. A passenger side airbag appeared June 1996.

It was originally built to house fire crews assigned to patrol the surrounding National Forest. Since the 1990s, the United States Forest Service rents Antlers Guard Station and other forest cabins and lookout stations to recreational visitors. The Antlers Guard Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment needed to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandoned. In the 1990s, historic preservation groups, with the support of Forest Service employees, began pressing National Forest managers to preserve the remaining structures. To finance the preservation effort, the Forest Service started renting its guard stations to the public. It later began renting out many unused fire lookout towers as well. The Antlers Guard Station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. It was originally used as a home station for fire crews patrolling the surrounding forest. The Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest started renting cabins including Antlers Guard Station to the public in the early 1990s. Because of its rustic architecture and the cabin's unique historic value as an early Forest Service guard station, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.  Structure  The Antlers Guard Station is located at an elevation of on the west bank of the North Fork of the Burnt River approximately two miles from the abandoned Whitney, Oregon town site. The forest area around the cabin is dominated by ponderosa pine and provides scenic views. The Antlers Guard Station has wood frame construction and a concrete foundation. Its exterior is covered with weather board and shingles. It has two small rooms: the front room is a combined living room and bedroom. It is furnished with a futon style double bed and two bunk bed sets. The kitchen is equipped with a propane stove, table and chairs. The cabin has a propane fireplace for heat and propane lights. An outhouse is located near the cabin. Water is available from an outside hand pump. There is a garage, a fire pit, and an outdoor picnic table located on the guard station grounds. There is also room for tent camping at the site.  Recreation  The Antlers Guard Station can be rented by the night. The Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest keeps 95 percent of the rental fee to maintain the cabin and improve the site. The cabin is available year-round and can be booked for up to seven days at a time. Kitchen utensils are provided, but visitors must bring their own sleeping bags or bedding, toiletries, towel, and first aid kit. In the summer, visitors can hike trails or bike on forest roads. The cabin is also used by fishermen and hunters. Cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling on designated routes are popular winter activities. In addition, it is legal to pan for gold in the Burnt River, which flows next to the guard station. Because the cabin is located in an isolated forest area, the Forest Service warns visitors to watch out for mountain lions, black bears, and rattle snakes.  Access  Antlers Guard Station is located approximately two miles from the old Whitney town site. It is 22 miles northwest of Unity, Oregon, and 40 miles west of Baker City, Oregon. Cabin reservations and detailed directions to the site can be obtained from the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest. In the winter, snow in the area can get deep so the Forest Service recommends that visitors carry tire chains during the winter.

Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul. 1970. pg. 266-267. ASIN B000NP64Z2 although since the building straddles a declivity, only one floor is visible from the main entrance. The exterior glazed bricks show a Central Asian influence, especially from the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand. The square, axial plan represents the four corners of the world and symbolizes, in architectural terms, the universal authority and sovereignty of the Sultan. As there is no Byzantine influence, the building is ascribed to an unknown Persian architect.Necipoƒülu, pg. 214 The stone-framed brick and the polygonal pillars of the fa√ßade are typical of Persia. A grilled gate leads to the basement. Two flights of stairs above this gate lead to a roofed colonnaded terrace. This portico was rebuilt in the 18th century. The great door in the middle, surrounded by a tiled green arch, leads to the vestibule and then to a loftily domed court. The three royal apartments are situated behind, with the middle apartment in apsidal form.Necipoƒülu, pg. 216 These apartments look out over the park to the Bosphorus. The network of ribbed vaulting suggests Gothic revival architecture, but it actually adds weight to the structure instead of sustaining it. The blue-and-white tiles on the wall are arranged in hexagons and triangles in the Bursa manner.Davis, pg. 267 Some show delicate patterns of flowers, leaves, clouds or other abstract forms. The white plasterwork is in the Persian manner. On both wings of the domed court are eyvans, vaulted recesses open on one side.

A product of a wealthy family, M√©ndez Arceo's father was a successful lawyer and his uncle was a prominent archbishop believed to be involved in the church-state conflict of the 1920s. M√©ndez Arceo graduated from the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome and served as a Seminary professor in Mexico. He became Roman Catholic Bishop of Cuernavaca, Morelos, in 1953 and served in that capacity until 1983. Basic ecclesial communities Sergio M√©ndez Arceo was Bishop of the Cuernavaca diocese in the Mexican state of Morelos. He is often cited as the force behind the growth of basic ecclesial communities () (CEB) in Mexico during the 1970s. The first groups arose in Mexico in 1967 under M√©ndez Arceo, and by the 1970s CEBs were operating throughout Mexico, 70% in rural regions with the remainder in working-class urban areas. M√©ndez Arceo and the CEB's often removed the emphasis on the church's hierarchy, instead pushing for a greater dialogue between church leaders, non-clergy members and the members of the surrounding community. Members of the CEB's would meet with priests and discuss social, political and economic issues they felt needed attention. Following the meetings, priests would confer with M√©ndez Arceo weekly to discuss possible solutions to the issues of the members of the community. The growth of CEBs in Mexico is often cited as a reason for Cuernavaca being the focal point of renovation in the church. M√©ndez Arceo is quoted as saying; CIDOC M√©ndez Arceo supported Ivan Illich, an Austrian philosopher, in setting up the Intercultural Documentation Center () (CIDOC) at his diocese in Cuernavaca in 1961. Illich is stated as having pronounced to M√©ndez Arceo; \\"I would like to start, under your auspices, a center for de-Yankeefication.\\" The Center was a research center and offered language courses to missionaries from North America and to volunteers of the Alliance for Progress program. Illich however was stated as having the goal of countering the participation of the Vatican in the \\"modern development\\" of the Third World. He believed that the Church should view itself as guest of the host country and, through the center, relayed this belief. The conservative members of the Church denounced the school, and for a time forbade clergy from studying at the location. The ban however was altered following M√©ndez Arceo's trip to Rome where he pleaded the case for the CIDOC. It was decided that priests and nuns may study at the CIDOC as long as their superiors monitored their progress. Liberation theology Sergio M√©ndez Arceo is a believer in liberation theology, a belief which has led him to be named the \\"Red Bishop\\" and a \\"scandalous supporter of socialism\\". In 1970 M√©ndez Arceo stated \\"Christianity and socialism can co- exist\\" and he encouraged then president of Mexico Luis Echeverr√≠a to form a committee of notable citizens to examine Mexico's most serious social and economic problems. Echeverr√≠a viewed Arceo as the foremost proponent of liberation theology and favored his emphasis on redistribution of wealth to the poor. Echeverr√≠a believed the clergy could help the people of Mexico learn the best means of organizing themselves in a capitalist society. The means of organizing in Arceo's view was labor unions, which he viewed as \\"essential to the base of community organizing.\\" For the workers whom Arceo provided support for in his Sunday homilies, his title was Don Sergio, an honorific title in the Spanish language. In April 1972, M√©ndez Arceo attended the Christians for Socialism conference in Santiago de Chile; he was the only member of the Mexican episcopate to attend. The conference was the first continent-wide gathering of its kind, composed of Catholics and Protestants. It is stated the conference members were composed of the most radical of those involved in liberal theology and that they attempted to find a synthesis between Christianity and socialism. The gathering was soon after banned by the Chilean episcopate. Upon his retirement M√©ndez Arceo founded the Center for Meetings and Dialogue (CED) in Cuernavaca to serve as an umbrella organization for other social and activist programs in the state of Morelos. The role of the CED was to help assist in the continuation of his life work in the field of liberation theology. Today, the CED \\"provides a regional mechanism for progressive popular organizations\\" as well as housing statewide meetings in various fields such as women's empowerment, human rights, education, and environmental protection. Human rights Sergio M√©ndez Arceo was an advocate of the Vatican II principles, which moved for changes in ritual distribution of the sacraments, deemphasis on saints, more studying of the bible, and sociological studies to aid ecclesiastical organization. M√©ndez Arceo attempted unsuccessfully to have the Mexican Conference of Bishops explore the violent suppression of the student movements in 1968, known as Mexico 68. As an individual without the support of the other bishops, M√©ndez Arceo assisted the imprisoned students, often called political prisoners, following the Tlatelolco Plaza massacre. In January 1970 he informed his fellow bishops of the condition of those prisoners; the bishops made no references to the massacre itself or the outcome, in keeping with its nonconfrontational stance toward the government at the time. M√©ndez Arceo was also involved in other social movements in Mexico such as striking Cuernavaca workers and guerrillas from Guerrero. The inaction by the episcopate, against what was viewed as rampant social repression, is believed to be what sparked many individual clergy and Jesuits, and the episcopate's social secretariat, to shift its emphasis from schools for the elite to social action programs. M√©ndez Arceo visited Cuba where he received the Orden de la Solidaridad from Fidel Castro for his \\"merit in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism and other forms of exploitation.\\" Following M√©ndez Arceo's trip to Cuba, he began supporting \\"democratic socialism.\\" Criticism Some say that Sergio M√©ndez Arceo's actions and views made him too controversial, to the point that it limited his ability to form collegiality with other Mexican bishops and the episcopate; also that he politicized his diocese and its communities, and in doing so was opposed to the government. Roderic Ai Camp in Crossing Swords: Politics and Religion in Mexico states that this is wrong, and asserts \\"empirical data ... states that religion in Cuernavaca is associated with increased PRI support.\\" The Institutional Revolutionary Party () (PRI), being the then ruling party. In 1983 when M√©ndez Arceo retired, the Vatican under Pope John Paul II sent unsympathetic bishops to reverse much of M√©ndez Arceo's work. Juan Jes√∫s Posadas Ocampo became bishop of the diocese of Cuernavaca. It later become known that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) produced a report on M√©ndez Arceo stating he was friendly to the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front () (FMLN) of El Salvador and the Sandinista National Liberation Front ()(FSLN) of Nicaragua, which took power in 1979 following the collapse of the Somoza regime. The FBI further alleged M√©ndez Arceo's diocese collected intelligence, bought and sold guns, and served as couriers for communist guerrillas of El Salvador. M√©ndez Arceo was further accused of being contacted by the Soviet Union Committee for State Security () (KGB) and Cuban General Intelligence Directorate () (DGI). In an article in the Catholic periodical The Athanasian, it is claimed that Arceo was in fact a crypto-Freemason; and that there were and are many more like him in the Vatican hierarchy.The Athanasian, Vol. XIV, No. 4, June 1, 1993 See also * List of people from Morelos, Mexico Further reading *Loustaunau, Esteban. \\"Sergio M√©ndez Arceo.\\" Encyclopedia of Mexico.

Located in the heart of Hollywood, the tower became a favorite place of residence for entertainment industry employees. A plaque by the front door reads: \\"Hollywood Tower. 1929. Sophisticated living for film luminaries during the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood.\\" Actor George Raft owned an interest in the building and lived there for a time. In her novel Stormy Weather, Paula L. Woods wrote: \\"Hollywood Tower was a seven-story, indecisive gray building at the corner of Franklin and Vista Del Mar in Hollywood. The faux French Normandy apartment building was so old it probably had a view of the sea when it was built [...] Hollywood Tower, though, was a last vestige of an earlier era. You could tell by the way the planting in the front was kept neatly trimmed and the lobby smelled Spic-and-Span clean.\\" The building directly abuts the Hollywood Freeway, and its neon \\"HOLLYWOOD TOWER\\" sign looking directly over the northbound freeway is a Hollywood landmark. Hollywood historian Marc Wanamaker said, \\"It has been a major landmark since it was built. Even before the freeway, it was a landmark on that hill.\\" Purchases and sales of the property The building was purchased over the years by South American investors for $300,000 in 1937, by Justus P. Seeburg in 1939 for $250,000, and by Sam Gutlin in 1953 for $642,000. In 1978, the Hollywood Tower was sold to Deseret Properties, a Glendale, California firm owned by Blain Anderson. When Deseret bought the property, it was in poor shape, and the new owner invested approximately $50,000 in new carpeting and paint. However, Deseret found the project to be difficult to operate due to the adoption of rent control by the City of Los Angeles in 1978, and problems collecting rent from tenants who \\"didn't get that part\\" or \\"didn't sell that piece of music\\". In order to achieve a more stable flow of rental income, the new owner began courting senior citizens as tenants, and by 1981, 31 of the building's 56 apartments were occupied by senior citizens. The building was sold in 2007 for $34.5 million to a Phoenix-based developer Alliance Residential with plans to build additional units on the land across Vista del Mar. Since the acquisition, ownership has invested more than $1 million in renovations and upgrades to the building and opened the new adjacent development, La Belle, in mid-2010. As of 2015, The Hollywood Tower has been sold to Los Angeles-based developer MWest Holdings, and managed by their subsidiary, Polaris management. La Belle has been sold to Legacy Partners and is now known as \\"La Belle at Hollywood Tower\\". The two buildings are effectively separate entities. Historic designation The Hollywood Tower was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. In popular culture Disney's Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney California Adventure and at Walt Disney Studios Park. Though the architectural styles differ, the Hollywood Tower is \\"often cited as the inspiration\\" for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror attractions at Disney parks in Florida, California, Paris and Tokyo. Like the real-life Hollywood Tower, the \\"Hollywood Tower Hotel\\" structure at the Disney theme parks bears the same classic \\"Hollywood Tower\\" sign and spiraling towers. A made-for-TV adaptation based on the ride entitled Tower of Terror was released in 1997, though while both the attraction and the movie shared the same basic premise of five people being killed in an elevator, the movie lacked any connection to The Twilight Zone. The Hollywood Tower appears prominently, by name, in the 1948 mystery film Devil's Cargo, part of The Falcon series. It is also featured in Brian De Palma's 1984 thriller Body Double, a movie notable for its setting in a number of Los Angeles landmarks. The Hollywood Tower received ample screen time in the 1980 screwball comedy Midnight Madness, produced by Walt Disney Productions.

Schwartz AKA The Ultimate Bad Guy is an American film and television actor and stuntman, and former professional wrestler. His size and agility at 6'8\\" and have allowed him many roles as thug or villain for film and television.  Background  Schwartz was born in the United States but is of Israeli descent. He is a devout Jew. (2011). Schwartz was born and raised in Philadelphia, where he played football, baseball and ice hockey at Washington High School before attending Temple University. After college, he became a professional wrestler, wrestling under the ring-names of \\"Joshua Ben- Gurion‚ÄîThe Israeli Commando\\" and \\"Giant David\\". Schwartz toured as a wrestler and held many titles, before turning his career toward performance in film and television. Apart from his acting, and after completing training, Schwartz became a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy and a reserve deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He currently resides in Seal Beach, California.  Professional wrestling career  After college, Schwartz became a professional wrestler, trained in the early '70s by wrestling's Walter \\"Killer\\" Kowalski. Schwartz's original ring-name was Giant David, but by the '80s he was known as Joshua Ben-Gurion‚ÄîThe Israeli Commando. As a professional wrestler, he performed in Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Western Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Guam, Canada and 40 of the 50 United States. He was promoted by Verne Gagne, Vince McMahon, Herb Abrams, Antone \\"Ripper\\" Leone, and Bruno Sammartino. Film career Schwartz was wrestling on tour in Bakersfield, California, when he was approached by a Hollywood agent. After seeing Schwartz's wrestling on television, the agent had traveled to Bakerfield to meet him, feeling Schwartz should take his skills into performing arts. At first, Schwartz was reluctant to change careers, wanting to retire as a wrestler. In his early stunt work, and because of his background in pro wrestling, Schwartz was able to handle the staged combat, which required protecting opponents from harm. Due to his look, size, agility, and ability to handle dialogue, he has been able to obtain roles as the \\"bad guy\\" in many films and television projects. He is known for his work in such films and TV shows as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Star Trek: Enterprise, The Scorpion King, Charmed, The Tick, and Black Scorpion among others, but he is probably most recognized for his role as 'Bruiser' in the films Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen. He has appeared in such big budget films as Spider-Man, Fire Down Below, Starsky & Hutch, and Fun with Dick and Jane.

The synagogue is built in Moorish Revival Style. Only a little park with a modern statue of famous Prague writer Franz Kafka (by Jaroslav R√≥na) lies between it and the church of Holy Spirit. Today, the Spanish Synagogue is administered by the Jewish Museum in Prague. Interior of the Synagogue  History  The Spanish Synagogue is not the first synagogue at the site. Before it there stood probably the oldest synagogue in Prague Jewish Town, Altschule. In the second half of 19th century, the capacity of the Altschule did not suffice. The modernist faction in the community, which renovated it in 1837 for the purpose of moderately reformed services, therefore decided to demolish the synagogue in 1867 and one year later it was replaced by the new, Spanish Synagogue. Its name presumably refers to the style in which it was built, Moorish Revival style, which was inspired by the art of Arabic period of Spanish history (this name was not always prevalent, in the beginnings it was usually called by German-speaking Jews Geistgasse-Tempel, i.e. Temple in Holy Spirit Street). The architectural plans were designed by Vojtƒõch Ign√°c Ullmann and Josef Niklas (an imposing interior decoration). In 1935, a functionalistic building, designed by Karel Pec√°nek, was added to the synagogue. Till the Second World War it served to the Jewish Community as a hospital. The synagogue used the space of the new building as well; there was a vestibule and a winter oratory in it. Since 1935, the appearance of the synagogue remained essentially unchanged. During the Second World War, confiscated properties of Czech Jewish Communities were stored in the synagogue, e.g. the furniture from other synagogues. Ten years after the war, the synagogue was handed over to the Jewish Museum and in 1958‚Äì1959 it was completely restored inside. In the following year an exposition of synagogue textiles was opened there. In the 1970s the building was neglected and after 1982 it remained closed. The restoration started only after the Velvet revolution. Completely restored to its former beauty, the synagogue was re-opened with a ceremony in 1998.  Appearance  Dome above the main hall The synagogue itself is two storeys high. Its ground plan is square. The main hall with a dome is surrounded by three built-in balconies. At the south balcony, there is an organ. In the eastern wall there is a great round stained glass window with a central ornament of Magen David (hexagram), installed in 1882‚Äì1883. Underneath it there is a monumental aron ha-kodesh. The most impressive decorative element in the synagogue is a gilded and multi-colored parquet arabesque. Its designers, Anton√≠n Baum and Bed≈ôich M√ºnzberger, were inspired by Arabic architecture and art. The synagogue was decorated according to their design in 1882‚Äì1893. The disposition of the synagogue is reform ‚Äì the reading platform, bimah, is situated at the eastern wall, not in the central space as in older synagogues. Benches (not original, but from synagogue in Zruƒç nad S√°zavou) stand in rows (as in a church), not around the walls. The aron ha-kodesh is designed in the style of mihrab, and has no curtain (parochet) today.  Today  Torah Ark and Bema Since the last restoration in 1998, an exposition about modern Jewish history in the Czech lands can be seen there. It begins with reforms initiated by enlightened Emperor Joseph II, which started the Jewish emancipation and inclusion of Jews to major society. Many personalities, which have attributed to its economy, science and culture, are mentioned here. Traumatic events of the 20th century are also commemorated. The themes of modern times accords well with the relation between the synagogue and Reform Jewish Community. The European Cantors Association held the concert for their 11th Annual Convention in the Spanish Synagogue in front of a packed crowd on 19 November 2016. Arranged as a tribute to ECA Convenor, Alex Klein, the concert was led by the Tel Aviv Cantorial Institute Choir conducted by Cantor Naftali Herstik.

It is a joint project of Czech Radio, Prague Zoo and telecommunication company Visual Connection. Presented as a parody of human reality television, the objective of the broadcast is to show the behaviour of gorillas living in captivity, and the gorillas have been seen eating, sleeping, socialising, solving brain-teasers and giving birth. History Richard The project was created by Miroslav Bobek, a producer at Czech Radio, and started broadcasting on 7 November 2005. Czech Radio installed 16 cameras in the gorilla pavilion in Prague Zoo and live webcasts were placed on the project's website, broadcasting 24 hours a day. Viewers were able to vote for their favourite gorilla via SMS. On 15 January 2006 the winner, 15-year-old male Richard, won 12 melons, a pun on Czech slang that uses the word melons instead of millions when speaking about large sums of money. The show was originally intended to last for three months, but it became so popular that its producers decided to continue broadcasting, and it is still running.

Marketing Moja Although the project started as a parody of human reality shows and an educational programme, it has become an effective internet marketing strategy, attracting substantial attention from the media and the public and creating publicity for Prague Zoo. Both the zoo and the Czech Radio website have received an increased number of visitors as a result of the project. The Revealed is a multimedia project. Clips of all the webcasts since the show began are accessible via an archive on the project's website, with comments from zookeepers, primatologists, ethologists and other specialists, along with podcasts and articles about the project. The website also carries a discussion forum and blogs, one of which is maintained by the gorilla zookeeper, in which he answers questions from visitors to the website about the gorillas' lives. The show's creators have used the show to warn about gorillas becoming a critically endangered species. Money raised from merchandising, charges for SMS voting, and online auctions of paintings and photos of the Prague gorillas has been used to help wild gorillas in Africa. News about the gorillas supported in Africa is also reported on the project's website. Awards A DVD based on the show was awarded the Comenius-EduMedia 2007 award by Gesellschaft f√ºr P√§dagogik und Information. It was also awarded the Panda Award at Wildscreen Festival in 2006, in the ARKive interactive award category.

The upper reaches of valley through which the river flows is home to a portion of the only inland temperate rainforest in the world. Etymology The name \\"Incomappleux\\" is derived from the Okanagan word nk'mapeleqs, meaning \\"point at end (of lake)\\". This refers to the northeastern tip of Upper Arrow Lake into which the Incomappleux River empties. The name of the adjacent mountain is also derived from this word. History The pioneer towns of Arrowhead, Beaton, Camborne, Circle City, and Comaplix were in the area. The mines Eva, Oyster, Meridian, Silver Dollar and others were rich in silver lead ore. Course The river's course is nearly due south from its origin in the Selkirk Mountains at the southwest toe of the Illecillewaet Neve on Mount Bonney, which is on the south side of the Rogers Pass and is also the source of the Illecillewaet River. Sometimes called the Fish River, this is a wild outfall, amid large cedars, hemlock, devil's club and bears. Pope and Talbot owned the timber lease, and wanted to cut the prime cedar, there being a grove of spectacular thousand year old cedar in the area.

The population as of 2014 was recorded at 68,922 according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The city covers a total area of along the banks of the S√£o Francisco River. Its economy is based on agriculture, commerce, tourism and fishing. The current mayor is Eures Ribeiro Pereira. It is the site of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bom Jesus da Lapa. The city is home to the third largest Catholic festival in Brazil, known as the Romaria (Portuguese for \\"Procession\\" or \\"Pilgrimage\\") of Bom Jesus drawing as many as 800,000 visitors or \\"Romeiros\\" to the city annually. For this reason, the city is known as \\"Capital Baiana da F√©\\" (The Bahian Capital of Faith). Bom Jesus da Lapa is distinguished by other cities in the region by its Gothic style wall and nearby caves.  History  It is one of the older towns in Brazil being founded in 1693. It did not reach the status of city until 1953. The name means \\"Good Jesus of the Grotto.\\" This might relate to a nearby cavern that naturally had \\"church-like\\" structures so was converted to a chapel. The chapel began in the seventeenth century and is a significant pilgrimage site in Brazil.  Transportation  The city is served by Bom Jesus da Lapa Airport.

The person doing the gate crashing is known as a gate crasher. Motivations for gate crashing include but are not limited to: *Avoiding entry fees *Joining the No Fees Club *Gaining access to free food and beverages (often alcoholic) *Gaining access to a party to which one wanted to be invited *Taking photos/video of celebrities (see paparazzi) *Having photos/video taken with celebrities *Thrill seeking And more serious crimes like: *Theft *Fraud *Murder *Stalking *Kidnapping *Causing general disruptions to gain attention. Various techniques that involve blending in with the crowd can be used to gain access to some events. Various measures can be taken to prevent gate crashers from gaining access such as collecting invitations at the door and employing staff to identify potential uninvited guests, but such measures can still be thwarted by a skilled gate crasher. The first \\"how to\\" gate-crashing book, Meet the Stars, was written by Charlotte Laws in 1988. She went by the name Missy Laws at the time and details how she crashed dozens of celebrity-filled events, major award shows and even got past Secret Service to interview the president. Her story about Elvis was reprinted in Uncle John's Bathroom Reader.  Notable gate-crashing incidents  2009 White House gatecrash incident = President Barack Obama greets Michaele and Tareq Salahi (two uninvited guests) in a receiving line in the Blue Room of the White House before the state dinner with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India on 24 November 2009. On November 24, 2009, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, from Virginia, and Carlos Allen, from Washington D.C., independently gate- crashed the state dinner between President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. =2013 Australian incident= On 7 September 2013, after media reported the results of the 2013 Australian federal elections which saw the Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia Coalition, a gatecrasher and anti-coal activist gatecrashed Coalition leader and Prime Minister-designate Tony Abbott's victory speech on stage.  Wedding crashing  Wedding crashing is the act of attending a wedding celebration without an invitation, particularly when the person or persons who turn up have a profound impact. = Motivations = There are various reasons why people crash weddings. Some of the most common reasons for crashing a wedding in real life include: *To see a person they know, such as a relative, friend, or ex get married, even if they are not invited. *To come with another person who is invited whom they wish to accompany. *For something that is offered at the event, such as free catered food or alcoholic beverages. Crashing for this reason is not always cost-effective. With the high cost of the clothes required for a formal wedding (presuming one doesn't rewear them), this may out-do that of the food, which often can be obtained for less from a restaurant. *To steal money or gifts from the bride, groom, or guests. *For the thrill of deviating from mores and etiquette or for the social prestige within a peer group of defying the broader culture. *To try to \\"win back\\" the bride/groom who was a former lover and/or current romantic-interest of the crasher (such as in The Graduate and Wayne's World 2), or to cause him/her discomfort/humiliation/problems by the presence of an \\"ex\\" at his/her wedding to someone else. *To get revenge, such as if the bride or groom is an enemy of the person doing the crashing. *At celebrity weddings, crashing may occur from those who wish to mingle with the celebrities or catch paparazzi photo shots. There have also been reports of celebrities crashing the weddings of strangers they encounter. *For fun for just getting a free party to attend to and to learn new people. = Methods = Most weddings are low profile family- oriented events, and security is low, so it is not checked whether or not a person who enters belongs. With the large number of people in attendance, coupled with the fact that not everyone knows each other or the bride and groom, a well-dressed person may be able to sneak in unnoticed. Wedding planners recommend having some form of security to be sure one does not enter the reception without an invitation when the likelihood of someone crashing may be high. Some people manage to crash a wedding by entering in the middle of a ceremony or reception after all the checking has been done, or by greeting the couple and appearing to be a part of the invitee list. Some who crash do so only to eat the hors d'oeuvres. This enables the crasher to remain even more under the radar. At a sit-down reception, there is usually assigned seating by place cards, and finding a seat may be difficult, especially when there are no-shows, or when determining which seats are vacant may be difficult. Crashing only for the hors d'oeuvres enables the crasher to eat all s/he wants while blending in. Sometimes the crashing of a wedding is unintentional; this can happen when multiple weddings are held at the same venue.

Daughter of a defender of the Roman Republic of 1849, exiled to Venice after a long sentence in the papal prisons, Giuditta Tavani grew up in an environment that instilled secular and republican ideals within her. Giuditta was born in 1830 to Giustino Tavani and Adelaide Mambor, and in 1844 married Francesco Arquati (Filettino, 27 September 1810 - Rome, 25 October 1867), also a patriot she lent on him, and followed his political path. When she met her husband Francesco, Giuditta was only fourteen. She married him in 1844 in the Roman parish church of St. Crisogono (in Trastevere) and gave him nine children. With him, she moved first to Subiaco and then in 1865 to Rome.  Battle in the Ajani wool mill  In the late morning of 25 October 1867 around forty patriots, of whom twenty- five were Romans were meeting in via della Lungaretta 97, in the Roman neighborhood of Trastevere, within Giulio Ajani's wool factory. The group, who were conspiring against the government of Pope Pius IX, anticipated that a direct attack by Giuseppe Garibaldi on Rome would follow shortly after. The battle at Villa Glori on 23 October 1867 caused everyone to expect an attack and a popular uprising. Giuditta Arquati, her husband, one of their three sons, Antonio, and their comrades had gathered to prepare cartridges, restock the rifles of their arsenal, and be ready to support Garibaldi, in what they thought would be an imminent attack on Rome. At around half past twelve, a platoon of Papal Zouaves from via del Moro, the perpendicular street in Trastevere attacked the wool-mill building. The conspirators tried to resist the fire. Within a short time, however, the papal troops had the better of the situation, and managed to take the building. A few conspirators managed to escape whilst others were captured. In the fire, nine people were killed, amongst whom, Giuditta Arquati, pregnant with her fourth child, her husband and their young son. > \\"...Signora Arquati, passing from one room to the other, brought munitions > to the combatants and animated them, helped the wounded... the three hundred > enemies were three times repelled... when, after two hours, another three > hundred zuavos arrived; the struggle infuriated more than before.

The figure of Giuditta Tavani Arquati became a symbol of the struggle for the liberation of Rome and for years the inhabitants of Trastevere and their secular and republican associations commemorated the slaughter. On 9 February 1887, the 'Giuditta Tavani Arquati Democratic Association' was founded which inspired many secular and anti-clerical activities. The association was dissolved in 1925 during the Fascist years - specifically, when Mussolini embarked on his raprochment with the Catholic Church, which would culminate in the Lateran Treaty. It was re-established after the war. On the first of November 1909, piazza Romana near to the wool mill in via della Lungaretta was renamed Piazza Giuditta Tavani Arquati.

The most prominent feature is the large bay window that usually covers more than half of the front of the house, surmounted by a gable roof. The classic bay and gable is a red brick semi-detached structure that is two and a half storeys tall, though many variations also exist. It was one of the most common forms of house built in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Toronto. The older parts of the city such as Cabbagetown and Little Italy are still home to many hundreds of examples. The style was well suited to the layout of the city and the tastes of Torontonians. Old Toronto was laid out with very long and narrow lots, usually only 13 to wide. The tall narrow bay-and-gable house was ideally suited to this environment. High ceilings and large windows allowed light to still reach the depths of the house. Toronto architectural tastes in this era were dominated by the various Victorian Revival styles, especially Gothic Revival. The steep roofs and sharp vertical lines of the bay-and-gable imitated the Gothic style in a way that was affordable to middle class homeowners. For homeowners who wanted more ornamentation, the gables and large windows both provided areas that could be elaborately decorated. Stained glass windows are common in bay-and-gables, as are bargeboards running along the gables and terracotta tiles with ornamental motifs and designs. In some cases, only the front of the house would be given a brick fa√ßade in order to save money, with the back and sides done in siding. The style was also very flexible. The typical bay-and-gable house was made out of brick, but ones made completely out of wood were also easily produced. Bay- and-gable houses were most often built as semi-detached buildings, but the basic design could also easily be modified into a stand-alone or row house format and many examples of both exist in Toronto. There are many variations on the bay-and-gable found in Toronto. One of the most common simplifications on the style is to replace the bay window with a flat wall. The style faded as modernism was embraced in the years after the Second World War. It still remains popular among Toronto residents. In older areas of the city several new infill projects have been built in the bay-and-gable style. In the northeastern suburb of Markham, there are subdivisions filled with bay-and- gable houses modified to incorporate a two car garage.Marchand, Philip. \\"Back to the future.\\" Toronto Star.
