Debate over the issue's significance Scientists remain uncertain about the existence and degree of pain in invertebrates, including insects. Nonetheless, insect welfare is being taken increasingly seriously in laboratory settings. Vincent Wigglesworth suggested a precautionary approach of anaesthetizing insects during potentially painful procedures. John Cooper has written about techniques for \\"Anesthesia, analgesia, and euthanasia of invertebrates\\" including insects. Neil A. C. Bennie and colleagues proposed a method for chemical euthanasia of insects and other terrestrial arthropods. Some authors have begun extending discussions of insect welfare beyond the laboratory to the domain of raising insects for food. The Dutch Animal Act, which went into effect on 1 January 2013, created a regulatory framework for farm-animal welfare based on the five freedoms, and the law specifically lists a number of insect species as \\"production animals\\" whose wellbeing needs to be respected. Dutch politician Marianne Thieme asked a series of questions suggesting concern that insect farming would multiply the number of animals farmed and killed for human consumption. Robert Nathan Allen of the pro- entomophagy organization Little Herds feels that the welfare of insects is important, though he believes well managed farms can maintain high standards of care. Some entomophagy suppliers highlight the importance of humane insect treatment. For instance, World Ento uses the name \\"Good Karma Killing\\" to describe its process of freezing insects into a statis state. A 2013 FAO report on \\"Edible insects\\" includes a section encouraging high standards of welfare in entomophagy operations, despite uncertainty about whether insects can suffer. Others feel that considering the wellbeing of farmed insects is going too far. Rhys Southan suggests that even most vegans do not care a lot about insects, but that \\"Insects are to animal rights what Larry Flynt is to the First Amendment ‚Äì you have to uphold their rights even if you don‚Äôt want to, or the whole thing falls apart.\\" He goes on to propose satirical slogans that insect-rights activists might use against entomophagy.  Welfare considerations for rearing  Because there is little standardized protocol for insect rearing, most farmers learn the best production methods by trial and error. For instance, if they kill an insect colony by setting the temperature too high, they avoid doing that in the future. Most breeders keep their techniques secret in order to avoid having them copied by other farms. Because there are so many types of insects, it is not feasible to devise a single protocol for their treatment. Case-by-case understanding is required. = Disease = When viruses infect an insect-rearing facility, they spread rapidly and kill most of the insects. Humans can spread diseases to farmed insects. Thus, sanitation is very important, and only farm staff should have access to the insects. For instance, the company Van de Ven had a pathogen outbreak that killed all of its Zophobas morio worms, and the breeders hypothesized that the disease may have been brought by human visitors. Giving insects a heat gradient may sometimes help prevent disease because behavioral thermoregulation can suppress pathogens. = Humidity = Walter Jansen's Jagran company raises housefly larvae for use as animal feed. Humidity needs to be carefully controlled to avoid dehydrating or drowning the insects. = Temperature = Insects are poikilothermic, but maintaining an adequate temperature range remains important. For example, mealworms thrive best when living close together, but this can lead to overheating if temperature is not controlled. = Cannibalism = Some insects like locusts begin eating each other when they become overcrowded or malnourished. Adequate space and nutrition are important to prevent this.  Slaughter methods  =Developing world= Entomophagy is common in many developing countries, such as Thailand and Mexico. Usually killing is done without euthanasia. For instance: Chapulines at Tepoztl√°n's market, near Mexico City. * Termites are either eaten alive directly where they're found or are brought home to be roasted over coals or fried. * Cicadas are boiled, fried, or saut√©ed. * Water bugs may be eaten whole, steamed, fried, or roasted and canned. * Scorpions are skewered alive and fried in oil. * Tarantulas are fried in oil or roasted over a fire. In Silveiras, Brazil, residents pluck the wings off ants and then either fry them or dip them in chocolate. In Thailand, crickets are gathered fresh in the morning and then fried. =Industrial farms= Little research has been done on humane methods of killing insects for consumption. The most common killing methods used by entomophagy companies in the Netherlands are freezing and dry-freezing (i.e., freezing and reducing pressure in order to extract water from the insects). Protix Biosystems kills its black soldier flies by shredding, since its end product is a powder. Death takes less than a second. Tarique Arsiwalla at Protix said shredding makes sense because Western consumers are more likely to accept powdered insects than whole insects. The Jagran company has tried asphyxiation, cooling, freeze-drying, boiling, and shredding. Managing Director Walter Jansen believes that shredding is most humane. The Kreca company kills its animal-feed insects by putting them into a fridge or freeze-drying them. Insects destined for human consumption are first sterilized in hot water and then are refrigerated or freeze-dried. FAO's \\"Edible insects\\" report suggests: \\"Insect-killing methods that would reduce suffering include freezing or instantaneous techniques such as shredding.\\" Freezing While freezing is sometimes said to be a humane way to kill certain arthropods, others dispute this. According to \\"AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals,\\" freezing is \\"not considered to be humane\\" when not preceded by another form of anesthesia. The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) Terrestrial Invertebrate Working Group (TIWG) reports on a survey conducted by Mark Bushell of BIAZA institutions. He found that refrigeration and freezing were the most common methods \\"of euthanasia of invertebrates although research has suggested that this is probably one of the least ethical options.\\" That said, freezing is a worst-case method if chemical or instantaneous physical destruction is not possible. =Hobbyist entomophagy= Some \\"how to\\" guides for eating insects make no mention of freezing or other euthanasia methods. For example, Miles Olson recommends * suffocating or roasting ants * decapitating, gutting, and then stewing, roasting, or saut√©ing slugs * steaming and slicing snails * frying, roasting, toasting, suffocating, or drowning crickets * drowning, squeezing, and then stir frying or stewing earthworms * eating aphids raw and so on. The website Insects Are Food suggests refrigerating insects to slow them down without killing them, prior to boiling or otherwise cooking them. Other guides recommend freezing first. Timothy Ferriss recounts what he observed when roasted his insects without freezing them first: \\"Suffice it to say, merely sedated crickets make horrible noises if you roast them, and the visual is far, far worse. Do yourself a favor and freeze them.\\" =Live insect feed= Sometimes insects are not killed by farming companies but are sold live, for consumption by fish and pets. 95% of the Kreca company's insects are sold live. Of the 1500 kg per week of mealworms produced by the Van de Ven company, most are sold as live feed. Many suppliers of insects for reptiles offer live bugs and worms. Monitor lizards are typically fed live insects and may not eat pre-killed ones. Amphibians typically require live insects‚Äîwild-caught, home- grown, or bought at a pet store‚Äîalthough some like axolotls can be fed chunks of meat. It's generally hard to convert reptiles and amphibians that eat insects to pre-killed prey, though some pet owners can feed dead insects by moving or dangling them. Bearded dragons can be fed dead crickets by hiding them in other food, dangling them with tongs, squirting them with water, or vibrating a bowl. Pet spiders, praying mantids, and other insectivorous bugs typically require live food. Hedgehogs can be fed live, freeze-dried, or canned insects. Live worms and insects are commonly used as fishing bait, with the result that they are either eaten alive by fish or drowned.  Farmed insects not used for protein  Many vegans avoid honey and silk because these require insect farming, even though the insects are not eaten. Silk production involves boiling silk worms alive in their cocoons. The red pigment carmine is produced from powdered bodies of scale insects, so some vegans avoid it. Shellac is produced from a resin secreted by the lac bug on specific trees in Asia. In addition to its use in industry, shellac is incorporated into some fruits, coffee beans, and candies as confectioner's glaze. Some vegans avoid confectioner's glaze because lac bugs may be killed during shellac production. Lac used to produce red dye may be even more injurious to lac bugs because while shellac comes from lac-bug secretions, lac dye's color comes from the insect bodies themselves.

It covers an area of and is situated along the coastal road between Accra and Tema in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. It is about west of Tema. Activities ongoing within the Ramsar Site include farming, fishing, recreation, urban and industrial development.  Ramsar Site  Sakumo wetlands was proposed as a Ramsar Site in 1987. In 1992 it was gazetted as a Ramsar Site by which time about one third of the area originally proposed had been used by settlement development.  Lagoon  The size of the open lagoon varies from depending on the season. In the rainy season it expands and shrinks in the dry season. Large portions of the lagoon dry up in the dry season, resulting in hyper-saline conditions. The lagoon is separated from the sea by a narrow road, connecting Accra and Tema. A small permanent connection to the sea is established by an open sluice, constructed to prevent flooding of the coastal road in the past. = Flora = The flood-plain is periodically inundated and the flooded areas are largely devoid of vegetation. There are also areas of freshwater marsh and coastal savanna grassland, the latter composed mainly of Sesuvium portulacastrum with various grass species associations. Land-use in the catchment includes rice, cassava, and vegetable cultivation. = Fauna =  Fishes  The lagoon has surface area and defined as semi-closed because of its permanent, but limited interaction with the sea. Sixteen fish species or genera were found in the lagoon. Four groups of fishes emerged: * Fresh water fishes occurring only during the rainy season (e.g. Clarias gariepinus) * Permanent inhabitants of the lagoon (e.g. Sarotherodon melanotheron) * Juvenile stages of marine fishes swimming into the lagoon after the rainy season (e.g. Mugil cephalus) * Marine fishes coming for short incursions into the lagoon (e.g. Lutjanus fulgens) The lagoon is heavily over-fished resulting in reduced catch over the years.  Avifauna  Past records have registered over seventy waterbird species at the site with about 30,000 birds. The common species are Charadrius hiaticula, Chlidonias niger, Egretta garzetta, E. gularis, Sterna hirundo, S. sandvicensi and Tringa erythropus. Some breeding waterbirds include Glareola pratincola, Charadrius pecuarius and S. albifrons. The Black heron (E. ardesiaca) is considered sacred and protected by local taboos.  Marine Turtle  Species of marine turtle that were previously recorded nesting on the beach are Lepidochelys olivacea, Chelonia mydas and Dermochelys coriacea.  Conservation Issues  The area which was designated in 1992, currently has portions taken over by land developers (urban and industrial). The area has one of the highest urban growth-rates within the coastal zone. Sewage and domestic waste from the catchment, also threatens the lagoon. The spread of urbanization continues and if not stopped the entire catchment will be destroyed. The area has high educational and recreational value as one of the green areas left in the Accra-Tema Metropolitan Area. The lagoon is regarded as a fetish by the indigenous people of Tema, New Town. During the dry season (August to March), a larger part of the lagoon dries up. The area is encroached upon by cattle which graze in the dry season and land developers who build very close to the site which is a government properly and should not be used by any developer. There is a Biodiversity Conservation and Local Community Development Project to rehabilitate degraded areas and conserve the biodiversity within the Sakumo Ramsar Site.  Rehabilitation of site  The Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission is the government agency responsible for the area. The Environmental Protection Agency-Ghana and the United Nation Environment Programme initiated an afforestation project of planting trees in the wetland area using treated waste water as a way of reforesting and conserving the degraded areas. Others are Sakumo Ramsar Conservation and Resource Users Association and the Friends of Ramsar Sites. The surrounding communities such as Klagon, Sakumono and Nungua are protecting the site.Environmental Protection Agency (2014).

Investigations in organic matter interactions with clay minerals led to the development of the idea of dual mode bonding in which amphipathic molecules interact with substrates by both hydrophobic- hydrophobic and hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions. Laird et al. (2008) showed that smectites, a class of clay minerals found in soil, can adsorb tremendous amounts of organic materials and, hence, strongly influence the transport and bioavailability of organic materials including pesticides applied to the soil.Laird, D.A., Chappell, M.A., Martens, M.A., Wershaw, R.L., and Thompson, M.L. 2008.

Growth of the village followed a typical pattern for rural New Hampshire towns, based in this case around the growth in the early 19th century of the paper industry, which continues to be a significant economic force in the community. The district is centered on the junctions of Main, Center, and School Streets with Bible Hill Road and Francestown Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The area that is now Bennington Village was settled in the 18th century as part of Hancock, and was originally known as \\"Hancock Factory\\". Around 1782, Joseph Putnam established a sawmill and gristmill, and built a bridge across the Contoocook River, the power for his mills and those to come. The village developed as an independent industrial center, and was incorporated as Bennington out of Hancock and portions of other towns in 1842. In those years, additional dams were built on the river, and a cotton mill and a paper mill were established. In the second half of the 19th century, the manufacture of cutlery arose as a significant economic endeavor. By the mid-20th century, papermaking had come to dominate, and now the only major surviving mill building is associated with that industry. The historic district is located mainly on the east bank of the Contoocook River, extending from a dam south of the bridge northward to the Monadnock Mills paper plant on the northern edge of the village. A central island of buildings is formed by Cross Street, Main Street, and New Hampshire Route 31, from which the village radiates along a number of main roads, which either lead to neighboring towns or parallel the river banks. The village includes all of the town's major civic buildings, including its town hall and library, as well as its first cemetery. Industrial resources include five dams on the river, as well as a power station from the early 20th century, which provided the first streetlights in the region.

EAD is also committed to ensuring that environmental protection, regulation and natural resources conservation are a high priority on the UAE's national agenda. As such, the agency provides direction for government, businesses and the community to commit to environmental considerations without compromising on Abu Dhabi's development.  Mission  To protect and conserve the environment for people's well-being and a better life for all.  Vision  Towards a sustainable environment for a sustainable future.  History  In 1989, the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) was established as a world-class conservation, research and captive breeding organisation in Abu Dhabi. This was the foundation upon which EAD was built. At the time, the agency was known as the Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency (ERWDA). The aim of ERWDA, which was established with Law No. 4 of 1996, was to protect Abu Dhabi Emirate's natural environment, wildlife and biodiversity through comprehensive research and cooperation with other government bodies. In 2005, H.H Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, passed Law No. 16 of 2005 that restructured the competent authority for the environment in Abu Dhabi. ERWDA in the same year became known as the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) and was chaired by the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, H.H Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Law No. 16 of 2005 with regards to the restructuring of EAD stated that the agency remains an independent regulatory body and is the responsible authority for environmental and wildlife issues in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, while working towards a more sustainable future. The law also specified that all government departments and agencies are required to coordinate and cooperate with the agency on issues related to research, studies and programmes concerning the environment and wildlife. The agency's objectives are specified in Law No. (16) of 2005 pertaining to the Reorganization of the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency.  Leadership  The Environment Agency ‚Äì Abu Dhabi (EAD) is chaired by H.H Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler's Representative in the Al Dhafra Region of Abu Dhabi Emirate. The Vice Chairman is H.E Mohamed Ahmed Al Bowardi. H.E Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, is the Managing Director and Board Member. The Secretary General is H.E. Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri and the Deputy Secretary General is H.E. Dr. Jaber Eidha Al Jaberi.  5 Core Pillars  EAD has five core pillars that outlines its efforts towards conserving the land, air and water environment, leading research, raising awareness in the community and regulating policy and legislation. 1\\\\. Conserving nature and biodiversity The legacy of EAD is founded on protecting biodiversity and natural ecosystems. As part of its mandate, EAD ensures effective and evidence-based planning and regulation for Abu Dhabi's biodiversity. Achievements include: ‚Ä¢ Leading the world's most ambitious mammalian species reintroduction programme by releasing Scimitar- horned Oryx, previously extinct in the wild, back to their homeland in Chad. ‚Ä¢ Establishing the Sheikh Zayed Protected Areas Network that is made up of 19 terrestrial and marine protected areas that the agency manages. ‚Ä¢ Successfully recording 100 invertebrate species previously unknown in the Emirate and discovering nine insect species that are new to science. ‚Ä¢ Expanding the understanding of the emirate's fish stocks through the Sustainable Fisheries Programme with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment and publishing the UAE National Framework of Sustainable Fisheries 2019 ‚Äì 2030. ‚Ä¢ For the first time in 35 years, the agency captured the Arabian Caracal on a remote sensing camera in Jabal Hafit National Park in Al Ain in 2019 ‚Ä¢ Tracking and tagging over 80 birds including the Greater Flamingo using a globally recognised satellite-tracking programme. 2\\\\. Promoting a clean, healthy and safe environment EAD believes that the well-being of the community is one of their fundamental responsibilities. To achieve this EAD is responsible for: Combatting climate change: EAD improves data collection and information on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, while working with partners to establish clear policies and regulations to manage emissions. Monitoring air quality: EAD works to protect the air by continuously monitoring air quality and strengthening its legal, regulatory and enforcement framework. Monitoring marine water quality: EAD's role in safeguarding marine water quality includes long-term monitoring, developing regulations and policies as well as working with the federal government to ensure its proper management. Waste Management': Improving waste management in Abu Dhabi is one of EAD's key priorities. It develop policies, regulations and guidelines to promote waste reduction and increase opportunities for reuse, recycling and resource recovery. Regulating groundwater: EAD's role is to regulate groundwater in different development sectors and tighten enforcement on illegal groundwater wells drilling, abstraction and selling. 3\\\\. Using data and science to monitor and innovate EAD leads all its projects and initiatives with evidence-based decision-making tools. The agency utilises a range of expertise inside and outside of the organisation in order to evaluate and assess the optimal environmental conditions of Abu Dhabi. The requirements of the community, industries, and habitats are all evaluated in parallel with the Emirate's development. EAD uses scientific expertise, on-the-ground research and global best practices to study the large amounts of information on environmental conditions to maintain and continually improve the fine balance in the Emirate. As a result, EAD is able to guide through policy and directly influence change in Abu Dhabi. 4\\\\. Regulating and directing policy with transparency EAD leverages innovation, research and international best practices to strengthen and enforce environmental laws. To date, EAD has achieved the following: ‚Ä¢ Eltezam campaign has helped in preventing or reducing the negative impact of urbanisation on the environment, by ensuring compliance to local environmental laws, international standards and best practice. ‚Ä¢ For climate change mitigation, EAD has continued to strengthen legislation to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to its impact. ‚Ä¢ The banning of gargour, a traditional fishing method was a landmark decision that EAD influenced. 5\\\\. Raising environmental awareness EAD works towards it goals through informing, inspiring and influencing the community through engagement. It also places a great emphasis upon the role of future generations as citizens in the community who have a significant role to play in protecting the environment. EAD's aim is to help educate, equip, empower and inspire the next generation in order to realise an environmentally sustainable future. Its programmes are supported by the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge. EAD designs, develops and supports the roll-out of structured, systematic and award-winning environmental education programmes in schools and universities. These programmes help improve the capabilities of relevant stakeholders to deliver environmental education and help bring about behaviour change through effective local partnerships. These include its Sustainable Schools Initiative, the Annual Enviro-Spellathon, and the Sustainable Campus Initiative. The Agency also focuses on supporting the business and government sector and seeks to raise their awareness of environmental issues facing Abu Dhabi Emirate and promote a sense of shared responsibility across business and government.  Key Achievements  Plastic Policy In March 2019, EAD announced a new policy to reduce single-use plastic materials in Abu Dhabi, mitigating its harmful effects. The comprehensive policy, which is the first-of-its-kind in the region, aims to keep single-use plastics out of the environment and eliminate the use of avoidable single-use plastic and non-plastic materials by 2021 through fostering a culture of recycling and re-use and encouraging more sustainable practices in the community. One of the key aspects of EAD's policy is focused on making Abu Dhabi Emirate free of single-use plastic bags by 2021 and ensuring that single-use plastic materials are no longer used by government organisations in Abu Dhabi. The scope of the policy includes developing regulations to limit the use of targeted single use plastics in Abu Dhabi gradually with a phased approach with incentives to target consumption of single use plastic bags through fees and then banning them, introduce fees on single use plastics with available sustainable alternatives and prevent free distribution of such items to the end user. Sustainable Fisheries Programme From its early beginnings, EAD has played a key role in the management of Abu Dhabi's fisheries and the gathering of scientific data to monitor fish stocks. EAD collaborated with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) to develop the UAE's first National Fisheries Information System and launched the UAE Sustainable Fisheries Programme in 2015, to preserve fish for future generations. A national framework for sustainable fisheries, was launched in 2019 which outlined measures to conserve and replenish fish stock and rehabilitate marine habitats through the installation of artificial reefs. The UAE National Framework for Sustainable Fisheries 2019-2030 also recommended the development of robust aquaculture research and programmes to support fish stock improvement. Oryx Reintroduction Programmes The Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Arabian Oryx Reintroduction Programme began in the Arabian Oryx Protected Area in 2007. Focusing on the Arabian Oryx and Scimitar-horned Oryx, EAD reintroduced these species back into their native habitats after being declared extinct in the wild. As a result, the growing number of Arabian Oryx across the range states in the Arabian Peninsula led to the species being downlisted from ‚Äòendangered‚Äô to ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô on the ‚ÄòRed List‚Äô of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2011. Supported by the Crown Prince's Court, the Scimitar-horned Oryx Reintroduction Programme saw EAD enter into a partnership with the Government of Chad, the Sahara Conservation Fund, The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, The Zoological Society of London and The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The plan of the programme was to establish a self-sustaining herd of around 500 animals into its traditional homeland in the Ouadi Rim√©Ouadi Achim Game Reserve in Chad over a period of five years. The first shipment of Oryx arrived in Chad in March 2016. By the end of 2019, the programme had translocated nearly 200 animals from Abu Dhabi to Chad, and later released in to the wild. The animals in the release programme have also begun to breed successfully, with over 60 healthy oryx calves born in Chad by 2019. Sheikh Zayed Protected Areas Network The Sheikh Zayed Protected Areas Network network encompasses 19 protected areas in total, containing some of Abu Dhabi's most critical marine and terrestrial habitats. Six of the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) represent 13.90% of the total marine natural habitats, and 13 Terrestrial Protected Areas (TPAs) cover 16.98% of Abu Dhabi's land mass. Other areas that are protected include Marawah Marine Biosphere, the region's first UNESCO - designated marine reserve, and Al Wathba Wetland Reserve, a Ramsar site which is a site that is of international importance according to the Ramsar Convention - a convention for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. It is also on the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. Liwa Strategic Water Reserve Developed in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority, at the time, and now operated by TRANSCO, The Liwa Strategic Water Reserve is a reliable reservoir of fresh groundwater that can be recovered and used in emergencies. The reserve currently stores 27 million cubic metres of desalinated water. The project includes a 160-kilometre pipeline that connects the water reserve site in the Liwa desert, on the border with Saudi Arabia, to a distribution network in Abu Dhabi city.  Offices  The Environment Agency ‚Äì Abu Dhabi (EAD) has its main headquarters in the city of Abu Dhabi, with an office in Al Ain city and in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi Emirate. EAD has an extensive customer service network, with 11 branches across the Emirate.

With a construction history dating to the early 19th century, it is an architecturally important example of how traveler accommodations changed in rural New Hampshire in the 19th century. The inn has been identified as \\"The Birchwood\\" since 1892, and was the town's only public accommodation for most of the 19th century. The building, still in use as a restaurant and inn, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Birchwood Inn is located in Temple's central village, on the east side of NH 45, at its junction with General Miller Highway. Its main building is a 2¬Ω story, roughly rectangular, brick and wood frame structure. The front half of the building, its five-bay width and about half of each side wall, are faced in brick, while the rear of the block is framed in wood and sheathed in clapboards. A single-story porch extends across the front and wraps around the sides, supported by chamfered square columns. Walls on some of its interior spaces were painted by muralist Rufus Porter, and it retains a well-preserved period taproom. This block is connected by an ell to a barn-like structure (built c. 1847-48), which was used for stabling horses on the ground level and has a large open hall above. The early construction history of the building is not known. Based on its style, the inn was built during the Federal period (roughly 1790-1830), and has served as a center of hospitality ever since. The building has historically been used for town meetings and other civic and social events, serving as the town post office and general store. The expansion in 1847-48 made it possible to expand the establishment's entertainment offerings, with a sprung wooden floor in the second-floor ballroom. The front porch was added in 1892, when it was purchased by new owners and converted into a boarding house catering to tourists. Its amenities were further updated in the 1930s to include inside plumbing and electricity.

According to prof. Justus van der Kroef there were about forty Indonesian communists staying in Tirana in the early 1970s, around half of them organized in the Persatuan Peladjar Indonesia ('Indonesian Students Association'). The Tirana-based group often acted as spokespersons of the party. Establishment According to Ruth McVey the establishment of Tirana as a hub for PKI exiles began with the 5th congress of the Party of Labour of Albania (PPSh) in November 1966. The PKI delegation at the congress was led by Jusuf Adjitorop, a candidate member of the PKI politburo before the coup. Now he headed the PKI Delegation in Beijing, having survived the purge of PKI by being in China for medical treatment prior to the coup. In his address to the Albanian party congress, Adjitorop called for the reconstruction of PKI under the banner of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Mao Tse-Tung Thought, calling for protracted armed struggle of the peasantry to overthrow the rule of Suharto and Nasution. Following the Albanian party congress Tirana became the main centre the pro- Chinese wing of PKI in exile, rather than Beijing. The dominant view is that neither the Chinese government nor the PKI wished that the party would be perceived as too closely linked to China. Another key factor was that Tirana was geographically close to other hubs of exiled Indonesian student activists across Eastern Europe. Notably the PKI had opted not to condemn the Albanian party at the 1961 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow. Publishing activities An English-language bimonthly journal, Indonesian Tribune, was issued from Tirana. The publishing house of Indonesian Tribune was called Indonesia Progresif ('Indonesian Progressive').

Indonesian Tribune and Api Pemuda Indonesia were the two main organs of the pro-Chinese wing of PKI. These publications were illegal inside Indonesia, and one could be arrested for possessing a copy. They were distributed by mail to Indonesia, posted from non-communist states (in particular via the Netherlands). By the late 1970s, circulation of these organs had dropped significantly.

He was elected scholar on 3 April 1818, minor fellow on 2 October 1820, and major fellow on 2 July 1823. He graduated B.A. in 1820, and M.A. in 1823. While at Cambridge he became connected with the British and Foreign Bible Society, and acted for some years as its librarian. Platt was one of the earliest members of the Royal Asiatic Society, and sat on its oriental translation committee. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He lived for many years at Child's Hill, Hampstead, dying at Dulwich Hill in Surrey, on 31 October 1852. He left an only son, Francis Thomas Platt. Works In 1823 Platt published a catalogue of Ethiopian biblical manuscripts in the Royal Library of Paris and in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society; and in succeeding years collated and edited for the Society texts of the New Testament. He made notes of the readings which particularly struck, in the Gospels; for the Acts and the Epistles he used only one manuscript and Brian Walton's text. In 1829 he also prepared an edition of the Syriac Gospels, and in 1844 edited an Amharic version of the Bible, using the translation of Abba Rukh for the Old Testament, and that of Abu Rumi Habessinus for the New. In 1827 Platt defended the British and Foreign Bible Society from an attack made on their publications in the Quarterly Review. In 1840, in a Letter to Dr. Pusey, he described his conversion from evangelical opinions to Tractarian views. He objected, however, to some of the Tractarian interpretations of the prophecies in the Old Testament.

Built in 1832, it is the only of the town's three such buildings to survive, and was the only one made of brick. It is also the only school building now standing in the town, since its students have been schooled in neighboring Peterborough since 1920. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Brick Schoolhouse is located in a rural setting of central Sharon, on the east side of Route 123 north of its junction with Mountain Road. It is set on a grassy rise above the road. It is a single-story structure wide and long, with a gabled roof. The main facade faces south, and has the main entrance at its center, flanked by short transom-like fixed windows. The side walls each have two sash windows. The interior is divided into two sections, with an entry vestibule deep, and the schoolroom occupying the rest of the building. The original wooden desks still occupy their places. The school was built in 1832, after another district school located nearby was destroyed by fire. As it was the second on that site to suffer that fate, the town decided to build the third school out of brick. It was one of three district schools the town built during the 19th century, and remained in use as a school until 1920, when the town began sending its students to Peterborough. The building has continued to serve municipal purposes, seeing uses as a town meeting site, polling place, and town records repository.

Early years  John English was born in Dudley, West Midlands, on 13 January 1911. Son of Bertie and Emeline English; along with his sister, Muriel May and his brother, Bill. He was educated at Dudley Grammar School until 1923 when the family moved to the Wylde Green area of Birmingham, where he went on to attend Bishop Vesey's Grammar School leaving aged 16. From a young age he was introduced to the arts and the theatre by both of his parents and would appear in numerous amateur theatre productions. It was here where he developed his craft and a keen eye for detail as both a director and as an actor. In 1929, English began work as an industrial chemist at the Chance Brothers glassmakers, Smethwick, West Midlands. He later became the firm's production manager and stayed there for 20 years. In 1934, he married Doris Holt (a fellow Highbury member), who then became Mrs Peta English. The couple divorced in 1959, the same year in which he married Alicia \\"Mollie\\" Randle. He retired from industry in 1948, aged just 40, to devote himself full-time to the theatre. Shortly after retiring he went on to found the Arena Theatre Company along with his new wife.  Highbury Theatre  In 1924, English's father helped set up the Erdington ILP Play-reading Circle. When the circle began putting on plays they rehearsed in the English's house; called Highbury (from which they later took their name when the ILP chose to rename themselves the Highbury Players). With his father directing the first few productions, a 14-year-old English acted as stage manager. From its conception, English was one of the most prominent founding members of the then, Highbury Little Theatre (latterly Highbury Theatre). He took over from his father as director of the Highbury Players aged just 17 and later went on to become the theatre's first arts director in 1942. It was in 1929 that he directed his first full- length play, a modern-dress version of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. It was in his position as arts director in which he helped to create and establish many of the features, rules and traditions that are still used by the theatre to this day. He also served as architect and supervised the building of the entire theatre from scratch and did so for all subsequent alterations over the next 10 years. His quote of \\"a good theatre never stands still\\" is still the mantra that the theatre stands by, only highlighting his impact and influence on the building and its members. His last role at the theatre was in 1947 in A Month in the Country. He retired from the position of arts director in 1963. During his time at the theatre he directed and co- directed more than 100 productions.  Arena Theatre Company  In 1948, he founded the Arena Theatre Company, which was a small, professional touring company which aimed to explore and develop how to introduce theatre to young people. Additionally they strived to provide theatre to areas in both the city and across the country where theatre was less prominent, thus bringing it to the masses. As well as experimenting with new, different forms of theatre and presentation, they would perform \\"under canvas\\" (a circus tent) in the summer and with the help of the Arts Council they was able to take performing arts to places that were without a theatre. English's wife, Mollie Randle later mentioned in an interview that the Arena Theatre's main practice was \\"of touring Birmingham parks in the summer and halls around the country in the winter, the theatre performed a range of popular plays and classics for adults and children's plays\\". The first performance took place in Pype Hayes Park in August 1948, and their second in Sparkhill Park. They performed every summer in Cannon Hill Park from 1949 to 1961. However, in 1961 the company dissolved as the idea of a Midlands Arts Centre began to become a reality and they would return to Cannon Hill Park bigger than ever.  Midlands Arts Centre  In 1960, English along with Mollie Randle and Councillor Sir Frank Price composed a proposal for the creation of an arts centre in the city of Birmingham which they delivered to the members of the City Council. Between the three of them, they lobbied Birmingham City Council to assist them in their ambitious idea; to which in 1962, the council approved their proposal and responded with a substantial largesse; they donated a site in Cannon Hill Park for the sole use of the MAC; the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People was born. The English's were heavily active in the amateur theatre scene within the city and as a result of the Arena Theatre Company and their experiences during their time there in promoting the arts to a younger generation, in which the concept and ideals of a permanent arts centre became apparent. It would be a place to allow younger people to experience a wider range of art forms as well as their practises and traditions. Building work was completed in the mid-1960s with the two small theatres and the studios making up what was now called the Midlands Arts Centre, making it the first centre of its kind in Britain. John English featured in a short Central Office of Information documentary in 1969 titled; The Pacemakers, where he discussed the origins of the MAC, and its ever-changing programme. After 16 years at the helm, he retired from his role of director of the MAC in 1976.  Later years  In his later years, English began to reduce his workload, but he still remained a prominent figure within the places he had founded and cultivated. His opinion was always sought on matters involving his beloved theatres and sat on the numerous boards of trustees up until his death. He directed his last production at Highbury Theatre in 1992, where he staged his own version of Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters.  Death  English died on 20 December 1998, after recent years of ill health, at the age of 87 at Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield. He asked that after his death, in lieu of flowers; donations should be made to Highbury Theatre or the Midlands Arts Centre; these being two of the main cornerstones of his life. His portrait hangs in the foyer of Highbury Theatre as a reminder of his devotion to the theatre and to the promotion of the arts, be it amateur or professional, in the city of Birmingham.

It was preceded by the 2008 election and was followed by the 2017 election. Plaid Cymru won 28 seats whilst Labour and the Independents won 23 each. The main feature of the election was a Labour recovery in the Llanelli area, and to some extent in the Gwendraeth and Ammanford area also, mainly at the expense of Independent candidates. Plaid Cymru lost ground to Labour in the Llanelli area but gained seats elsewhere, becoming the largest party. An Independent-Labour coalition was again formed, but with Labour as the leading partner. As a result, Kevin Madge replaced Meryl Gravell as the leader of the council. Madge resigned as leader of the council in May 2015, having lost the leadership of the Labour group. Two days later it was announced that Plaid Cymru would from a coalition with the Independents. Emlyn Dole was elected leader of the council. Results Overview No Overall Control (unchanged) }  Ward Results =Abergwili (one seat)= =Ammanford (one seat)= Deian Harries had come within six votes of victory for Plaid Cymru in 2008. The sitting Labour member, Hugh Evans, a member of the authority since its formation in 1995, stood down and Plaid Cymru captured the seat. =Betws (one seat)= Labour, which had held the seat from 1995 until 2008, came from third place to recapture Betws with a new candidate =Bigyn (two seats)= Labour, having held all seats in Bigyn from 1995 until 2008, regained both on a low turnout. Eryl Morgan was previously county councillor for Hengoed. =Burry Port (two seats)= Pat Jones, a member of the authority since 1999, was re- elected alongside another Labour candidate who narrowly ousted the sitting Independent member, who had served since 2004. The Conservative candidate had stood as a Liberal Democrat in 1999. =Bynea (one seat)= On a very low turnout, Labour came from third place to take a seat held by the Independent candidate, a member of the cabinet, since 2004. =Carmarthen Town North (two seats)= Plaid Cymru again held both seats, for the third successive election. =Carmarthen Town South (two seats)= Plaid Cymru held both seats in this ward for the first time, unseating an Independent member who had served for one term. Jeffrey Thomas had represented Carmarthen North from 2004 until 2008. =Carmarthen Town West (two seats)= Plaid Cymru completed a clean sweep of all seats in Carmarthen Town by ousting Arthur Davies, a leading figure in People First, former Labour councillor and a member of the authority since 1999. =Cenarth (one seat)= Hazel Evans had captured the seat in a by-election following the death of the previous Independent member, Haydn Jones. =Cilycwm (one seat)= Tom Theophilus, who had represented the area for decades narrowly held the seat against one of the most prominent opponents of the previous administration and a leading critic of Mark James, the Chief Executive of the Council. =Cynwyl Elfed (one seat)= Irfon Jones had represented Newchurch from 1995 until 1999 but was defeated by Dorrien Thomas when the enlarged Cynwyl Elfed ward was created following boundary changes. Thomas retired at this election and Jones won a narrow victory over Plaid Cymru. =Cynwyl Gaeo (one seat)= Eirwyn Williams, a member of the authority since 1995, was comfortably re-elected. =Dafen (one seat)= Labour won by a large majority although Plaid Cymru's vote may have been affected by the decision of their former candidate, Clem Thomas, to stand for People First. =Elli (one seat)= One-time Conservative John Paul Jenkins was returned for a third term with a much increased majority in a seat which has traditionally changed hands on a regular basis. The Liberal Democrats who once held the seat failed to field a candidate. =Felinfoel (one seat)= The sitting member, first elected in 2004, held his seat against the former Labour member who was elected in 1995 and 1999. =Garnant (one seat)= Labour's leader on the authority increased his majority. =Glanamman (one seat)= The sitting Plaid member, who gained the seat in 2008, increased his majority. =Glanymor (two seats)= In a ward that returned only Labour councillors from 1995 until 2008, Winston Lemon held his seat for Plaid Cymru and Labour regained the second seat from the Independents. David Tucker, a Labour councillor before 2008 and Keith Skivington, who stood in 2008 for Plaid Cymru, both contested the election as Independents which made the contest more unpredictable. =Glyn (one seat)= Jim Jones, the representative since 1999, won by a large margin. =Gorslas (two seats)= Terry Davies, the member since 2004, held one seat but the second seat was captured by Plaid Cymru, their first success in the ward.

Plaid also lost the second seat to Labour in a closely fought contest. =Kidwelly (one seat)= Labour strengthened the hold on a seat won against the tide in 2008. =Laugharne Township (one seat)= Jane Tremlett had held the seat since 2004 and held on by a large majority as there was no Conservative candidate as was the case in 2008. =Llanboidy (one seat)= Roy Llewellyn had been a county councillor since 1989 on the Dyfed and Carmarthenshire authorities. He was unopposed in 2008 but was run close on this occasion by an Independent, as had been the case in 2004. =Llanddarog (one seat)= On a relatively high turnout, Wyn Evans was challenged for the first time for many years. =Llandeilo (one seat)= A close contest followed the retirement of Ieuan Jones, the member since 1999.

The research was carried out by Japan's Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), Komae Research Laboratory.Operator-Free Super Safe Fast Reactor Concept RAPID-L Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, 2002  History  In 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) started the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) project (not to confuse with International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative I-NERI from 2001International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative: 2011 Annual Report International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, 2012). Its goal was to solicit innovative public research. The theme was to create ultra-safe and ultra-small reactors. Inspired by SP-100, the Alkali Metal Thermoelectric Converter (AMTEC), JAERI's own high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) High-temperature engineering test reactor from 1990, and CRIEPI's RAPID & RAPID-A projects from 1993 & 1995 among others JAERI commissioned the RAPID-L study. The original study looked for an ultra-safe and ultra-small fast reactor RAPID-LAT assumed for use at a Moon base or Mars base. The reason for the assumption of a Mars or Moon base was the closesness of the gravities of both celestial bodies 1/3 and 1/6 of Earth's gravity.Super safe small reactor RAPID-L conceptual design and R and D. JAERI's nuclear research promotion program, H11-002 Mitsuru Kambe, Hirokazu Tsunoda, Kaichiro Mishima, Akira Kawasaki, Takamichi Iwamura, International Nuclear Information System INIS Vol. 37 Issue 01, March, 2003 The study followed a three-year plan: *1999: basic concept; material research *2000: experiment of innovative technologies and their feasibility; Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) tests *2001: LIM tests; plant dynamics analysis  Design considerations  *Natural circulation was a necessary ability considered for the reactor. As coolant lithium-6 was chosen based on temperature requirement and its boiling point (1615 K=1342 ¬∞C) being higher than either Sodium (882 ¬∞C) or Potassium (757 ¬∞C). Another reason is the generation of Helium gas by reaction (n, Œ±) as well as serving as a neutron absorber. This required the ability to remove and extract Helium. *A target was the reduction and simplification of the reactor structure to ease In-Service Inspection (ISI). It was determined that an adaption of the RAPID design concept would solve all this.The RAPID concept would also offer unrefueled running times for 20 years and beyond. *At the time a launch by the Space Shuttle and the H-2 were considered which set a limit to 3.7 m in diameter, 10 m or less in length, and a mass of less than 10 tons. The gravities of the Moon and Mars were also taken into account. It was determined that an elongated furnace structure is required to meet these requirements. As the seismic requirements are relaxed compared on the Earth there was less concern of damage to the structure. A free wavefront design was adopted for the reactor. Further, it was assumed that the transport would be divided into two launches. *It was assumed that the weight on the Moon would be 670 kg at most and that simple cranes can handle it. Heavy equipment for excavating a 2 x 6 m pit was expected to be available.  General description  The RAPID and RAPID-L designs were developed by the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) of Japan. The RAPID-L design is a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) concept meant to prevent accidents due to human errors. The goal was to create a long-life core that is inherently safe due to being maintenance free. These were necessary requirements as the reactor was intended to be used on the Moon. RAPID-L highly automated fast reactor concept without any control rods, 2; Critical experiment of lithium-6 used in LEM and LIM Hirokazu Tsunoda, Osamu Sato, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, July 1, 2002 To this end several innovative ideas were adopted *Heat systems with radiator panel *An Integrated Fuel Assembly (IFA) to realize quick and simplified refueling *A 10-years-operation without refueling *Innovative reactivity control systems without control rods, etc. The RAPID-L is a thermoelectric power conversion system using uranium-nitride fuel (40% and 50% enriched respectively) and liquid lithium-6 coolant with a 5 MW of thermal energy and 200 kW of electric power. The lithium inlet and outlet are rated for a temperature of 1,030 and 1,100 ¬∞C. Lithium-6 also serves as neutron absorber. It is the first reactor of this kind. As lithium-6 has not been used as a neutron absorbing material in conventional fast reactors, measurements were performed at the Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). The FCA core was composed of highly enriched uranium and stainless steel samples so as to simulate the core spectrum of the RAPID-L. The samples were enriched with 95% lithium-6 and were inserted into the core parallel to the core axis for the measurement of the reactivity at each position. It was found that the measured reactivity in the core region was in agreement with calculations. Bias factors for the core design were obtained by comparing between experimental and calculated results. RAPID-L Highly Automated Fast Reactor Concept Without Any Control Rods (1) Reactor concept and plant dynamics analyses Mitsuru Kambe, American Nuclear Society Conference, July 1, 2002 Critical Experiment and Analyses for the Conceptual Design Study of Fast Reactor Equipped with Li-6 Reactivity Control Systems LEM and LIM Shigeaki Okajima, Tsuyoshi Yamane Susumu Iijima,Hirokazu Tsunoda, Osamu Satoh, Mitsuru Kambe, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, October 7‚Äì10, 2002 As a variant of the RAPID (Refueling by All Pins Integrated Design) fast reactor concept, it can be refueled in a quick and simple manner. Essential for this feature is that the reactor core consists of an Integrated Fuel Assembly (IFA) instead of conventional fuel subassemblies. This small core has 2700 fuel elements (pins) combined together by the IFA, consisting of a core support grid and several spacer grids, and are assembled into a fuel cartridge. This cartridge can be replaced as a unit. The reactor can be operated without refueling for up to 10 years (80% nominal power). The reactor has no control rods. To achieve fully automated operation the reactor relies on various reactivity control systems: Lithium Expansion Module (LEM), Lithium Injection Module (LIM) and Lithium Release Module (LRM). LEM serves for inherent reactivity feedback, LIM serves for inherent ultimate shutdown, and LRM serves for automated reactor startup. These passive systems help to mitigate the effects of fuel depletion, allowing a long fuel life. The bias factors were used to determine the number of LEM and LIM needed in the core to achieve fully automated operation. RAPID-L Highly Automated Fast Reactor Concept Without Any Control Rods (2) Critical experiment of lithium-6 used in LEM and LIM Hirokazu Tsunoda, Osamu Sato, American Nuclear Society Conference, July 1, 2002 The reactor has basically a loop type configuration and a reactor container of 2 m in diameter, 6.5 m deep and weighs about 7.6 tons. This RAPID concept has neither diagrid nor core support structure since they are integrated in a fuel cartridge. The simple reactor container would make the most important In-Service Inspection (ISI) easier. An ISI can be conducted for each refueling. The reactor is designed to be installed below grade so that the ground provides the necessary shielding. Separate electromagnetic pumps and the fuel cartridge are connected by the connecting tubes. The reactor subsystem is characterized by the RAPID refueling concept to eliminate conventional fuel handling systems. This gives a substantial reactor block mass savings of 60% over comparable liquid metal cooled fast reactor systems.  Reactor control  Burn-up compensation is achieved automatically by the LEMs, achieving 80% of the nominal power at the end-of-life of the fuel cartridge. The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This ‚Äúliquid control rod‚Äù can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life. Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary coolant flow rate. Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary coolant flow rate due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers. The lower chamber, within the active core, has a 95% enriched Li6 reservoir, while the upper chamber is a vacuum prior to reactor startup. Reactor startup can be done automatically if the primary coolant temperature reaches its standby temperature. Coolant heating can be achieved by heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot standby temperature (approximately 780 ¬∞C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase. It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient negative reactivity feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot standby temperature of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs. The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight temperature deviation of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.  Reactor installation and launch  The reactor can be launched by the H-2 launch vehicle to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) before going to the Moon. Then it will be installed in an excavated cylindrical hole 2 m in diameter and 6 m in depth. The four thermoelectric energy conversion segments and the eight radiator panels are placed around the reactor.  Toshiba controversy  Toshiba has been often cited to be involved in the research and development of the RAPID-L, however, this could not be confirmed in any of the Japanese documentations nor in contemporary science or press news.

Goff & Sons Pawtucket factory in 1876 Darius Goff (10 May 1809 ‚Äì 14 April 1891) was one of the foremost textile manufacturers in the United States and a leading citizen of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He is known for introducing the manufacture of worsted braids and mohair plush upholstery into the United States.  Biography  = Early life = Goff was born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts into a textile mill‚Äìowning family. His father, Lt. Richard Goff, was a partner in the Union Manufacturing Company in Rehoboth, dyeing yarn which would be made into cloth. As a youth, Darius worked in his father's factory, until it closed its doors in 1821. In 1826, at age 17, Goff headed to Fall River to study the woolen business with John and Jesse Eddy. His career was temporarily put on hold when he suffered a serious accident. For three years Goff worked as a clerk in a Providence grocery store while he recovered. = Textile career = After Goff recovered from his injury, together with his brother Nelson he bought the Union Cotton Mill in Rehoboth in 1836. Unfortunately, this mill soon burned to the ground. Goff then turned his attention to the cotton waste business. Darius started contracting with local cotton mills to take their refuse. By 1847, he started the Union Wadding Company to process cotton waste into a wadded form that was usable by paper mills, and then he sold this wadding to paper mills to be made into paper. In 1871, that mill burned down. Fortunately, by 1861 Goff had begun the manufacture of worsted braids, first under the name of the American Worsted Co., then in 1864 under the name D. Goff & Son, with his son Darius L. Goff as partner. The braids were often mentioned in the advertisements for the company of Pawtucket. When his other son Lyman joined the company, it became D. Goff & Sons. Goff was determined to produce mohair plush for upholstery, such as the kind used for car seats. Goff sent associates to France and Germany to uncover how the process was done, but they failed to learn the trade secrets. Goff eventually wound up creating his own process through trial and error, becoming the first manufacturer of plush in the United States in 1882. = Other achievements = Goff was also at various times a director of various concerns including The Franklin Savings Bank, the First National Bank, the Pawtucket Street Railroad, The Pawtucket Hair Cloth Co, and others. He was a member of the National Association of Wool Manufacturers. Goff served repeatedly on the Town Council of Pawtucket, and in 1871, he was elected to the Rhode Island State Senate.  Personal life  Goff was twice married; first in 1839 to Sarah Lee, daughter of Israel Lee of Dighton, Massachusetts; Sarah died early, and she had no children. After Sarah's death, Goff married her sister Harriet. Their three children were Darius Lee and Lyman Bullock Goff, who went into the family business; and his daughter Sarah married Thomas S. Steele of Hartford, Connecticut. Goff was a lifelong Republican and since 1848 member of the Pawtucket Congregational Church. =Goff's sons= Goff's sons Darius (1840-1926) and Lyman Bullock (1841-1927) followed their father into the textile business; in 1872, the firm became known as D. Goff & Sons. They are credited for introducing electric power to Pawtucket, as well as founding the Pawtucket Boys Club. Lyman is the namesake for the Lyman B Goff Junior High School in Pawtucket, and for a time lived in the historic Pitcher-Goff House. The brothers were inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1997. Like their father, the Goff sons were deeply involved with the Pawtucket Congregational Church. = Burial = Darius Goff is buried with his family in Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, Rhode Island.  Goff Memorial Hall  Goff Memorial Hall In 1884 Goff gave money and land for the building of a library and school in Rehoboth. The large, wooden Victorian building was named Goff Memorial Hall. It opened in March 1886. It was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in July 1911. A new brick building was built in 1915 at 124 Bay State Road. The building was named Goff Memorial Hall and it houses Blanding Public Library.

The first Long Table a \\"Long Table on Feminism\\", was held as part of the Live Art Development Agency's (LADA) third Restock Rethink Reflect initiative, and constituted a discussion on what and who is missing from historical accounts, and what to do about it. The event was attended by over 100 artists and thinkers.  Common Elements  The Long Table was designed to stage public conversations around difficult subjects. Long Tables begin with a group of people sitting around a table that is set with empty chairs. To begin the conversation a question is asked, and participants are able to take a seat at the table if they wish to speak. Participants are not allowed to speak unless they are sitting at the table, and they may join or leave the table at any time. If there are no seats available they are permitted to ask for a seat. The event has been described as 'a performance of a dinner party where conversation is the only course.'

Football Playing Career  Before becoming a referee, Cann was a promising footballer playing in the Youth Team for Norwich Cityhttp://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/cann.htm Flown From The Nest, Norwich City and being signed by Steve Coppell in the 1980s for Crystal Palace.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/13/newsstory.sport Stuart James, The Guardian He played regularly for the Youth Team and Reserves, but did not make any first team appearances.  Early Refereeing Career  Cann began refereeing in 1991 and quickly excelled, receiving successive promotions in his first two seasons, to become a 'Class 1' Referee in 1993. He was promoted to the National List of Assistant Referees (Football League Assistant Referee) in 2001/02 and again promoted as an Assistant Referee on the Premier League in 2005. In that same year he was awarded his first International appointment, a UEFA Cup match refereed by Howard Webb. Cann has since represented his country over 125 times on International matches.  Notable Achievements  In just his first season as a Premier League Assistant Referee, Cann's performance throughout that season saw him appointed to the 2006 FA Cup Final between Liverpool and West Ham United. In a pulsating match, considered to be one of the best Cup Finals ever, Liverpool eventually came out on top, winning 3-1 on penalties after the match finished 3-3 after 90 minutes. Over the next 16 months, Cann would go on to complete the set of four most prestigious appointments in English football (FA Cup Final 2006, FA Community Shield 2007, Carling Cup Final 2007, Championship Play Off Final 2007). Indeed, he holds the distinction of becoming the first person ever to officiate in the six most prestigious matches available to an English official (the aforementioned four domestic finals as well as The UEFA Champions League Final and The World Cup Final). Howard Webb and Mike Mullarkey have since also achieved this feat. The English Refereeing trio of Howard Webb, Darren Cann and Mike Mullarkey were honoured with the appointment of officiating the 2010 Champions League Final at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in Madrid.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8694338.stm BBC News, 20 May 2010 Inter Milan, under the management of Jose Mourinho, beat Bayern Munich 2-0.

In April 2020, McDonald stated to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that it was a political decision to opt out of an EU scheme to bulk-buy ventilators and protective equipment for NHS workers to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The comments raised concerns that ministers had put Brexit ahead of responding to the public health crisis.Following comments, Matt Hancock used Downing Street's daily press briefing to state that as far as he knew, they had been no political decision not to participate. McDonald subsequently wrote to the committee chairperson, Tom Tugendhat, stating that he had \\"inadvertently and wrongly\\" misadvised the committee \\"due to a misunderstanding\\". In June 2020, it was announced that McDonald would take early retirement in autumn 2020. The move stemmed from the merger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Department for International Development, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalling that he wanted a new leader to head up the combined department.

She has advised on government policy and has written reports for the WHO on tackling inequalities in health. She is also an associate editor for the Cochrane Public Health Review Group since 2008 and has a visiting Professorship at the Karolinska Institute. Honours Whitehead was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to public health. Research Longstanding research interests have been the assessment of policies and strategies to tackle inequalities in health and in health care. The current research programme that Margaret Whitehead leads focuses on the social dimensions of ill-health. In particular it traces social pathways to and from health inequalities and what this means for developing more effective health and social policy. The programme explores not only the social causes of ill health, but also the adverse consequences of having a chronic illness, such as reduced income and employment chances, social isolation and stigma in relation to specific tracer conditions. With international collaborators, her studies are looking at the ways in which health and social welfare systems themselves reduce or exacerbate the adverse consequences of ill-health and what can be done to improve the situation. She is keenly involved in knowledge transfer: finding ways for research evidence to get to where it can be most useful in informing policy-making and public health practice.

The house was designed by Dr. Juan Nakpil in the early 1930s and was owned by one of the most distinguished couples in Quezon, Dr. Isidro Rodriguez and Do√±a Gregoria Gala. The house is located in Rizal Street along with other opulent houses owned by the illustrados of old Sariaya. The Gala‚ÄìRodriguez House is listed as one of the Ancestral Houses in the Philippines, under Region IV-A. History Gala‚ÄìRodriguez House facade The Gala‚ÄìRodriguez House, second receiving area at the 2nd floor The Gala‚ÄìRodriguez mansion was built in the 1930s as Dr Isidro Rodriguez' gift to his ailing wife, Do√±a Gregoria, who had long wished to have her dream house for their seven children. During the house construction, Sariaya and the Province of Quezon were suffering from a crisis brought by a pest called leaf miners. Most of the coconut plantations which were the primary source of income in Quezon were greatly affected. In this depressing period, Do√±a Gregoria feared that the house may not be finished in full but the crisis later proved to be beneficial for them because the labor cost went down to 50 centavos per day and P12.00 for the master carpenter. On May 4, 1935, in time for Do√±a Gregoria's birthday the house was finally completed and the family decided to occupy the place. Unfortunately, two days before her birthday, Do√±a Gregoria died of her illness. In the year 1942, during World War II, Japanese Imperial Officers used the house as their headquarter. Three Japanese Officials occupied the second floor while the family was allowed to stay at the ground floor. According to the current owner of the house, one of the Japanese Officers, General Ashima, fell in love and courted Carmen, the oldest daughter of the owner. To win Carmen's heart, General Ashima would provide the family with supply of foods and clothing materials. He would also serenade Carmen by playing the guitar and by dedicating love songs for the beautiful lady. Nonetheless, the family was doubtful about the real intention of the Japanese officer so they would hide Carmen in the Cellar. When the guerilllas learned that there were Japanese Officers occupying the house, they intentionally informed the Americans who were about to liberate Manila at that time. The guerillas sent a map to the American forces to bomb the whole house. Before the planned destruction took place, residents of Sariaya already fled to the barrios for their safety. They did not inform the owners of the house because they fear that General Ashima might follow Carmen. Luckily a good friend of the family went back to tip them of the planned bombing and on the same day, the whole family evacuated. Three bombs were dropped in the vicinity of the house. The first one hit the front part of the property and exploded at the gate. The second one was dropped behind the house and created a 20- foot- deep crater. The third one directly hit the house and landed in the stairs but it did not explode. When the whole town was looted after the bombing, the Gala‚ÄìRodriguez House was spared because no one dared to enter the house for the fear that the bomb might explode anytime, not a single piece of furniture was lost. Later, the bomb was moved to the garage with the help of some residents. A week after the bombing, the house became the venue for a welcome party dedicated to the US Air force. In the midst of the celebration, Exal, the younger sister of Carmen told one American soldier about the bomb that was kept in the garage. Immediately, the party stopped and everyone was alarmed. A bomb disposal unit was called by the American forces to check the bomb and found out that it was live The bomb squad unit successfully removed the bomb and finally the house was out of danger. Life moved on and Do√±a Carmen took charge of the house. In 1950's, she married Judge Vicente Arguelles and they had one child, Gladiola, also known as Ineng. It was this time when the family decided that the crater created by the bomb explosion at the back of the house be turned into the biggest and deepest swimming pool but it was later downsized into 15- foot deep pool which is equivalent to a two-storey building. In 1960's, Sariaya was struck again by another disaster and it was known as the great fire. Do√±a Carmen had already given instruction to throw the furniture at the pool to save them but another stroke of luck happened. The flames that were about to destroy the house were fanned away by the wind. The grand daughter of the original owner, Galdiola Arguelles-Cabu√±ag is now the owner and the one who maintains the historical house. As quoted from the official brochure of the ancestral house, ‚ÄúThe Ancestral home, having survived theses series of both tragic and momentous events cannot simply be attributed to some good luck. It certainly was blessed and preserved for a definite and meaningful purpose.‚Äù. House features Entrance Close up of facade The Gala‚ÄìRodriguez heritage house is one of the Art Deco houses that flourished in Sariaya, Quezon during the pre-war era in the Philippines. The house most prominent features are the fan-shaped front entrance glass canopy and the art deco relieves that decorates the mirador of the house. The house features two receiving rooms, several bedrooms, two dining halls, a prayer room, and an intricately designed veranda. At the back is a terrace overlooking a 15-foot- deep swimming pool and a private garden with a gazebo. Most of the fixtures and furniture inside the house are of American and European origins. The crafted wooden pieces of furniture was designed and manufactured by Manila's leading furniture atelier, Don Gonzalo Puyat. Exquisite table wares are also on display and large wall mirror greets every visitor in the receiving area. A 19th century grand piano is also in the receiving area complemented by a vintage wooden radio in one corner of the room. According to Eric Dedace, a tour guide and PRO of Sariaya Tourism Council, the real charm of the house are the stories tied to this historical house most especially during the wartime era concerning Carmen, the beautiful daughter of Dr. Isidro. Her stories are one of the highlights of a guided tour that gives a picture of what life is in old Sariaya. =First floor= One of two receiving areas of the Gala‚ÄìRodriguez house. On the first floor is the first of two receiving rooms of the house, a dining area, and a study room which also served as Dr. Isidro's office. Inside the office is a wooden cabinet where clothes, pictures and other personal belongings and memorabilia of the eldest child in the family, the beautiful Do√±a Carmen, are exhibited. Old pictures of the different areas of the house are also displayed inside because these were Do√±a Carmen's way of reminding the maids how they should fix the curtains, furniture and other fixtures back in place when they are removed for cleaning. The owner of the house wants everything to be in exact place and arranged in the original manner. On the left side of the staircase is the dining area where a classic and elegant table arrangement is on display. The set up is complemented by antique silver and china ware with golden and satin table cloths. Hidden under the dining room carpet is a secret passage that leads to the cellar of the house. =Cellar= The Gala‚ÄìRodriguez House cellar, the hiding place of Dona Carmen during the Japanese era The Cellar used to be the hiding place of Carmen during the Japanese era. According to the current owner of the house, the family of Carmen would often hide her in the cellar because a high-ranking Japanese official, General Ashima, was after her beauty but the family was doubtful of the General's real intentions. The young Carmen would often stay there for days with her Yaya. Today, the cellar has been turned into a museum. Some of the family's antique belongings are on displayed including Carmen's shoes, the family travel luggage and bags, a collection of old bottles and tin cans from different makes and brands, unused vintage art deco light fixtures and some vintage car plates. An old image of Virgin Mary in a wooden frame is bolted on the wall and below it is a wooden kneeler of Carmen that she uses when praying the rosary. Below the passage leading to the dining area is a small door that opens at the back gate of the house which they call \\"the secret passage to freedom\\". =Second floor= Second floor On the second floor is the second receiving area which is as elegant as the first one, meticulously furnished with pieces of furniture and textiles in green hues. The set up is completed with wide opening windows, stained glass clerestory windows, large chandeliers, French provincial style furniture and long curtains that extend from floor to ceiling. The second dining area is also located at the second floor of the house. From the receiving area, a wide door opens to the front porch where the family stays for coffee to relax and have a view of the town. The girls' bedroom and master's bedroom are also located on this floor. The house also features a small prayer room which is typical in most ancestral houses in the Philippines. The bathrooms still has its original and working plumbing fixtures from the 1930s.

Campbell (1912 ‚Äì 15 December 2004) was a Scottish polyglot and a linguist at the BBC for many years, author of the Compendium of the World's Languages (Routledge, 2000), as well as Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets (Routledge, 1997). He was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records during the 1980s as one of the world's greatest living linguists, could speak and write fluently in at least 44 languages and had a working knowledge of perhaps 20 others. He was born in Dingwall, Scotland, as a son of the overseer of gardens and dells for Lord and Lady Seaforth, heirs to the Brahan Castle Estates. The Campbell family lived on the main estate, near the castle. Campbell‚Äôs sister, Aileen Campbell McCausey, who emigrated to the United States in 1947 noted that her older brother had a slight stammer from an early age. Right through his schooldays, his sister recalled, teachers thought young Campbell a dunce because of his stammer. They relegated him to the back of the classroom and ignored him, which allowed him to devour language books on his own. Sitting in the back of the classroom, he taught himself Spanish and Italian before learning French and German at secondary school. When he applied to the University of Edinburgh, he found out he needed to know a classic language, so he taught himself six years of Latin in a year and won the school‚Äôs Latin prize. He found his language books burrowing through secondhand bookstalls at a fish market. He studied German at the University of Leipzig and mastered eight other languages from fellow students who had come to Leipzig from Central and Eastern Europe. In 1937, he received a degree in librarianship from London University and became assistant librarian in the School of Slavonic Studies. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Mr. Campbell was called to the military but was immediately transferred to the BBC World Service as a language supervisor. He retired in 1974 as head of the Romanian Service. Living in retirement in Brighton, he taught himself classical Chinese, Basque, and several other languages. He also translated academic works, mainly from Russian and German. Mr. Campbell also played piano and taught himself tensor calculus. (\\"I wanted to know what the cosmologists were talking about,\\" he told a former BBC colleague.) Another BBC colleague, George Mikes, recalled in The Guardian newspaper that he had made a point of asking native speakers at the BBC about Mr. Campbell's facility. \\"All said that his knowledge was not only adequate but amazing,\\" Mikes wrote. Douglas Dearie, Mr. Campbell's nephew and a Bowie software engineer, recalled his uncle as a gentle man with a wry sense of humor who, in his soft-spoken Scottish burr, loved telling stories. Dearie recalled that Mr. Campbell and his wife traveled the world but didn't like to go where they already knew the language. He died of pneumonia on 15 December 2004 in Brighton, England, at the age of 92.

He was an active trade union leader and a trained physicist. He legally represented the families of the individuals who were killed in \\"fake encounters\\" in Gujarat following the 2002 riots and in Manipur, in which he secured convictions of the politicians and police officers involved. Along with his wife Nirjhari Sinha, he founded and served as the president of Jan Sangharsh Manch (trans. People's Struggle Forum), an independent civil rights organization with the aim of addressing issues of labour and workers rights. He was also a vocal critic of erstwhile Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Early life and education Mukul Sinha was born in Kolkata on 10 February 1951. After completing his undergraduate studies at Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, he studied at IIT Kanpur where he received a master's degree in physics. Career Sinha joined the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad in 1973 for doctoral research. He became involved with social activism after the expulsion of workers at PRL in 1978. He organized the workers to fight for their rights, founding the Federation of Employees of Autonomous Research and Development, Education and Technical Institutes (FEARDETI), although this cost him his job in 1979. Subsequently, he obtained a degree in law in 1988 and joined the Gujarat High Court as an advocate in 1989. He co-founded Jan Sangharsh Manch in 1990 under the aegis of the New Socialist Movement and organized a group of lawyers and individuals from different professions to work pro-bono on various issues of the general public ranging from trade-unions, housing, environment, natural calamities, and civil rights. His recommendations made after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, entitled \\"Kutch Quake Profile\\" resulted in an injunction from the court to incorporate earthquake resistant structures in the state of Gujarat. =2002 Gujarat Riots= Gujarat experienced large scale communal violence and riots in 2002. With Jan Sangharsh Manch, he participated in the Nanavati-Mehta Commission appointed by the Government of Gujarat to seek justice for the victims. As a party to the law suit, he managed to obtain mobile phone 'call data records' (CDR) submitted by Indian Police Service officer Rahul Sharma. A thorough analysis of these records enabled lawyers, activists and victims to cite the CDRs as evidence, implicating a number of political leaders and police officers. The CDRs of Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi were crucial evidence in corroborating the testimonies of Naroda Patiya massacre victims. Finally, the special court convicted them for their role in the riots. =Electoral Politics= Mukul Sinha contested elections for the Gujarat Legislative Assembly in 2007 as a candidate from his own political party, the New Socialist Movement, and in 2012 as an independent candidate. He contested the 2007 elections from Shahpur, a constituency where Muslims formed the majority of the population, and the 2012 elections from Sabarmati in Ahmedabad. He lost both elections, securing only a few votes. Death and Legacy Sinha died of lung cancer on 12 May 2014. He is survived by his wife Nirjhari Sinha and their son Pratik Sinha, who runs the fact-checking portal AltNews.in. According to his wishes, his body was donated to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital for cancer research. Journalist Rana Ayyub wrote an obituary for Mukul Sinha, remembering her personal loss and his legacy. He was posthumously awarded the second Bhagirath Human Rights Award (BHRA) by the Bhagirath Memorial Fund Committee set up at the Centre for Social Studies (CSS), Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat. Activist Jignesh Mevani worked under Sinha's mentorship before becoming MLA from Vadgam, Gujarat.

He joined the Mexican Army in 1992 and was part of the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), an elite special forces unit of the Army. In 1999, he withdrew from the military and was recruited by the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization, shortly thereafter. With other ex-commandos, he formed Los Zetas, a group that worked as the Gulf Cartel's military wing. In 2010, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas broke relations and Mellado Cruz sided with the former to maintain a low profile status. He was killed in a gunfight against Mexican security forces in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on 9 May 2014. Early life and career Galindo Mellado Cruz (also Galdino) was born in Tampico Alto, Veracruz, Mexico on 18 April 1973. According to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA), Mellado Cruz joined the Mexican Armed Forces as a soldier in the Mexican Army on 1 September 1992. During his tenure in the military, he was part of the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), an elite special forces unit of the Army, where he received top military training. On 1 May 1999, however, he applied to be discharged from the Army. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the Gulf Cartel, a Mexican drug trafficking organization, and began working for the drug kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n along with several other ex-commandos from the Army. The group of former soldiers recruited by the Gulf Cartel became known as Los Zetas, and Mellado Cruz was part of the original fourteen founders of the group. The group's members were Arturo Guzm√°n Decena (alias \\"Z-1\\"), the leader; Alejandro Lucio Morales Betancourt (alias \\"Z-2\\"); Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (alias \\"El Lazca\\" and \\"Z-3\\"), Mateo D√≠az L√≥pez (alias \\"Z-6\\"); Jes√∫s Enrique Rej√≥n Aguilar (alias \\"El Mamito\\"); √ìscar Guerrero Silva (alias \\"Z-8\\"); Omar Lorm√©ndez Pital√∫a (alias \\"Z-10\\"); Efra√≠n Teodoro Torres (alias \\"Z-14\\"); Mellado Cruz (also known by his alias \\"Z-9\\" and \\"El Mellado\\"), among other ex-commandos. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Los Zetas were the Gulf Cartel's military wing and had the task of protecting C√°rdenas Guill√©n and killing rival cartel members. When C√°rdenas Guill√©n was arrested by Mexican security forces in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on 14 March 2003, the leadership of the Gulf Cartel was handed over to his brother Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (alias \\"Tony Tormenta\\") and Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez (alias \\"El Coss\\"). The leadership of Los Zetas, on the other hand, was kept under the control of Lazcano Lazcano. However, C√°rdenas Guill√©n allegedly continued to command the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; with his extradition to the United States in 2007, Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel kept their alliance under a loose relationship, but each of their respective leaders attempted to fill the leadership void. Following several disagreements and internal power struggles, both criminal organizations broke their alliance and declared war at each other in early 2010. According to information from U.S. law enforcement, Mellado Cruz sided with the Gulf Cartel after the split in order to maintain a low-profile status and avoid public attention. Under the Gulf Cartel, he allegedly oversaw organized crime activities at the U.S.-Mexico border area known as La Ribere√±a, which encompasses the municipalities of Camargo and Miguel Alem√°n in Tamaulipas. Sometime between 2010 and 2014, Mellado Cruz escaped from two prisons in Tamaulipas after being imprisoned for rape, armed robbery, homicide, and drug trafficking. He also had thirteen pending criminal investigations for homicide, kidnapping, extortion, and drug trafficking accusations. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Mellado Cruz under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Death On 9 May 2014, Mellado Cruz was killed in a shootout against Mexican federal security forces at a domicile in Las Fuentes neighborhood in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. During the firefight, grenades detonated and shots were exchanged between law enforcement and Mellado Cruz's aides. Gulf Cartel gunmen set roadblocks and threw road spikes throughout Reynosa's streets to prevent the mobilization of reinforcements from the military. Reinforcements from organized crime arrived at the scene in an attempt to save his life, but he was shot dead inside the property. Following his death, the gunmen left the premises. The firefight left five more gunmen associated with him dead, along with a Mexican Army soldier. Inside the house, authorities discovered several assault rifles, including a Barrett 50 rifle and AK-47s, along with grenades, cartridges, and other weapons the criminals used to combat law enforcement. Mellado Cruz's death came amid an internal power struggle within the Gulf Cartel, as rival factions within the organization fight for the control of Reynosa and the rest of Tamaulipas with each other and Los Zetas, their former allies. Days prior to his death, gunfights in Reynosa had left a total of at least 23 dead, including two innocent bystanders, a couple of federal policemen, a soldier, and eighteen suspected criminals. In order to confirm the drug lord's identity, the Mexican government carried out forensic anthropology studies, where they analyzed the corpse's pictures with the photos from Mellado Cruz's time in the military. They also compared the corpse's fingerprints and DNA samples with the ones they had on file in the Mexican Armed Forces database. The following day, authorities apprehended Ricardo Flores L√≥pez (also known as Pedro Luis Hern√°ndez Campos), the alleged second-in-command behind Mellado Cruz and the cartel's chief in Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas.

Life Born at Falmouth, Cornwall in January 1814, he was eldest son of Nicholas Pocock of Falmouth and grandson of Nicholas Pocock the marine painter; Isaac Pocock and William Innes Pocock were his uncles. He was educated at a private school in Devon by the Rev. John Manly, and on 3 February 1831 matriculated at The Queen's College, Oxford, as Michel exhibitioner; in 1834 he was elected scholar. He graduated B.A. that year with a first class in the final mathematical school, and a second class in literae humaniores In 1835 he won the Johnson mathematical scholarship, and the senior mathematical scholarship in 1836. In 1837 he graduated M.A. In 1838 Pocock became Michel fellow of Queen's, where later he was mathematical lecturer. He had a reputation as mathematical tutor, and among his pupils was Bartholomew Price; he was public examiner in mathematics in 1839, 1844, and 1848, and in literae humaniores in 1842 and 1852. He was ordained deacon in 1838 and priest in 1855, but never held any ecclesiastical preferment. He married in 1852 a daughter of James Cowles Prichard, and moved to Clifton, Bristol, where he spent the remainder of his life with the exception of a year when he was in charge of Codrington College in Barbados. He died at Clifton on 4 March 1897, survived by his widow, sons and daughters. Works Pocock did much to undermine the traditional Protestant view of the Reformation. His major work was his edition of Gilbert Burnet's History of the Reformation, published in seven volumes by the Clarendon Press in 1864‚Äì65. The seventh volume consisted of Pocock's discussion on Burnet's authorities, sources, and errors. In 1847 Pocock edited the third edition of Henry Hammond's Miscellaneous Theological Works, and in 1852 published The First two Books of Euclid ‚Ä¶ with additional figures. Later he devoted himself almost exclusively to the history of the Reformation in England. The series Records of the Reformation issued by the Clarendon Press in 1871 was stopped at the year 1535, because of poor sales: and Pocock's collections remained mostly in manuscript, though some were published in Troubles connected with the Prayer-Book of 1549 (Camden Society, 1884). Pocock also edited, for the Camden Society, Nicholas Harpsfield's Treatise of the Pretended Divorce of Catherine of Aragon (1878). Other works included: * The Ritual Commission, Bristol, 1872. * The Abolition of the Thirty-nine Articles, 3 parts, London, 1874. * The Principles of the Reformation, London, 1875. * The Recovery from the Principles of the Reformation, London, 1877. He contributed articles on Reformation history to the Saturday Review, the Union Review, Quarterly Review, Church Quarterly Review and English Historical Review, and to The Athen√¶um and The Academy. He also wrote for the Dictionary of National Biography.

Early life and education  Love is from Stradishall, Suffolk. His parents, Alexander Love, a prison chaplain at HM Prison Highpoint North, and Sirkka-Liisa Love (a Finnish citizen), who also works at the prison, live in Stradishall. He has dual citizenship of the United Kingdom and Finland. After dropping out of sixth form college and working in a turkey plant, Love applied for a Finnish passport, and then served in the Finnish Army for six months, became a conscientious objector and finished another six months of his obligation in alternative civilian service. After that, he applied at the University of Nottingham in England and dropped out in his second term after a physical and mental collapse, then at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, but dropped out in his second year, again for health reasons. He was part of the 2011 Hetherington House Occupation, a student protest at Glasgow University.  Cases  = United States = In January 2013, the website of the United States Sentencing Commission was replaced with a video protesting the treatment of activist Aaron Swartz who had committed suicide days earlier. The video claimed that those responsible had obtained secrets from the United States Army, Missile Defense Agency, and NASA but they were only ever released in encrypted form. The subsequent investigation named Lauri Love in two indictments (2013 in District of New Jersey, 2014 in Southern District of New York and Eastern District of Virginia) for allegedly \\"breaching thousands of computer systems in the United States and elsewhere ‚Äì including the computer networks of federal agencies ‚Äì to steal massive quantities of confidential data\\". The United States made an extradition request and dropped the charges after it was denied. Love's attorney in America is Tor Ekeland.  Extradition hearing  During Love's two day extradition hearing on 28 and 29 June 2016 at the Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, his father testified that Lauri Love is Autistic and so should not be extradited. Specifically, he testified that his son was not diagnosed autistic until he was an adult serving in the Finnish Army. Psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, who diagnosed Love as autistic in 2012, testified that Love should not be extradited because of his diagnosed disorders, which also include eczema, psychosis, and depression. Baron-Cohen stated that Love told him that he would commit suicide if extradited. Love, who lives at home with his parents, testified at his extradition hearing on 29 June 2016. He was supported by the Courage Foundation. Love's barrister for this extradition hearing was Ben Cooper of Doughty Street Chambers. The case was adjourned. On 16 September 2016, at Westminster Magistrates' Court, a judge ruled that Love could be extradited to the United States. Love's solicitor Karen Todner said that they would appeal, and on 5 February 2018, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley, at the High Court, upheld his appeal against extradition, while ruling that it would \\"not be oppressive [to] prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences\\". = National Crime Agency = The National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested Love in October 2013. In February 2015, BBC News revealed that Love was taking legal action for the return of computers seized by the NCA when he was arrested. In May 2016, Judge Nina Tempia of the Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled that Love did not have to tell the NCA what his passwords, or encryption keys, are.

Previous positions include CEO of Digg.com, executive roles at Amazon, and Entrepreneur-In-Residence at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Early life and education Williams was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in the Pacific Northwest, attending Shorecrest High School near Seattle, Washington. His parents were both entrepreneurs: his father starting radio stations, including KUBE 93.3 in Seattle and his mother starting Lake Forest Park Montessori in North Seattle. Williams graduated from the Eller College of Management at the University of Arizona. Career =LiveBid.com= In 1996 Williams and high-school friend Sky Kruse cofounded Seattle-based LiveBid.com, a proprietary software site that partnered with traditional auction houses to stream their events online, allowing Internet bidders to participate in bidding. The firm was acquired by Amazon in 1999. =Amazon= Williams remained at Amazon until 2010, he occupied several executive roles, including General Manager of Payments, General Manager for WebStore, Director of Community and Gifts, and Director of Live Auctions. He was responsible for early iterations of various web products, including Amazon's Selling on Amazon and WebStore by Amazon. In 2001, Williams initiated a partnership between Amazon and the Annual Today Show Holiday Drive, a project of the Today Show Charitable Foundation, Inc. The partnership allowed Amazon customers to select and purchase a wish list of toy products for needy children from the site. =Digg.com= In September 2010, Williams became CEO of social news aggregator Digg.com. He inherited a number of challenges: the technically marred release of site redesign Digg v4 had resulted in a decline in customer usage and an alienation of the site's core audience; at the same time, changes in the internet milieu - most particularly Google's search algorithm - had made Digg's news aggregation model less relevant. After the departure of former CEO Jay Adelson, founder Kevin Rose had run the company, making Williams the company's third CEO within a span of months. During Williams' tenure, the firm's metrics began to rebound. Site engagement increased significantly: Diggs and time on site by 20%, the total number of comments submitted per day by 50%. Despite this, the company's burn rate remained high, resulting in layoffs of 40% of staff and cuts in operational costs in order to approach cash flow positive in 2011. In July 2012, Williams completed the sale of Digg in three parts: some staff members were transferred to The Washington Post's SocialCode project for $12 million, a suite of patents were sold to LinkedIn for $4 million, and the Digg brand and website was sold to Betaworks for stock plus at least $500,000 cash. =Pro.com= In mid-2013, Williams became CEO of the Internet startup Pro.com, a home services marketplace where users receive instant price estimates from home professionals and schedule appointments online.

The book, which advocates linguistic decolonization, is one of Ng≈©gƒ©'s best-known and most- cited non-fiction publications, helping to cement him as a preeminent voice theorizing the \\"language debate\\" in post-colonial studies. Ng≈©gƒ© describes the book as \\"a summary of some of the issues in which I have been passionately involved for the last twenty years of my practice in fiction, theatre, criticism, and in teaching of literature\\". Decolonising the Mind is split into four essays: \\"The Language of African Literature,\\" \\"The Language of African Theatre,\\" \\"The Language of African Fiction,\\" and \\"The Quest for Relevance.\\" Several of the book's chapters originated as lectures, and apparently this format gave Ng≈©gƒ© \\"the chance to pull together in a connected and coherent form the main issues on the language question in literature.\\" The book offers a distinctly anti-imperialist perspective on the \\"continuing debate ‚Ä¶ about the destiny of Africa\\" and language's role in both combatting and perpetrating imperialism and the conditions of neocolonialism in African nations. The book is also Ng≈©gƒ©'s \\"farewell to English,\\" and it addresses the \\"language problem\\" faced by African authors. Ng≈©gƒ© focuses on questions about the African writer's linguistic medium (should one write in one's indigenous language, or a hegemonic language such as French or English?), the writer's intended audience, and the writer's purpose in writing. Decolonising the Mind is a meld of autobiography, post-colonial theory, pedagogy, African history, and literary criticism. Ng≈©gƒ© dedicated Decolonising the Mind \\"to all those who write in African languages, and to all those who over the years have maintained the dignity of the literature, culture, philosophy, and other treasures carried by African languages.\\"  Background  = The language debate in post-colonial studies= Language is a central question in post- colonial studies. Many post-colonial scholars and writers detail the colonial practice of imposing the colonizer's languages onto the peoples they colonized, even forbidding the use of the colonized people's native tongue. They examine this practice as part of the systematic oppression of imperialism in neocolonial societies, and they investigate its ramifications on the psychological, physical, and cultural well-being of colonized peoples. In the context of post-colonial studies, language is a weapon and a site of intense neocolonial conflict. Some post-colonial theorists advocate, if not a complete abandonment of the English language, at least a conscious and pronounced preference of indigenous languages as a literary or scholarly medium. Ng≈©gƒ© sits firmly on this side of the debate. Others, however (Salman Rushdie, for example), see the practicality of utilizing hegemonic languages like English and French as too immediate to permit the abandonment of such languages. On this side of the argument, writers and activists see using the colonist languages as a practical alternative which they can employ to improve conditions of colonized peoples. For example, a colonist language can be used both to enhance international communication (e.g. people living in Djibouti, Cameroon, Morocco, Haiti, Cambodia, and France can all speak to one another in French). This side also views the subversive potential of the appropriation of a colonist language by an indigenous people; it is seen as a ‚Äúcounter to a colonial past through de-forming a 'standard' European tongue and re-forming it in new literary forms.‚Äù As Jennifer Margulis, a scholar of post-colonial studies at Emory University, outlines, the issue of languages raises several polemical questions for consideration in the study of literary texts: Thus, the question of whether or not to write in African languages is a serious one for the African writer, as Oliver Lovesey, a scholar of Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong‚Äôo, notes. In his book on Ng≈©gƒ© and his work, Lovesey quotes Albert S. G√©rard on this topic: Ng≈©gƒ©'s contribution to the language debate is widely known and studied, and he has theorized on the topic extensively. He passionately advocates the overall development of African languages and their use in African literatures--in 1992 he founded the Gikuyu-language journal M≈©tƒ©ri, and continues to edit it--and he famously renounced writing in English. First, he committed to abandoning English in his fiction writing, and in a note on Decolonising the Mind, he bids a final \\"farewell\\" to English in all of his writings. = Imprisonment and exile= In December 1977, following the production of the controversial play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), which he co-wrote with Ngugi wa Mirii, and the publication of his highly politicized novel Petals of Blood (1977), Ng≈©gƒ© was imprisoned without trial or charges in Kamƒ©tƒ© Maximum Security Prison by the authoritarian Kenyan regime. The play was performed in his native tongue Gikuyu in an open-air theatre in Limuru, with actors who were peasants and workers in the village. Both Petals of Blood and Ngaahika Ndeenda were openly critical of neocolonial life in Kenya, and they garnered Ng≈©gƒ© a reputation with the Kenyan regime as a political dissident. Ng≈©gƒ© was denied employment at the University of Nairobi upon his release, and he was imprisoned again in 1981 and 1982. He published several works while he was shifted in and out of imprisonment: Caitaani M≈©tharaba-inƒ© (Devil on the Cross), which he had written on toilet paper in prison, and Writers in Politics in 1981, and Detained, an account of his experiences in prison, in 1982. Upon his release from prison, Ng≈©gƒ© continued to write and produce activist literature and theatre, and he remained critical of the situation in Kenya. Another play Ng≈©gƒ© had helped write, Mait≈© Njugƒ©na (Mother, Sing for Me), was suppressed by the government. Due to his writing about the injustices of the dictatorial government, Ng≈©gƒ© and his family received threats of violence and death, and were forced to live in exile. Ng≈©gƒ© lived out his exile in the United Kingdom (1982‚Äì1989) and in the United States (1989‚Äì2002). While he was in exile, the Kenyan regime continued to harass him, and attempted to get him expelled from England. The regime also continued to repress his literature in Kenya: from 1986‚Äì1996, Matigari could not be sold in Kenya, and the regime removed all of Ng≈©gƒ©'s work from all educational institutions. Only after Arap Moi was voted out of office, 22 years later, was it safe for him and his family to return. Ng≈©gƒ© experienced acute repression, but he was also intensely creative during this earlier period of his exile. Between 1982 and 1984, he widened the scope of his writing and released three children's books in Gikuyu. He published Barrel of a Pen: Resistance to Oppression in Neo-Colonial Kenya, a collection of essays about Kenya's hostile political atmosphere, in 1983. Decolonising the Mind and Matigari were both published in 1986. In their book on Ng≈©gƒ© and his works, David Cook and Michael Okenimkpe write that Ng≈©gƒ©'s works from 1979 onward reveal his renewed determination and mental resilience, and demonstrate that his prison ordeal \\"strengthened his will to continue the battle for social justice.\\" The works of social and literary criticism Ng≈©gƒ© published since his exile in 1982‚ÄîBarrel of a Pen (1983), Decolonising the Mind (1986), and Moving the Centre: The Struggle of Cultural Freedom (1993)‚Äîare often studied together because they share an interest common themes like imperialism, culture, African languages, African literature, African theatre, education, and religion, and they each articulate his commitment to revolutionary socialist ideology. \\"Individually these volumes add new dimensions to his writing,\\" Cook and Okenimkpe write, \\"and together they document a transition in his campaign towards rousing his countrymen to act in practical ways against exploitation and inequality.\\"  Themes, ideas, and structures = Language and culture = Central to Decolonising the Mind is Ng≈©gƒ©'s \\"theory of language\\", in which \\"language exists as culture\\" and \\"language exists as communication\\": Communication between human beings propels the evolution of a culture, he argues, but language also carries the histories, values, and aesthetics of a culture along with it. As he puts it, \\"Language as culture is the collective memory bank of a people's experience in history. Culture is almost indistinguishable from the language that makes possible its genesis, growth, banking, articulation, and indeed its transmission from one generation to the next\\" (15). Furthermore, in Decolonising the Mind, Ng≈©gƒ© sees language, rather than history or culture, as the enabling condition of human consciousness: \\"The choice of language and the use of language is central to a people's definition of themselves in relation to the entire universe. Hence language has always been at the heart of the two contending social forces in the Africa of the twentieth century\\" (4). = Imperialism = Imperialism can be said to over-arch nearly everything Ng≈©gƒ© wrote in his exile writings, particularly Decolonising the Mind. He gives imperialism many definitions in his writings which typically implicate capitalism, as well, including: \\"the rule of consolidated finance capital\\" (Decolonising the Mind, 2); \\"the conquest and subjugation of the entire labour force of other countries by concentrated capital\\"; and so on. Cook paraphrases Ng≈©gƒ©'s understanding of imperialism as he articulates in his work: \\"Imperialism disrupts the entire fabric of the lives of its victims: in particular their culture, making them ashamed of their names, history, systems of belief, languages, lore, art dance, song, sculpture, even the colour of their skin. It thwarts all its victims' forms and means of survival, and furthermore it employs racism.\\" = Imperialism and the \\"cultural bomb\\" = These discussions intersect as Ng≈©gƒ© grapples with language as both an insidious tool for imperialism as well as a weapon of resistance for colonized peoples. In his introduction, Ng≈©gƒ© asserts, \\"The study of African realities has for too long been seen in terms of tribes\\" (1). This is problematic for Ng≈©gƒ© because this perspective ignores imperialism's historical and contemporary role in the problems in Africa. And so, Ng≈©gƒ© proposes a different approach: \\"I shall look at the African realities as they are affected by the great struggle between the two mutually opposed forces in Africa today: an imperialist tradition on one hand, and a resistance tradition on the other\\" (2). Ng≈©gƒ© considers English in Africa a \\"cultural bomb\\" that continues a process of wiping out pre-colonial histories and identities: \\"The effect of the cultural bomb is to annihilate a people's belief in their names, in their languages, in their environments, in their heritage of struggle, in their unity, in their capacities and ultimately in themselves\\" (3). He argues that it leaves colonized nations \\"wastelands of non-achievement,\\" and leaves colonized peoples with the desire to \\"distance themselves from that wasteland\\" (3). He determines that \\"colonial alienation\\" is enacted by the \\"deliberate disassociation of the language of conceptualisation, of thinking, of formal education, of mental development, from the language of daily interaction in the home and in the community\\" (28). In Decolonising the Mind, Ng≈©gƒ© considers \\"colonial alienation,\\" ultimately an alienation from one's self, identity, and heritage, vis-a-vis linguistic oppression to be imperialism's greatest threat to the nations of Africa. Ng≈©gƒ© also engages with this issue on a distinctly personal level; when he chose to abandon English, he chose to enact out his own theory in practice. As one biographer points out, \\"Writing in Gikuyu, then, is Ngugi‚Äôs way not only of harkening back to Gikuyu traditions, but also of acknowledging and communicating their present.\\" However, due in large part to his faith in the working classes and \\"peasantry,\\" Ng≈©gƒ© remains hopeful. He insists that while indigenous African languages have been attacked by imperialism, they have survived largely because they are kept alive by the workers and peasantry, and he maintains that change will only happen when the proletariat is empowered by their own language and culture. = African authors = For Ng≈©gƒ©, because he theorizes language as the foundation and carrier of culture, the role of the writer in a neocolonial nation is inherently political. To write fiction in English is to \\"foster a neocolonial mentality.\\" On the other hand, writing in African languages is a blow to imperialism's systematic oppression. He advocates for African writers to reconnect with their \\"revolutionary traditions\\" of anti-imperialism in Africa (28). Ng≈©gƒ© also engages with this issue on a distinctly personal level; when he chose to abandon English, he chose to enact out his own theory in practice. As one biographer points out, \\"Writing in Gikuyu, then, is Ngugi‚Äôs way not only of harkening back to Gikuyu traditions, but also of acknowledging and communicating their present.\\" = Fanonean and Marxist influence = Ng≈©gƒ© is regarded as one of the most significant interpreters of Frantz Fanon, an influential figure in the field of post-colonial studies. Fanon gave careful attention to the violent ramifications of colonialism on the psyches of the colonized, and that the colonized individual was ‚Äústunted‚Äù by a ‚Äúdeeply implanted sense of degradation and inferiority.‚Äù Ng≈©gƒ© builds upon Fanon's post-colonial psychoanalysis by proposing art as a means of healing the trauma of colonialism. In Decolonising the Mind, Ng≈©gƒ© discusses, true to Fanon's form, the negative ramifications on the national consciousness as a result of racism, legalized bigotry, and dispossession. Lovesey notes that while Ng≈©gƒ©'s continuing ‚Äúadvocacy of African languages and their use in aiding the process of decolonization has roots in Fanon‚Äôs thinking,‚Äù his interests have ultimately moved beyond Fanon. Ng≈©gƒ© remains \\"sincerely committed\\" to the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and it is important to note that many liberation movements in Africa have had Marxist roots. As Ng≈©gƒ© once said in an interview: \\"The political literature of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was important and soon overshadowed Fanon. Or rather, Marx and Engels began to reveal the serious weaknesses and limitations of Fanon, especially his own petit bourgeois idealism that led him into mechanical overemphasis on psychology and violence, and his inability to see the significance of the rising and growing African proletariat.\\" Throughout Decolonising the Mind, Ng≈©gƒ© stores great faith in the African \\"peasantry.\\" He credits them with keeping native African languages alive, and maintains throughout the book that it will be the empowerment of the lower classes alone that will be able to \\"bring about the renaissance in African cultures\\" and ultimately uplift African nations from their neocolonial conditions of oppression (23). In Decolonising the Mind, while he runs with Fanon's idea that a rejection of the colonizers‚Äô linguistic and cultural forms is a precondition for achieving \\"true\\" freedom, Lovesey points out that ‚ÄúNg≈©gƒ© would always add that material circumstances must also change,\\" in keeping with the Marxist tradition of paying careful attention to material history. = Autobiographical elements = The autobiographical impulse of Decolonising the Mind allows for Ng≈©gƒ© to elegantly intertwine personal and national politics. The anecdotal perspective in Decolonising the Mind lends a certain accessibility to readers on political or theoretical issues that is missing from much of the typical and more disengaged academic discussions of linguistic imperialism and post- colonialism. For example, in \\"The Language of African Literature,\\" he details the trajectory of the 1884 Berlin Conference's evolution into the 1962 Makerere University College Conference on the Writers of English Expression as a way of illustrating how imperialism was able to indoctrinate even those who were conscious of and active in African literature. He had come to accept the Makerere conference as genuinely African, but he recounts how years later he was struck by his and others' blithe omission of many famous African language writers. He determines that in the 1962 Makerere conference, after \\"all the years of selective education and rigorous tutelage,\\" he and his contemporaries had been led to accept the \\"fatalistic logic of the unassailable position of English in our literature\\" (20). \\"The logic was embedded deep in imperialism,\\" he says. \\"And it was imperialism and its effects that we did not examine at Markere. It is the final triumph of a system of domination when the dominated start singing its virtues\\" (20). Furthermore, as Gikandi discusses, Ng≈©gƒ© places his own childhood and youth in a trajectory \\"that moves from linguistic harmony with his African community to a disjunctive relationship under the grip of the colonial language\\" in order to support his theory of language, part of which maintains that the native tongue promotes a view of the world that is shared by all members of the linguistic community. In the book, the anecdote operates as a bridge between the reader and the content, and it's part of what made it so popular. As one critic puts it, \\"Ng≈©gƒ© is a voice emanating from the heart of Africa and, more than a voice, a person suffering the price of exile for exercising freedoms of people in the West and elsewhere take for granted.\\"  Reception and criticism  In a short essay titled \\"Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o: In Praise of a Friend,\\" Gayatri Spivak, a fellow pioneer in post-colonial studies, remembers that Ng≈©gƒ© was a \\"hero\\" at the time of the appearance of Decolonising the Mind, which instantly became the \\"controversial classic it remains to this day\\": \\"His political commitment and courage, his imprisonment and exile, had given him an aura.\\" Decolonising the Mind was perfectly suited to its moment in Africa and relevant to neocolonial struggles in other nations, and it was quickly adopted to the canon of post-colonial studies in language. While Decolonising the Mind is in large part a reiteration of much Ng≈©gƒ©'s previous work on the topic, several critics commented that the book finally concentrates his work on language and imperialism, as much of it had previously existed fragmentarily in the form of lectures, interviews, and scattered articles. As far as a more critical reception is concerned, many critics have argued, most prominently Simon Gikandi, that Ng≈©gƒ©'s theory of language as purported in Decolonising the Mind ‚Äúfetishizes language as an ahistorical repository of an innate, romantic and cultural harmony. Gikandi asserts that despite Ng≈©gƒ©‚Äôs attempts to construct a theory of language that both defines communities and structures experiences, he is left with a forced harmonization: \\"no language can exist independent of the social ambition of its speakers or the ideological presuppositions behind the institution in which it is taught.\\" According to Gikandi, Ng≈©gƒ© proposes a theory of language that runs up against \\"all historical evidence\\" so that he may ‚Äúreconcile three conflicting perspectives on language: the materialist, the romantic, and the phenomenological.\\" Gikandi does concede, however, that the \\"real\\" value of Ng≈©gƒ©'s discourse on language ‚Äúlies in its reconceptualization of national identity and of the institutions of literary and cultural production as vehicles of this identity.‚Äù  Influence  = On his own authorship and the language debate = Gayatri Spivak, a pioneer of the subaltern studies school, notes the \\"timeliness\\" that Ng≈©gƒ©'s book manages to maintain in the debates among post-colonial scholars, both 1) about the emerging discussion on language and cultural globalization, as well as 2) the continuing \\"language question\\" for authors who write in \\"subaltern\\" languages. Speaking to Ng≈©gƒ©'s relevance to the first debate, Spivak notes that while globalization requires a few hegemonic languages in order to maintain international communication, in order to nurture \\"the impossible dream of a welfare-world globalization (by which she means 'using capital as socialism would'), this requirement must be supplemented by a deep immersion in that world's richness of language.\\" In other words, English has its uses, but nurturing and proliferating indigenous languages will only help to improve the more egalitarian projects of globalization. Spivak insists that Ng≈©gƒ©'s Decolonising the Mind paved the way for this perspective on globalization: \\"Ng≈©gƒ© was not simply arguing for his mother tongue, as his subsequent career has shown. He was also arguing for inhabiting non-hegemonic languages with the depth of imaginative use, while retaining English... as 'the first language of international communication'.\\" In approaching the second debate, Spivak reiterates Ng≈©gƒ©'s relevance to \\"language question\\" that has been facing post- colonial writers for decades: 'Decolonising the Mind has had a long history in a somewhat specific debate among African and Indian writers. Should one write in one's native language and achieve a small yet culturally prepared audience, or should one write in English and claim an international readership‚Äîbecome world literature instantly, as it were?\\". She adds, however, that \\"for Ng≈©gƒ© there was the additional desire to produce for a subaltern audience in the native language.\\" Ng≈©gƒ©, she notes, is caught in a \\"double bind\\"‚Äîbound by his desires to reach a global audience and to write to a \\"subaltern\\" language. Briefly in the 1980s, Ng≈©gƒ© made conference presentations in Gikuyu and published a significant critical essay in his mother tongue in the prestigious Yale Journal of Criticism. Ng≈©gƒ© did not keep his promise to never again write in English, however. He returned, without explanation, \\"to his familiar role as a critic of imperial European languages writing in English.\\" Gikandi notes that by the time Ng≈©gƒ© accepted a fellowship in the mid-1990s at New York University, \\"it was clear that Ng≈©gƒ©'s effort to use Gikuyu as the language of both his fiction and critical discourse had been defeated by the reality of exile and American professional life.\\" Gikandi notes that the \\"more complicated\\" problem with Ng≈©gƒ©'s unexplained return to English for students of his work is contextualizing and rectifying the decision with his politics of language.  Decolonising the Mind as pedagogy  Decolonising the Mind provides an empathetic pedagogical framework, as some critiques have noted. One critic of Ng≈©gƒ©'s work, who is also an English as a second language teacher, notes that exposure to texts like Ng≈©gƒ©'s cultivates empathy for the experiences and cultural contexts of people learning English as a second language, and those most affected by the \\"globalization of English as an industry.\\" Furthermore, Ng≈©gƒ© offers a \\"useful resource\\" for the growing use of narrative and autobiographical methods in TESOL research, and can be used to work to correct the \\"glaring absence\\" of non-Western authors, subjects, and publications.

She was an illustrator, educator, self-taught ornithologist and writer who commissioned the building of the Chimney Swifts' Tower which allowed her to be the first to study and demonstrate the life cycle of chimney swifts. Her career in ornithology also lead to her publishing more than 70 articles in scientific and ornithological journals and lead to her election as a member of the American Ornithologists' Union and inclusion in the Who's Who of Women in Science. Additionally, her work as an illustrator, particularly of the American goldfinch, inspired the Iowa Legislature to adopt the American goldfinch as the State bird. Early life and education Sherman's father Mark was a self-taught tanner and shoe maker, but once these techniques were taken up by large factories he turned his attention towards farming, turning their prairie farm into a rich agricultural resource. For this he received considerable personal success as a farmer. However, although his daughter, Althea, later wrote about the animal and plant life that vanished under this agricultural development, the work of her father provided the best education for her and supported her in her later life whilst she carried out research. Althea and her two older sisters, Amelia and Ada, often travelled 40 miles to an academy at Upper Iowa University to prepare for college. By the mid-19th century, a number of colleges offered courses to both women and men, but the oldest and best of these was Oberlin College in Ohio, in which all three girls enrolled. Amelia and Ada both started on courses to study medicine, but Althea took a different path and chose to dedicate herself to the study of art. Oberlin College maintained two separate degree routes: a classical and literary course. Althea was one of the highly motivated women who chose to follow the classical course, to which she later on attributed her success in her scientific career following her study of Greek and Latin. Following her graduation from Oberlin College in 1875 with an AB in Art, Althea started teaching before returning to Oberlin College in 1882 to study for a master's degree. Althea then continued her teaching, interspersed with periods of further training as an artist. She then went on to teach at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, leaving in 1885 to study at the Art Students League of New York. In 1887, Althea then moved to Wichita, Kansas to be closer to her older sister Ada. She then worked in Wichita until she returned to her hometown to look after her father who was gravely ill. In 1892, Althea became a supervisor of drawing at Tacoma Public Schools until she returned to Iowa in 1895 to care again for her father. Her father died in 1896 and Althea remained to care for her mother (Melissa Clark Sherman) until she died in 1902. Althea then remained in Iowa in her family home with her older sister, Dr. Amelia Sherman. Scientific career Following a 20-year career in the arts, Althea then took up a career in science, specifically ornithology, due to her skills as an observer and illustrator. Rather than killing any birds, Althea became a strong pioneer in the life study of birds, setting up nest boxes and creating feeding areas for birds to be observed. From her home in Iowa, Sherman subscribed to a total of 26 scientific and ornithological journals and joined 15 societies. Sherman used her skills as an artist to meticulously study and detail her observations and studies, publishing over 70 articles on 38 species over her career that spanned three decades. Articles were published in journals such as: * The Auk * The Audubon Society's Bird-Lore * Journal of Mammalogy * Avicultural Magazine. Her research led to her being elected as a member of the American Ornithologists' Union and inclusion in the Who's Who of Women in Science and American Men of Science. Chimney Swifts' Tower In 1915, Althea commissioned the building of a 28-foot tall, 9-foot square wooden tower which was designed to attract nesting chimney swifts for observation. A staircase ran through the center and doors and peepholes allowed Althea to be the first to observe and document the life cycle of the chimney swifts. The journals Althea created covered 18 years of data collection and over 400 pages of intricate detail on the birds. Nowadays, this remastered building - the only one of its kind, is visited by many tourists from nearby and abroad. Althea Sherman died aged 89 before she could publish a book on her chimney swift data. However, Fred J. Pierce published a number of copies (1,500) of Sherman's Birds of an Iowa Dooryard following her death.

She and her team were the first to publish evidence that the brain can change with experience and improve with enrichment, what is now called neuroplasticity. Her research on the brain of Albert Einstein helped fuel the ongoing scientific revolution in understanding the roles of glial cells in the brain. Her YouTube Integrative Biology lectures were the second most popular college course in the world in 2010. She was a professor of anatomy at the University of California, Berkeley. Other published research explored differences between the cerebral cortex of male and female rats, the link between positive thinking and immune health, and the role of women in science. Biography =Early life= Marian Cleeves was born in Glendale, California to Dr. Montague Cleeves and Rosa Marian Wamphler Cleeves as the sixth and last child in the family. Her father was an English physician and her mother a Latin teacher at Berkeley High School. Diamond grew up in La Crescenta. She was educated with her siblings near home at La Crescenta grammar school, Clark Junior High, Glendale High School and finally Glendale Community College, before going to University of California, Berkeley. She played tennis at Berkeley, earning a letter. =Career= After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1948, Diamond spent a summer at the University of Oslo, Norway before returning to Berkeley for her graduate studies, the first female graduate student in the department of anatomy. Her doctoral dissertation thesis \\"Functional Interrelationships of the Hypothalamus and the Neurohypophysis\\" was published in 1953. During obtaining her PhD degree, Diamond also began to teach, a passion that continued well into her eighties. Marian Diamond received her PhD degree in human anatomy. After working as a research assistant at Harvard University between 1952‚Äì53, Diamond became the first woman science instructor at Cornell University from 1955‚Äì58 where she taught human biology and comparative anatomy. Diamond returned to the University of California, Berkeley in 1960 in the role of lecturer. She joined an ongoing research project with psychologists David Krech, Mark Rosenzweig, and chemist Edward Bennett, as a neuroanatomist.Diamond, Marian Cleeves, (1998). Magic Trees of the Mind: How to Nurture Your Child's Intelligence, Creativity, and Healthy Emotions from Birth Through Adolescence. New York: Plume, Penguin Group. pp. 12-16. (pbk) By 1964, Diamond had the data and the first actual evidence in anatomical measurements showing the plasticity of the anatomy of the mammalian cerebral cortex. These results \\"opened the doors for our experiments to follow for the next 37 years.\\"Bennett EL, Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR,‚ÄúChemical and Anatomical Plasticity of the Brain‚Äù, ‚ÄúScience 1964:146:610-619‚Äù; retrieved February 9, 2017 UC Berkeley invited Diamond to be an Assistant Professor in 1965, progressing later to be a full professor, and finally, Professor Emeritus until her death in 2017. In 1984, Diamond and her associates had access to sufficient tissue from Einstein's brain to make the first ever analysis of it, followed by publication of their research.

Diamond produced the first scientific evidence of anatomical neuroplasticity in the early 1960s. At that time, the scientific consensus was that the nature of your brain was due to genetics and was unchangeable and fixed. Diamond showed that the structural components of the cerebral cortex can be altered by either enriched or impoverished environments at any age, from prenatal to extremely old age. Her initial anatomical experiment, and replication experiments, with young rats showed that the cerebral cortex of the enriched rats was 6% thicker than the cortex of the impoverished rats based on different kinds of early life experiences. An enriched cortex shows greater learning capacity while an impoverished one shows lesser learning capacity. These paradigm-changing results, published in 1964, helped to launch modern neuroscience.Bennett EL, Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR, \\"Chemical and Anatomical Plasticity of the Brain\\", \\"Science 1964:146:610-619\\", February 6, 2017 Einstein's Brain: In early 1984, Diamond received four blocks of the preserved brain of Albert Einstein from Thomas Stoltz Harvey. Harvey, pathologist of Princeton Hospital at the time of Einstein's death, had removed Einstein's brain during autopsy in 1955 and maintained personal possession of the brain. The fact that the Einstein brain tissue was already embedded in celloidin when the Diamond lab received it meant that their choice of methods of examination would be somewhat limited. However, they were able to successfully analyze both the superior prefrontal (area 9) and inferior parietal (area 39) association cortices of the left and right hemispheres of Einstein's brain and compare results with the identical regions in the control base of 11 human, male, preserved brains. From previous analysis of the eleven control brains, the Diamond lab \\"learned the frontal cortex did have more glial cells/neuron than the parietal cortex.\\"Diamond MC,Einstein's Brain?\\"Retrieved February 18, 2017 After many years of research, Diamond and her team had data proving that, in the rat brain, glial cells increased with enriched conditions, but did not increase with age.Diamond, Marian Cleeves (1988). Enriching Heredity: The Impact of the Environment on the Anatomy of the Brain.New York:The Free Press, A Division of Macmillan, Inc. p.48-49. Diamond and her associates discovered that the big difference in all four areas was in nonneuronal cells. Einstein had more glial cells per neuron than the average male brains of the control group. Importantly, the biggest difference was found in area 39 of the left hemisphere of Einstein's brain where the increase in the number of glial cells per neuron was statistically significantly greater than in the control brains. Astrocyte and oligodendrocyte glial cells were pooled for these results. Diamond demonstrated that the structural arrangement of the male and female cortices is significantly different and can be altered in the absence of sex steroid hormones. Diamond also showed that the dorsal lateral frontal cerebral cortex is bilaterally deficient in the immune deficient mouse and can be reversed with thymic transplants. In humans, cognitive stimulation increases circulating CD4-positive T lymphocytes, supporting the idea that immunity can be voluntarily modulated, in other words, that positive thinking can impact the immune system.

Such surfaces require an extremely water repellent super-hydrophobic surface and an elastic hairy structure in the millimeter range to entrap air while submerged. The Salvinia effect was discovered by the biologist and botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (University of Bonn) and his colleagues and has been investigated on several plants and animals since 2002. Publications and patents were published between 2006 and 2016.Barthlott, W., Wiersch, S., ƒåoliƒá, Z., & K.

The best biological models are the floating ferns (Salvinia) with highly sophisticated hierarchically structured hairy surfaces,Barthlott, W., Schimmel, T., Wiersch, S., Koch, K., Brede, M., Barczewski, M., Walheim, S., Weis, A., Kaltenmaier, A., Leder, A., & H.

Three of the ten known Salvinia species show a paradoxical chemical heterogenity: hydrophilic hair tips, in addition to the super-hydrophobic plant surface, further stabilizing the air layer.Ditsche- Kuru, P., Schneider, E.S., Melskotte, J.-E., Brede, M., Leder, A., & W. Barthlott, (2011) Superhydrophobic surfaces of the water bug Notonecta glauca: a model for friction reduction and air retention. Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology. 2(1). pp 137‚Äì144, DOI:10.3762/bjnano.2.17.  Salvinia, Notonecta and other organisms with air retaining surfaces  Immersed in water, extremely water repellent (super-hydrophobic), structured surfaces trap air between the structures and this air-layer is maintained for a period of time. A silvery shine, due to the reflection of light at the interface of air and water, is visible on the submerged surfaces. Long lasting air layers also occur in aquatic arthropods which breathe via a physical gill (plastron) e. g. the water spider (Argyroneta) and the saucer bug (Aphelocheirus) Air layers are presumably also conducive to the reduction of friction in fast moving animals under water, as is the case for the back swimmer Notonecta.Amabili, M., Giacomello, A., Meloni, S.,& C. M. Casciola, (2015) Unraveling the Salvinia Paradox: Design Principles for Submerged Superhydrophobicity. Advanced Materials Interfaces. 2(14). DOI:10.1002/admi.201500248. The best known examples for long term air retention under water are the floating ferns of genus Salvinia. About ten species of very diverse sizes are found in lentic water in all warmer regions of the earth, one widely spread species (S. natans) found in temperate climates can be even found in Central Europe. The ability to retain air is presumably a survival technique for these plants. The upper side of the floating leaves is highly water repellent and possesses highly complex and species-specific very distinctive hairs. Some species present multicellular free-standing hairs of 0.3‚Äì3 mm length (e. g. S. cucullata) while on others, two hairs are connected at the tips (e. g. S. oblongifolia). S. minima and S. natans have four free standing hairs connected at a single base. The Giant Salvinia (S. molesta'), as well as S. auriculata, and other closely related species, display the most complex hairs: four hairs grow on a shared shaft; they are connected at their tips. These structures resemble microscopic eggbeaters and are therefore referred to as ‚Äúeggbeater trichomes‚Äù. The entire leaf surface, including the hairs, is covered with nanoscale wax crystals which are the reason for the water repellent properties of the surfaces. These leaf surfaces are therefore a classical example of a ‚Äúhierarchical structuring‚Äú. The egg-beater hairs of Salvinia molesta and closely related species (e. g. Salvinia auriculata) show an additional remarkable property. The four cells at the tip of each hair (the anchor cells), as opposed to the rest of the hair, are free of wax and therefore hydrophilic; in effect, wettable islands surrounded by a super-hydrophobic surface. This chemical heterogeneity, the Salvinia paradox, enables a pinning of the air water interface to the plant and increases the pressure and longtime stability of the air layer.http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/weeds/publications/guidelines/wons/pubs/s-molesta.pdf The air retaining surface of the floating fern does not lead to a reduction in friction. The ecological extremely adaptable Giant Salvinia (S. molesta) is one of the most important invasive plants in all tropical and subtropical regions of the earth and is the cause of economic as well as ecological problems.Konrad, W., Apeltauer, C., Frauendiener, J., Barthlott, W., & A. Roth-Nebelsick, (2009) Applying methods from differential geometry to devise stable and persistent air layers attached to objects immersed in water. Journal of Bionic Engineering 6(4), pp 350‚Äì356, DOI: 10.1016/S1672-6529(08)60133-X Its growth rate might be the highest of all vascular plants. In the tropics and under optimal conditions, S. molesta can double its biomass within four days. The Salvinia effect, described here, most likely plays an essential role in its ecological success; the multilayered floating plant mats presumably maintain their function of gas exchange within the air-layer.  The working principle  190x190pxThe Salvinia effect defines surfaces which are able to permantently keep relatively thick air layers as a result of their hydrophobic chemistry, in combination with a complex architecture BMBF-Projekt PTJ-BIO/311965A: \\"Superhydrophobe Grenzfl√§chen ‚Äì ein m√∂gliches Potenzial f√ºr hydrodynamische technische Innovationen\\", Bonn 2002‚Äì2007. in nano- and microscopic dimensions. This phenomenon was discovered during a systematic research on aquatic plants and animals by Wilhelm Barthlott and his colleagues at the University of Bonn between 2002 and 2007.Solga, A., Cerman, Z., Striffler, B.F., Spaeth, M. & W.

(2009) Hierarchically Sculptured Plant Surfaces and Superhydrophobicity. Langmuir. 25(24), pp 14116‚Äì14120.DOI:10.1021/la9017322 . (1) hydrophobic surfaces chemistry in combination with (2) nanoscalic structures generate superhydrophobicity, (3) microscopic hierarchical structures ranging from a few mirco- to several millimeters with (4) undercuts and (5) elastic properties. Elasticity appears to be important for the compression of the air-layer in dynamic hydrostatic conditions.Ditsche, P., Gorb, E., Mayser, M., Gorb, S., Schimmel, T. & W. Barthlott. (2015) Elasticity of the hair cover in air-retaining Salvinia surfaces. Applied Physics A. DOI:10.1007/s00339-015-9439-y. An additional optimizing criterion is the chemical heterogeneity of the hydrophilic tips (Salvinia Paradox). This is a prime example of a hierarchical structuring on several levels. In plants and animals, air retaining salvinia effect surfaces are always fragmented in small compartments with a length of 0.5 to 8 cm and the borders are sealed against loss of air by particular microstructures.Balmert, A., Bohn, H.F., Ditsche-Kuru, P. & W. Barthlott. (2011) Dry under water: Comparative morphology and functional aspects of air- retaining insect surfaces. Journal of Morphology. 272(4), pp 442‚Äì451, DOI:10.1002/jmor.10921. Compartments with sealed edges are also important for technical applications. The working principle is illustrated in for the Giant Salvinia. The leaves of S. molesta are capable of keeping an air layer on its surfaces for a long time when submerged in water. If a leaf is pulled under water, the leaf surface shows a silvery shine. The distinctive feature of S. molesta lies in the long term stability. While the air layer on most hydrophobic surfaces vanishes shortly after submerging, S. molesta is able to stabilize the air for several days to several weeks. The time span is thereby just limited by the lifetime of the leaf. 242x242px The high stability is a consequence of a seemingly paradoxical combination of a superhydrophobic (extremely water repellent) surface with hydrophilic (water attractive) patches on the tips of the structures. When submerged under water, no water can penetrate the room between the hairs due to the hydrophobic character of the surfaces. However, the water is pinned to the tip of each hair by the four wax free (hydrophilic) end cells. This fixation results in a stabilization of the air layer under water. The principle is shown in the figure. Two submerged, air retaining surfaces are schematically shown: on the left hand side: a hydrophobic surface. On the right hand side: a hydrophobic surface with hydrophilic tips. If negative pressure is applied, a bubble is quickly formed on the purely hydrophobic surfaces (left) stretching over several structures. With increasing negative pressure the bubble grows and can detach from the surface. The air bubble rises to the surface and the air layer decreases until it vanishes completely. In case of the surface with hydrophilic anchor cells (right) the water is pinned to the tips of every structure by the hydrophilic patch on top. These linkages allow the formation of a bubble stretching over several structures; bubble release is suppressed because several links have to be broken first. This results in a higher energy input for the bubble formation. Therefore an increased negative pressure is needed to form a bubble able to detach from the surface and rise upwards.  Biomimetic technical application  168x168pxUnderwater air retaining surfaces are of great interest for technical applications. If a transfer of the effect to a technical surface is successful, ship hulls could be coated with this surface to reduce friction between ship and water resulting in less fuel consumption, fuel costs and reduction of its negative environmental impact (antifouling effect by the air layer).Klein, S.

Two flow profiles of laminar flow in water over a solid surface and water flowing over an air retaining surface are compared here. If water flows over a smooth solid surface, the velocity at the surface is zero due to the friction between water and surface molecules. If an air layer is situated between the solid surface and the water the velocity is higher than zero. The lower viscosity of air (55 times lower than the viscosity of water) reduces the transmission of friction forces by the same factor. Schematic illustration comparing the fluid dynamics of water along a solid surface and an air retaining surface: Directly at the solid surface the velocity of the water is zero due to the friction of water molecules and surface (left). In the case of the air retaining surface (right) the air layer serves as a slip agent. Due to the low viscosity of the air, the water is able to move on the air-water-interface which means a drag reduction and a velocity higher than zero. Researchers are currently working on the development of a biomimetic, permanently air retaining surface modeled on S. molesta Tricinci, O., Terencio, T.,Mazzolai, B., Pugno, N., Greco, F. & V.

Despite her debilitating chronic eye conditions she was successful in editing volumes of textbooks, her own papers, and directing many master's degree students. She earned her undergraduate degree from Wellesley College in 1889. She went on to obtain her doctorate from Cornell University in 1898. She held several teaching positions over the course of her career and was a member of several influential organizations including the American Psychological Association (APA). Gamble was a distinguished and well- liked professor at Wellesley College for more than two decades, and by 1930 she was the head of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology following the death of Mary Whiton Calkins. At the time of her death she was professor of psychology and director of the psychological laboratory at Wellesley College.  Personal life  = Education = Gamble's education began in 1889 when she graduated with her bachelor's degree Wellesley College, MA. She then went on to pursue her PhD at Cornell University, one of the few schools accepting women in this time period. During this time, she began to study smell under her supervisor E. B. Titchener and wrote her doctoral thesis ‚ÄúThe Applicability of Weber‚Äôs Law to Smell‚Äù.Fancher, Raymond; Rutherford, Alexandra (2017). Pioneers of Psychology. Norton. p. 306. .

Later in her life, she began to develop glaucoma in her right eye after her first study abroad trip to Europe. Her vision continually worsened throughout her life despite several surgical operations.  Career  Gamble's thesis Eleanor Gamble received her PhD under Edward B. Titchener at Cornell in 1898. Next, she began teaching in her home state of Ohio, then New York, before being offered a teaching position in the philosophy and psychology department at her alma mater, Wellesley, all in 1898. At Wellesley she taught and specialized in experimental psychology. Gamble became an associate professor of psychology in 1903, and full professor seven years later in 1910. In her time as an associate professor, Gamble received a postdoctoral research grant to study with M√ºller in Germany in 1906. After returning from Germany, Gamble became the director of the psychological laboratory at Wellesley, previously run by Mary Whiton Calkins. From this position, Gamble supervised psychological research until the 1931.

She was a beloved teacher and was even elected as an honorary member of the class of 1926 at Wellesley College. Wellesley College has a series of stained glass windows in their chapel, including one dedicated to Eleanor Gamble on 17 June 1939. It was gifted to the college by her classmates of 1889. The window features multiple images, including a woman with a pen and book, and an owl to symbolize wisdom. The second is an image of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals. Gamble loved animals and had multiple cocker spaniels whom she cared for greatly. The window has an inscription, 'Wisdom, expressive of the great teacher'. Her funeral was held at Wellesley College, and one of her colleagues, T. Proctor, gave a eulogy.

The total spending authorized by the bill is classified, but estimates based on intelligence leaks made by Edward Snowden indicate that the budget could be approximately $50 billion. The bill was introduced into and passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 would authorize FY2014-FY2015 appropriations for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI); (2) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (3) United States Department of Defense (DOD); (4) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (5) National Security Agency (NSA); (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Coast Guard; (8) Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy (DOE), and Justice (DOJ); (9) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (10) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); (11) National Reconnaissance Office; (12) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and (13) United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bill would specify that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2014, and as of September 30, 2015, respectively, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations for FY2014 and FY2015, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President. The bill would allow the DNI to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2014 or FY2015 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions. The bill would require notification to the intelligence committees on the use of such authority. The bill would require the DNI to establish guidelines to govern the treatment under such authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student or trainee program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long term, full-time training. The bill would authorize appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY2014 and FY2015, as well as for personnel positions for elements within such Account. The bill would authorize appropriations for FY2014 and FY2015 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. The bill would permit appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. The bill would prohibit the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Section 309 An amendment to the bill in December added Section 309, which statutorily authorized the retention of communications involving United States person for a period of five years with various exemptions the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized as \\"massive loopholes\\" in the law. This prompted Representative Justin Amash to force the roll call vote and send a letter to representatives calling for them to vote against the legislation. A petition to call for president Obama veto the bill on grounds of unconstitutionality was created, and is due to complete on January 10th 2015. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on May 22, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4681 would authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for intelligence activities of the U.S. government. Since the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not provide estimates for classified programs, this estimate addresses only the unclassified aspects of the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4681 would cost about $500 million over the 2015-2019 period, subject to the appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. Section 104 would authorize appropriations of $528 million and $505 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the Intelligence Community Management Account (ICMA). The ICMA provides the principal source of funding for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and resources for managing the intelligence agencies. Because CBO anticipates that the bill would be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2015, we estimate that this provision would not affect spending in 2014. However, assuming the appropriation of the amount authorized for fiscal year 2015, CBO estimates that implementing section 104 would cost about $330 million in fiscal year 2015 and about $500 million over the 2015-2019 period. Section 603 would extend through 2018 the authorization for the Public Interest Declassification Board. The board advises the President on the government‚Äôs standards and procedures for releasing and declassifying information. Based on information from the National Archives, CBO estimates that implementing this provision would cost less than $500,000 over the 2015-2019 period. Enacting H.R 4681 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. Section 201 would authorize the appropriation of $514 million for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System for both fiscal years 2014 and 2015 (CIARDS). Appropriations to CIARDS are considered mandatory and fund various unfunded liabilities of the system. However, because the amounts authorized are the same as the amounts projected in the CBO baseline, CBO does not ascribe any additional cost to this provision. H.R. 4681 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. On February 5, 2014, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S. 1681, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on November 12, 2013. S. 1681 would authorize the appropriation of $569 million for fiscal year 2014, or $41 million more than the amount authorized in H.R. 4681. However, unlike our estimate for S. 1681, CBO does not ascribe any cost to that authorization because we expect that H.R. 4681 would not be enacted until near the start of fiscal year 2015. Other differences in the estimated costs of S. 1681 and H.R. 4681 reflect differences between the two bills. Procedural history The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 20, 2014 by Rep. Mike Rogers (R, MI-8). The bill was referred to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The bill was reported alongside House Report 113-463. On May 30, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 271 to pass the bill 345-49. The United States Senate received the bill on June 2, 2014, and referred it to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It was passed on December 9, 2014, with a voice vote and then referred to the House where it passed 325-100 on December 10, 2014, following a roll call vote. Debate and discussion According to news website TechCrunch, Reps. Justin Amash, Zoe Lofgren, and Jared Polis, three \\"voices usually associated with stronger takes on needed reform of the intelligence organs of the United States\\" all voted against the bill. Alex Wilhelm described the passage of the bill as being part of a \\"somewhat dispiriting period for those in favor of reformation of the National Security Agency and its ilk.\\" Rep. Mike Rogers, who sponsored the bill, argued that the controversies as a result of the global surveillance disclosures had left Americans with the wrong impression of intelligence activities. Rogers said that \\"we have somehow decided over the last year that our intelligence services are the problem... they are part of the solution.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Intelligence Authorization Act References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4681 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4681 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4681 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4681 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4681 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4681 *House Report 113-463 on H.R. 4681 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4681 Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015"},{"id":"42744777","text":"Fernando Espino Ar√©valo (born 22 February 1949) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico.

A native of Ohio, he traveled to Kansas and California in the late 19th century. Returning East by way of Indian Territory, he participated with his brother, Herman, in the Land Rush of 1889 for the Unassigned Lands. Afterward, he sold his claim and settled in the new town of Edmond. He became an early wildcatter and oil producer. His most notable accomplishment was the discovery of the Glenn Pool oilfield. O'Dell, Larry. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Galbreath Robert (1863 ‚Äì 1953).\\" Retrieved May 12, 2014. Early life Robert Galbreath Jr. was born to Robert and Sarah A. (n√©e Hill) Galbreath on a farm in Pickaway County, Ohio on December 23, 1863.Thoburn, Joseph B. A Standard History of Oklahoma. Volume IV. American Historical Society. 1916. He evidently lived there until he decided to go to Kansas in 1884, where he met with David L. Payne. Payne would later achieve notability as leader of the Boomers (Oklahoma settlers) in Indian Territory. However, Galbreath did not join the movement, but traveled on to California in 1889. It would seem that he did not find what he was seeking, because he returned to Indian Territory in 1889. Robert was joined by his younger brother, Herman. They entered the 1889 Land Rush for the Unassigned Lands. The pair claimed land near the present town of Hennessey. They soon sold the claim and moved to Edmond, where Robert served as town marshall and then deputy U.S. Marshal. Settling in Indian Territory Robert held a variety of jobs after arriving in Edmond, including serving as postmaster and starting a newspaper. In 1892, he married Mary Ellen Kivlehen. Robert participated in the 1893 Cherokee Outlet. Following that experience, he moved his family to Perry, where he published the Perry Evening Democrat. In 1895, he was appointed as a United States Commissioner headquartered in Shawnee. (At this time, to have a case for federal court, a commissioner was tasked to decide if enough evidence existed). In 1899, Galbreath moved to Oklahoma City to open a real estate business. There, he formed a business partnership with Charles Colcord. Wildcatting Galbreath's career in the oil business began when he and Colcord became partners with Charles \\"Gristmill\\" Jones to drill a wildcat well in the newly discovered Red Fork field near Tulsa. The well became a successful producer, providing Galbreath with enough money to continue wildcatting. He then partnered with Frank Chesley and bought a lease on a farm that belonged to Ida E. Glenn and her husband Robert. Ida was a mixed-blood Creek Indian, while Robert was white. She had received the land by allotment. Galbreath reportedly paid about three cents per acre for the lease.Franks, Kenny Arthur. Oklahoma: The Land and Its People. (1994) p. 32. Galbreath named the well \\"Ida Glenn No. 1.\\" The two men operated the drilling rig themselves. On November 22, 1905, it produced a gusher and initiated a major oil boom in the area. The gusher was the first strike in a very large field that Galbreath named Glenn Pool. It became the state's largest oil field. Galbreath moved to Tulsa to continue his activities in the oil fields. Galbreath continued to drill two more producing wells in the Glenn Pool field. Together, these three wells earned him the names \\"Oil King of the Southwest\\" and \\"the richest man in Oklahoma.\\" Davenport, Linda Haas. \\"History of Glenpool, Oklahoma.\\" Retrieved May 13, 2014. In 1907, he drilled the first producing well in the Bald Hill Field in Okmulgee County. In 1909 he sold his Glenn Pool holdings to J. E. Crosbie and turned his attention to politics. He defeated W. Tate Brady in the 1912 election for National Committeeman of the Democratic Party. Other business interests His other business interests included building the three-story Galbreath Hotel in the town of Bromide, where he intended to develop a health spa based on the local mineral water. The Great Depression caused the idea to fail. He also attempted to mine iron and manganese in southeastern Oklahoma.

She studied tuberculosis with Albert Calmette and Camille Gu√©rin in Lille, then worked with Jules Bordet in Brussels and also with Am√©d√©e Borrel at the Institute of Health in Strasbourg. In 1924 she was again sent to France for training in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute and in the laboratory of Alexandre Besredka. There she met Charles Nicolle during his annual conference on typhus, changing the course of her life. In 1925, the Pasteur Institute financed her research with Nicolle into epidemic typhus in Tunisia. She spent time during 1927-28 at the Pasteur Institute in Tunis and continued her vaccination trials against typhus using repeated injections of small doses of an attenuated strain. She obtained her first tenured academic post in 1928 as an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Warsaw, presenting her doctoral thesis on 'Probl√®mes de la vaccination contre le typhus exanth√©matique' ('The problems of vaccinations against typhus exanthematique') and was subsequently the Professor of Bacteriology. She managed microbiology training and actively participating in medical societies in Poland and the Warsaw branch of the French Soci√©t√© de biologie into the 1930s. In 1931, she was sent by the government, along with Charles Nicolle, to study epidemic typhus in Mexico and Guatemala. In 1933 she went with Nicolle to join the Pasteur Institute in Tunis as laboratory chief and introduced the Weigl approach for vaccine production. Her transfer of expertise in the laboratory culture of lice was important for progress against typhus at the Pasteur Institute, Tunis by herself and others. This included development of a vaccine, trials of insecticides and isolation of bacteria that were the causal agents of typhus and typhus-like fevers. From 1935 she worked on a murine virus as a potential basis of anti-typhoid vaccine and in 1940 she and Paul Durand developed the Durand-Sparrow anti-typhoid vaccine. She also worked to culture the agent of spotted fever as a prelude to a vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever. She was allowed to continue working at the Pasteur Institute until 1961 as 'Chef de Service', beyond the compulsory retirement age and from 1949 was the Head of the vaccine service, immunising against tuberculosis. From 1955 she was in charge of work on relapsing fever in Ethiopia for the World Health Organization. Personal life She married Baron Robert von Kuegelgen in 1917, a surgeon in the Russian army, and they had a daughter, Marie Bogna Seiler von Kugelgen. They eventually separated. Following her move to Tunis, she became a French citizen in 1933. In October 1933 she married Phillippe Germa, an agriculturalist. During the Second World War she hosted French refugees (including Andr√© Gide) and Polish deserters in Tunis. Gide arrived in December 1942 while it was occupied by German and Italian troops, remaining until May 1943 when French, British and American forces re-took the city and he was able to travel to Algiers. During this time he recorded in his journal that Sparrow was present at or hosted several lunch engagements for mutual friends within the French community. Gide also recounts how Sparrow narrowly escaped death during bombing raids. On 1 January 1943, while she was in the building, a bomb fell on the ground-floor apartment where Sparrow lodged with the Boutelleau family, but it did not explode. Five days later, on 6 January, bombs destroyed two adjacent houses. Sparrow and her second husband planted an orange orchard together in Soukra, near Tunis. During the final French withdrawal from Tunis, the couple left Tunisia to retire to Corsica. She died at Pietranera in Corsica in 1970.

Location It is located 1 mile north of the main city, in Motithang. The school shares its border with Jigme Namgyel lower secondary school. The Assembly Ground Academic Session For all the government school in Bhutan, the academic year is February‚ÄìDecember. The two weeks summer break commences from first day of July. Houses The school named each of their houses after the current King of Bhutan, His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck as a mark of utmost respect. They are: #Druk House #Gyalpo House #Jigme House #Khesar House #Namgyel House #Wangchuck House Each house is being led by a house master and a house mistress and a group of teachers. A total of four student representatives are being elected to work in the house administration. A boy and a girl vice captain are selected yearly from the eleventh graders and then promoted to full house captains in the following year.  Education  The subjects for the ninth and tenth grader include Mathematics,English, Dzongkha, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Economics, History and Geography. The medium of instruction is English for all subjects except for the Dzongkha course. Entrance to the eleventh and twelfth grades would require an individual to obtain higher marks than the required baseline i.e. the cut- off percentage for entering into government high school. The courses for the eleventh and twelfth grader are divided into three major streams. They are *Science Courses in this field include English, Dzongkha, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science(only for I.T Students) and Mathematics/Biology as a choice. *Commerce Courses in this field include English, Dzongkha, Commerce, Accountancy, Business-Mathematics and Economics/Computer Science as a choice. *Arts and Humanities Courses in this field include English, Dzongkha, History, Geography and Rigzhung .English literature/Business Mathematics and Economics/Computer Science stands as a choice. Faculty The school is now headed by Madam Jigme Choden, the principal of Changzamtog Lower Secondary School earlier. The vice principals for the school are Mrs. Tashi Choezom and Mr. Pema Wangchuk. The school is run by a faculty of 70 staffs. The faculty consists of fourteen non-teaching staffs (approx.) helping in school's management. Student Body ‚Äì Student Representative Council (SRC) The Council consists of two presidents, two vice presidents, the general captains and PYP (Police Youth Partnership) volunteers. The student council serves as an important consultative body in the school's management, helping the school in matters concerning the students.

The Battle of San Francisco de Macoris took place on 29 November 1916 during the early stages of the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic. Dominican forces in San Francisco de Macoris had refused to lay down their arms and had taken control of the local fortress. This was in direct violation of the terms imposed by the military government installed by the United States. A small squad of Marines that were close by were able to make their way inside the fortress and surprise the defenders, securing it before any organized resistance could take place.Musicant, I, The Banana Wars, 1990, New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., Background On 13 May 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. Three days after Arias left the country, Marines landed and took control of the country within two months, and in November the United States imposed a military government under Rear Admiral Harry Shepard Knapp. The Marines confiscated some 53,000 firearms (mostly ancient muskets), 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 14,000 edged weapons. In San Francisco de Macoris, however, the situation was somewhat different. Juan Perez, the provisional governor, and a band of followers had occupied a local fort and refused to lay down their arms. This was a direct violation of the directives that were promulgated by the military government installed by the United States. In the town, some 30 miles southeast of Santiago, was one company of the 4th Marine Regiment: the 31st. They had allowed a few hundred supporters of Arias to barricade themselves in the fortaleza. During this time the Marines were being sniped at from inside the fortress and relations with civilians in the town was deteriorating because of the indecisiveness of the Marine commander. Eventually the 31st Company would be reinforced by the 47th Company and First Lieutenant Ernest C. Williams, would take over command. He decided to forcibly oust the Dominicans from their stronghold after they refused to evacuate their positions inside the fortress. The Battle During the night of 29 November Lieutenant Williams along with twelve marines crept as close to the entrance of the fort as was possible without arousing suspicion. On a signal from Lieutenant Williams, the marines made a dash for the open gate. The Dominicans, taken by surprise, were unable to slam the gate closed. The rebels were nonetheless able to let loose with a fusillade from the fort which cut down eight of the Marines in their rush for the gate. Williams and the remaining four men pushed their way through the entrance, firing their weapons as they burst into the fort. After a fierce, ten-minute firefight the fort was secured and the fight was over. During the battle some two-hundred of Perez's followers were able to escape the fort but another one-hundred were forced to surrender inside the fortalezas. Eight of the twelve US Marines were wounded during the battle First Lieutenant Williams received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. This engagement was the last organised resistance, which the 4th Marine Regiment encountered in the Dominican Republic, although minor patrol actions continued to occur for some time.

Aside from her interest in physics, Jones enjoyed hobbies such as gardening at her garden in Meadowbrook Park, south of Urbana, and kayaking. She grew many vegetables at her garden and gave them out amongst her students and colleagues. She would also spend a summer month on an island in Lake Vermillion every year. Jones was very much a nature enthusiast along with being a physicist. Education and career Jones was interested in the application of computers to physics education and championed the cause of women in physics. access date 13/5/2014 She wrote an essay entitled \\"Intellectual Contributions of Women in Physics\\" in Women of Science: Righting the Record. She studied at Harvard, concentrating on mathematics, and graduated magna cum laude in 1964. From Harvard she moved on to Caltech receiving an M.Sc. in 1966 and Ph.D. in 1968. She became an associate professor of physics at Illinois in 1974, later becoming a full professor. Her research was in high-energy physics, particularly the force binding nuclear particles to quarks. Her career in research on theoretical high-energy focused on four things: Regge pole theory, phenomenological models of photomeson production, jet calculus in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and use of Grassmann coordinates to describe internal symmetries. She took a sabbatical in 1981‚Äì1982 to work at CERN, becoming a fellow of the American Physical Society in the division of particles and fields in 1982. She became director of the university's Education Research Laboratory in the year 1992, remaining at the University of Illinois for her whole career and publishing a total of 64 papers based on her research. Research in Illinois She investigated photoproduction of energized mesons with H.W. Wyld. She examined the truth of the A1 state through watchful fractional wave investigation of the response and affirmed the presence of that pivotal meson by means of the supposed Deck mechanism. This drove her to work out the outcomes of hadronic enchant creation through a \\"gluon combination\\" demonstrate and to anticipate the principal highlights of bound quark-antiquark generation, especially the vitality reliance. She then began research in the domain of partons and QCD. As a team with Migneron and others, she could create equations in the jet calculus of partons, where the viable propagators developed down instead of up, as in the Altarelli‚ÄìParisi plot. She in this way reproduced jets through Monte Carlo strategies, indicating how QCD falls from quarks and gluons can, on a basic level, be recognized. She then classified jets through the longitudinal connections between hard particles produced in the hadronic jets. She ended up being intrigued by the utilization of concealed Grassmann factors for comprehension and ordering molecule symmetries. In work with Delbourgo and White, she explained the anharmonic Grassmann oscillator, which is the fermionic simple of the common anharmonic oscillator. She went ahead to create Dirac-like equations of movement, which incorporated the Grassmann variables in a general sense, and acquired quantized mass spectra, showing the helpfulness of such thoughts.  Death  Lorella Jones died on February 9, 1995, aged 51. She died in a nursing home in Champaign, Illinois. The cause of her death was cancer.

Some 7,000 Polish Jews were imprisoned there from all neighbouring settlements for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. Two years later, beginning 21 August 1942 during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in occupied Poland, they were rounded up ‚Äì men, women and children ‚Äì and deported to Treblinka extermination camp aboard Holocaust trains.Statistical data compiled on the basis of \\"Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland\\" by Virtual Shtetl Museum of the History of the Polish Jews , as well as \\"Getta ≈ªydowskie,\\" by Gedeon, and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters at Deathcamps.org . Accessed 23 April 2014. In the process of Ghetto liquidation, some 1,300 Jews were summarily executed by the SS in the streets of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki. History Following the September 1939 Nazi- Soviet invasion of Poland, on 25 October 1940 a ghetto was created in Mi≈Ñsk east of Warsaw, around the heavily shelled town square, and along the streets of Siennicka, Nadrzeczna, Mostowa and Warszawska. Some 5,000 Jews were forced to relocate there from all over the city, which was followed by the ghetto expansion with more dispossessed Jews brought in from Ka≈Çuszyn, Kalisz, Lipno, and Pabianice. Those confined within the boundaries of the ghetto were allowed starvation rations by the SS for unreasonable amounts of money. Whenever possible, they received help from the non-Jewish Poles on the outside who smuggled food, and passed around kennkartes forged by the underground. Such activity presented a grave danger due to the presence of the German minority in Mi≈Ñsk serving with the local Sonderdienst battalion (the gun-wielding Sonderdienst were formed by Gauleiter Frank on 6 May 1940). Among the Polish Righteous were Helena and Julian Grobelny, President of ≈ªegota, who harbored over a dozen Jewish activists in their home nearby.Irena 'Jolanta' Sendlerowa, Julian Grobelny i jego ≈ºona Helena, FKCh \\"ZNAK\\" - 1999-2008\\\\. Internet Archive. There were also Christian Poles executed by the SS under the charge of aiding Jews. =Ghetto resistance= Memorial to the Holocaust victims at the Jewish cemetery in Mi≈Ñsk The underground resistance formed in the ghetto in mid 1941 and began planning an escape to freedom. Donations were collected for the purpose of buying weapons. A Jewish fund-raising was organized in June and July 1942. However, the very next month a ghetto liquidation action began on 21 August, commanded by SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Schmidt, the chief of Mi≈Ñsk Gestapo. Some 5,000 Jews were loaded onto freight trains, locked in and sent away to Treblinka on the following day. Most of the remaining 1,000 to 1,300 Jews (many attempting to hide) were shot at various locations around town, along with all members of the Judenrat including its president Mosze Kramarz, his deputy Majer Bryks, as well as Jankiel Popowski, Hil Morgensztern, Mosze Wajnberg, Mr. Bressler, Mr. S≈Ço≈Ñ, Mr. Sztutman and others murdered behind the SS building on 35 Warszawska street. Several hundred men were allowed to live and split into prisoner work battalions, temporarily. The first group composed of 150 men was placed at the prewar iron foundry K. Rudzki i S-ka taken over by the Nazis, which was located at 55 Pi≈Çsudskiego street. The second group of around 500 men was moved to the premises of the Public School Nr 1 at 39 Siennicka street, as the work force for German company Wolf & Goebel. Kreishauptmann Bittrich on 12 December 1941. The final wave of mass shootings began several months later. A large group of Jews from the school building (renamed Camp Kopernikus) were transported to the Jewish cemetery on 24 December 1942 and murdered there; those who remained (around 250 slave workers) were killed on 10 January 1943 following the Kopernikus prisoner revolt. The SS surrounded the premises planning a deportation action, but the prisoners locked themselves inside and resisted, putting the SS in a state of shocked disbelief. After a struggle, the building was eventually set on fire and burned down with the Jews inside. Meanwhile, at the K. Rudzki foundry (renamed Krupp AG) over 100 Jewish workers were extracted on 5 June 1943, and executed as the last. The Ghetto was no more. An underground resistance movement developed in Mi≈Ñsk, and later the Polish Home Army (AK) got a chance to retaliate. On 22 July 1943 the Gestapo chief Schmidt was ambushed and shot by the partisans. At the end of the German occupation of Poland, Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki was liberated not by the advancing Red Army, but by the Polish soldiers of the AK who entered the town ahead of them. Although 250 Jews of Mi≈Ñsk are known to have survived ‚Äì many of them saved by the Polish families on the \\"Aryan\\" side of the city (including those who managed to escape Treblinka deportations), the prewar Jewish community was effectively wiped out in Mi≈Ñsk during the Holocaust. There was no-one, and nothing to go back to, after the war ended. The community, which had thrived since 1768, ceased to exist entirely. It has not been re-established.

Pictures. It was written by David Feeney and John Quaintance. Its story follows a police officer assigned to protect the widow of a drug boss from corrupt cops and criminals who want her dead as they race through Texas to avoid detection. It stars Reese Witherspoon and Sof√≠a Vergara. The film was produced by New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Pacific Standard and was released on May 8, 2015. It grossed $13.9 million during its opening weekend and $51.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $35 million. It received negative reviews from critics, and has a 7% approval rating based on 172 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot Rose Cooper is a San Antonio Police Department officer whose work ethic is too intense. Following an incident in which the mayor's son yells \\"Shotgun!\\", setting him on fire by tasing him while he carried an alcoholic drink, Cooper's ineptness in the field has her assigned to the evidence locker. Cooper's commanding officer, Captain Emmett, gives her a secret assignment to join Deputy US Marshal Jackson, protecting Felipe Riva and his wife Daniella. Riva must go to Dallas to testify against notorious cartel leader Vicente Cortez. At the Riva home, a pair of masked assassins and a different pair of assassins kill Jackson and Felipe while Cooper and Daniella are upstairs. Daniella grabs one suitcase, containing many pairs of shoes, and the ladies flee in Riva's car. When Daniella later tries to run off, Cooper handcuffs herself to her. The ladies are found by Cooper's fellow officers Dixon and Hauser. When Cooper notices a tattoo that reveals the officers are one of the assassin teams, they escape and head for Dallas, where Daniella can testify against Cortez. The ladies learn that Cooper is now labelled a fugitive, fleeing with Daniella. A truck plows into the car, spraying hidden cocaine everywhere. Cooper gets the truck driver to drop them at a clothing store, where Daniella and the very stoned Cooper change their clothing. When the pair of assassins show up, the ladies stow away in a trailer hooked to a pickup truck. When the truck stops, Cooper tries to steal it when the owner, Red, reappears with a gun. Cooper and Daniella flee, find another pickup truck, and drive away. The ladies continue bonding, with Cooper admitting that her rigid and by-the-books nature has made it difficult to find a man. They are surprised to find a man named Randy sleeping in the back of the truck. Randy is a felon with an ankle bracelet due to viciously assaulting his sisters' abusive boyfriends. Cooper agrees to take off the bracelet in return for Randy's help. Daniella is pleased to see Randy flirting with Cooper. Daniella explains that her bag of shoes which were thought to be studded with fake diamonds are in fact studded with $4 million in real diamonds, revealing Cortez's money laundering method. When Dixon and Hauser appear and shoot at the ladies, Randy attacks Hauser, allowing the ladies to run. Cooper sneaks into Cortez's daughter's Quincea√±era as a man to get close to Daniella, and tries to get her to wear a wire so that they can get Cortez to confess to her brother's murder, but a woman walking into the bathroom mistakes Cooper for a pervert and throws her out. She gets back into the party, running into Emmett and learning that he is working for Cortez. He pulls a gun on her, but Cooper pours alcohol on him and tases him so he catches fire. Daniella corners Cortez and reveals her intentions to kill him. Cooper arrives and stops Daniella, but when Cortez draws a gun Cooper shoots him dead.

She holds a B.A. in Latin American Studies from The University of Colorado at Boulder and an M.A. in Archaeology from the University of the Americas After her graduate studies, Ridinger lived in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and worked on a number of archeological digs in the country, including the excavation preceding the construction of Mexico City's subway system. She is known for her discovery of the in-situ jade quarry sites in Guatemala that had been lost since the time of the Spanish Conquest of the Americas. Discovery of Guatemalan Jade Sources Ridinger is widely regarded among scholars as the first archaeologist to discover the in-situ locations of the pre-Columbian Maya jadeite jade quarry areas.https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203935604577066063066160448 In 1975, In partnership with her late husband Jay Ridinger, Mary Lou Ridinger discovered three distinct sources for jadeite in the Motagua river valley of Guatemala, and also discovered tools and other indications that pre-Columbian Maya artisans had worked the material at the source site. In years that followed, Ridinger and her husband discovered new types of jade that had previously been unknown, uncovering in 1987 a dark colored jade with pyrite inclusions now dubbed \\"Galactic Jade\\" and followed in 1998 by the discovery of a lavender variety of jadeite. Jade Enterprise in Guatemala Jadeite crafts and jewelry is now a staple craft industry in Guatemala. In 1975, Mary Lou and Jay Ridinger opened Jades S.A., the first post-conquest jade workshop in the western hemisphere, and began training stone carvers to work with the very dense mineral. She is recognized by such organizations as The Explorers Club and the Marquis Who's Who as the founder of the modern jade business in Guatemala. Notable figures such as President Bill Clinton and actor Robert Redford have visited her business in Antigua Guatemala and commended her work. Jades S.A. is now frequently visited by foreign dignitaries as well as local government officials and houses a sizeable museum wing illustrating the history and timeline of the use of jadeite by the Maya and pre-Maya inhabitants of Central America.

In the same year, Thomas married Mary Clements, set himself up as a grocer, and moved to a property on the High Street near Bristol Bridge. Both Thomas and his wife joined the Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers, in which they suffered both fines and imprisonment for their beliefs. In 1674 Thomas bought a country estate at Elberton, Gloucestershire for ¬£700. He didn't take residence, but gained income from the associated rents for tenants and farmers. However, from 1681 financial difficulties forced him to lease out the estate on a long term arrangement to his son-in-law, James Wallis. In 1688, Thomas built four houses on land formerly known as Castle Precincts. Taking one for himself, he rent the other three out, and rented his former house on the High Street to his son Thomas Goldney II and his family. Thomas Goldney I died in 1694, his wife Mary died in 1709. =Thomas Goldney II= Born in Bristol in 1664, in 1687 he married Hannah Speed, the daughter of merchant Thomas Speed. As his father was a freeman, Thomas II achieved the same level the following year through being the son of a free burgess. From 1688 he took over the family grocery business, but also invested in other ventures, including: merchant ships; farmland at Elberton; as well as acting as an agent for the Collector of Customs for the Port of Bristol. Having invested in land at Clifton, from 1694 Thomas leased an adjoining country estate complete with a manor house, which after purchase in 1705 for ¬£100 he named Goldney Hall. Manillas - exchanging currency 'bracelets', which became known as slave trade money used to acquire slaves in West Africa. Thomas became the principal shareholder for Captain Woodes Rogers' voyage on the Duke and her sister ship Dutchess. Rogers' crew rescued the real-life Robinson Crusoe, Alexander Selkirk, from Juan Fernandez island. However, shortly after the ships sailed, Thomas ran into a series of legal difficulties, and was jailed over a debt from 1708 to 1710. In 1711, Woodes Rogers returned to Bristol, and for an initial investment of ¬£3,726 Thomas received payments ¬£6,800, a huge amount by today's standards. This enabled him in 1713 to make a large investment in Abraham Darby I ironworks at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. With costs escalating, in April 1713 Darby mortgaged half of the Coalbrookdale works to Thomas for ¬£1,700. After Abraham Darby I died intestate in 1717, Thomas protected his assets by acquiring 8 of the 16 shares in the Coalbrookdale works via his widow Mary Darby. In 1718 Thomas assigned two further shares to his son, Thomas Goldney III, which gave them the controlling interest in the works. Renamed the Dale Company, control allowed the Goldney's to invest and further develop the ironworks. Thomas Goldney II and his son were part of the triangular slave trade, which the Abraham Darby's ironworks as the key to the slave trade. They produced manillas and the brass objects which were used to trade for slaves in Africa to transport to the Americas.https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol- news/forget-colston-heres-five-bristol-8465 From 1723, Thomas began to retire, initially developing Goldney Hall, and then from 1725 taking a two-month tour of Europe, from which he returned afresh to make more adjustments to his property. Thomas II died in 1731. =Thomas Goldney III= Born in Goldney Hall in 1696, after a top-level education he became apprenticed to his parents from 1711. His father trained him in accounts, allowing him to become an assistant book keeper at Coalbrookdale after the death of Abraham Darby I. Thomas III resultantly became involved as an investor in a number of businesses, including: the Willey furnace, across the River Severn from Coalbrookdale; the Bersham furnace near Wrexham; and the Warmley Works of William Champion, which produced copper, brass, spelter and utensils. From 1750, Thomas invested in a mine at Gronant, Flintshire, intended for the mining of lead, copper ore and calamine. A successful venture, it led to Thomas investing in other mines at Kellyn, Whitford, Devon, Cornwall and Ireland. From 1751, Thomas bought shares in three ships, which bought iron goods down from Coalbrookdale to Bristol, and onwards for sale to merchants. This led in 1752 to his becoming one of six partners which founded the Goldney, Smith and Co. merchant bank, one of the first six banks established in the whole of the UK. After the death of the original partners, after a series of renamings and takeover it became part of the National Westminster Bank, today a division of the Royal Bank of Scotland. From 1754, Thomas III financed Abraham Darby II's construction of a new furnace at Horsehay. After the opening of a second furnace on the same site, and a third at Ketley, Thomas III and Darby II agreed to integrate their works through development of a wagon way. By 1757, of wooden track existed, transporting both raw materials and finished product. =Legacy= Thomas Goldney III died without heir in 1768. He left his shares to his surviving family, who retained their interestes until 1773, when they sold them to Abraham Darby III for ¬£10,000. The shares in Ketley and Horsehay were brought in 1775 by the manager of Coalbrookdale, Richard Reynolds.

In 1724 the earlier house was partially demolished to be replaced by a grander building, possibly built by George Tully. The grotto, built at enormous expense by Goldney to entertain his wealthy friends, is today a Grade I listed building, one of originally six follies within the garden grounds, which today include a gothic tower which houses a steam pump produced at Coalbrookdale that was used to irrigate his estate. There is also a bastion, a rotunda and an ornamental canal. The house was recased, altered and extended in 1864‚Äì65 by Alfred Waterhouse, who also designed the Natural History Museum. The house was later owned by other wealthy Bristol families, the Wills and the Frys; among them Lewis Fry (1832‚Äì1921) who was a member of the prominent Bristol Fry Family and became a Liberal MP and the first chairman of the University of Bristol University Council.

He grew up in Augusta, Georgia and graduated from Richmond Academy in 1948. He then attended the Junior College of Augusta (later Augusta State University). When the Korean War broke out Robert volunteered for the U. S. Army. He was turned down due to flat feet. Wanting to participate in some way he, and one of his best friend Tommy Hodges, entered a contest for a spot on the USO tour. Other than photography, entertaining audiences was one of Robert's greatest passions. Robert and Tommy won the Augusta contest and secured a spot for the finals in New York City. They went by the name Click and Clack, due to the sound of the train to NYC. At the finals, the promoter thought two country boys from Augusta Georgia had no chance so he put them on first. Robert and Tommy's show was a mixture of slapstick, comedy and songs, true Vaudeville. The crowd had them come back for three encores. They won the contest and headlined a tour in 1952 that took them to Korea, Guam and Japan. Robert said they did not worry about the shells coming from behind them, but would hit the deck when the shells came the other way. After the tour he returned to Augusta and his love of photography. But he would still continue to entertain groups for fun for the rest of his life. He said one of his greatest honors was a handshake and a \\"very well done\\" by then President Dwight Eisenhower. This was at the Augusta National Golf Club one evening after entertaining the President, Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts after dinner. The family still has a treasured signed photograph of Ike and Mamie in front of their Augusta National Cabin. He won many awards down through the years and took many famous photographs, with one of his best-known that of Elvis Presley in an alley before a 1956 concert in Bell Auditorium in Augusta.

Fradique () is a chapel located in the Convent of S√£o Francisco, in the civil parish of Estremoz (Santa Maria e Santo Andr√©), in the municipality of Estremoz, in the Portuguese district of √âvora. History Altar of the Capela de D. Fradique de Portugal. In 1255 the Royal Convent of Estremoz was founded. The noble Eborense knight, Nuno Martins, first of the cloistered order, who enjoyed royal favour and protection, was buried at the foot of the cross. D. Fradique was a person of importance in the peninsular politics of the reign of King D. Manuel I. Son of the Counts of Faro, D. Afonso and D. Maria de Noronha, he realized his ecclesiastical career in Castile, where he was educated alongside the Catholic Monarchs. For a time he was the executor of Queen Isabel of Aragon, Bishop of Calahorra, Seg√≥via, Siguenza and Saragoza. In Saragoza he ascended to the status of Archbishop, and shortly after, he was nominated by King Charles V as Viceroy of Catalonia. Some time during the 15th century, the chapel of D. Fradique was probably erected, before the region was integrated into the Province of the Algarves (in 1425). This was before the 6 May 1520 papal bull from Leo X that gave license to King Manuel I to construct a convent to the invocation of St. Francis in the village of Estremoz. An inscription, dated 3 March 1535, was placed over the portico of the chapel of Fradique. In the pavement of the chapel are tombstones marking the members of seigneurial Masters of Vimeiro, including the tombs of Fernando de Noronha (who died in 1552) and Isabel de Melo (1563). The chapel, initially consecrated to the name of St. Francis, shelter after 17th century of the Brotherhood of Senhor Jesus dos Passos. It was this institution that ordered the Mannerist retable that crowned the southern wall, that was damaged by natural causes, and in the 19th century, an era when they opted for imitation marble painting to substitute the original goldleaf. By order of the reformer, the Archbishop Infante D. Henrique delivered in 1541 the observance of the Province of the Algarves. The temple was remodelled in 1771. In 1876, the ceiling of the chapel of D. Fradique was remodelled and repaired. The first major works carried out by the DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) began in the middle of the 20th century, with preliminary surveys for the restoration of the chapel of D. Fradique 1963 (that proceeded with the consolidation of the cross and general restoration of the ceiling). Secondary repairs preceded in 1970 and in 1975 in the vaulted ceiling, and in 1980, repairs to the chapel that include cleaning and revision of the ceiling. =Architecture= The sarcophagus of Vasco Esteves de Gatus The small chapel, open to the third line of the southern flank of the church and Convent of S√£o Francisco. A Manueline structure of artistic quality in the city of Estremoz, constructed by and for a figure of importance to European history. The chapel of D. Fradique consists of a portico of sculptural work within a perfect arch, framed by two archivolts and highly-ornamented vegetal interlacings, on a fine, two-order, hexagonal-shaped colonnades over circular plinths and vegetal capitals. The rod or vegetal trunk, with hexagonal capitals and fluted ornamentation forms a body with inner archivolt (or similar appearance) and shoulder columns. The two-section ribbed, ogival vault, with marble silhouettes, is loaded over thin triple columns over hexagonal three-order bases with annular rings and capitals of vegetal crochet. Vegetal buttons close the vault, while in the clasp of a Manueline button is the Noronha heraldry. In the columns of the toral arch, on the side of the gospel, is a parchment letter, carried on a angel's head, with the inscription: :ESTA CAPELA MANDOV FAZER / O MVI ILVSTRE E REVERENDISSIMO / SE√ëOR DOM FRADIQVE DE POR / TVGAL ARCEBISPO QVE FOI DE / ZARAGO√áA E VISV REI DE CATA / LVNHA A QVAL HE DO ILVSTRE SE / HOR DOM FR√ÉCISCO DE FARO SEV / SOBRINHO E HERDEIRO SE√ëOR DA / VILA DO VIMEIRO //.

History The chapel was founded in 1371. Oral tradition and chronicles of 1371 suggests that the chapel was constructed by regal initiative (by King D. Fernando), but was completed by the Condest√°vel D. Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, master of the town of Estremoz. At one time there existed hospital and administrative annexes, sometime after the 16th century, for the Miseric√≥rdia of Estremoz. There was extensive remodelling around 1500, that included the substitution of the high choir. There were extensions/expansions during the reign of King D. Manuel I, as well as unsuccessful repairs during the 17th and 18th centuries. There was a general restoration undertaken in 1938. In 1959, the terrace was reconstructed, with the roofing and pavement repaired or replaced in 1966. The marble staircase and vaulting were rebuilt, while the cornerstones were cleaned. Little was accomplished until 1987, when further repairs to the roofing and ceiling of the narthex, including to the architrave, capitals and columns. The following year there was a reconstruction of the nave. Architecture The ribbed vaulted ceiling of the apse in the chapel The chapel is situated in a rural locale, along a small bend, along with the facilities for the hermit and pilgrims, as well as a small yard overlooking the road. The building consists of an apse and main nave, fully built in fine-cut marble ashlar, with gabled roof and nave. It is solidly supported by buttresses pending talon over perfect arch, with a Gothic porch supported by corbel framework. The triangular frontispiece with cornice, corresponds to the purest canons of the Gothic monastic tradition, with many of elements stolen in the 17th century, replacing the Ros√°cea with a simple rectangular window. The nave's front porch, a forced narthex, perhaps used the palatial building nearby, and includes three sections of Tuscan colonnade on high plinths, raising an ashlar architrave. The porch, simple will of pointed arch framed beveled masonry, is flanked by wainscot tile. A similar portico framed by chamfered ashlar and flanked by tile is located in the lateral southern facade. The rear facade is dominated by the polygonal apse supported by buttresses, decorated along the radial axes. The interior, lit by diffuse light, is illuminated by cracks in the apse and the rose window. The \\"L\\"'shaped chapel is divided into a central nave, apse with vaulted ceiling and ancillary room. Along the nave, until half-way along the walls, are azulejo tiles. Although relatively small, the temple illustrates the architectural style of the late-Gothic style, immediately before the beginning of the Monastery of Batalha. In this context, it represents a long tradition of early medieval Portuguese architecture, namely the expansive volume typical from the 18th century.

Thomas H. Jones (b. 1806) was born a slave Wilmington, North Carolina and was a prominent African-American abolitionist in antebellum America. Jones escaped slavery, traveled to Canada and subsequently relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts. Following years of working as an itinerant preacher and lecturer, Jones became a prominent figure within the Colored Conventions Movement. He served as a delegate to the 1859 New England Colored Convention. His narrative, Experience and Personal Narrative of Uncle Tom Jones; Who Was for Forty Years a Slave. Also the Surprising Adventures of Wild Tom, of the Island Retreat, a Fugitive Negro from South Carolina, captures his early life as a slave and his subsequent escape from slavery. Early life Born a slave, Jones grew up on the plantation of John Hawes near Wilmington, North Carolina. At the age of nine, Hawes sold him to Mr. Jones, a storekeeper in Washington, North Carolina located about 45 miles from Hawes' plantation. Jones reports in his autobiography that, \\"Mr. Jones sent his slave driver, a colored man, named Abraham, to conduct me to my new home in Washington. I was at home with my mother when he came. He looked in at the door, and called to me, 'Tom, you must go with me.' His looks were ugly and his voice was savage. I was very much afraid, and began to cry, holding on to my mother's clothes and begging her to protect me, and not let the man take me away.\\" Thomas H. Jones took his last name from Mr. Jones the storekeeper, for whom he worked as a house servant and then a store clerk. Jones obtained some education from Mr. Jones. At the age of 20, Thomas married Lucilla Smith, a young woman of 17 and slave to a neighbor, Mrs. Moore. Thomas and Lucilla had three children, Annie, Lizzie, and Charlie. Mrs. Moore eventually moved to Newburn, taking Thomas's family with her. When Thomas was 23, Mr. Jones took ill and died. Thomas was purchased by Owen Holmes for $435.00. Thomas worked for Holmes as a stevedore until 1849, when he got word that Holmes was about to sell his family. Thomas moved his family to the free northern states and eventually joined them after stowing away on a brig bound for New York City. Activism Upon arriving in the North, Jones started lecturing at abolitionist gatherings and conventions across New England. In 1850, Jones delivered an impassioned speech at the meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Slave hunters forced Jones to relocate to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia where he continued to lecture, frequently attracting large audiences. He returned to Massachusetts in August 1853, at which time he began writing his autobiography, The Experience of Thomas Jones (1854). In 1859 Jones spoke before the New England Colored Citizens' Convention in Boston. Legacy Thomas Jones Primary School in London is named in his honour.

Joulli√© (born March 29, 1927) is a French-born American organic chemist. She was the first woman to join the University of Pennsylvania chemistry faculty as well as the first female organic chemist to be appointed to a tenure track position in a major American university. She was one of the first affirmative action officers at the University of Pennsylvania. She has a distinguished record as a teacher of both undergraduate and graduate-level organic chemistry, and as a mentor of students. Joulli√© is also an active researcher in organic chemistry who has published three textbooks of organic chemistry, more than 18 review articles, and more than 300 scientific papers. Her work in synthesizing organic compounds such as tilorone, furanomycin, and numerous cyclopeptides has led to the development of antibiotic and antiviral drugs. Joulli√© has received numerous awards, including the 1978 Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society, in recognition of her accomplishments in teaching and research. Early life Madeleine Joulli√© was born in Paris, France. Her father, an international businessman, soon moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she attended the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais. The family also lived briefly in S√£o Paulo. There she attended a private school, the . Joulli√© moved to the United States to study in 1946. She obtained a B.S. degree in chemistry from Simmons College, a women's college in Boston, in 1949. Then she moved to Philadelphia, where she was the only full-time female graduate student in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. There weren't even bathrooms for women in the chemistry building. She earned an M.S. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1950 and a Ph.D. in 1953. She worked with Allan R. Day, who inspired Joulli√© as both a researcher and a teacher. Also at the university, Joulli√© met Richard E. Prange (1932‚Äì2008), a condensed matter theorist in the physics department. They married in 1959. Career In 1953, Madeleine Joulli√© joined the University of Pennsylvania chemistry faculty, the first woman to do so. Originally in a non-tenure-track position, Joulli√© taught undergraduate organic chemistry five days a week and ran the lab. In her first five years, none of the graduate students would work with her, so she carried out research in collaboration with undergraduates. As more women entered the department, first female and later male graduate students began to work with her. Joulli√© received a Fulbright scholarship to lecture at the University of Brazil (1965). While there, she wrote a textbook in Portuguese on heterocyclic chemistry. She has also been a visiting Professor at Columbia University (1968), CRNS (Grenoble, France, 1987), the University of California at Santa Barbara (1989), and Cambridge, England (1997), but the majority of her career has been spent at the University of Pennsylvania. Joulli√© became a full professor in 1974. =Community involvement= Joulli√© was active in the safety committee at UPenn, helping to identify and enforce safe work guidelines for the chemistry department. In 1970, Joulli√© and Mildred Cohn worked on the Committee on the Status of Women, which gathered data and documented the second-class status of women at Penn. The percentage of women holding faculty positions was far below the percentage of qualified women Ph.D.'s, and those women who had positions held lower rank, received lower salaries, and waited longer for promotion. The committee developed affirmative action guidelines, supporting the university's efforts to recruit more women and minority faculty. Later in the 1970s, dean Vartan Gregorian appointed her as one of the first affirmative action officers at the University of Pennsylvania. Between 1976 and 1980, Joulli√© reviewed the hiring and promotions processes of the School of Arts and Science, comparing resumes of male and female candidates. On some occasions, when she felt that qualified women had been ignored in the hiring process, she flatly refused to sign off on new hires. Her effectiveness in the position led Provost Eliot Stellar to appoint her as the chair of the university's Council for Equal Opportunity, overseeing affirmative action in all departments. Of her affirmative action activities, Joulli√© says: \\"I served in that role for seven years, without help, extra pay, or teaching relief... It was not a pleasant job, but it did produce results. The School of Arts and Sciences was so successful with their affirmative action program that I was then asked by the provost to chair the Council for Equal Opportunity to oversee the affirmative action programs of all the schools at Penn.\\" Described by professor Helen Davies as \\"fearless and formidable\\", Joulli√© is credited as having played a key role in creating a culture of equality for women at the university. Joulli√© also helped the American Chemical Society to develop professional guidelines for chemists. =Scientific achievements= Early in her career, her Ph.D. advisor, Allan R. Day, interested her in heterocyclic compounds, and she did early work with aromatic and heterocyclic scaffolds and fluorinated heterocycles. She also did significant research on heterocyclic ketones in the 1970s, collaborating with Peter Yates of the University of Toronto, and receiving the 1972 ACS Philadelphia Section Award. In the early 1970s, she successfully synthesized tilorone, an interferon inducer which helps to protect cells. Since then, much of Joulli√©'s research has focused on the synthesis of natural products. In 1980, she reported the first asymmetric total synthesis of the antibiotic (+)-furanomycin, the first use of the Ugi 4CC in the synthesis of a non- proteinogenic amino acid. She helped to develop methodologies for aromatic substitution, and introduced the term \\"chirality transfer\\". Her subsequent work has led to the total synthesis of several natural products, including muscarine, geiparvarin, ascofuranone, furanomycin, and dihydromauritine A. Working with Judah Folkman at Harvard Medical School and Paul B. Weisz at the University of Pennsylvania, Joulli√© helped to synthesize beta-cyclodextrin sulfate, a ring-shaped sugar molecule that attaches to the walls of growing blood vessels. By capturing and delivering cortisone molecules, it decreases the growth of new capillaries. Chemotherapies can thus target aberrant angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, and restrict the growth of malignant tumours. Joulli√©'s specialized compounds made Folkman's original treatments 100 to 1000 times more potent. Beta-cyclodextrin sulfate is also useful in limiting restenosis, growth of cells on artery walls that can lead to blockages at the site of surgical procedures. Another particularly interesting area of research has involved the Didemnin class of macrocyclic depsipeptide. Derived from a marine tunicate of the family Didemnidae, didemnins exhibit antitumor, antiviral and immunosuppressive qualities. Joulli√©'s asymmetric total synthesis of didemnin B in 1990 was a landmark event leading to fundamental contributions to both the chemistry and biology of this intriguing class of natural products. Didemnin B was the first marine natural product to be used in clinical trials against cancer. Joulli√© has produced several didemnin analogs. She has also developed probe molecules that can trace didemnins, allowing researchers to more effectively study their biological activities. Another area of research has been ninhydrin analogs. Joulli√©'s lab has developed compounds with enhanced chromogenic and fluorogenic properties, useful in fingerprinting and forensic science. Joulli√© was asked by the United States Secret Service to help in developing fingerprint reagents. Fingerprint chemicals must be non-toxic and can't damage sensitive evidence, as well as meeting other criteria. Joulli√©, with students Olga Petrovskaia and Diane Hauze, developed and patented a class of compounds called indanediones. Like ninhydrins, indanediones react with amino acids from the oil on people's fingertips. They have the advantages of being cheaper to produce, easier to use, and more sensitive, providing more clarity and sharper contrast. Indanediones are standardly used in the first stage of forensic identification of latent fingerprints. Awards Madeleine M. Joulli√© has received a substantial number of awards, including the following: * Edward Leete Award (2009) * Arthur C. Cope Senior Scholar Award (2002) from the American Chemical Society * Distinguished Achievement Award University of Pennsylvania Graduate Student Associate and Phi Lambda Upsilon (1999) * ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences (1998) * H.

Kemeny installed a year-round program ensuring women's admission to the college. Kemeny's action created significant controversy among alumni and male students. Beginning admission and Kemeny's Year-Round Plan Coeducation at Dartmouth began with the addition of a fourth term in the summer of the 1971-1972 academic year. Women were allowed to take classes during the summer term that would count for degrees in their own schools. In 1971, the Kemeny started a committee in which women would be included in a year-round plan. In 1972, the Dartmouth board of trustees approved the admission of women for year-round operation of campus. Complete coeducation started that same year. Resistance to coeducation Though many male students favored coeducation, a significant number of them resisted it. Male students frequently slurred the Dartmouth women by calling them ‚Äúco- hogs.‚Äù This insult, derived from the words coed and quahog, was a derogatory reference to female genitalia. In 1975, the song ‚ÄúOur Cohogs‚Äù won a competition judged by dean Carroll W. Brewster. The song consisted of vulgar references to Dartmouth women to the tune of ‚ÄúThis Old Man.‚Äù Dartmouth received several letters that referred to Dartmouth women as ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù and sexual objects. A 1973 letter listed four demands. The first demand was that women's upper torsos must remain naked in the dining hall. The second demand was that the women's ‚Äúservices be available at all times,‚Äù implying that the women would have sex with males students. The third demand was that the > ‚Äúco-hog softball team must also play naked in the green. Women with large > floppy tits may wear bras. The brush area must remain uncovered.‚Äù The final demand in the letter was that a Dartmouth woman perform oral sex on the Dartmouth president to remove his so-called ‚Äúfaggy‚Äù tendencies. The Dartmouth women were also subjected to violence and open criticism. Butterfield Hall, a mixed sex dorm at the college, was frequently vandalized. Its residents endured frequent harassment by screaming drunken men. It was widely believed that these attacks on Dartmouth women were meant to isolate them and reestablish traditional gender roles at the colleg. This isolation of the women would allow male students, particularly fraternity members, to assert their dominance. , women's admission to Dartmouth is around 50% percent. Female students have the same rights as male students.

The model combines the k-omega turbulence model and K-epsilon turbulence model such that the k-omega is used in the inner region of the boundary layer and switches to the k-epsilon in the free shear flow. History The SST two equation turbulence model was introduced in 1994 by F.R. Menter to deal with the strong freestream sensitivity of the k-omega turbulence model and improve the predictions of adverse pressure gradients. The formulation of the SST model is based on physical experiments and attempts to predict solutions to typical engineering problems. Over the last two decades the model has been altered to more accurately reflect certain flow conditions. The Reynold's Averaged Eddy-viscosity is a pseudo-force and not physically present in the system. The two variables calculated are usually interpreted so k is the turbulence kinetic energy and omega is the rate of dissipation of the eddies.

IAMS convenes international and regional conferences, facilitates collaborative study groups researching in mission studies, and publishes the journal Mission Studies. IAMS members include some 50 corporate members and more than 400 individual scholars of a range of academic disciplines and Christian traditions around the world who actively research on the historical and contemporary theory, practice, and impact of Christian mission in diverse social, economic and political environments. History IAMS was founded in 1972, but the impulse dated from the vision of the late Olav G. Myklebust, then director of the Egede Institute in Oslo. In 1951, Myklebust produced a thirty-five-page proposal entitled ‚ÄúAn International Institute of Scientific Missionary Research.‚Äù He looked to ‚Äúthe establishment of an international association of missiologists (and others engaged in the scholarly study of mission) that from time to time would convene international conferences for the discussion of missionary subjects in a strictly scientific spirit and would publish a scholarly review of high standard.‚ÄùAnderson Gerald H., Roxborogh John, Prior John M., Grundmann Christoffer H.

A European consultation on mission studies held at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham, England, in April 1968 brought things closer, but the decisive turning point was in Oslo in 1970 at a second European conference on mission studies when 74 participants from different denominations, countries and continents decided that an organization would be established.Johannes Verkuyl (1978), Contemporary Missiology : An Introduction.

A Senior Advisory Group provides a consultative level of governance. The Executive Committee is chosen at each general assembly by the members present. It is responsible for the development of the Association between its general meetings and is charged to organize the next international conference. The Secretariat is usually taken charge by one of the associated institutions. Currently the Secretariat is located at the headquarters of the Church Mission Society in Oxford, United Kingdom. Mission study groups Within the association, five major study groups have been active in continuing research and consultation, which is an indispensable part of the purpose of the membership. Currently these are: * Biblical Studies and Mission (BISAM). * Documentation, Archives, Bibliography, and Oral History (DABOH). * Gender in Mission. * Healing/Pneumatology. * Religious Freedom. The study groups execute research on the bible (including the study of the Old Testament and the New Testament), Christian theology and its branches (biblical, systematic and practical theology), feminist theology, missiology, pneumatology, evangelism (including the various approaches to evangelism), freedom of religion and freedom from persecution, and other Christian-related theological, anthropological and social studies disciplines. =Mission Studies Journal= The IAMS‚Äô scholarly journal Mission Studies is published by Brill in Leiden.

History  The railway station was opened in June 1841 as a part of the railroad from Vienna to Gloggnitz in Lower Austria. The first steam locomotive using the new railroad was built by the Norris Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1837 and brought to Vienna. The locomotive was named Philadelphia and a bridge across the railroad between the railway stations Wien Meidling and Wien Hetzendorf is called Philadelphiabr√ºcke up to now in commemoration of the early days of that railroad. It was completed as the Southern Railway in Austria until 1857 to reach the harbour of Trieste, then part of the Austrian Empire.

Route description NC 481 is a two-lane rural highway that operates more of a farm- to-market route than a to any other destination besides Enfield. The highway begins at an intersection with NC 4/NC 48 in the community of Glenview, then proceeds east, quickly connecting with I-95 along the way. Near Enfield, NC 481 Business goes straight into the downtown area, while NC 481 meets-up with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) first before entering the town.

After connecting with NC 125/NC 903, it ends at NC 561 in the community of Tillery and near the banks of the Roanoke River. History NC 481 made three brief appearances before the current routing that exists today. The first NC 481 appeared in 1925 as a new primary routing from NC 48 in Roanoke Rapids, to NC 40 in Pleasant Hill. In 1926, NC 40 was rerouted and replaced all of the first NC 481; which quickly lead to the second establishment of NC 481, replacing an old alignment of NC 40 from Garysburg to Pleasant Hill. In 1930, NC 40 and NC 481 switched routes again, ending the second and the start of the third, from NC 48 in Roanoke Rapids, to NC 40 in Pleasant Hill. In 1932, the third NC 481 was renumbered as NC 40A. The fourth and current NC 48 was established in 1937 as a new primary routing from NC 48 in Glenview to NC 561 in Tillery.

Early life Mike Presley played high school football at Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie, Texas, where he was the starting quarterback for three years. During this stretch, Presley guided his team to a district championship and the school's most wins in AAAA competition. He was the All-District quarterback twice and honorable mention once, first team All-Greater Dallas twice and honorable mention once, first team All-Metro, Player of the Week, and second team all-district for defence once. He also was named to the Super Team in Texas Football magazine and played in the annual Texas High School Coaches All-Star Game. . He received dozens of scholarship offers but was only interested in Texas which he hoped would help him play professional football.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/26333955/ College career Mike Presley arrived at Texas with high expectations, but numerous injuries and tough competition limited his playing time. He managed to start two games, but left the program before his eligibility was used up. During his freshman year, the last one in which freshmen were not allowed to play varsity, Mike Presley competed with Adrian Ford for the starting quarterback position on the freshman team, but after winning it, he injured his shoulder and wound up splitting time with Ford all season. In 1972, Presley played well in the spring, moving into the #2 position when Ford was moved to defense. But then he suffered a case of tendonitis and found himself demoted behind freshman Marty Akins. That season, he was officially the 3rd string quarterback, but he redshirted and never took the field. In 1973, Mike Presley was the back-up to starting quarterback Akins, but the two shared the quarterback position in most games, with Presley getting about 1/3 of the snaps. He suffered some minor injuries during the season, including a pulled muscle and broken nose, but was able to keep playing. After both quarterbacks struggled in the 1974 Cotton Bowl, Presley took over in the 4th quarter, because he was seen as the better passer. After Presley played well in the Cotton Bowl, he came into spring practice with a real chance to earn the starting position. But, on the third day of practice, he suffered a strained ligament in his ankle and missed the remainder of the spring. Given another chance in the fall, he injured his groin, again ceding the starting position to Akins. However, in the first game of 1974 Akins suffered a concussion in the 2nd quarter and Presley, a favorite with students, replaced him, leading the Longhorns from a 3-0 deficit to a win over Boston College. The following week, Presley got the first start of his career, and quarterbacked the team to a 34-7 win over Wyoming. Presley played well, and so was given the start the following week against Texas Tech, but when the Longhorns fell behind 26-3 and Presley was sacked after holding the ball too long, Coach Darrel Royal pulled him from the game and replaced him with Akins who was unable to bring the Longhorns back. Akins returned as the starter the following week and he and Presley shared quarterbacking duties for most of the season. After the 1974 season, Presley decided to leave football to focus on his education. Presley finished his career with a 1-1 record as a starter. After school, Presley became a financial professional, registered as a Broker-Dealer Agent, in Austin, Texas. His son, Michael Austin Presley, Jr. played college baseball at Hutchinson Community College, St. Edwards University in Austin, Texas and at Kansas State.http://kstatesports.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/121905aaa.html References  External links  * Texas stats Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Texas Longhorns football players Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:1953 births ","title":"Mike Presley"},{"id":"42746593","text":"St Mary's Church in 1755, viewed from the north-east St Mary's Church, Reculver, was founded in the 7th century as either a minster or a monastery on the site of a Roman fort at Reculver, which was then at the north-eastern extremity of Kent in south-eastern England. In 669, the site of the fort was given for this purpose by King Ecgberht of Kent to a priest named Bassa, beginning a connection with Kentish kings that led to King Eadberht II of Kent being buried there in the 760s, and the church becoming very wealthy by the beginning of the 9th century. From the early 9th century to the 11th the church was treated as essentially a piece of property, with control passing between kings of Mercia, Wessex and England and the archbishops of Canterbury. Viking attacks may have extinguished the church's religious community in the 9th century, although an early 11th-century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks. By the time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish church. The original building, which incorporated stone and tiles scavenged from the Roman fort, was a simple one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel, with a small room, or porticus, built out from each of the church's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met. The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages, including the addition of twin towers in the 12th century; the last addition, in the 15th century, was of north and south porches leading into the nave. This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver: the settlement's decline led to the church's decay and, following unsuccessful attempts to prevent the erosion of the adjacent coastline, the building was almost completely demolished in 1809. The church's remains were preserved by the intervention of Trinity House in 1810, since the towers had long been important as a landmark for shipping: preservation was achieved through the first effective effort to protect the cliff on which the church then stood from further erosion. Some materials from the structure were incorporated into a replacement church, also dedicated to St Mary, built at Hillborough in the same parish. Much of the rest was used for the building of a new harbour wall at Margate, known as Margate Pier. Other, surviving remnants include fragments of a high cross of stone that once stood inside the church, and two stone columns from a triple arch between the nave and chancel: the columns formed part of the original church and were still in place when demolition began. The cross fragments and columns are now kept in Canterbury Cathedral, and are among features that have led to the church being described as an exemplar of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture. Origins Hlothhere of Kent grants land to Abbot Berhtwald and his monastery at Reculver in 679, in the earliest surviving original Anglo- Saxon charter. The first church known to have existed at Reculver was founded in 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent gave land there to Bassa the priest for this purpose.; ; ; . The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle \\"clearly considered this to be a significant event\\", and it may be that King Ecgberht's intention in founding a church at Reculver was to create an ecclesiastical centre with a strong English element, to counterbalance domination of the Canterbury Church by Archbishop Theodore, from Tarsus, now in Turkey, Abbot Hadrian of St Augustine's, from North Africa, probably Cyrenaica, and their equally \\"non-native followers.\\"; . Historians vary over whether to call the church a minster or a monastery ‚Äì thus Susan Kelly uses the former term, but Nicholas Brooks uses the latter, commenting that:; ; . The foundation of this church, sited within the remains of the Roman fort of Regulbium, exemplifies the \\"widespread practice [in Anglo-Saxon England] of re-using Roman walled places for major churches\\"; the new church was built \\"almost completely from demolished Roman structures\\". The building formed a nave measuring by and an apsidal chancel, which was externally polygonal but internally round, and was separated from the nave by a triple arch formed by two columns made of limestone from Marquise, in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France.; . The arches were formed using Roman tiles, but the columns were made for the church rather than being Roman in origin, and their form has been attributed to late-Roman and early Byzantine architectural influences, probably transmitted via the contemporary architecture of Merovingian France.; ; . Around the inside of the apse was a stone bench, and two small rooms, or porticus, forming rudimentary transepts were built out from the north and south sides of the church where the nave met the chancel, from which they could be accessed. The presence of a stone bench around the inside of the apse has been attributed to influence from the Syrian Church, at a time when its followers were being displaced. The walls of the church were rendered inside and out, giving them a plain appearance and hiding the masonry. Interior of the ruined church, looking eastwards from an elevated gallery between the towers in 2015. A curved strip of concrete towards the top of the image marks the line of the apse, and two circles of concrete represent foundations for the columns of the triple chancel arch. To the right of these is the southern porticus, where King Eadberht II of Kent was buried in the 760s. Parched grass in the central, nave area indicates the underlying presence of original, concrete flooring. Ten years after the foundation of the church, in 679, King Hlothhere of Kent granted lands at Sturry, about south-west of Reculver, and at Sarre, in the western part of the Isle of Thanet, across the Wantsum Channel to the east, to Abbot Berhtwald and his \\"monastery\\".; The grant was made at Reculver, and the charter in which it was recorded was probably written by a Reculver scribe. The grant of Sarre in particular is significant: In the original, 7th-century charter recording this grant, Reculver is referred to as a civitas, or city, but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre.; . In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support.; . Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar. Further charters show that the monastery at Reculver continued to benefit from Kentish kings in the 8th century, under abbots Heahberht (fl. 748x762), Deneheah (fl. 760) and Hwitred (fl. 784), acquiring lands in Higham and Sheldwich and exemption from the toll due on one ship at Fordwich,; ; and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried in the church in the 760s. Properties belonging to Reculver in the 7th and 8th centuries are indicated in passing by otherwise unrelated records, such as the estate at Higham, land probably in the High Weald area of Kent, from which iron may have been sourced for use or sale at or on behalf of Reculver, and an unidentified property named Dunwaling land in the district of Eastry. Such records also identify other abbots of Reculver, namely √Üthelm√¶r (fl. 699), B√¶re (fl. 761x764), √Üthelheah (fl. 803), Dudeman (fl. 805), Beornwine (fl. 811x826), Baegmund (fl. 832x839), Daegmund (fl. 825x883) and Beornhelm (fl. 867x905). Triple arch of the 7th-century church, between the nave and the chancel until demolition in the early 19th century: the arch was high, and the columns . By the early 9th century the monastery had become \\"extremely wealthy\\", but from then on it appears in records as \\"essentially a piece of property\\". For most of the period from 764 to 825 Kent was under the control of kings of Mercia, beginning with Offa (757‚Äì96), who treated Kent as part of his patrimony: he may also have claimed direct control of Reculver, as he did with similar churches in other areas.; ; . In 811 control of the monastery appears to have been in the hands of Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury, who is recorded as having deprived it of some of its land. But by 817 Reculver was in the hands of King Coenwulf of Mercia (796‚Äì821), together with the nunnery at Minster-in-Thanet, through which he would also have had strategically lucrative control of the Wantsum Channel: Coenwulf had by then secured a privilege from Pope Leo III that gave him the right to \\"dispose of his ... monasteries in [England] at will\\".; . In that year a \\"monumental showdown\\" began between Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf over the control of monasteries, featuring Reculver and Minster-in- Thanet in particular. The dispute over Reculver continued until 821, when Wulfred \\"made a humiliating submission to [Coenwulf]\\", surrendering to him an estate of 300 hides, possibly at Eynsham in Oxfordshire, and paying a fine of ¬£120, to secure the return of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet.; ; . The record of the dispute indicates that Wulfred continued to be denied control of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet after 821 by Cwoenthryth, Coenwulf's heir and abbess of Minster-in-Thanet, until a final settlement was reached at a synod at Clofesho in 825.; ; From 825 control of Kent fell to the kings of Wessex, and a compromise was reached between Archbishop Ceolnoth and King Egbert in 838, confirmed by his son √Üthelwulf in 839, recognising Egbert and √Üthelwulf as lay lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship, particularly over election of abbots and abbesses, to bishops. One copy of the record of this agreement was preserved either at Reculver or at Lyminge. A factor leading to this abandonment of Wulfred's strict policy may have been the increasing intensity of Viking attacks, which had begun in Kent in the late 8th century and had seen the ravaging of the Isle of Sheppey in 835. An army of Vikings spent the winter of 851 on the Isle of Thanet and the same occurred on the Isle of Sheppey in 855. Reculver, like most of the Kentish monasteries, lay in an exposed coastal location, and would have presented an obvious target for Vikings in search of treasure. By the 10th century the monastery at Reculver had ceased to be an important church in Kent and, together with its territory, it was in the hands of the kings of Wessex alone. In a charter of 949 King Eadred of England gave Reculver back to the archbishops of Canterbury, at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne, land at Sarre, in Thanet, and land at Chilmington, about south-west of Reculver.; ; ; Monastery to parish church Detail from an adaptation of a 15th-century map of the Isle of Thanet by Thomas Elmham, with north on the left: a stylised view of St Mary's Church, Reculver, is inset at left, and the chapelries of St Nicholas-at-Wade and All Saints' Church, Shuart, marked as \\"Om[ni]u[m] S[an]c[t]orum\\", are shown on Thanet. The Wantsum Channel is shown separating the island from mainland Kent. Reculver may have remained home to a religious community into the 10th century, despite its vulnerability to Viking attacks.; ; ; . It is possible that the abbot and community of Reculver took refuge from the Vikings in Canterbury, as the abbess and community of Lyminge did in 804.; . A monk of Reculver named Ymar was recorded as a saint in the early 15th century by Thomas Elmham, who found the name in a martyrology, and wrote that Ymar was buried in St John‚Äôs Church, Margate: Ymar was probably killed by Vikings in the 10th century, and hence regarded as a martyr.; . The Church in East Kent seems broadly to have \\"preserved its primary ... character against all the odds\\", but evidence for the monastery at Reculver is lacking: by the 11th century the monastery had \\"dropped out of sight entirely\\". The last abbot is recorded as Wenredus: although it is unknown when he was abbot, it must have been after 890 ‚Äì possibly 905 ‚Äì when the name of Abbot Beornhelm last appears in Anglo-Saxon charters.; ; . The church was last described as a monastery in about 1030, when it was governed by a dean named Givehard and was home to monks, two of whom are named as Fresnot and Tancrad: these names indicate the presence of a religious community from the European continent, probably Flemings.; ; This may have been nothing more than a temporary \\"resurgence of communal life at Reculver, at least for a period in the earlier eleventh century. ... [Perhaps] the old minster ... was provided as a refuge for a body of foreign clerics\\". By 1066 the monastery had become a parish church, with no baptismal function.; ; . In 1086, Reculver was listed in Domesday Book among lands belonging to the archbishop of Canterbury: in practice, however, it must previously have been lost to him again, since William the Conqueror is recorded as having returned it to the archbishop, along with other churches and properties, at his death, which occurred in 1087. The value of the manor of Reculver in 1066 is given as ¬£14, but in 1086 it was worth a total of ¬£42.7s. (¬£42.35): this can be compared with, for example, the ¬£20 due to the archbishop from the manor of Maidstone, and ¬£50 from the borough of Sandwich. Included in the Domesday account for Reculver, as well as the church, farmland, a mill, salt pans and a fishery, are 90 villeins and 25 bordars: these numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependents, as they only represent \\"adult male heads of households\\". By the 13th century Reculver parish provided an ecclesiastical benefice of \\"exceptional wealth\\", which led to disputes between lay and Church interests. In 1291 the Taxatio of Pope Nicholas IV put the total income due to the rector and vicar of Reculver at about ¬£130. Included in the parish were chapels of ease at St Nicholas-at-Wade and All Saints' Church, Shuart, both on the Isle of Thanet, and at Hoath and Herne. The parish was broken up in 1310 by Robert Winchelsey, archbishop of Canterbury from 1294 to 1313, who created parishes from Reculver's chapelries at Herne and, on the Isle of Thanet, St Nicholas-at-Wade and Shuart, in response to the difficulties posed by the distance between them and their mother church at Reculver, and a \\"steady increase in population\\",; ; . which Winchelsey estimated at more than 3,000. At this time Shuart became part of St Nicholas-at-Wade parish, and its church was later demolished. However, St Mary's Church, Reculver, continued to receive payments from the parishes of Herne and St Nicholas-at-Wade in the 19th century as a \\"token of subjection to Reculver\\", as well as for the repair of St Mary's Church, and the parish retained a perpetual curacy at Hoath until 1960.; ; ; ; ; . Enlargement and decline =Enlargement= Ruins of St Mary's Church, Reculver, seen from the south-east in 2011 The church building was considerably enlarged over time. The outer walls of the north and south porticus were extended westwards to enclose the nave in the 8th century, forming a series of rooms, including chapels on both northern and southern sides, and a porch across the western side. The towers were added as part of an extension with a new west front in the late 12th century, when the internal walls of the rooms added in the 8th century were demolished, creating aisles on the north and south sides of the nave. In the 13th century the original apse was demolished and the chancel more than doubled in size, incorporating a triple east window of lancets with columns of Purbeck Marble, and in the 15th century north and south porches were added to the nave.; ; ; . At some point in the same period, according to J. Russell Larkby, a sundial was added to the south wall of the south tower, about from the ground. A chantry in the church was endowed in 1354 in memory of Alicia de Brouke, and two more were endowed in 1371 by Thomas Niewe, a former vicar of Reculver.; . These chantries were suppressed in the reign of Edward VI, in 1548 or very early in 1549. The towers were topped with spires by 1414, since they are shown in an illustrated map drawn by Thomas Elmham in or before that year, and the north tower held a ring of bells, accessed by a spiral staircase.; ; ; . The addition of the towers, \\"an extraordinary investment ... for a parish church\\", and the extent to which the church was enlarged in the Middle Ages, suggest that \\"a thriving township must have developed nearby.\\"; . Despite all the building work, the church retained many prominent Anglo-Saxon features, and one in particular roused John Leland to \\"an enthusiasm which he seldom displayed\\" when he visited Reculver in 1540: Interior of the west end of the ruins of St Mary's Church, Reculver, in 2008: the gallery between the towers passes through the openings for the two main windows. The high cross described by Leland had been removed from the church by 1784. Archaeologists examined what was believed to be the base of a 7th-century cross in 1878 and the 1920s, and it has been suggested that the monastery at Reculver was originally built around it.; ; The Reculver cross has been compared with the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross ‚Äì an open-air preaching cross in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland ‚Äì and traces of paint on fragments of the Reculver cross show that its details were once multicoloured. Later, stylistic assessments indicate that the cross, carved from a re-used Roman column, probably dates from the 8th century or the 9th, and that the stone believed to have been the base may have been the foundation for the original, 7th-century altar.; . Leland also reported a wall painting of an unidentified bishop, on the north side of the church under an arch. Another Anglo-Saxon item Leland found in the church was a gospel book: this was In its final form, the church consisted of a nave long by wide, with north and south aisles of the same length and wide, and a chancel long by wide. Including the spires, the towers were high, the surviving towers alone reaching . The towers measure square internally, and are connected internally by a gallery that was about above the floor of the nave. The overall length of the church was , and the breadth of the west front, which also survives, is . =Decline= The decaying west front of St Mary's Church in 1781: the two windows above the double west door are partly bricked up, perhaps in connection with a lowering of the roof. The building at left is the former chapel of St James. The straight section of churchyard wall at right still stands. When Leland visited Reculver in 1540, he noted that the coastline to the north had receded to within little more than a quarter of a mile (402 m) of the \\"Towne [which] at this tyme [was] but Village lyke\\".; . Soon after, in 1576, William Lambarde described Reculver as \\"poore and simple\\". In 1588 there were 165 communicants ‚Äì people in Reculver parish taking part in services of holy communion at the church ‚Äì and in 1640 there were 169, but a map of about 1630 shows that the church then stood only about from the shore. In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning \\"encroachments of the sea ... [that had] since Michaelmas last [29 September 1657] encroached on the land near six rods ], and will doubtless do more harm\\". The village's failure to support two \\"beer shops\\" in the 1660s points clearly to a declining population, and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century, its residents moving to Hillborough, about south-west of Reculver but within Reculver parish.; . The decline of the settlement led to the decline of the church. In 1776 Thomas Philipot described it as \\"full of solitude, and languished into decay\\". In 1787 John Pridden noticed that the roofline of the nave must have been lowered at some time, judging by the tops of the east and west walls, and the fact that the tops of the two windows over the west door were at that time filled in with brick; he also noted that the roof had been repaired in 1775 by A. Sayer, churchwarden, these details appearing embossed on replacement lead. But he described the church as \\"a weather-beaten building ... mouldering away by the fury of the elements\\", and a letter to The Gentleman's Magazine in 1809 said that it was then somewhat dilapidated, with \\"trifling ... repairs such as have only tended to obliterate its once- harmonizing beauties.\\" Destruction In the autumn of 1807 a northerly storm combined with a high tide to bring erosion of the cliff on which the church stood to within the churchyard, destroying \\"ten yards [9.1 m] of the wall around the churchyard, not ten yards from the foundation of the church\\".; . Sea defences had been in place since at least 1783, but although they had been costly to build their design had led to further undermining of the cliff. Two further schemes were devised by Sir Thomas Page and John Rennie to preserve the cliff by means of new sea defences, Rennie's being estimated to cost ¬£8,277.; ; . Instead, at a vestry meeting on 12 January 1808, and at the instigation of the vicar, Christopher Naylor, it was decided that the church should be demolished.; ; ; ; . The decision was reached by vote among eight of the leading residents of Reculver and Hoath, including the vicar: the votes were evenly split, so the vicar used his casting vote in favour of demolition. Naylor applied to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, for permission to demolish, arguing that \\"in all human probability the parishioners [would] shortly be deprived of a place for the interment of their dead.\\" The archbishop commissioned neighbouring clergy and landowners to assess the situation, and they reported in March 1809 that the church should be demolished \\"to save the materials for the erection of another church.\\" Demolition was begun in September 1809 using gunpowder, in what has been described as \\"an act of vandalism for which there can be few parallels even in the blackest records of the nineteenth century\\":, quoting Taylor, H.M & J. (1965), Anglo-Saxon Architecture 2, Cambridge, p. 503; ; ; . Demolition of the church in progress: viewed from the south-east, the main feature is the 7th- century triple chancel arch, with one of its two columns already taken down. The demolition of this \\"shrine of early Christendom\\", and exemplar of Anglo- Saxon church architecture and sculpture, was otherwise thorough, and it is now represented only by the ruins on the site, material incorporated into a replacement parish church at Hillborough,; fragments of the cross, and the two stone columns that had been part of the church's triple arch. The columns and fragments of the cross are on display in Canterbury Cathedral. Two thousand tons of stone from the demolished church were sold and incorporated into the harbour wall at Margate, known as Margate Pier, which was completed in 1815, and more than 40 tons of lead was stripped from the church and sold for ¬£900.; ; ; ; In 1810 Trinity House bought what was left of the structure from the parish for ¬£100, to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid, and built the first groynes, designed to protect the cliff on which the ruins stand.; The spires had both been destroyed by storms by 1819, when Trinity House replaced them with similarly shaped, open structures, topped by wind vanes. These structures remained until they were removed some time after 1928. The ruins of the church, and the site of the Roman fort within which it was built, are now in the care of English Heritage, and the sea defences around Reculver are maintained by the Environment Agency. Archaeology burial vault are marked to the right of the semi-circular apse. The first archaeological report on the then demolished church of St Mary was published by George Dowker in 1878. He described finding the foundations of the apsidal chancel and of the columns that formed part of the triple chancel arch, and noted that the original floor of the church was of concrete, or opus signinum, more than thick.; , quoting . The floor had previously been described in 1782, prior to the church's demolition, as polished smooth and finished in red, a sample having been taken with difficulty using a pickaxe. Within the floor Dowker also found what he believed was the foundation for the stone cross described by Leland, and noted that the concrete floor appeared to have been laid around it. The floor of the chancel appeared to have been raised by about when the chancel was extended in the Early English period, and had been covered with encaustic tiles. Dowker also reported hearing from a Mr Holmans about the existence of a large, circular burial vault at the east end of the chancel, containing coffins arranged in a circle. Further excavations were undertaken in the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into the north and south porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the concrete floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone that Dowker described as the foundation for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100 years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint. The church was found to have been free-standing, so any other monastic buildings must have stood apart. In 1966, archaeologists discovered the foundations of what they identified as probably a medieval building, rectangular and on an east-west axis, with its eastern wall aligned with that of the church precinct, which it pre-dated. Extending over and in contact with the western end of a Roman bath house, it stood a few yards east of the south-eastern corner of the 13th-century chancel. This building was not recorded by William Boys, who drew a plan of the Roman fort and the church in 1781. Otherwise no such buildings have been found, but they may all have been in the area to the north of the church, which has been lost to the sea. In this connection Peers noted that the cloisters of the early Canterbury churches of St Augustine's and Christ Church were both on their northern sides, and that St Augustine's had also been free-standing in the 7th century. A building that stood west- northwest of the church may have had an Anglo-Saxon doorway and the dimensions of an Anglo-Saxon church, and had \\"the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection\\".; . It was demolished after the sea weakened its foundations during storms in the winter of 1782.; ; . Leland reported another building outside the churchyard, where it was believed that a parish church had stood while the main church at Reculver was still a monastery: this building, formerly a chapel dedicated to St James, was later known as the \\"chapel-house\\", and stood in the north-eastern corner of the fort until it collapsed into the sea on 13 October 1802.; ; Peers noted further that it seems to have had brick arches. St John's Cathedral, Parramatta The facade of St John's Cathedral, Parramatta, NSW, Australia, in 2013 The design of the twin towers, spires and west front of St John's Cathedral, Parramatta, in Sydney, Australia, which were added in 1817‚Äì1819, is based on those of St Mary's Church at Reculver. Efforts to save St Mary's Church were under way when Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth left England for Australia in 1809. Elizabeth Macquarie asked John Watts, the governor's aide- de-camp from 1814 to 1819, to design the towers for St John's Cathedral, and these, together with its west front, are the oldest remaining parts of an Anglican church in Australia, and are on the oldest site of continuous Christian worship there. In 1990 a stone from St Mary's Church was presented to St John's Cathedral by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England, now English Heritage.

Issued on CD by Alias Records, it anthologizes the band's debut album, most of the songs from two subsequent EPs, and one rare single. Background By mid-1982, Scott Miller had assembled the first iteration of Game Theory, which consisted of Miller (lead guitar, vocals), Nancy Becker (keyboards, vocals), Fred Juhos (bass, guitar, vocals), and Michael Irwin (drums). The first Game Theory album was the Blaze of Glory LP, released on Rational Records in 1982. Due to a lack of funds to both press the album and print a jacket, a thousand copies of the LP were packaged in white plastic trash bags with Xeroxed cover art glued to each bag. With Dave Gill replacing Michael Irwin on drums, two 12-inch EPs followed. In 1983, the group released the six- song EP Pointed Accounts of People You Know, recorded at Samurai Sound Studio, which was co-owned by Gill. The group then recorded the five-song Distortion EP in December 1983 (released 1984), with The Three O'Clock's Michael Quercio producing. The song \\"Dead Center,\\" a rare promotional single, was recorded in 1983 as a 7-inch flexidisc for distribution with the music magazine Option. Production notes Distortion of Glory was remastered and released by Alias Records in 1993. All of the material from Blaze of Glory and Pointed Accounts, except for \\"The Young Drug\\" and \\"Stupid Heart,\\" was remixed in 1990 by Miller and Dave Wellhausen. For the song \\"It Gives Me Chills,\\" the original recording's bass and backing vocals by Donnette Thayer were removed and replaced with newly recorded contributions by Shalini Chatterjee. Although the two EPs included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, only one Juhos song was included on Distortion of Glory. Juhos's contributions had been criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, though Miller defended his early decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like \\"relief from seriousness,\\" Critical response Reviewers of Distortion of Glory wrote that the band had improved with each successive EP, both featuring \\"some stellar material.\\" Notable songs included \\"The Red Baron\\", cited as \\"heartbreaking ... an anguished acoustic lost-love song leavened by keyboardist Nancy Becker's mocking 'fifty or more' backing vocal,\\" as well as \\"Shark Pretty,\\" which featured guest lead guitar by Bowie sideman Earl Slick (credited as Ernie Smith). In the 2002 book All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul, reviewer Stewart Mason cited the \\"winsome\\" song \\"Penny, Things Won't,\\" and the \\"sneering rocker\\" \\"Metal and Glass Exact,\\" naming them as examples of \\"stellar material\\" that originally appeared on the Pointed Accounts EP. \\"Dead Center,\\" a rarity from a promotional single, was distinguished by a \\"freaky opening\\" which featured \\"layered voices, odd sounds, and snatches of bandmember interviews\\" that foreshadowed the experimentalism of the band's 1987 double album Lolita Nation.

Officers of the Order of the Garter (left to right): Secretary (barely visible), Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, Garter Principal King of Arms, Register, Prelate, Chancellor History of the office When the Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by Edward III of England three officers were initially appointed to serve them, the Prelate, the Register and the Usher. In 1477 Edward IV decreed that the further position of Chancellor should be created to be responsible for the seal and its use. Accommodation was to be provided in what came to be called the Chancellor's Tower. The position of Chancellor was to be second in seniority to the Prelate and was granted to Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, and his successors in that position. At that time Windsor Chapel lay geographically in the See of Salisbury, although as a royal chapel it did not come under the direct jurisdiction of the Bishop. The unbroken succession of Bishops of Salisbury came to an end in 1551 when Sir William Cecil was made Chancellor by Edward VI, after which a succession of lay Chancellors were appointed. Following a number of petitions by successive Bishops of Salisbury, their right to hold the position was conceded in 1669 and on the death of Henry de Vic the honour reverted to the Bishops of Salisbury. In 1837 boundary changes made Windsor Castle fall in the diocese of Oxford and the Chancellorship was transferred to the Bishop of Oxford. A century later, the Bishop of Salisbury again challenged the loss of the office on the grounds that the Chancellorship had been attached to his office regardless of the diocese in which the chapel of the order lay and that, in any event, St George's Chapel, as a Royal Peculiar, was not under diocesan jurisdiction. The office of Chancellor was removed from the Bishop of Oxford (the outgoing bishop, Thomas Banks Strong, had been outspoken in the abdication crisis of Edward VIII), and withheld from his successors. The office has since been held by one of the Knights Companion.

Family Ashley was born in 1675, the third son of Lord Ashley, MP, who succeeded as Earl of Shaftesbury in 1683. Maurice Ashley attended Winchester College from circa 1682 to 1689 but after seven years had little to show for his time there. His brother suggested he should spend some time at Utrecht under the guidance of a private tutor which did effect some improvement. Political career Although still a minor, Ashley was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis on his father's interest at the 1695 general election. He did not seek re-election at the 1698 English general election. After his father's death, his brother the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury settled on him an estate of ¬£1,000 a year. Ashley was returned again as MP for Weymouth for Melcombe Regis, at the January 1701 general election. The next election took place later that year in November/December, when he was elected for two seats, Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and Wiltshire. On 20 January 1702 he chose to sit for Wiltshire, but a few months later was defeated at the 1702 English general election. Ashley and his brother were on bad terms by this time, mainly on account of Ashley's election expenses. At the 1705 English general election Ashley was returned successfully as a Whig MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705 but was otherwise an inactive Member. Ashley and his brother continued on bad terms, particularly as Ashley's hot temperament, was becoming an embarrassment and a threat to Shaftesbury's political aspirations. He was re-elected as a Whig at the 1708 British general election and supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was returned again at the 1710 British general election . and voted for the motion of ‚ÄòNo Peace Without Spain‚Äô on 7 December 1711 and against the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. He stood down at the 1713 British general election. Ashley married Catherine Popple, daughter of the merchant William Popple in 1709. She died without issue in 1721. He died in 1726 and was buried at Purton, Wiltshire.

Happersberger was a member of California Parlor No. 1 of the Native Sons of the Golden West. =Personal life= Happersberger's wife Evangeline Ballou-Happersberger was the subject of a short 1894 article in the San Francisco Examiner, which described her skill at wood carving. A \\"wood carving revival\\" had been a fad out East, and Evangeline learned the skill from her husband. She was happily planning to carve \\"elaborate beams and panels\\" for a new house they were building. In 1899, Happersberger moved to New York, hearing that there was more work for sculptors there. He left Evangeline in San Francisco. She alleged that he had deserted her and sought a divorce, citing \\"cruelty and failure to provide the necessities of life.\\" The resulting bitter and emotional confrontations between Frank and Evangeline were reported in the Examiner. Their divorce was granted in January 1900. He died on October 11, 1932 in San Anselmo, California at age 74.

History The newspaper was launched in September of 1926 by Parada Harahap, then editor of Bintang Hindia. Before its first issue, the Dutch language newspaper Algemeen handelsblad voor Nederlandsch-Indi√´ was already recommending it to \\"the natives\\" due to Harahap's reputation for hard work and dedication to good journalism. The editorial lineup in the first year, aside from Harahap, were G. Soetadipradja, Kadar, Hatnid and Abdullah Badjrei. The paper noted that Bintang Timoer would be independent of any religious or political faction, and that it had a more modern layout than most Malay language papers, with illustrations and more space given to content. Since the paper was not involving itself in politics, it even promised that while \\"the importance of Indonesia will be kept in mind, since no party interests are served, Indonesia will be understood as a 'geographical concept' not in the meaning of a 'political concept'.\\" Bintang Timur apparently resumed publication in early 1953 after being unable to publish during World War Two and the Indonesian National Revolution. Under its new guise in independent Indonesia, Parada Harahap once again became president-director and head editor, and promised that the paper would have a \\"national progressive\\" line and to present the news in a responsible and neutral manner. In its later years it was the organ of the Indonesia Party (Partindo). S. Tahsin served as the editor-in-chief of Bintang Timur, later followed by Tom Anwar. As of the late 1950s it was estimated to have a circulation of 25,000.

The structure marks the cremation site and serves as a memorial to Gunatitanand Swami. An event was held to commemorate 150 years of the structure in Gondal, the structure as well as the site was renovated to bring it to modern standards. Religious significance Gunatitanand Swami =Samadhi of Gunatitanand Swami= Gunatitanand Swami, who was one of the most important swamis in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya and regarded as the first successor of Swaminarayan by members of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), died on 21 October 1867, and his funeral rites were performed on the banks of the river Gondali in Gondal, Gujarat in India. The shrine commemorates the site of his cremation. =Akshar Deri rituals= Since its construction, the shrine has become a major pilgrimage site within the sect, attracting pilgrims from around the world. A daily morning mahapuja takes place at the shrine. Pilgrims offer their prayers at the altar, chant the Swaminarayan mantra, perform pradakshina (circumambulations) around the shrine, and perform prostrations before the images. Pilgrims perform these rituals as part of praying for the fulfillment of spiritual or worldly wishes. History Naulakha Palace balcony that inspired the shape of Akshar Deri =Origin of Akshar Deri= Shortly after Gunatitanand Swami's cremation ceremony, Moghiba, the then Queen Mother of Gondal, had the shrine constructed under the supervision of Abhaysinh Darbar of Ganod. The construction of the shrine started on 28 November 1867 and was completed on 29 January 1868. The shrine was modeled after the shape of the jharukhas (balconies) of the Naulakha Palace in Gondal. Balmukund Swami of Junagadh installed the carved black charanavind or \\"holy footprints\\" of Swaminarayan inside. Queen Moghiba placed a painted image of Akshar and Purushottam in the shrine and celebrated the festival of Vasant there, beginning the tradition of celebrating other major festivals at the pilgrimage site. Gunatitanand Swami‚Äôs birth anniversary was first celebrated at the site on 1 October 1868 by followers of Swaminarayan from the Sorath region. Starting in 1867, the fields surrounding the shrine incurred the name Akshar Vadi, or the orchard of Akshar, in reference to the belief of Gunatitanand Swami as the manifestation of Akshar. The shrine became associated with healing miracles and the fulfillment of prayers recited there. =Construction of Akshar Mandir= Akshar Mandir shortly after it was consecrated, in Gondal, India On the morning of a Devpodhi Ekadashi, Gunatitanand Swami is said to have appeared before a senior devotee by the name of Narayanji Maharaj of Virsad in a dream and commanded him to build a three-spired shikharbaddha mandir in Gondal at the site of the Deri. Following this dream, Narayanji Maharaj along with three of his disciples Shankarbhai Amin, Haribhai Amin, and Bhikhabhai Shukla went to Gondal, where they requested Bhagvat Singh, the maharaja of the princely state of Gondal, for the land surrounding the Akshar Deri. Bhagvat Singh agreed to sell the land for the temple and set three conditions for its construction: first the temple should be completed in three years; second, the Akshar Deri should be kept intact; and third, no less than 1,000,000 rupees should be spent on the project. On 18 January 1932, Shastriji Maharaj (Shastri Yagnapurushdas) performed the ground breaking ceremony in the presence of Bhagvat Singh. Aksharswarupdas Swami was placed in charge of the temple construction effort with help from Gnanjivandas Swami (Yogiji Maharaj) and other devotees. Swamis and devotees worked around the clock to complete the temple amidst financial hardship and other obstacles. On 24 May 1934, Shastriji Maharaj performed the murti pratistha ceremony and installed the murtis of Akshar Purushottam in the central garbhagriha (sanctum) after the conclusion of a grand yagna, fulfilling Bhagvat Singh's conditions by building the temple around an intact Akshar Deri in two and a quarter years using many more than a million rupees. On the day after the ceremony, Shastriji Maharaj appointed Yogiji Maharaj as the mahant of the temple. =Other significance= On 10 January 1940, Shastri Narayanswarupdas (later Pramukh Swami Maharaj) was given bhagvati diksha or full initiation into ochre robes, by Shastriji Maharaj sitting before the Akshar Deri. A memorial shrine for the fourth spiritual successor, Yogiji Maharaj called the Yogi Smruti Mandir was also constructed here to commemorate his cremation. To commemorate 150 years of the Akshar Deri structure, the Yogi Smruti Mandir was also in turn made anew, a one shikhara mandir now stands at the previous site of the memorial shrine. The Akshar Deri serves as the symbol of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha.

It includes the rights, laws, and problems experienced by women and their families regarding proper reproductive health. Women account for over half of the Russian population and are considered a vulnerable population due to political and social problems from inequalities in gender, age, socioeconomic status, and geographical location that affect access to comprehensive health care.Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Other At Risk Populations. Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. February 5, 2014. As Russia struggles with a decreasing birthrate and increase in STIs, HIV, and poor reproductive health care, the need for government financed services and international programs is essential to successfully reach this vulnerable population. Currently, women in Russia access care through government funded free services, private insurance, and NGO programs.  Issues  = Female and gynecologic cancers = Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death for women in Russia, particularly among the 45- to 55-year-old age group. As of 2003, there were approximately 50,000 reported cases per year. Though Russia has over 2,150 mammogram machines, there is no national screening program and poor education for women regarding early detection, treatment, and counseling. Much of this comes from a lack of social and psychological assistance from the medical sphere, family, and Russian society.Susan G. Komen. Women‚Äôs Health Empowerment Program Moscow and Central Russia. Susan G. Komen. 2011. Gynecologic Cancers (including, but not limited to breast, cervical, uterine, and ovarian) ‚Äì Of screening services, cervical screenings are common in Russia, though a woman must be referred by a gynecologist. The Center for Reproductive Rights reports that 91.7% of women in Russia have had at least one appointment in their lives, but this is often insufficient to ensure early detection. Like breast cancer, there are no national screening programs.Barden-O‚ÄôFallon, Janine, Reynolds, Zahra, Speizer, Ilene S. Women‚Äôs Health in the Russian Federation: The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the National Research University Higher School of Economics, 2010. MEASURE Evaluation Working Paper, USAID. October 2011 = STIs and HIV/AIDS = The prevalence of STIs, particularly among young women, has been steadily increasing since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. STIs have increased from increased promiscuity and lack of knowledge about prophylactics and treatment, especially among teens. Lack of treatment in youth has led to reproductive issues later in life.The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights of Young Girls and Adolescents in Russia: A Shadow Report. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. New York, 1999. HIV/AIDS in Russia drastically increased through intravenous drug use and sexual promiscuity that flourished in the post-Soviet era; the incidence of HIV has steadily increased over the years. Women are particularly vulnerable to the disease, contracting it through partners, prostitution, incest, rape, and sex trafficking. There is also a significant problem of Russian mothers abandoning HIV-positive babies.Dudchenko, Olga, Hillis, Susan, Jamieson, Denise, Kissin, Dmitry, Mytil, Anna, Elena Pervysheva, and Zabina, Helena. Abandonment of infants by HIV-positive women in Russia and prevention measures. Reproductive Health Matters Vol.17 No.33 pp162-170. 2009. The government has rolled out a series of programs since the 1990s, but women encounter problems with access to protection and care due to gender discrimination and family rejection.The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights of Young Girls and Adolescents in Russia: A Shadow Report. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. New York, 1999. = Contraception and sterilization = In Russia, there is a social norm that women are responsible for contraception. This increases vulnerability as many women have not received any formal sex education and do not know where to acquire contraception (or that it is necessary). Under the Soviet Union, federal programs provided condoms, IUDs and estrogen pills, and allowed abortion as a form of contraception.Barden-O‚ÄôFallon, Janine, Reynolds, Zahra, Speizer, Ilene S. Women‚Äôs Health in the Russian Federation: The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the National Research University Higher School of Economics, 2010. MEASURE Evaluation Working Paper, USAID.

Ab Imperio Vol 2. pp223-251. 2013. Currently, women rely on a combination of traditional and modern contraceptive methods and lack some of the services once provided by the Soviet Union. Sterilization is legal for women only if they are over age 35, have had two or more children, or if there is medical need (such as cancer). This policy is due to Russia‚Äôs need to increase the population following sharps declines after 1991.Center for Reproductive Rights. Russia. Center for Reproductive Rights. 2003. See Russian Cross =Abortion= Abortion in Russia is legal up to the 12th week of pregnancy. As a pronatalist country, legislation as of 2003 forbids abortion after week 12 except in cases of rape, imprisonment, death or disability of husband, and loss of ‚Äúparental rights‚Äù.Rivkin-Fish, Michele. ‚ÄúChange Yourself and the Whole World Will Become Kinder‚Äù: Russian Activists for Reproductive Health and the Limits of Claims Making for Women. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, Vol.18 No.3 pp218-304. 2004. Russia is still struggling to change the social norm of abortion as a primary form of contraception, and abortion remains one of the biggest challenges to women‚Äôs reproductive health because of post-abortion mental and physical health problems and lack of proper care. =Family planning services, prenatal and postnatal care= These free services are available through the Ministry of Health.Center for Reproductive Rights. Trends in Reproductive Rights: East Central Europe. Center for Reproductive Rights. December 2001 There are strong incentives for women in Russia to have multiple children due to depopulation, so the government provides health care to ensure healthy babies are born.Barden-O‚ÄôFallon, Janine, Reynolds, Zahra, Speizer, Ilene S. Women‚Äôs Health in the Russian Federation: The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the National Research University Higher School of Economics, 2010. MEASURE Evaluation Working Paper, USAID. October 2011 However, women report loneliness, depression, and dissatisfaction with their maternal health care providers. Over 75.2% of women see a provider less than 3 times during the course of a pregnancy. After giving birth, many women report a lack of psychological and practical help.Ivanov, Louise L.

Maternal and infant mortality rates account for some of this categorization. As of 2011, the maternal mortality rate was 24 per 100,000 births, with an infant mortality rate of 9 per 1000 births.The World Bank. Mortality Rate, infant (per 1000 live births) and Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 lives births). The World Bank. 2014. =Mental health services= Mental health services for reproductive health involve psychological counseling and services for issues including abortion, postpartum depression, abandoned and unwanted babies, spousal abuse, and suicide. Russian women cite psychological issues from the transition out of a communist system and the challenges of identifying their new role in society. Lack of programming has led to untreated mental health problems that extend to physical reproductive health and well-being.Barrett, Jennifer B. and Buckley, Cynthia. Gender and Perceived Control in the Russian Federation. Europe-Asia Studies Vol,61 No.1 pp29-49. January 2009.  Social issues  Much of the vulnerability of Russian women in accessing reproductive health care stems from social issues. =Sex education= Sex education is not compulsory in Russian schools and under 5% of Russian teens have been educated on proper contraception and family planning. The ‚ÄúChildren of Russia‚Äù federal program has created family planning programs and voluntary sex education programs at health clinics for those under 17.The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights of Young Girls and Adolescents in Russia: A Shadow Report. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. New York, 1999. However, there is social stigma attached to the utilization of clinics and most young women remain uneducated. Often, young women do not know how to protect themselves, leading to high rates of pregnancy and abortion. =Access to care= Many Russian women are unaware of where to access care. Additionally, issues of reproductive health care in rural areas is a huge concern for Russian women. Much of the population is clustered in cities, but for the millions of Russian women living in rural areas, reproductive health care is extremely limited. On average there are 38 physicians and 95 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants, but these numbers can halve in rural areas. Additionally, specialty clinics, including maternity and gynecologic clinics have declined in number in the post-Soviet era.Center for Reproductive Rights. Russia. Center for Reproductive Rights. 2003. =Religious issues= The Russian Orthodox Church emphasizes the need for an increase in the birth rate and is openly opposed to abortion. Some of the problems with access to reproductive health care stem from Church-State ties, that hinder support and funding for contraceptive and abortion services.Erofeeva, Lyubov Vladimirovna. Traditional Christian Values and Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights in Modern Russia ‚Äì Is a Consensus Ever Possible? American Journal of Public Health Vol.103 No.11 pp1931-1934. November 2013. =Domestic violence= Domestic violence in Russia fosters the vulnerability of women. Often out of fear, women fail to seek contraception or abortion. In some families, women accept domestic violence as a norm and are unaware of the services available to them. Especially among poor and rural populations, lack of education and socioeconomic status lead to failures to seek reproductive healthcare if the husband forbids it.Kislitsyna, Olga, Stickley, Andrew, Timofeeva, Irina, and Vagero, Danny. Attitudes Toward Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Moscow, Russia. J Fam Viol Vol.23 pp447-456. 2008.  Reproductive health rights and Russian law  =Federal and local laws= Women's Reproductive Health Care is protected by the \\"Fundamentals of Legislation on Public Health Care\\", part of the Constitution of Russia. The Ministry of Health (Russia) oversees women‚Äôs reproductive health care services, which are provided through a combination of free care packages and compulsory private insurance. Insurance costs have created a burden for poor women and lead to inequality in services. These discrepancies have left women vulnerable and increased health care failures in the issues for free care, health services suffer from an uneven distribution of providers, convoluted regulations regarding patient rights and privacy, and difficulty transferring providers.Rivkin-Fish, Michele. Women‚Äôs Health in Post-Soviet Russia: The Politics of Intervention. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN. 2005.Dubikaytis, Tatiana, Hemminki, Elina, Kuznetsova, Olga, and Larivaara, Meri. Inequalities in health and health service utilisation among reproductive age women in St. Petersburg, Russia: a cross-sectional study. BMC Health Services Research. Vol.10:307. 2010  Sexual harassment, rape and sex trafficking  The Russian Criminal Code outlines laws against sexual crimes, but these issues are commonly underreported among Russian women. As few as 5-10% of rape survivors report their rape, and many women do not tell their families. This leads to complications in seeking mental and physical care, as well as access to abortion. Human trafficking in Russia has increased the vulnerability of women through increases in underage forced prostitution and sexual violence. Over two-thirds of trafficked girls are under age 25, and have no access to care. The government has increased efforts to crack down on trafficking, but there is also documentation of tacit complicity with the practice.The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights of Young Girls and Adolescents in Russia: A Shadow Report. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. New York, 1999.  International aid for women's reproductive health  A number of NGOs have begun to administer programs for women in reproductive health service areas, including: WHEP ‚Äì Administered by Susan G.

Women‚Äôs Wellness Centers ‚Äì USAID and AIHA developed centers in the Soviet Union in 1992 that provide primary care and educational outreach programs.

Many of those that have not signed are small countries. In April 2016, shortly after the release of the controversial Panama papers, Panama adopted the Multilateral Competent Authorities Agreement (MCAA) and signed the MCAA in Paris in January 2018 joining the CRS MCAA as the 98th jurisdiction. In the United States a different cross-border tax compliance approach is promoted through the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).Is US Becoming World‚Äôs Leading Offshore Territory? Sputnik News, 15.12.2015 The U.S. receives information relating to US citizens' accounts from many countries due to the compliance requirements of the FATCA. The United States, in many cases, will reciprocate by sharing banking data with countries for accounts which their citizens hold in the U.S., but not automatically as is required by the U.S. Information exchanged The information and its exchange format are governed by a detailed standard, whose details are listed in a 44-page long document. Each participating country will annually automatically exchange with the other country the below information in the case of Jurisdiction A with respect to each Jurisdiction B reportable account, and in the case of Jurisdiction B with respect to each Jurisdiction A reportable account: OECD # Name, address, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and date and place of birth of each Reportable Person. # Account number # Name and identifying number of the reporting financial institution; # Account balance or value as of the end of the relevant calendar year (or other appropriate reporting period) or at its closure, if the account was closed. # Capital gains, depending on the type of the account (dividends, interest, gross proceeds/redemptions, other) =Reportable accounts= OECD allows the participating countries to determine what accounts are reportable. \\"The term \\"reportable account\\" means a [Jurisdiction A] reportable account or a [Jurisdiction B] reportable account, depending on the context, provided it has been identified as such pursuant to due diligence procedures, consistent with the Annex, in place in [Jurisdiction A] or [Jurisdiction B].\\" This means that either jurisdiction may negotiate and determine its own reportable accounts in its agreement.  Participants The European Union adopted the CRS on 1 January 2016 after amending the part on administrative cooperation re taxation. First reporting was planned for September 2017. As of June 2017, the following countries committed to start reporting in 2017: > Anguilla, Argentina, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, > Bulgaria, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Croatia, Cura√ßao, Cyprus, Czech > Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, > Gibraltar, Greece, Greenland, Guernsey, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, > Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, > Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Montserrat, Netherlands, Niue, Norway, Poland, > Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Seychelles, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South > Africa, Spain, Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, United > Kingdom Starting to report in 2018: > Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, The > Bahamas, Bahrain, Belize, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, > Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Dominica, Ghana, Grenada, Hong Kong (China), > Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Marshall Islands, Macao (China), > Malaysia, Mauritius, Monaco, Nauru, New Zealand, Pakistan, Panama, Qatar, > Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Samoa, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the > Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Turkey, Switzerland, > United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vanuatu = Non-CRS countries participating in global transparency for tax purposes = Of the 154 countries which have signed on the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes,The 142 members of the Global Forum are: OECD, n.d. retrieved 28 June 2017 the following countries have not signed on to the CRS: (Incomplete list as of June 2017) Armenia, Azerbaijan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Gabon, Georgia, Guatemala, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya, Kingdom of Lesotho, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Moldova, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, North Macedonia, Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United States. = Non-participating countries = (List as of June 2019) 59 countries have not signed the CRS Standard yet: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Cuba, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Georgia, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, North Korea, Palau, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Syria, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uzbekistan, Vatican City State, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Reactions =Private sector= In 2016, a legal expert complained that \\"The CRS has a much more ambitious scope, however, and modelling the standard on the FATCA rules has created problems for implementing it in Europe\\". And a \\"private sector advocacy group representing financial services and law firms\\" went even further seeing a \\"showdown\\" between the two regimes. =Developing countries= Transparency groups have reacted in various ways, some of them criticising how developing countries were (not) considered and involved. Collecting and providing information can be so costly and difficult for developing countries obviating participation in the scheme. Instead of offering a period of non-reciprocity, where developing countries could simply receive financial data, the only mention of non-reciprocity agreements is catering to tax havens. =Loopholes= While tax havens will have to provide some information, they can use a number of loopholes (unequal standards for how information is shared e.g.) and also elect not to receive any info in return. The Financial Transparency Coalition criticised the access cost of $73 to download OECD‚Äôs report itself, being \\"a perfect illustration of why this process needs to include low income countries from the start\\". The OECD reviews investment mechanisms worldwide to identify risks in compliance and loopholes. It opened a website for whistle-blowers to anonymously report CRS violations including for pensions, insurance, and citizenship-for-sale tools. The OECD has investigated and labeled specifically as \\"low-risk\\" an investment tool in Hong Kong called ORS (Occupational Retirement Scheme) which is classified as a \\"non-reporting financial institutions\\" and can be used to bypass CRS as it does not need reporting under CRS guidelines and can be used to effectively be like a shell company.

His first exhibition came in 1786 with statuettes of Frederick the Great and Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin, the success of which enabled him to leave the factory. He became a teacher at the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1788. Following Frederick's death, a competition to create his monument ensued among the sculptors of Berlin. This competition came to be known as the \\"Kost√ºmstreit\\" (Costume Dispute) because of disagreements over how Frederick was to be depicted. Johannes Eckstein (who had made the King's death mask) favored showing him dressed as a Roman Emperor. Bardou joined with those who preferred an equestrian statue. Ultimately, public opinion came to Bardou's side, but not until 18 years after his death. Among his best known works are busts of Immanuel Kant (1798) and Daniel Chodowiecki. He produced two busts of his friend Chodowiecki from death masks; one with a wig and one without. The tomb of D.E. Roloff (a preacher) in St. Mary's Church (1794) is, perhaps, his largest work. His brother, Paul Joseph, and his son Carl Wilhelm (1774-c.1842) were both portrait painters. References  Further reading  * Martin Fontius, Helmut Holzhey: Schweizer im Berlin des 18. Jahrhunderts.

He appeared in around a hundred films and television series between 1942 and 1980. Life and career Born Luciano Sanipoli in Genoa, he made his acting debut in 1939 in the Roman Cal√≤'s stage company Society of Mystery Shows. Quite soon he was cast in leading roles in dramas, achieving popularity and critical appreciation after World War II for his performances in Detective Story and Anne of the Thousand Days (both represented in 1951) and winning a San Genesio Award in 1957, for his performance in Virginio Puecher's Il Revisore. Sanipoli made his film debut in 1942, starring in two adventure films based on Emilio Salgari's novels, Il figlio del Corsaro Rosso and Gli ultimi filibustieri, under the stage name Vittorio Sanni. After war, he continued his film career with dozens of roles, even if mainly consisting of supporting or character roles. While most of his performances were in Italy, he also worked on a number of co-productions with France such as La Reine Margot (1954).Susan Hayward.

The Wagemark Standard is maintained by the Wagemark Foundation, a Canadian non-profit organization. There are two ways to achieve Wagemark compliance, both of which result in an organization's listing on the Wagemark Global Registry. As of May 2014, there are 30 Wagemark certified organizations across 14 industries and 4 countries.  Standard  The Wagemark Standard is a third-party standard that makes it possible for organizations to respond constructively to income inequalities by committing to operate within a wage range that supports competitiveness, transparency and social equity. = Calculation = The standard compares the total earnings of the highest-paid employee with the average pay of the bottom decile of earners within an organization. This decile is based on the proportion of full-time and part-time employees within the organization. Earnings include all tax- reported income and benefits.  Compliance  Compliance with the Wagemark Standard applies to a whole organization across all product lines and issue areas. All organizations are eligible to join the Wagemark Global Registry. =Wagemark Certification = Wagemark Certification is open to organizations with a wage ratio of 8:1 or less, as calculated by the Wagemark Standard. Compliance with the Wagemark Standard must be verified by a chartered accountant. Wagemark Certification lasts for 12 months. Certification costs $200 per year, per organization. Wagemark Certified organization may use the Wagemark logo and applicable Ratiomark. = Wagemark Registration = Wagemark Registration is open to all organizations. To become Wagemark Registered an organization must disclose their wage ratio to the Wagemark Foundation. Wagemark Registered organizations may use the Wagemark logo on their website.  History  The Wagemark Foundation was inspired by management theorist, Peter Drucker. In 1977, Drucker wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal that decried the corrosive effect of lavish executive salaries. Drucker's simple solution was to make company wage policies more rational and transparent by fixing the maximum compensation of corporate executives as a multiple of the lowest paid regular full-time employee. Wagemark's founding in 2013 was further motivated by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett's book, The Spirit Level, which was published in 2009. As of April 2020, the Wagemark website has been moved. The work of the foundation continues as  Impact on Legislation  Inspired by Wagemark, in May 2014, Rhode Island State Senator Catherine Cool Rumsey introduced legislation to establish a preference in government contracts for organizations with wage ratios of 32:1 or less.

Harvey also worked in granite, collage, painting, and produced intricate sculptural jewelry cast in gold. He worked in the Brandywine Valley, in Rockland near Wilmington, Delaware.  Biography  Harvey was born in Hollywood, Florida and raised in Pocopson, Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Virginia in 1963. In 1969, after working both as a journalist and an educator, he and his wife, Bobbie quit their jobs in search of a life change and traveled through Europe and Morocco. During this period, Harvey met and worked with abstract sculptor Michel Anasse, in Vallauris, France, which resulted in his focus on sculpture as a career. Once back in the US, Harvey began creating small and large-scale realistic sculptures inspired by his childhood growing up in rural Pocopson, near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Harvey's first high-profile exposure was the exhibition of five sculptures for the five windows at Tiffany & Company, New York. Since that time, in a career spanning over four decades, Harvey has produced an extensive volume of work which has been purchased by numerous public and private collections, and has been featured in exhibitions both nationally and internationally. He was a Fellow and former board member of the National Sculpture Society, New York. Harvey received the National Sculpture Society's Joel Meissner Award and the Tallix Foundry Award. On June 15 and 16, 2017, the Hagley Museum and Library produced a two part oral history, Interview with Andr√© and Bobbie Harvey.

In cultivation particularly, it has often been confused with two other species with broad green leaves and a single green mark on the inner tepals: Galanthus ikariae and Galanthus platyphyllus (usually under its synonym G. latifolius). Description Galanthus woronowii grows from a bulb. The leaves are \\"supervolute\\", i.e. one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud, usually remaining like this at the base of the plant as it grows. The leaves are generally long, sometimes up to , and around wide, although they may be narrower or wider. The leaf narrows at the base with widest part of the leaf in the upper third. The leaf is light to medium green; the lower surface is somewhat more shiny than the upper. The midrib of the leaf is prominent; there are also often two to four visible fold marks running along the length of the leaf. The usually solitary flowers are born on a leafless green stem (scape), long. The pedicel (stalk) of the flower is long. The outer three tepals are considerably longer than the inner three, usually about long compared to . Since the flower hangs downwards, the apex of the tepals is at the lowest point. The apex of the inner tepals has a \\"sinus\\" (i.e. it has a notch in the middle). There is a green mark around the sinus, either U-shaped or split into two parts on either side. The seed capsule is green, more or less spherical with brown seeds about long. Taxonomy Galanthus woronowii was first described in 1935 by the Russian botanist Agnia Losina-Losinskaja. The specific epithet commemorates the botanist and plant collector Yury Nikolaevich Voronov. (Voronov's name is transcribed here as \\"Georg Jurii Nikolaewitch Woronow\\".) Particularly in cultivation, it has frequently been confused with two other species, Galanthus platyphyllus (usually under its synonym G. latifolius) and Galanthus ikariae. All three species have broad green leaves arranged in a supervolute pattern (i.e. wrapped round one another at the base), and inner tepals with a green mark only at the apex. The inner tepals of G. platyphyllus lack a sinus at the apex, i.e. they do not have a notched edge. G. ikariae and G. woronowii are similar, although molecular studies have shown that they are distinct species. Some differences are: * The green mark at the tips of the inner tepals is smaller and less bold in G. woronowii compared to G. ikariae, in which it typically occupies half or more of the area of the tepal. * The leaves of G. woronowii are bright green; those of G. ikariae are duller, being described as \\"dark matt-green\\". * A transverse section of a leaf shows differences in the air spaces. In G. woronowii the air spaces are small and generally invisible to the naked eye. In G. ikariae there are large air spaces, clearly visible to the naked eye. Cultivation Galanthus woronowii has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

He was appointed Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary in March 2013, and immediately embarked upon an ambitious, and (in some quarters) controversial programme of reform. In May 2014 he was suspended because of allegations made by whistleblowers of inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and/or staff. The ensuing disciplinary panel found him guilty of eight counts of misconduct but recommended that he be reinstated. Following the intervention of the Police and Crime Commissioner, he resigned from his post in October 2015. Early life Gargan studied French and politics at the University of Leicester. Career Gargan joined the Leicestershire Police in 1988 under the Graduate Entry Scheme, before transferring to the Thames Valley Police in 2006. Gargan moved to the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) in early 2010 as Deputy Chief Executive, and became Acting Chief Executive and Acting Chief Constable when Chief Constable Peter Neyroud began a Home Office project in September 2010. He oversaw the transfer of its functions into other policing bodies before its disestablishment. Gargan was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the New Year's Honours List 2012. He was forced to return the Honour in 2017. =Chief Constable, Avon and Somerset Constabulary= Gargan was appointed as Chief Constable of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary in March 2013, following the retirement of Colin Port. Suspension In mid-May 2014, Gargan was suspended by Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens, as a result of allegations of 'inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and staff'. The enquiry into the allegations was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). During the period of Gargan's suspension and following his resignation, the force was led by the Deputy Chief Constable, John Long, and subsequently by Gareth Morgan, following Long's retirement On 9 July 2015 Gargan was found guilty of eight counts of misconduct, none of which related to the original allegations. During the course of the investigation, which lasted more than 16 months, the IPCC found that Gargan had on occasions shared information with his partner by email, and had used his work mobile phone for communications of a personal (but not intimate) nature again, with his partner. All charges of gross misconduct, and of inappropriate behaviour, were dismissed. The disciplinary panel found they did not justify dismissal: consequently they recommended that he return to work. In line with the panel's recommendations, his suspension was immediately lifted and a phased return to his role leading Avon and Somerset Constabulary was planned. However, there was vocal local resistance to the idea of Gargan returning to work: the Police Federation of England and Wales issued a statement questioning whether the public could have \\"confidence in his leadership\\" following the guilty findings of the misconduct case, and a petition was set up campaigning for his resignation. Three former Chief Constables of Avon & Somerset Police called for his resignation on 6 August 2015 saying ‚ÄúLeadership should be inspiring and not an embarrassment.‚Äù Ultimately, it was felt that the duration of Gargan's suspension made his position untenable. On 16 October 2015, Gargan resigned from Avon and Somerset Constabulary. He was awarded three months' salary in lieu of notice. Over the course of Gargan's suspension and immediately following his resignation a number of local MPs questioned the handling of the situation, the length of time the investigation took (at considerable expense to the tax-payers of Avon and Somerset), and the way the local media, and social media, contributed to the ending of his career in policing, calling the process a \\"witch-hunt\\" and \\"trial by media\\". The issue was the subject of a House of Commons Debate called by the MP for North East Somerset Jacob Rees-Mogg on 29 October 2015. There was also suspicion that the allegations and public campaign against Gargan had been orchestrated by elements within Avon and Somerset and more widely across policing who resented his leadership style and determination to modernise the force. The case is seen to have highlighted weaknesses and risks within the current legislation that defines the respective roles and responsibilities of PCCs and Chief Constables, as well as raising questions about the remit and competence of the IPCC, as detailed in a blog by Gavin Hales, Deputy Director of criminal justice think-tank The Police Foundation. =Post-police career= Gargan took up a four-month contract with the global security company G4S in December 2015, as a programme director in its justice health division.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34981218 He subsequently established Nick Gargan Consulting. Gargan was stripped of his Queen‚Äôs Police Medal in 2017 by the Honours Forfeiture Committee for disreputable conduct. Personal life Gargan is divorced, and lives in London.

Born in Dunedin, Drake sang in the choir of the local St Paul's cathedral, and was educated at Otago Boys' High School. He then studied at the University of Otago, where he sang with the music society. He made his opera debut in 1948 as Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen,Elizabeth Forbes. \\"Drake, Bryan (Ernest Hare)\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Opera: Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 16 May 2014 in a production originally staged as part of the Otago Centennial, which then toured around the country. Receiving a government bursary in 1949, Drake travelled to London. The following year he received a two-year contract as a full-time principal in the Covent Garden Opera Company. During that time he created the roles of Donald, in the 1951 world premiere of Britten's Billy Budd, and Watchful in Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress. To cover a difficult scene change, Vaughan Williams inserted an aria specially for Drake, of which The Times critic commented: \\"For pure singing, there was nothing finer than the interlude between the first and second acts, in which Mr Bryan Drake sang the 121st psalm with perfect declamation and limpid purity of tone and style.\\" At the Welsh National Opera during the 1950s and '60s, Drake's roles included Germont in Traviata, Ferrando in Trovatore, Flint, the sailing- master, in Billy Budd, and the title roles in Nabucco and Macbeth. At Sadler's Wells, he sang Creon in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex and Mephistopheles in Gounod's Faust. In 1960, Britten invited Drake to sing the role of Junius in The Rape of Lucretia, at the Aldeburgh festival. Britten, known to be exacting and for dropping musicians who ceased to please him, never lost his high opinion of Drake. For the next 15 years, Drake was a regular member of Britten's English Opera Group, not only singing and recording various roles in his operas, but also performing various leading roles in operas by Malcolm Williamson, Gordon Crosse and Thea Musgrave. He also appeared in BBC television productions of Peter Grimes (as Balstrode) and Billy Budd (as Flint, a role he also recorded for Decca under the composer's baton). In the Church Parables Britten composed between 1964 and 1968, the composer wrote roles specially for Drake in all three: the Traveller in Curlew River, the Astrologer in The Burning Fiery Furnace and the Elder Son in The Prodigal Son. In 1972, Drake began to teach singing, first at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He was director of opera at the Royal College of Music from 1981 until 1985, after which he and his wife settled in Aldringham, Suffolk. From 1987 he worked as voice consultant at the Britten-Pears School in Aldeburgh. His final performance was in 1999, when he played the Voice of God in a production of Britten's Noye's Fludde in Aldeburgh parish church.

Maitland is typical of most SunRail stations featuring canopies consisting of white aluminum poles supporting sloped green roofs and includes ticket vending machines, ticket validators, emergency call boxes, drinking fountains, and separate platforms designed for passengers in wheelchairs. The station is located along the former CSX A-Line (originally constructed by the South Florida Railroad) along the west side of US 17/92 just south of the SR 414 interchange. A transit-oriented development called The Parker at Maitland Station is located adjacent to the station and features a five-story, 293-unit luxury apartment community. Because the station currently averages the lowest ridership on the entire SunRail system with only 200 passengers a day, the City of Maitland constructed a pedestrian boardwalk that connects the station to the Greenwood Gardens neighborhood, which is located directly behind the station, in an effort to help boost ridership. Additionally, the city plans for the construction of a parking garage to be built at the station. Despite the current low ridership numbers in and out of the station, city officials believe there will be a need for the garage in the future. Plans call for the garage to be built sometime during the 2019 fiscal year. The city is not looking to pay for the construction of the garage, but rather, fund it using federal or state grant money.

Nieuw hoofdkantoor Wibra in Epe, De Stentor, 21 May 2013  History  Wibra was founded in 1956 by Johannes Wierdsma, who took over his family in law's store in Epe, the family Braam. Wibra was the first self-service store in the Netherlands. At first, they mostly focussed on textile and clothing, but they also had an \\"other\\" section, with products like cleaning tools, writing equipment, candy, toys, and cosmetics, that would grow to become about half the revenue of the store. In the 1960s Wibra grew to a store chain of 11 stores and joined the \\"club of nine\\". This club was made up of comparable stores who divided the market in order to not compete with each other. Wibra and Zeeman would eventually buy most of the other stores. In the 1990 the founder died. His sons Arnoud, Ren√© and Ron continued the business. In 1998 Wibra took over Scholten and became market leader in cheap textile, with a revenue of 400 million guilders.

It was Italy's first aviation drama film, with a fictional story that celebrated the Italian Air Force.Moliterno 2009, p. 78. Plot Commander Mario Spada (Alfredo Moretti) and Carlo Banti Ennio Cerlesi are pilots and best friends in the Regia Aeronautica Italiana (Italian Air Force). The air armadas that are flying on military exercises, show off the air power of Italy. The two friends find that their minds are not on flying, they have something that comes between them ‚Äì a woman. Spada's sister, Elena (Germana Paolieri) is being pursued by Banti. Spada sees his friend as a womanizer and does not like the advances being made on his sister. Banti attempts an altitude record in an aircraft prepared by Spada. When he crashes in the mountains, Spada doesn't hesitate in flying to his friend's rescue. Spada, motivated by his sister's anguish, and releasing she loves Banti, manages to bring him back to the base where he is warmly greeted by Elena.

Skogsberg 1987, p. 89. \\"Most of the aerial sequences were shot during the 1931 army manoeuvres and involved vast formations of aircraft. However, somewhat artificially, a narrative theme was introduced involving the friendship of two young pilots, a daring rescue and other melodramatic incidents.\\" Upon completion, the production was released in 1932 although some sources have a 1935 release date. Reception Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo in Aviation in the Cinema (1985) in his evaluation of the film, referred to the review from The New York Times, \\"... a motion picture record of Italy's 1932 naval and airplane manoeuvres followed by a series of Sicilian folk songs and dances ...\\" Pendo 1985, p. 242.Aviation film historian Michael Paris in From the Wright Brothers to Top Gun: Aviation, Nationalism, and Popular Cinema (1995) considered \\"the expensive and prestigious production was made to promote Italian Air power.\\"Paris 1995, p. 96.

D. Easton, Inc.. History Hoyt was founded in 1931 in St. Louis, Missouri with Earl Hoyt Sr. and his son producing hand made cedar arrows and wooden bows. In 1983, Hoyt was purchased by California-based sporting goods equipment manufacturer Jas D. Easton Inc., and its headquarters moved to Salt Lake City. Hoyt is currently a division of the Easton-family owned Jas. D. Easton, Inc. which also owns Easton Technical Products, manufacturers of arrows, tent tubing and medical tubing. About Earl Hoyt Sr Earl Hoyt Sr. was the founder, owner, and president of Hoyt archery and was born in 1911, where he lived in St. Louis, MO. In 1931 he started his company Hoyt Archery. In 1971 Earl married his wife Ann Weber Hoyt, they met many times at exhibition and on a tournament, and started to date around the 1960s. They later had a son, Bright Hoyt, born in 1980. Earl was scared of Penguins. Product 2017 Hoyt Products are only available in pro shops. The newest hunting bows that were released were the Carbon Defiant, Pro Defiant, and Defiant series from last year. The latest target compound bow is the Prevail. Hoyt not only makes adult bows but youth bows as well called the Fireshot and Klash which is targeted for children wanting to get into the sport. Hoyt also manufactures their own strings, known as Fuse strings. These are sold on all of their bows. Hoyt also makes accessories that are able to attach to standard designed bow. Carbon RX-1: Current flagship bow produced by Hoyt Archery. This carbon riser bow is packed with all sorts of technology Hoyt Offers like Zero torque Hyper cams and Zero torque cable guide. Technology Zero Torque Hyper Cam: This is a patent-pending design that reduces the torque introduced by the cables. This cam system creates a balanced load by incorporating a split cable system which makes this a smooth, fast, and when the cams rotate they let off the most. Zero Torque Cable Guard System: This cable guide is mounted reverse to allow the torque introduced by the normal cable guide to be directed in the opposite direction. This means that any torque created by the cams will be neutralized which means it will be easier to tune and align the bow. X3 Cam & ¬Ω: This Cam system is adjustable by half an inch increments. This cam is available in 65% or 75% let off and has a lighter back wall which makes it smoother than the SVX cam. X-Lite Prolock Pocket: The super tight tolerance pocket means the connection between the riser and limbs will make the bow even more accurate and consistent. This is important to have as tight tolerances in this area since it is critical to the accuracy and consistency of the bow. X-Act Grip: This grip is designed to allow the user to consistently put your hand in the same and right place. Proper Hand placement is critical to ensure accurate and consistent shots. The engineers at Hoyt shaped the grip to ensure that you get the best hand placement. Uniform Stress Distribution: These limbs are contoured limbs that as they bend they store more and more energy which at full draw it will produce the most speed and create less stress on the limbs since they become straighter as they are being loaded. Ultraflex Limb System: This limb system works with the DFX cam system which creates a head position that you can achieve consistently. This system makes a 30.5 inch axle to axle bow feel like a 34-inch axle to axle length bow. Media The Hoyt Buffalo hunting recurve was used by the character Hawkeye in the Avengers movie, as well as by Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games series. The Hoyt Gamemaster II was used by Hawkeye in The Avengers II: Age of Ultron. The Hoyt/Spectra bow was the principal silent weapon used by Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo in Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III. In the backstory Rambo had attained skill with a bow since childhood. In the film he uses arrows tipped with explosive warheads.

The cave is around 3 metres long, 1 metre wide and 2 metres high, and contains two incised crosses on its east wall, dated by their style to around 700 AD. Saint Cormac (or Cormaic, Carmaig, Charmaig) is an obscure figure; he lived at the beginning of the 7th century and he may have been a son of Cormac, King of Leinster.Saint Carmaig and Knapdale, Celtic Knapdale, accessed 13 May 2014 He is the legendary founder of Keills Chapel 3.5 miles to the north on the Scottish mainland, and he is reputed to have used this cave as his hermitage. The rough stone wall in front of the cave may have been a medieval structure to control pilgrim access to the cave.

It was converted into a dwelling house around 1700, and used by a tenant of Macneil of Gillchoille, the island‚Äôs owner. The chapel was surrounded by a burial ground, now mostly obliterated, but the headless effigy of a medieval cleric can still be seen on the south side of the chancel. St Cormac's Cross Beside the chapel stands St Cormac‚Äôs Cross, believed to date from the 10th- century. Legend claims that it stands at the west end of the grave of Saint Cormac.Site Record for Eilean Mor, St Cormac's Chapel, Cross, RCAHMS, accessed 13 May 2014 Only the shaft and the lower part of the ringed cross survive. It stands 1.75 metres in visible height, but was originally at least 2.8 metres tall. The east face shows two wrestling beak-headed monsters with tails and prominent genitals, above which is a hooded rider astride an oversized horse, and then a large monster gripping a snake in its jaws and linked by its tail and crest to a cruciform group of four animals at the top of the shaft. The decoration on the west face is damaged, but two squatting beasts can be seen with interpenetrating necks and large heads. Another cross can be seen on the island's highest point, and is a replica of the late 14th-century cross erected by Mariota de Ros, wife of Donald MacDonald, 2nd Lord of the Isles.

It is managed by the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital has its origins in the Dryburn Emergency Hospital which was established at Dryburn Hall, the former home of William Lloyd Wharton, in 1940 during the Second World War. After the war the establishment was expanded into a civilian facility known as Dryburn Hospital. A new hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract which was awarded to a consortium of Balfour Beatty and the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1998. It was built by Balfour Beatty with an initial cost of ¬£87 million and opened in 2001. Facilities management services are provided by Engie. Balfour Beatty subsequently sold their stake to Dalmore Capital in 2014. Services provided The main hospital building contains the vast majority of the hospitals departments. It has a basement for pathology and pharmacy and three other floors, each consisting of a long main corridor with wards and departments on both sides. Most of the wards consist of four single beds in each room, as well as side rooms. A few buildings from the original \\"Dryburn Hospital\\" remain in operation. These buildings include Dryburn House which is used as the hospital doctor's residence. The hospital works in partnership with Bishop Auckland Hospital and Darlington Memorial Hospital. Cases relating to some of the departments not present in the University Hospital of North Durham (e.g. neurosurgery) are referred to the other hospitals for management. 2014 report and response In 2014 a BBC report identified that \\"out of 126 serious incidents when patients were delayed admission to hospitals for more than two hours, 71 happened at the University Hospital of North Durham\\". The hospital trust subsequently announced they had earmarked ¬£5.6million to invest into the emergency departments at Darlington Memorial Hospital and University Hospital of North Durham. That focus has resulted in improved patient perceptions but a 2015 Care Quality Commission assessment of the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust resulted in an overall \\"Requires Improvement\\" rating.

It includes the oldest Hasidic yeshiva in Israel, Yeshivas Toras Emes. Location Shikun Chabad is bordered by Ezrat Torah on the north, Romema on the west, Kerem Avraham on the south, and Tel Arza on the east. It lies adjacent to Route 417 (Yirmiyahu Street). Its main streets are Chana Street and Elkana Street. History Original apartment buildings in Shikun Chabad Shikun Chabad was founded in 1954 by the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. It was ready for occupancy in 1961 with 116 apartment units, a Talmud Torah for 200 students, a girls' school for 180 students, and a kindergarten. The neighborhood yeshiva, Yeshivas Toras Emes, is the oldest Hasidic yeshiva in Israel. It was founded in Hebron in 1911 by the fifth Lubavitcher rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, and relocated to Jerusalem several years later. As of 2014, the Toras Emes Institutions include a rabbinical academy, kollel, yeshiva gedola, yeshiva ketana, Talmud Torah, and preschools. Rabbi Tuvia Zilbershtrom is the Rav of Shikun Chabad. In 2004 the Kaliver Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Taub, moved his court from Bnei Brak to Jerusalem, opening a large beis medrash on Chana Street in Shikun Chabad. Demographics A 2008 census showed that Shikun Chabad had one of the lowest workforce participation rates (29%) in the city. A 2011 survey by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies reported that 51% of the residents of Shikun Chabad claimed exemption from payment of arnona (municipal taxes). Simchat Beit HaShoeivah yeshiva gedola building For many years, Shikun Chabad hosted public Simchat Beit HaShoeivah celebrations during the holiday of Sukkot, with outdoor music and dancing in its large square on Chana Street. In 2008, leaders of other Hasidic sects and Lithuanian rabbis called on Shikun Chabad to move this event indoors to ensure total separation of men and women. Chabad rabbis acquiesced to this demand, although it meant that women would be excluded since there was insufficient space for both sexes in its indoor facility. Chabad continues to sponsor outdoor concerts in other parts of the city, with men and women separated by partitions.

Verner was the second son of Sir William Verner, Bt (1782‚Äì1871) and his wife Harriet Wingfield. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He married Selina Florence, daughter of Thomas Vesey Nugent, on 15 December 1864. Verner was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lisburn in 1863. He contested a by-election in February of that year, and was narrowly defeated by the Liberal Party candidate, industrialist John Doherty Barbour. However, that result was overturned on petition and at a second by-election in June he won the seat by 151 votes to Barbour's 90. Verner held the Lisburn seat until 1873. His father William had been one of the two MPs for County Armagh, and on William's death Edward resigned his seat to stand in the by-election for Armagh. He was elected unopposed,Walker, op cit, p 250‚Äì251 and re-elected with a generous majority in 1874. He stood down at the 1874 general election, when his nephew William Edward was defeated by the Liberal candidate James Nicholson Richardson.

Like other mycoplasmas M. fermentans is characterized by the absence of a peptidoglycan cell wall and resulting resistance to many antibacterial agents. It is a possible human pathogen with roles suggested in many illness such as respiratory, genital, and rheumatoid diseases among others. Investigations have focused on a possible link to it being a cofactor in HIV infection as well as fibromyalgia, Gulf War syndrome and Chronic fatigue syndrome, however the belief that M. fermentans is pathogenic in such conditions has largely been disregarded after the failure of several large scale studies to find a link. Due to its incredibly small size it is difficult to determine the full extent of its role in human diseases, while M. fermentans has been implicated in a myriad of diseases, research at the current point has not conclusively proven its pathogenicity in humans outside of opportunistic infections. Discovery M. fermentans was first described by Ruiter and Wentholt in 1952 from isolate of a human genital infection, which led to the initial name G-strain. In 1954 D.G. Edward identified a strain of mycoplasma in his laboratory isolated from 91 different samples collected from humans that differed in its ability to ferment sugars, he labeled this strain human type 3 as it was the 3rd strain he found in the group of samples. This was later identified to be the same strain as Ruiter and Wentholt's G-strain. In 1955 Edward proposed a new naming structure renaming his human type 3 strain and Ruiter and Wentholt's G-strain to M. fermentans due to its believed unique ability amongst the group to ferment multiple sugars. It has since been found that several other mycoplasma are capable of fermenting multiple sugar sources. M. incognitus In the late 1980s a mycoplasma infection was isolated during autopsy of AIDS patients. This new mycoplasma, dubbed M. incognitus was concerning as it could either be an opportunistic co-infection or a sexually transmitted infectious cofactor to the HIV disease process. This \\"new\\" mycoplasma however was later determined to be a strain of M. fermentans . Since then however, several more mycoplasmas have been described as being co-infectious with HIV.  Characteristics  M. fermentans is capable of fermenting both glucose and arginine as well as other sugars.

It was filmed in the Berkshires, a hilly region of Massachusetts. Faulkner plays a reporter who investigates rumors of persistent ergot poisoning in an isolated, unfriendly town, only to find a plot that involves cults and modern day accusations of witchcraft. It premiered in October 2013 and was released on DVD in December 2013.  Plot  Rachel, a reporter, is surprised when her roommate, Greg, arrives earlier than expected. Greg explains that his unsupportive ex- girlfriend has kicked him out, and he needs a place to stay while he works on his thriller screenplay. Both Greg and Rachel have been drawn to a small town in the Berkshires that is said to have been plagued with repeated cases of ergot poisoning. Greg wants to write a story about an insular town with a dark past, and Rachel believes that ergot poisoning can explain the accusations of witchcraft in the Salem witch trials. However, Rachel's questions upset the townspeople, who are tired of discussions about the town's history. Encouraged by Greg's faith in her, Rachel continues to dig deeper and ask more questions. Eventually, she meets Paul, a friendly townsperson who is willing to speak about the town's history, rumors of ergot poisoning, and a vague conspiracy that involves the town's elders. Paul urges Rachel to be careful, as there are dangerous secrets in the town that people will kill to protect. Unconvinced, Rachel proceeds with her investigation, only to find Paul dead. When Greg disappears, Rachel becomes increasingly worried about her own safety. Her fears are realized when Joe and Jason, local townspeople who have stalked and harassed her, seemingly attempt to kidnap her. She sees Jason intentionally infect younger townspeople with ergot poisoning, and Jim, a friend of Paul's, shows her evidence that the town keeps these sick people imprisoned as suspected witches. Jim promises to show her further evidence of coverups and cult activity, and Rachel contacts her editor to receive more time to investigate these claims. Dubious of her reports, Rachel's editor insists that she stick to the original story and observe the deadline; instead, she works with Jim to expose the cult. When Greg suddenly reappears, she angrily accuses him of abandoning her and explains the danger that they are in. Greg attempts to calm her and suggests that they get dinner; Rachel reluctantly agrees. While she prepares, she sees Greg go through her research and hand it off to Joe. Hurt by this betrayal, she locks Greg out of the house and asks her skeptical editor to contact the police. Undeterred, Rachel continues her investigations, and Jim takes her on a tour of the house where the town's cult keeps kidnapped victims of ergot poisoning. Before she can do anything to help them, she runs into Joe, who chases her down. Greg helps Joe hold her as Jason injects her with a syringe. Rachel once again tearfully accuses Greg of betrayal and falls unconscious. In the next scene, flashbacks reveal that Rachel has been suffering from ergot poisoning: Paul and Jim are hallucinations, Joe and Jason are concerned townspeople who have been trying to help Rachel, and Greg has agreed to take her to a specialist in New York. On the way to New York, Jim appears to her one last time, asking for her help, but she swallows a pill that causes him to disappear.

In their first and only season under head coach Fielding H. Yost, the team compiled a 7‚Äì2 record, shut out seven of nine opponents, scored 154 points (17.1 points per game), and allowed 20 points (2.2 points per game) by opponents. The team registered three shutouts against the Reliance Club, two shutouts against California State Normal School, now known as San Jose State University, and single game shutouts against Oregon and California. The team's two losses came against (0‚Äì6) and a Stanford alumni team (0‚Äì14) that featured coach Yost playing at the fullback position. Stanford's final game of the season against California, played on Thanksgiving Day in San Francisco, drew the largest crowd to that date to watch a sporting event west of the Mississippi River. An overflow crowd watched from the roof of an adjacent factory. The weight of the spectators caused the roof to collapse, plunging a large group, primarily boys and young men, to the concrete floor and active furnaces of the factory. In all, 22 died and more than 70 were injured. Schedule Season summary =Pre-season= The 1899 Stanford football team compiled a disappointing 2‚Äì5‚Äì2 record in their first and last year under head coach Burr Chamberlain. In December 1899, William Wesley \\"Babe\\" Burnett, a 26-year-old tackle and law student from Adelaide, California, was unanimously elected as the captain of the 1900 Stanford team. On March 1, 1900, after a bidding war with Missouri, Stanford hired Fielding H. Yost as its football coach. Yost had led the 1899 Kansas team to an undefeated 10‚Äì0 record. The San Francisco Call reported at the time of Yost's hiring: \\"Yost seems to be a favorite wherever he goes, and his success lies in his ability to develop magnificent team work.\\" However, some Stanford players, including team captain Burnett, initially objected to Yost's hiring on grounds that he came from a small college (Lafayette College) and was \\"not known to the leaders of college football in the East.\\" In July 1900, Stanford football administrator J. Burt Gildersleeve traveled east to inspect the football training facilities at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Penn. While in the east, he also met with coach Yost in Pittsburgh. Upon his return, Gildersleeve expressed confidence in the choice of Yost: \\"He impressed me as being a man of strong personality and wonderful magnetism, and he certainly knows the game from start to finish. . . . I am confident that he will be a success, and I think we were fortunate in securing his services against the higher bid of Missouri.\\" In early August 1900, Frank Slaker announced his intention to transfer to Stanford from the University of Chicago to study mining engineering. Slaker had been a second-team All-American and first-team All-Western player on Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons football teams. (1899 All-American)(1898 All-Western) On August 21, 1900, Yost arrived at Stanford. Upon his arrival, Yost expressed confidence that he could turn out a team that would defeat rival California. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Yost impressed those he met as a \\"thorough gentleman\\" who \\"looks every inch an athlete.\\" Upon arriving, Yost commenced supervising the development of the team's new football field. =Game 1: Reliance= On September 29, 1900, Stanford opened its 1900 football season with a 6-0 victory over the Reliance Club. Stanford threatened to score reportedly but registered the game's only touchdown late in the second half. The touchdown was scored by a guard named Seeley who was pushed over the goal line by his teammates. The game included the first appearance for Stanford by fullback Frank Slaker. The San Francisco Call reported that Slaker \\"showed remarkable speed in line-plunging, but was too fast for his support.\\" Stanford's lineup against Reliance was as follows: Thompson and Allen (left end); Traeger (left tackle); DeForest (left guard); Lee (center); Seeley (right guard); Burnett (right tackle); Cooper (right end); Hill (left halfback); Fisher (right halfback); Raitt (quarterback); and Slaker (fullback). =Game 2: at California State Normal= On October 10, 1900, Stanford defeated the team from the team from the California State Normal School by a 35-0 score. The game was played at Cycler's Park in San Jose, California. Stanford's left halfback Geissler scored two touchdowns on long end runs. Additional touchdowns were scored by quarterback Raitt and left tackle Traeger, who returned a fumble for a score. Stanford led 23-0 at halftime. Hill replaced Geissler at left halfback in the second half and scored two touchdowns. Willie Heston, who later played for Yost at Michigan, was the starting left halfback for the State Normal team. Stanford's lineup in the game was as follows: Allen and Luck (left end); Traeger (left tackle); DeForest (left guard); Lee (center); Seeley (right guard); Burnett (right tackle); Cooper and McFadden (right end); Raitt and Erb (quarterback); Geissler and Hill (left halfback); Smith (right halfback); and Slaker (fullback). =Game 3: vs. Reliance= On October 13, 1900, Stanford played its second game against the Reliance Club, this time at the 16th Street Grounds in San Francisco before a crowd estimated at between 500 and 600 spectators. Stanford again won by a 6-0 score. After a scoreless first half, \\"Coach Yost hurried his cardinal squad up the field and gave each player new advice on how to act in the second half.\\" In all Stanford ran with the ball 81 times, gaining 320 yards. Slaker scored the only touchdown. Stanford's lineup for its second game against Reliance was as follows: Allen (left end); Traeger (left tackle); DeForest (left guard); Lee (center); Seeley (right guard); Burnett (right tackle); Cooper (right end); Raitt (quarterback); Geissler (left halfback); Fisher (right halfback); Slaker (fullback). =Game 4: California State Normal= On October 20, 1900, Stanford played its second game against the California State Normal School, this time at Stanford Field. After a scoreless first half, Stanford scored 24 points in the second half and won by a 24-0 score. Despite the score, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Stanford's \\"formations were slow and ineffective and every main in the team lacked life.\\" The Chronicle also praised the performance of the State Normal School's left halfback Willie Heston: \\"The right side of the cardinal line was especially weak, Heston plunging through it as he pleased.\\" Stanford coach Yost was not present at the game, opting instead to travel to Berkeley to watch the University of California team play against the Reliance Club. Stanford's lineup against the State Normal team was as follows: Cooper (right end); Burnett (right tackle); Seeley (right guard); Lee (center); Emerson (left guard); Traeger (left tackle); McFadden (left end); Raitt (quarterback); Fisher (right halfback); Hill (left halfback); and Slaker (fullback). =Game 5: Stanford Alumni= On October 26, 1900, Stanford was defeated by a team made up of Stanford alumni. The game, played at Stanford Field, ended in a 13‚Äì0 in favor of the alumni. Adding to the defeat, Stanford's starting right halfback, Ralph Fisher, sustained a broken collarbone in the game. Stanford's 29-year-old coach Yost played at the fullback position for the alumni team and was, with other alumni backs, reportedly \\"all over and around the varsity.\\" The alumni led 2-0 at halftime. Yost kicked a goal after touchdown in the second half. The lineup against the alumni was as follows: Cooper (right end); Burnett (right tackle); Seeley (right guard); Lee (center); DeForest (left guard); Traeger (left tackle); Allen (left end); Erb (quarterback); Fisher (right halfback); Geissler (left halfback); Hill and Slaker (fullback). =Game 6: Reliance= On November 3, 1900, Stanford played the Reliance Club for the third time in one season. While the first two games had been close, Stanford won the third game by a 44-0 score at Stanford Field. Stanford scored on six touchdowns, four goals after touchdown, and two field goals (by Traeger). Stanford captain Burnett left the game with a leg injury. The University of California team watched the game from the bleachers. Stanford led 16-0 at halftime. Stanford's lineup for its third game against Reliance was as follows: McFadden (left end); Traeger (left tackle); Bentley and Emerson (left guard); McFadden and Gregory (center); Seeley (right guard); Lee and Burnett (right tackle); Cooper and Luck (right end); Raitt (quarterback); Allen (left halfback); Smith and Erb (right halfback); and Hill (fullback). =Game 7: Oregon= On November 10, 1900, Stanford defeated Oregon by a 34-0 score at Stanford Field. The San Francisco Chronicle described Erb's 70-yard touchdown run as \\"the best sprint seen on a Coast gridiron\\" since 1898. The Chronicle praised the performance of the Stanford team as a whole: \\"The Oregonians were completely smothered by the Cardinal interference. Stanford played throughout the game with a rare snap and dash.\\" Stanford's lineup against Oregon was as follows: McFadden-Caglieri (left end); Traeger (left tackle); Emerson-DeForest (left guard); McFadden-Lee (center); Seeley (right guard); Bentley-Burnett (right tackle); Luck-Cooper (right end); Raitt (quarterback); Erb (left halfback); Allen-Erb (right halfback); and Hill (fullback). =Game 8: Nevada State= On November 17, 1900, Stanford lost to Nevada State by a 6 to 0 score at Stanford Field. The San Francisco Call compared the upset to \\"a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky.\\" Stanford's lineup against Nevada State was as follows: Cooper and Luck (right end); Burnett and Nutter (right tackle); Seeley (right guard); Lee, McFadden and Gregory (center); Nutter and Emerson (left guard); Traeger (left tackle); McFadden (left end); Erb and Bausback (quarterback); Geissler and Allen (right halfback); Hill and Erb (left halfback); and Slaker (fullback). =Game 9: California= Stanford center and backs preparing for the California game in 1900 On Thanksgiving Day, November 29, 1900, Stanford played the 10th edition of its annual rivalry game with California at the 16th Street Grounds in San Francisco. Stanford won 5‚Äì0 on a field goal by left tackle Traeger. Stanford's lineup against California was McFadden (left end), Traeger (left tackle), DeForest (left guard), Lee and McFadden (center), Seeley (right guard), Burnett (right tackle), Cooper (right end), Raitt and Bansbach (quarterback), Hill (left halfback), Erb and Smith (right halfback), and Slaker (fullback). Stanford quarterback Charles Raitt was severely injured when he received a blow to the head in the second half; more than 10 days after the game, he was still unable to go outside. The game is most notable due to a horrific accident that occurred among the spectators. The Thanksgiving Day game had become a popular event for several years running. In 1900, the game was played at the 16th Street Grounds in the midst of an industrial area of San Francisco. 19,000 spectators filled the stands, the largest crowd to witness a sporting event west of the Mississippi River. Many spectators chose not to pay the $1 admission and instead observed the game from the roof of the San Francisco and Pacific Glass Works across the street from the stands. During the game, the weight of hundreds of spectators caused the roof to collapse, plunging a large group of primarily boys and young men to the concrete floor and active furnaces of the glass factory. In all, 22 died and more than 70 were injured, some seriously. The \\"Thanksgiving Day Disaster\\" remains the deadliest accident ever at a U.S. sporting event. =Note regarding Multnomah= Some sources, including the College Football Data Warehouse, erroneously list a tenth football game played by Stanford on December 25, 1900, in Portland, Oregon, against a team from the Multnomah Athletic Club. However, that game was actually played by Stanford's \\"second team\\" without participation by any of the players on Stanford's 1900 varsity team. Contemporaneous news sources clearly indicate the game was played by Stanford's \\"second team\\", not by Stanford's varsity football team. Also, the Stanford yearbook does not include the Multnomah game in its record of the varsity football games for 1900, which are limited to the nine games above. The lineup for Stanford's \\"second eleven\\" against Multnomah was as follows: Montague (right end); Pratt (right tackle and captain); Kirkley (right guard); Harmer (center); Edmonston (left guard); Rusk (left tackle); Stansberry (left end); Kerrigan (quarterback); Hamilton (right halfback); Downs (left halfback); Davey (fullback). =Post-season= At the end of the 1900 football season, Stanford passed a rule requiring all coaches to be alumni. The decision left coach Yost without a job. Yost was hired by Michigan, and his first recruit was Willie Heston from the California State Normal School in San Jose. Stanford freshman George W. Gregory also followed Yost to Michigan. Charles Fickert replaced Yost as Stanford's football coach and led the team to a 3‚Äì2‚Äì2 during the 1901 season. Yost led the 1901 Michigan team to an 11‚Äì0 record, outscoring their opponents by the unprecedented total of 550 to 0. Michigan and Stanford met in the 1901 Rose Bowl, the first post-season bowl game. Michigan won by a 49‚Äì0 score. Players The members of Stanford's 1900 varsity football team were as follows:The list of Stanford's starters and substitutes is from the Stanford yearbook (Quad) for 1902, covering the 1900 football season, at page 178.

History Vyond was founded as GoAnimate in 2007 by Alvin Hung, and the first version of GoAnimate went live in mid-2008. In May 2009, DomoAnimate was launched. This program allowed users to create GoAnimations based on the Domo shorts. The site closed down on September 15, 2014 and later redirected to the GoAnimate for Schools website. In early 2011, GoAnimate became a founding partner of YouTube Create ‚Äì a suite of apps available to content creators within YouTube. A U.S. office in San Francisco opened in June 2011. In late August 2011, GoAnimate for Schools was publicly launched. GoAnimate for Schools was a school-safe version of GoAnimate featuring dedicated privacy, security, content moderation and group management features. In late 2011, a custom set of ‚ÄúElection 2012‚Äù characters became popular. On , GoAnimate launched the Business Friendly Theme, the first of the four Business Themes on the site. In April 2012, the first business- oriented subscription plans were publicly launched. These included 1080p download, logo removal & replacement, and new business-oriented visual themes. These plans led to increased popularity and exposure for GoAnimate. By July 2013, over ten million videos had been created using the GoAnimate platform. On , GoAnimate changed its logo, removing the exclamation mark. That same day, the site relaunched with a new user interface, plus the removal of GoBucks and GoPoints. Logo for GoAnimate used from 2013 to 2018. At the end of 2013, the ‚Äúpaper cutout‚Äù assets of explainer video pioneer Common Craft were integrated into GoAnimate as a new visual theme. In April 2014, multi-seat business subscription plans were launched, including full-featured administrative tools along with group collaboration and review. Around the same time, GoAnimate also released their next Business theme, that being Whiteboard Animation, and a publishing integration with elearning courseware authoring platform Lectora. By the end of 2014, GoAnimate's library contained over 10,000 assets, including a new set of Supreme Court justices and settings. In 2015, the Taiwan office was opened, making it GoAnimate's third location (after Hong Kong and San Francisco). As of May 2015, GoAnimate announced future expansion plans included going public, but there had been no decision on the listing venue. During the summer of 2015, social network features such as favorites, comments and messages were removed so that GoAnimate could focus more on businesses and marketing. On October 19, 2015, it was announced that GoAnimate would migrate from Adobe Flash and go towards HTML5 animation, which can allow mobile device compatibility. The older, less technological-adaptable themes (or Non-Business Themes) such as Lil' Peepz, Comedy World, Anime, Stick Figure, and Cartoon Classics, were retired as they were incompatible with HTML5. GoAnimate for Schools however, retained Adobe Flash and the non- business themes until July 26, 2016. On November 25, 2015, GoAnimate replaced their free plan with a trial plan that lasts 14 days. After the subscription expires, the ability to create or edit videos is locked until a paid plan is subscribed to. By the end of 2015, the company had over 50 employees. On May 6, 2018, GoAnimate was renamed to Vyond after the company had revealed its launching to occur at an exhibition in San Diego a day later. The trading name for Vyond remains as \\"GoAnimate, Inc.\\". On May 6, 2019, Vyond announced the retirement of the legacy video maker, due to the end-of-life of Flash, which occurred in December, 2019. All user accounts defaulted to Vyond Studio on August 14, 2019.  Product  Vyond provides its users with a library containing tens of thousands of pre-animated assets, which can be controlled through a drag & drop interface. Asset types include characters, actions, templates, props, text boxes, music tracks and sound effects. Users can also upload their own assets, such as audio files, image files or video files. There is also a drag & drop composition tool, which users can employ to create pans and zooms. Spoken dialogue and narration can be recorded directly into the platform or imported as an audio file. Characters can automatically lip- sync dialogue that is assigned to them. Alternatively, audio can be set as voiceover narration. Users can download their finished videos as MP4 files, GIFs or video presentations. They can also export them directly to a variety of video hosting sites including YouTube, Wistia, Vidyard, Vimeo, Vzaar and WeVideo. Another version of GoAnimate for schools was also available, simply called GoAnimate for Schools. On April 10, 2018, Vyond announced that GoAnimate for Schools would be shutting down on June 30, 2019. On that same day, GoAnimate removed its 14-day free trial to the schools site. Subscription purchases and renewals on Goanimate4schools.com were later removed on May 6, 2018, with product support and service officially terminating on June 30, 2019. Grounded videos On YouTube, a subculture of videos that utilizes Vyond emerged in 2011. Colloquially known as \\"grounded videos\\" or \\"punishment day videos\\", these videos usually feature characters such as the protagonists from animated children's programs, including Caillou, Dora the Explorer, Little Bill, Arthur, Peppa Pig, The Backyardigans and others acting out of character and generally getting into trouble, resulting in over-the-top punishments. Generally, this is a grounding for a very long and absurd amount of time such as a century or multiple decades, often exaggerated into billions of years. These punishments can also be as extreme as immediate life imprisonment or capital punishment carried out by law enforcement. Grounding videos are usually created with the intent of comedic effect, as the text-to- speech system Vyond uses to provide voices can fail to recognize the large numbers used in those videos, and often reads onomatopoeic sounds as literal words rather than expressions. Individual videos have seen viewership in the millions.

Located west of the Alabama state line, on the east bank of the Tombigbee River, Nashville was once an important shipping port and river crossing location. History The site was settled by Daniel Young, a blacksmith, in 1824, and the place became known as \\"Young's Bluff\\". In 1833, a road was constructed west from Young's Bluff to intersect the Robinson Road (which connected the cities of Columbus, Jackson, and Natchez, and is the second oldest road in Mississippi), and another was constructed east into Alabama. Road traffic passed through the community and then crossed the river on a ferry owned by Young. Another early settler, Nimrod N. Nash, opened a store there, and then purchased Young's property in 1834. He renamed the town \\"Nashville\\", and sold lots to settlers. In addition to the successful ferry service, Nashville's stores supplied local farmers with goods, it had a post office established in 1837, and its port had facilities to store cotton until steamboats arrived in the late autumn-early winter, when water level would rise. Despite this, Nashville never experienced significant growth, and the town did not incorporate. It never had more than two stores, and in census of 1840, the population was about 55 whites, and an undetermined number of slaves. Decline A river flood devastated the low-lying town in 1847, and by 1850, there was one store left. The post office closed in 1852, and the Nashville voting precinct ended the following year. Many of the homes were soon abandoned. Nashville continued to serve as a minor shipping port until the Civil War, and the Nashville Ferry continued to operate until between 1967 and 1973. The river at this site is now part of the Tennessee‚ÄìTombigbee Waterway, and numerous cottages line the east bank. A private boat launch known as \\"Nashville Ferry\\" is located there, and roads leading to the waterway on both shores are named \\"Nashville Ferry Road\\".

He served from 1708 to 1740 as the town clerk of Norwalk. He was one of the purchasers of the land for the present town of Ridgefield, Connecticut from the Ramapoo Indians, as well as the town's clerk and surveyor. He also laid out the lots and roads of the present town of Bedford, New York.  Early life and family  He was born in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on June 9, 1673, the son of David Copp, and Obedience Topliff. His father was a cordwainer, a clerk of the market, and a sealer of leather.Professional Surveyor He was also a surveyor and adviser to selectmen of Boston on matters dealing with the laying of bounds for highways and property listings. John Copp moved to Stamford, Connecticut Colony, while still in his twenties. There he married the widow Mary Jagger Phelps on March 16, 1698, but soon thereafter she died. He worked in Stamford for some time as a schoolteacher.  Settlement at Bedford  In 1699, he temporarily moved to Bedford (which was, at the time a part of the Connecticut Colony, but would later be a part of New York.)Bedford On November 14, 1699, he was granted 23 acres with the condition that he settle on the land for three years. Copp was appointed to a committee to negotiate with the Natives to purchase more land. By February 1700, he was appointed town treasurer and chief surveyor. As town surveyor, he laid out the lots and roads of the town.  Life in Norwalk  In 1701, a town meeting in Norwalk, Copp was hired as a schoolteacher.Norwalk Historical Society In 1705, the selectmen of Norwalk recommended that Copp apply for a medical license. He was subsequently granted a license. On July 24, 1711, at a meeting in New Haven, the Governor's Council of Assistants voted to dispatch Copp as a surgeon with a Connecticut regiment which was assigned to attack the French in Port Royal. Whether or not Copp actually had any medical training is not known.  Purchase of Ridgefield  On May 9, 1706, the Connecticut General Assembly appointed Captain Jonathan Selleck, David Waterbury and John Copp to visit the area north of Norwalk, and south of Danbury for the purpose of inspecting the land for a settlement.Ridgefield Timeline However, complications arise and no action was taken. On May 3, 1708, John Copp and John Raymond, Jr. visited the area. They may have camped at Settlers Rock at the south edge of today‚Äôs Ridgefield Cemetery on North Salem Road. They reported that the land was good and would sustain 30 families or more. As a result, about 20,000 acres of land were purchased from Catoonah on behalf of the Ramapoo Indians. In 1710, the original proprietors of Ridgefield chose John Copp, Josiah Starr and Major Peter Burr to survey their land.The Ridgefield Press Copp was Ridgefield‚Äôs first doctor, first schoolmaster and first Town Clerk. He recorded all the land sales, took the minutes at town meetings and listed all marriages, births, and deaths in the town records. When the Reverend Hauley arrived in 1712, Copp returned to Norwalk. Copp's Island (), Copp‚Äôs Hill Road, Copp‚Äôs Hill Shopping Plaza and Copp‚Äôs Mountain are all named in his honor.

In total, 301 people were killed in what was the worst mine disaster in Turkey's history. The mine, operated by coal producer Soma K√∂m√ºr ƒ∞≈ületmeleri A.≈û., suffered an explosion, the cause of which is still under investigation. The fire occurred at the mine's shift change, and 787 workers were underground at the time of the explosion. After the final bodies were pulled from the mine on 17 May 2014, four days after the fire, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yƒ±ldƒ±z confirmed the number of dead was 301. Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) announced the names of 301 workers who died in the mine disaster and 486 people who survived but some politicians claimed that the number of dead is more than 340. Miners protested against dangerous mining conditions in late 2013 and the demand by the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, to investigate the mine's safety was rejected in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey with votes from the ruling Justice and Development Party only weeks before the disaster. Background Mining accidents are common in Turkey, which has poor mine-safety conditions. According to a report issued in 2010 by the Turkish Economy Policies Research Foundation (TEPAV), in 2008, deaths per 1 million tons of coal mined were 7.22 in Turkey (the highest figure in the world), 5 times the rate in China (1.27) and 361 times the rate in the US (0.02). Official statistics record that more than 3,000 coal miners died in mining accidents from 1941 to April 2014. 78 miners were killed in accidents in 2012, and 95 died in 2013. Prior to the Soma disaster, the deadliest accident in recent Turkish mining history was an explosion which killed 263 people in 1992. The mine, formerly a state-owned company, had been privatized in 2005. In 2012 Alp G√ºrkan, CEO of Soma Holding, indicated that since privatization the cost of producing coal had decreased from about $140 to $24 per ton. In November 2013 hundreds of coal miners protested against working conditions by barricading themselves in a mine in Zonguldak. On 29 April 2014, the Republican People's Party's demand for a parliamentary investigation regarding the safety in Soma mines was rejected by the Grand National Assembly.  Explosion and fire  The fire was started by an explosion that occurred below the surface; the explosion caused the mine's elevator to stop working. The explosion killed 301 workers, injured another 80, and trapped nearly 600 workers in the mine, causing most of the victims to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. Because the explosion took place close to shift change, the exact number of employees underground at the time was initially uncertain. H√ºrriyet first declared a young-looking mine worker among the dead to be 15 years old and working illegally, though this claim has been dismissed by the person's family.  Rescue effort  Rescue crews arrived at the mine soon after the explosion and provided fresh air to the mine workings in an effort to keep those workers still trapped underground alive. Four mine rescue teams were deployed underground to look for trapped miners; however, thick smoke initially hindered progress in the operations to rescue more workers from the mine.  Reactions  = Domestic = * The Turkish government announced three days of national mourning for the Soma coal mining victims. * Presidency of Religious Affairs announces that prayer will be held for Soma on following Friday in all mosques in Turkey. * Youth week activities scheduled to take place on 19 May at the festival was canceled by Ministry of Youth and Sports. * The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) announces that competitions in all amateur and professional leagues scheduled to play on 14 and 15 May have been postponed to a later date. * Soma K√∂m√ºr ƒ∞≈ületmeleri A.≈û., the mine owner, replaced its website with a black page, a message of condolences for those affected by the fire. * Regarding the mining disaster, investigation was initiated by the Office of the Prosecutor in Manisa. * Around 800 protesters hurled stones at the police and shouted anti-government slogans as they tried to march from Middle East Technical University (METU) to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources building in Ankara.

During protests in Soma, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan appeared to push a man while PM Erdoƒüan's aide Yusuf Yerkel was seen kicking a protester lying on the ground. Yerkel later took a sick leave with soft tissue trauma in his right leg. * Hundreds of family members in the town of Soma, Manisa ( from the mine) surrounded and attacked Prime Minister Erdoƒüan's car after he stated the mine deaths were \\"normal\\". Afterwards they chased him through the city, at which point he had to flee to a shop, while rocks were thrown and people shouted \\"murderer\\" and \\"thief.\\" * KESK, one of the principal trade union confederations in Turkey, called for a one-day general strike for Thursday, 15 May, citing privatisation as the cause of the disaster. * Thousands of protestors also gathered in Artvin, Bursa, Edirne, Eski≈üehir, Giresun, ƒ∞zmir, Kƒ±rklareli, Kocaeli, Muƒüla, and Tekirdaƒü.

Background Concurrent to an attack by Russian Southwestern Front, the Russian Western Front was to launch an offensive in the direction of Vilna. However, the plan of attack was changed - instead of an attack on Vilna, the offensive was to target the area of Baranovichi. This change of direction came about due to orders from above, mediated in a vision to Grigory Rasputin, and accepted by the Tsar, as commander-in-chief. In early June 1916, the troops of the Southwestern Front began their offensive, achieving breakthroughs against the Austro-Hungarian army and advancing into Galicia. However, General A. E. Evert, commander of the Russian Western Front, twice postponed planned offensive towards Baranovichi, first on May 31, then on June 4, and then attempted to cancel the operation altogether. By order of Russian GHQ, General Evert was obliged to \\" attack the enemy on the front - Nowogrodek - Baranovichi\\" on June 3. Battle The Russian Fourth Army launched the first attack on July 2 with three army corps, but had stalled by the next day. The Russians revived the offensive on July 4 but again stalled after only two days of fighting. Under the cover of night on July 8, the Russians launched a third push but all Russian attacks were repulsed by the end of the following day. On July 14, the German Army counterattacked and took back all lost ground. A final Russian attempt was made from July 25 to July 29, but yet again failed. Results Despite months of preparation and a sixfold advantage in manpower and artillery, the Russians failed to break through the fortified German positions, seizing only the first fortified line in some areas of the offensive which was then lost to German counterattacks.

History In 1825 the Bishop of Calcutta, Reginald Heber, visited Kandy with the Governor of Ceylon, Edward Barnes, to preach and conduct a confirmation service. He noted that the church services where being held in the former King of Kandy's Audience Hall, a location he associated with 'horrid cruelties'. Heber also recognised the need for a purpose built church to service the needs of the garrison and the local community. In 1841 a public subscription list was established to fund the construction of the church. In 1843 the British Government ceded a block of Crown land to the trustees of the church and their successors in order to construct a church in Kandy. The foundation stone of the church was laid by the Bishop of Madras George Spencer on 16 March 1843 and whilst it was first used on 10 August 1846 construction work was still in progress. The church was primarily constructed out of solid terracotta bricks, manufactured at the Government brickworks. The church wasn't completed until 1852. The church was formally consecrated on 25 January 1853 (Feast day of the conversion of St. Paul) by the first Bishop of Colombo, James Chapman. The church was enlarged in 1878 by Archdeacon Matthew, with addition of a chancel, vestry, and organ chamber. The bricks however were inferior to the original and therefore concreted over. In 1926 a number of significant cracks appeared in the church walls and the eastern section of the building was declared unsafe. The rebuilding of this section facilitated a new extension to the church, the 50-seat Lady Chapel, which was completed and dedicated in August 1928. As it was first used by British officials and the British Garrison, it has been called the Garrison Church. The architectural style is Neo-Gothic, and the interior is a piece of English Victoriana.The Rough Guide to Sri Lanka, Gavin Thomas, Rough Guides, 2012, p. 219. It is an Anglican church, affiliated to the Church of Ceylon. The Reverend Neil Van Dort was vicar at St Paul's Church in 2013. The church houses the only pipe organ in Kandy and potentially, the largest pipe organ in regular use in Sri Lanka. The original pipe organ was donated in 1874 and was in constant use until the 21st Century. In 2009 it was replaced with a similar-sized pipe organ from a disused church in Bradford.

The set is now in the British Museum's Greek and Roman antiquities collection. One of the decorations bears an inscription meaning \\"while Pliny was prefect of cavalry\\". This provides an important link to the famous Roman historian Pliny the Elder, who later witnessed the destruction of Pompeii. History The horse trappings were found in the early nineteenth century at the Roman city of Castra Vetera near modern-day Xanten in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Castra Vera was an important Roman army camp for the Classis Germanica regiment that provided protection and security along the frontier of the Roman Empire. The heightened military presence encouraged the development of a large city nearby that became the second largest settlement in the province of Germania Inferior. Inscription to Pliny the Elder Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as Pliny the Elder, was a Roman historian, author and army commander in the reign of the Emperors Claudius and Nero. Famous for writing Naturalis Historia, he also witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum. One of the horse-trappings bears his name and reads: PLINIO PRAEF(ECTO) EQ(UITUM) ('while Pliny was Prefect of the cavalry'). This suggests that these horse-phalerae belonged to a cavalryman under his command when Pliny was stationed in Germania Inferior in approximately 50 AD. Description The set of horse-trappings is made of about 60 silvered-bronze phalerae and forms part of a decorative equestrian harness that is only partly preserved. Organic material such as leather has not survived but enough roundels have to enable a partial reconstruction of the set in the museum. One of the phalerae has the bust of a Roman Emperor, but it is difficult to determine which emperor is represented from the appearance.British Museum Collection See also *Ribchester Helmet *Mainz Gladius Gallery Image:Silvered-bronze horse trapping from Xanten (BM).JPGImage of a roundel with the bust of an emperor Image:Plinio praefecto.jpgDetail of the phalera with Latin inscription Bibliography *L.

Isis, 1992, 83, 554-563. This is in length discussed by David Pingree in his address to colleagues. Hellenophilia is a way of thought that allows those who look into the history of science to be blinded to science that was born in other cultures. Pingree states, in explanation of the term that \\"a Hellenophile suffers from a form of madness that blinds him or her to historical truth\\" (Pingree, 1992, p. 554) He continues by explaining the main symptoms of Hellenophilia \\"the first of these is that the Greeks invented science; the second is that they discovered a way to truth, the scientific method, that we are now successfully following; the third is that the only real sciences are those that began in Greece; and the fourth (and last?) is that the true definition of science is just that which scientists happen to be doing now, following a method or methods adumbrated by the Greeks, but never fully understood or utilized by them\\" (Pingree, 1992, p. 555). Although Hellenophilia relates directly to the history of science, it is important to look at it through aspects of history that lend to the habit, other than the symptoms listed by Pingree. One of these habits, as described by David C. Lindberg is looking at the history of science as starting with writing in fully syllabic systems.Lindberg, David C. \\"The Beginnings of Western Science\\". The University of Chicago Press. 1992, 2007. According to Lindberg the beginning of syllabic writing was around 1500 B.C., although fully alphabetic writing was apparent in Greece in 800 B.C.

Family Express is known for its pursuit of vertical integration, following an approach similar to Kwik Trip. The Family Express logistics model consolidates what would otherwise be 25 direct store deliveries by different vendors to each store weekly into one combined daily delivery by Family Express itself. One result of the company's centralized logistics, according to the company, has been increased freshness. The company's use of a centralized commissary has been a core aspect of its approach to logistics. In 2004, the company announced plans for its first centralized commissary and bakery at a former warehouse site in Valparaiso. The commissary opened in late 2006. Prior to the launch of the company's commissary, the bakery products were shipped from a manufacturer in Chicago and cross docked for delivery to stores. In 2010, the company built a new distribution center, which includes a bakery. The company has attracted attention for its use of its own proprietary branding, including the Cravin's Market brand for bakery items, Java Wave for hot beverages, and square donuts. Branding has extended to the company's delivery trucks as well, which are festooned with upside-down cows and emit a \\"moo\\" sound when arriving and leaving each location. In 2016, the company launched a \\"hot foodservice\\" brand called Cravin's Kitchen at some locations. Offering kiosk, mobile and app- based ordering, the brand included breakfast sandwiches and \\"made-to-order\\" pizzas. Family Express has placed a high emphasis on attracting and retaining \\"high-quality employees\\". The Family Express turnover rate is among the lowest in the convenience store industry. According to CEO Gus Olympidis, the company uses \\"personal and institutional behavior and performance tools\\" and selects only one candidate out of fifty. In 2011, Olympidis announced that half of the company's stores had zero turnover the previous year. As of 2018, the company's starting wage was US$11 per hour. The company released a customer loyalty app in 2019. Developed by retail industry software as a service provider Paytronix, the app included online ordering for hot foodservice items as well as more traditional customer engagement features. According to Paytronix, the Family Express app was the first convenience-store customer loyalty app to include online ordering. The company's Valparaiso headquarters includes a \\"full-scale, functioning store\\" for employee training and product testing.  Origin and expansion  Springville on US Route 20. The company was started by Gus Olympidis with a single location on Valparaiso's west side in 1975. The initial name of the stores was \\"Time Low\\", which changed to \\"Family Express\\" in 1987. Originally a Northwest Indiana company, in 1999 the company purchased Carter Oil, giving it access to the Lafayette market and improved exposure on Interstate 65. It entered the suburban Indianapolis market in 2018. Plans for the Indianapolis expansion included new sites in Zionsville, Whitestown, and Carmel, with the Carmel location to be designed Art Deco style in conformity with local zoning standards.  Controversies  Family Express square donuts From 2006 to 2018, Family Express was involved in a trademark dispute with Square Donuts of Terre Haute over Family Express's use of the phrase \\"square donuts\\" to describe its square donuts. Square Donuts sent a cease and desist letter to Family Express in 2006, which Family Express opposed on the ground that referring to a square donut as a \\"square donut\\" is purely descriptive. Square Donuts obtained state and federal trademark protection in 2012 and 2013, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office subsequently rejected Family Express's own trademark application due to likelihood of confusion with the Square Donuts mark. In 2016, Family Express brought a declaratory judgment action in federal court to have the Square Donuts trademark invalidated on grounds of descriptiveness. In 2018, Family Express added a new argument, that Square Donuts had abandoned its mark by allowing third parties to use it. Later in 2018, the parties reached a settlement. In 2019, after revelations of severe animal abuse at a confined animal feeding operation operated by Fair Oaks Farms, Family Express discontinued all Fairlife products, replacing them with Organic Valley. Family Express, which was joined by other companies including Jewel-Osco in withdrawing Fairlife products, issued a statement describing the abuse as \\"chilling\\".  Recognition  In 2015, the company received the Convenience Store Decisions \\"Chain of the Year\\" award, described as \\"one of the most prestigious convenience retail awards in the United States.\\" The award was presented by the CEO of RaceTrac Petroleum, who praised the company's \\"outstanding operations\\" and \\"ongoing commitment to convenience retail\\". In 2019, Delish named Family Express the best local convenience store in Indiana. In 2019, the National Advisory Group trade association gave Family Express CEO Gus Olympidis its NAG Lifetime Award for Convenience Retailing. The association cited his \\"indelible mark on the convenience retailing industry\\". As of 2019, trade publication CSP Magazine ranked Family Express 91st in its \\"Top 202\\" convenience store listing, up from 99th place the previous year.

The Guardian has called her the \\"godmother of Italian fashion.\\" According to the New York Times, Mandelli was one of the first female fashion designers to create a popular line of men's wear. In 1964, she unveiled her first black-and-white collection at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, which earned a Critica della Moda award. The fashion house grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Under Mandelli, Krizia released a version of shorts cut \\"very short\\" in 1971, now seen as an early form of hot pants. Krizia grew into a $500 million business at its height during the 1990s. Mandelli was born in Bergamo on Jan. 31, 1925. She had a talent as a seamstress and an interest in fashion, but studied to be a teacher based on her mother's advice. Mandelli worked as a teacher for several years until her friend, Flora Dolci, offered use of a flat in Rome for six months rent-free. She purchased an old sewing machine in the early 1950s and founded her label, Krizia, in 1954 by selling clothes from her Fiat 500.

Background One of the now derelict distribution buildings. Note the overhead rails for carrying munitions. By the turn of the 20th century, the Lubienski-Bodenham family - descended from Mary Tudor, the daughter of King Henry VII - owned the Rotherwas estate, which combined of on the south side of the River Wye. After the death of his wife in 1908, following the death of Count Louis Pomian Lubienski-Bodenham JP DL in 1909 (his great-grand daughter is actress Rula Lenska), having already demolished their country house, sold-off the estate in 1912. At the resultant auction, Herefordshire County Council bought that was overlooked by Dinedor Hill and was bordered by the Wye meadows. World War I At the outbreak of World War I, the Ministry of Munitions were looking to create a number of munitions production facilities quickly and cheaply. A site of was acquired by the Ministry on 15 June 1916, located south of Hereford on the junction of the Welsh Marches Line and the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway. Laid out to a standard design, the site encompassed: * standard gauge railway * of roads * of guard fence * of footpaths and sentry paths *370 buildings varying in floor area. Like a typical munitions facility, the buildings were widely spaced on safety reasons, to avoid complete destruction of the facility in case of an explosion *A rail connected outpost was established at Credenhill, were a munitions store was stablished. During WW2 this land was again requisitioned for defence, and became RAF Hereford, now the home of the Special Air Service. All components were produced elsewhere, with the facility responsible for final production: inserting explosive into shells, and fitting detonators. Shell filling began on 11 November 1916, with both Lyddite and Amatol explosives being used in production. From June 1918, alongside the main plant at Banbury and supporting site at Chittenden; all three were supplied with dichloroethyl sulphide by the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, to produce mustard gas shells. By the ed of WW1, the average output of shells from the facility was 70,000 per week. At peak of 6,000 employees; by October 1918, there were 5,943 employees, 3,977 of which were women. Workers were transported in from billets in Hereford, Leominster and Ross on Wye. Dedicated trains were run from Hereford Barrs Court railway station to the specially built factory station, with free tickets supplied to all employees. Between the wars The only ROF of 25 sites retained between the wars, it was put into care and maintenance from 1920. From 1926 onwards it resumed filling gas shells, staffed by about 400 men. By the late 1930s it was used by the Royal Navy for filling sea mines. World War II During World War II, the facility was used to produce shells, and bombs for the Royal Air Force. The site employed over 8,000 staff, mainly women. The site suffered three major incidents: *12 September 1941: a milling machine overheated, creating explosions with killed three people *27 July 1942: a single Nazi Luftwaffe bomber dropped 2 x 250 kg bombs, killing 22 people *30 May 1944: a bomb during filling operations exploded, setting off a chain reaction. The filling house, located in the south east of the complex, was destroyed, whilst the surrounding buildings were damaged to various extents. The Ministry redeveloped the affected area, and medals were awarded for bravery: five George Medal, one Order of the British Empire, one Member of the Order of the British Empire; nine British Empire Medals, and 34 other commendations. Former ROF Rotherwas distribution buildings from World War II, now used for commercial purposes just north of Netherwood Road. August 2009 Present With vastly reduced production after World War II, the town and county council lobbied for various business to relocate to the site. As the ROF was reduced in scale, parts of the site were redeveloped with various commercial industrial facilities. The ROF closed in 1967. In 1975 Herefordshire County Council bought for redevelopment an industrial estate. A number of World War I buildings survive, as does a group of World War II Romney huts to the north- east, now used as industrial starter units.

Hal originated from a monsoon trough that formed in early June 1985. The system gradually became better organized, and on June 20, the storm attained tropical storm. Intensification continued and the storm reached typhoon intensity later that day. On the evening of June 21, Hal reached peak intensity, before passing south of Taiwan. The storm weakened slightly on June 22, and lost typhoon intensity two days later. Later on June 24, Hal moved onshore northeast of Hong Kong. Hal dissipated three days later. Across the Philippines, 46 people were killed, 10 of which perished due to drownings. Roughly 80% of one Pangasinan municipality was flooded. Widespread power outages were reported, and two radio towers were brought down. A total of 127,440 persons were directly affected by the typhoon. In all, about 13,000 families, or 77,000 people, were homeless and damage totaled $10.5 million. Throughout Taiwan, flooding occurred. There, seven people were killed and 15 others were injured. Prior to landfall in China, 200 shelters were opened, but only 19 people used these shelters. A total of 26 flights were cancelled in Hong Kong. Additionally, eight people were hurt and three others were reportedly missing. Meteorological history Following the extratropical transition of Typhoon Gay on May 26, a spring-like weather pattern returned to the West Pacific, including a tropical upper- tropospheric trough (TUTT) and a strong ridge, which extended from the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula. On June 1, the monsoon trough re-developed over the South China Sea. Thunderstorm activity increased considerably on June 8\\\\. Three days later, a weak disturbance was first noted just north of the equator. Although most of the convection was initially displaced from the center, the system began to show signs of organization on June 15\\\\. Three days later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance. On June 19, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first identified the system; however, strong wind shear caused all the deep convection to become displaced to the south of the center. At 1800 UTC, wind shear began to decrease, and the cyclone developed a well-defined circulation. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Hal. Early the next day, the JMA classified Hal as a severe tropical storm. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Kuring. Convection soon developed along the northern semicircle of the system, and thus Hal began to quickly intensify. At 1200 UTC on June 20, both the JTWC and the JMA estimated that Hal attained typhoon strength. Meanwhile, Hal tracked west-northwestward, while situated south of a ridge that extended west over China. However, both the JTWC and its primary tropical cyclone forecast model predicted Hal to move northward, and re-curve northeast. Around this time, the storm passed about north of Luzon. Late on June 21, the JMA estimated that Hal attained its peak intensity, with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Passing near Taiwan, the storm gradually weakened. At 1800 UTC on June 22, the JMA lowered the intensity of Hal to . According to the JMA, the typhoon leveled off in intensity for roughly 30 hours, before weakening resumed. On the morning of June 24, the JMA downgraded Hal to a severe tropical storm. Five hours later, Hal moved ashore about northeast of Hong Kong at the same intensity. By June 26, the JTWC considered Hal dissipated. The next day, the JMA followed suit and ceased watching the system. Preparations, impact, and aftermath When it became apparent that the storm posed a threat to the Philippines, typhoon alerts were issued for much of Luzon, including the nation's capital city of Manila. Although Hal ultimately passed north of the Philippines, Luzon bore the brunt of the typhoon, enduring widespread flooding and significant crop damage. Forty-six people were killed in the Philippines: fatalities included two individuals who drowned when a river overflowed its banks in the Zambales province; a 24-year-old man electrocuted in Manila; a man who became entrapped in a vehicle; three people caught in a landslide; three civilians and a soldier swept down a torrential river; and ten fisherman aboard a stricken ship. A total of 5,242 families were evacuated, including 50 in Baguio and 89 in Olongapo City. In Laoag, 225 houses were destroyed. Approximately 100 people moved to higher ground in the Pangasinan province. Roughly 80% of the nearby Santa Barbara municipality was flooded. According to press reports, 200 homes were either damaged or destroyed in the province of Ilocos Norte. Elsewhere, in the province of Cagayan, the typhoon damaged of rice and of corn. Widespread power outages were reported, and roads leading to Bagio were closed. Two radio towers were brought down. A total of 127,440 people were directly affected due to the system. In all, 13,518 families or 77,542 persons were left homeless and damage totaled $10.5 million. Offshore, eight people were injured on the U.S. Naval ship Kirk when a large wave crashed over the bow. Another boat, USB Oldendorf, sustained significant damage due to the heavy seas, and 22 of its occupants required rescue. Many of the rescued received minor injuries. A total of 13 people were rescued from the imperiled ship Offshore Patrick. Following the passage of Typhoon Hal in the Philippines, 4,000 bags of food, 200 bags of clothes, and 400 bags of medicine were provided via airlift. A few days after Hal, the nation was later affected by Typhoon Irma. Hal brought heavy rains to much of Taiwan especially along the eastern portion of the island nation, where of precipitation was measured. These rains resulted in flooding, which led to most of the damage. Seven fatalities occurred due to the storm, including five others were initially reported as missing. A 41‚Äëyear‚Äëold woman died due to the collapse of a wooden house. Six people were swept away, including an 11-year-old boy that died and two others were initially rendered as missing. A total of 15 were hurt across the nation, including one child and two farmers. After passing near the Philippines and Taiwan, Hal threatened southern China, becoming the first significant tropical cyclone to do so since Typhoon Ellen in 1983. A total of 200 shelters were opened in Hong Kong, but only 19 people used the shelters. Many schools and business were closed, including all stock markets within Hong Kong. Typhoon Hal brought strong winds to much of southern China. At the Royal Observatory, Hong Kong, winds of and wind gusts of were recorded. A peak wind gust of was observed in the Hong Kong International Airport. Heavy rains were also reported, which led to mudslides. The southern Fujian province was hardest hit, where over 100,000 people were stranded. Ferry service to Macao was cancelled. A total of 14 incoming and 12 out coming flights from Hong Kong were cancelled. Throughout the area, three farmers were reported missing and eight minor injuries were reported. Overall, damage in China was minimal.

At the present time (May 2014), only one species is known, Albidella nymphaeifolia, formerly called Echinodorus nymphaeifolius. It is native to Cuba and the Yucat√°n Peninsula (Belize, Guatemala, Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucat√°n State). Etymology Albidella is a taxonomic anagram derived from the name of the confamilial genus Baldellia. The latter name is a taxonomic patronym honoring the Italian nobleman Bartolomea Bartoloni-Baldelli. Description Leaves are variable; one plant can develop 2 - 3 stems of different types simultaneously. Submersed leaves short-petiolate, blades long, lanceolate to linear, light-green, membraneously transparent, 15 ‚Äì 25 cm long x 0.8 - 1.8 cm wide, obtuse at the point, decurrent to the markedly winged petiole at the base. Their margins are undulate to curled, sometimes narrowly parallel, another time the blades broaden towards the apex and are widest in the upper 1/3 showing clariform.

From 1996 to 2002 she served as director of the New Brunswick Laboratory, becoming the first African American and the first woman in charge of a Department of Energy lab. Early life and education Margaret Ellen Mayo was born in Suffolk, Virginia to Jessie Clifford \\"Clifton\\" and Martha Taylor Artis Mayo. Her mother died when she was quite young, and her father a few years later. She and her siblings were raised for several years by her grandmother Fannie Mae Johnson Mayo, and after her grandmother became ill, by the older sister, Audrey Mae. Margaret and her five siblings were kept together in spite of financial difficulties. The city was strongly segregated, with different areas at the beach and different entrances and drinking fountains in stores and movie theaters. Margaret Mayo attended Ida V. Easter Graded School, and then East Suffolk Junior High. She walked two miles to reach junior high school and was still the top in her class. Her hard work continued through high school. She worked as a maid to help her family while she took advanced placement classes. A well-off African-American couple for whom she worked, Mrs. and Mrs. S. A. Cook, were supportive, sponsoring her as a debutante and encouraging her to attend university. She graduated from East Suffolk High School in 1963 at the top of her class of 99 students, and was its valedictorian. University education Margaret enrolled in the Tuskegee Institute, an action enabled primarily by the availability of financial aid. The Cooks drove her to Alabama, and introduced her to friends at Tuskegee, the Howells. At the time Tuskegee was actively involved in the civil rights movement. At Tuskegee University, Margaret enrolled in chemistry with a minor in mathematics. Margaret was a student research assistant under the mentorship of C. J. Smith and L. F. Koons of the Tuskegee Institute Department of Chemistry. She also participated in summer research at Central State College in Durham, North Carolina and at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). As an assistant at Tuskegee, she studied the conductivity and electrical resistance of different chemicals in water solutions. At ANL, she studied the electrical resistance and chemical combinations of uranium. She graduated from Tuskegee in 1967 with a B.S. degree. She also married briefly and had a son. She earned her master of science degree in analytical chemistry from Wayne State University in 1968, and returned briefly to Tuskegee, where she supervised chemistry projects and taught mathematics (1969-1970). She was then recruited to Brown University where she defended her thesis in 1973 and received her doctorate degree in biochemistry in 1974. Her research involved signal transduction in rat liver cells. Her research advisor at Brown was John Nicholas Fain of the Division of Medical Sciences. While at Brown she married her second husband, Henry Hudson Tolbert. The research conducted by Margaret while she was a student at Brown University was \\"... among the first studies in signal transduction to point out that there are rapid effects of ligands that did not involve RNA or protein synthesis and occur by some intracellular messenger other than cyclic AMP\\" according to Fain. She also taught science and mathematics at the Opportunities Industrialization Center in Providence, Rhode Island, while completing her graduate studies. Further career After earning her doctorate degree, she returned to Tuskegee as a faculty member and researcher in the chemistry department, continuing her rat liver research (1973-1976). She taught at Florida A&M; University for two years (1977‚Äì1979) and was an associate dean there before accepting a short-term visiting research position at the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology (ICP) in Brussels, Belgium in 1979. This position was made possible by a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. She then accepted a short-term visiting research position at Brown University, again working on the biochemistry of the liver. In 1979, Tolbert returned to Tuskegee as the first female director of The Carver Research Foundation of Tuskegee University and as provost of the university, holding these positions for eight years. She also continued to research the effects of drugs on the human liver. Other institutions at which she has conducted research include: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Biomedical Institute, Summer 1974), University of Texas Medical School at Houston (Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy; Department of Pharmacology; Summer 1977), and the NARACOM/ARIEM (Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine) in Natick, MA (between 1980 and 1985). In 1987, Tolbert joined the research department of British Petroleum. She was involved as a corporate planner in the merger of BP and Standard Oil of Ohio. Between 1990 and 1993, she was In 1994, she worked briefly as a consultant for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute developing international research programs. Tolbert then accepted the position of division director at the Argonne National Laboratory. In 1996 she resigned to become director of the New Brunswick Laboratory. She was the first African American and the first woman in charge of a Department of Energy lab. She was director of the New Brunswick Laboratory from 1996 to 2002. She served on Presidential Committees on Education and Technology. As director of the New Brunswick Laboratory, she was involved in projects to prevent the spread of nuclear materials and weapons technology, the preparation of nuclear reference materials for the standardization of instruments, assessment of worldwide measurement capabilities at nuclear laboratories, and measurement of nuclear material from worldwide samples. As of September 22, 2002, Tolbert became Senior Advisor to the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA), promoting activities at the National Science Foundation (NSF) that increase the participation of underrepresented groups (women, minorities, and people with disabilities) in science and engineering. She has acted as Executive Secretary and NSF Executive Liaison to the Committee on Equal Opportunity in Science and Engineering. She retired from the NSF in December 2011. Honors Tolbert has received a number of awards and honors. In 1998, Tolbert was elected as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). She is also a member of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), the American Chemical Society (ACS), and the Organization of Black Scientists.
