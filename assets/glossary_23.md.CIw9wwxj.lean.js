It is located in the village of Vossevangen. It is the church for the Voss parish which is part of the Hardanger og Voss prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The gray, stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1277 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 460 people.  History  View of the church The site of the present church may once have been occupied by a heathen temple. In 1023, King Olaf Haraldsen visited Vossevangen to convert the people to Christianity. Tradition says that he built a large stone cross at the site, which was probably the first Christian place of worship at Voss and it became the main church for Hordafylket during the Middle Ages. The first church here was built of wood, but it was replaced by a stone church in 1277. In a royal letter dating from 1271, King Magnus Lagab√∏te expressed his satisfaction that the parishioners were going to replace the wood building with a stone one, and he urged the continuation and completion of the task. When it was finished in 1277, the church was dedicated to Saint Michael. Restoration work was carried out on the church between 1919 and 1953 by Georg Greve.

Biography  Kathleen Rachel White was born 15 February 1917 near London, England the eldest of three children. She was remembered by one teacher as \\"a voracious reader at school\\". She became interested in science at age 12 or 13, \\"I got hooked on atoms and molecules\\". Growing up in England, during the Depression, her father lost his job as a head teacher and found employment, but with a reduction in pay. She learned as a teenager that teachers' salaries varied by gender, saying \\"the Council that ran the schools 'appointed female heads at half the salary'.\\" She earned a Bachelor of Arts (1939) and, later, a Ph.D. in physics (1970), both from Newnham College, part of the University of Cambridge, in England. She had been awarded a scholarship to study physics at Cambridge University, achieving a Double First in 1939, and was aiming for a career in X-ray crystallography, but after meeting an Australian physicist at the university, she agreed to postpone her doctorate, move to his home country and marry. She arrived with her husband, Richard Makinson (1913‚Äì1979), as World War II was raging in Europe. In Australia, her husband was offered a position at the University of Sydney as a physics lecturer but no similar position was offered to Rachel as the country had placed rigid barriers to prevent most employment of married women. = Researcher = In the 1940s, Rachel Makinson, her preferred name, took the opportunities she had, including tutoring \\"several cohorts of RAAF airmen in the rudiments of radio physics as a precursor to radar training\\". She was enlisted to join a team of 60 physicists to develop radar technology at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), in the Radiophysics Laboratory and was one of only three women on the team, including Ruby Payne-Scott, and Joan Maie Freeman. = Expertise = After the end of World War II, research into the physics of wool fibres had become increasingly important to Australian wool producers, which inspired the CSIRO to launch a Division of Textile Physics. The organizers recruited as a scientific officer \\"a young Englishwoman,\\" Makinson, who would become \\"an international authority on felting, friction and shrinkproofing\\" of woolen textiles. She is quoted as saying that, at the time, \\"next to nothing\\" was known about of the physical properties of wool fibres or about the processes of felting and shrinkage. The only shrinkproofing method available at that time was chlorination, however that process was known to damage the wool fibres and was not well understood from a scientific perspective. Makinson began work in the Division of Textile Physics in 1953, and was a senior principal research scientist from 1971‚Äì1977. She devoted her research to carefully examining the \\"underlying physics of wool fibres and their microscopic interactions.\\" Her appointment did not come without obstacles. As a married woman, she was denied the chance to hold a permanent position at the CSIRO so, for many years, she was retained as a temporary employee and had to seek official reappointment every year. Beginning in the early 1960s, Makinson used her own organizational success to campaign for the fair treatment of her female colleagues. To do so, she helped form the CSIRO Officers Association and used that group to promote equal pay for women on the staff. By applying her research skills, she collected and presented data to management supporting her causes illustrating \\"the systemic nature of discrimination in pay and seniority\\". She was the first woman to become a chief research scientist at CSIRO (1977‚Äì1982). From 1979‚Äì1982, she was the assistant chief of the division, also the first woman to hold such a position. According to her obituary, she succeed despite obstacles, > \\"In 1979, she became Assistant Chief of Division, the first woman to achieve > that rank in CSIRO (having been told by her male boss some years before that > 'I will not have a woman in a senior position if I can help it.')\\". = Final years = Throughout her life she loved bushwalking, identifying native plants and exploring Aboriginal Australia. After the death of her husband in 1976 and her retirement from CSIRO, Makinson moved to the Blue Mountains, where she became active in conservation efforts with the Blue Mountains Conservation Society and Historical Society. When her health declined in the 1990s, she returned to Sydney and died 18 October 2014, survived by two sons.

The anonymous text depicts Roman empress Agrippina the Younger on the way to her execution, which was ordered by her son, the emperor Nero, whom she had schemed to put on the throne. The title of the cantata, which is approximately fifteen minutes in length, may be translated as \\"Agrippina condemned to die\\". Background The German-born Handel spent several years of his early career living and working in Italy, first in Florence, then in Rome. Operas were banned in Rome by order of the Pope at the time Handel was resident there but the very wealthy Cardinals and leaders of the Church who were Handel's patrons in Rome presented musical entertainments for their guests at their palatial residences. For these occasions Handel composed a series of cantatas, most of them of a pastoral character, but some, as \\"Agrippina condotta a morire\\" and others, more in the nature of dramatic monologues. The cantata The death of Agrippina It is not certain exactly when or where the cantata, to a text by an anonymous author, was first performed, but it is probable that it was one of the many secular cantatas Handel composed for entertainment at the palace of Cardinal Ruspoli in Rome, at some point between 1707- 08. The soloist was probably the soprano castrato Pasqualino Tiepoli. The historical Roman empress Agrippina the Younger, wife of the emperor Claudius, had plotted to make her son by another marriage, Nero, Claudius' heir to the throne and had finally poisoned her husband, according to various Roman historians, to ensure the success of her machinations.Tacitus, Annals XII.66; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.34; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 44; Josephus is less sure, Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.8.1 After a few years, however, Nero tired of his powerful mother's interference and condemned her to death. Handel's cantata depicts Agrippina on the way to her execution, in a series of recitative passages, ariosos and arias, accompanied by two violins and continuo instruments. At first Agrippina bewails her cruel fate, condemned to death by her own son, who owes his position entirely to her. Her mood turning to fury, she calls on the gods to destroy the monster Nero. Torn by conflicting emotions, however, she cannot help feeling love for her son, and vacillates between praying for his success as ruler and her desire that justice should be done. Finally she reconciles herself to her death and the cantata ends with quiet resignation. The way Handel vividly portrays these contrasting emotions in his music makes the piece, in the opinion of musicologist Winton Dean, \\"a masterpiece\\". In 1709, in Venice, Handel produced a full-length opera, \\"Agrippina\\", to huge success.

Constructed in 1901 and designed by Boston-based Allen & Vance, the brick dorm stands five stories tall. Lathrop houses 180 students who may be any year or gender. History Lathrop House was the third residential quadrangle (quad) dormitory built on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893‚Äì1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing‚Äîa single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building‚Äîwas quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of the dorm was paid for with Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had been paid for by a gift from John D. Rockefeller. The dormitory is named after Dr. Edward Lathrop, one of Vassar's charter trustees, and carries the full name Edward Lathrop House. Lathrop's daughter, Julia, was a graduate of the Vassar class of 1880. In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a multicultural student space, moved into Lathrop in spite of initial disagreement by members of the house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish house across the street from the college. Architecture and features Lathrop was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Francis Richmond Allen and J. McArthur Vance who were also responsible for the design of its neighbor, Davison House, in 1902. Formulating a design for these two buildings was not difficult as a template had already been set by way of the preexisting Strong and Raymond Houses. Frederick Law Olmsted, a consultant of design for the college, recommended that any new dorms in the area be built in an \\"echelon formation\\" in order to provide for a greater sense of openness. Allen disregarded this advice, instead opting to place the dorm, along with Davison, in \\"two long unbroken rows of buildings on the bias\\". Lathrop was ultimately placed north of Strong, across the quad to the east of Davison, and diagonally across from Raymond. Lathrop stands five stories tall with an additional basement level. The dormitory, Elizabethan in style, is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim. The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys, each built with two wythes of brick and capped with bluestone. There are also multiple cupolas that are framed with wood, include painted louvered slats, and have topped with a coat of terne. The building also has parapets, unlike neighboring Strong. The house is co-ed and currently has a capacity of 180 students. Students in Lathrop, which houses students of all class years, may live in either single rooms, one-room doubles, or three-room triples. Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall.

Initially a camp for migrant farm workers, it became the Sacramento Assembly Center a temporary detention center for interned Japanese Americans in 1942. The site is one of 12 California assembly centers that share designation as California Historical Landmark No. 934. History Camp Kohler had many uses throughout its existence. It began as a migrant farm worker camp and was later used to house over 4,700 Japanese Americans who had been removed from the West Coast during World War II. One of 15 temporary detention sites known as \\"assembly centers\\" and run by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the Sacramento site, called the Sacramento Assembly Center, confined Japanese Americans from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties while they waited to be transferred to a more permanent and isolated War Relocation Authority camp. Also known as the Walerga Assembly Center, it was one of the smaller WCCA camps and operated for 52 days, from May 6 to June 26, 1942. Upon closure of the assembly center, the site was turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as Camp Kohler. After the war, returning Japanese Americans, prevented from owning their pre-war homes by discriminatory legislation and faced with a severe housing shortage, were often unable to find housing, and 234 families temporarily lived at Camp Kohler in late 1945. Today, the former Signal Corps camp site is part of a residential subdivision just outside the city of Sacramento, in a community called Foothill Farms. There is a sign on Roseville Road that reads Camp Kohler, 5922 Roseville Rd, Gate 201. It is next to a fenced area that has a building and a tower with a rotating antenna. There also appear to be remnants of the camp in Walerga Park at the northwest corner of Palm Avenue and College Oak Drive, where there is a plaque commemorating California Historical Landmark #934, Temporary Detention Camps for Japanese Americans-Sacramento Assembly Center.

The company makes mobility enhancement products for physical therapy and athletic training. The first product, the Anti-Gravity Treadmill, now includes a product line including the M/F320, Via 400 and 400X, and Pro 200 and 500. In 2013 the company acquired Tibion Corporation and added the Bionic Leg to its list of products. Charles Remsberg is CEO.  History  Sean Whalen and his father developed the original prototype of the Anti-Gravity Treadmill in the family garage. They used technology developed by NASA to create a treadmill that unweights a user through \\"differential air pressure\\". The Nike Oregon Project, runner and coach Alberto Salazar, the Oakland Raiders and the Golden State Warriors tested and used the prototype. In 2007, the Washington Wizards were the first professional sports team to purchase the P200 model, and by 2008, the Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, Houston Texans, and Phoenix Suns all purchased the P200 for their training rooms. In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the Anti- Gravity Treadmill, which at the time went by the name G-Trainer, as a medical device applicable for uses in rehabilitation. Since then the company's Anti- Gravity Treadmill has been used for rehabilitating lower extremity injury or surgery, aerobic conditioning, weight control, gait training for neurological conditions, strengthening and conditioning the elderly. The company named Steve Basta as CEO in 2011. Steve is a graduate of the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering program. In 2013, AlterG acquired the Tibion Corporation, and took over production and sales of its flagship product, the Bionic Leg.  Technology  All of AlterG's products are manufactured and assembled at the company's headquarters in Fremont, CA. The company's line of Anti-Gravity Treadmills and its Bionic Leg both use patented technologies. =Differential air pressure= NASA developed the differential air pressure technique as a way for astronauts to exercise and maintain conditioning in space. In 2012, NASA purchased the P200 model to use for pre-flight and post- flight training of International Space Station astronauts. AlterG now holds a patent for this technology, which employs air pressure to adjust the users body weight on the treadmill between 20% and 100% of normal weight. In 2013, AlterG was named by Fast Company as one of the top 10 most innovative companies in sports for its Anti-Gravity Treadmill. The company's Anti-Gravity Treadmill M320 was cleared by the FDA for use in medical facilities, hospitals, physical therapy clinics, and skilled nursing facilities. Like the other models, the M320 can reduce a user's body weight by up to 80%. The company released the Anti-Gravity Treadmill F320 in 2013. This device is classified as a fitness product and does not meet some of the electrical interference requirements designated by some hospitals. The Pro Anti-Gravity Treamills are used in professional athlete training and conditioning because of their high top speed of 18 mph. =Intention based therapy= Bob Horst developed the technology behind the Bionic Leg, which contains sensors and robotics that detect and provide force when a patient's weight shifts. The Bionic Leg is a battery-operated external brace that uses information from foot sensors to predict the user's movements while the user walks, sits, and stands.  In professional sports  The company's Anti-Gravity Treadmill is used by professional sports teams and university sports programs, including the Seattle Seahawks, Miami Heat, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Washington Wizards, Golden State Warriors, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets, Texas Rangers, Green Bay Packers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Detroit Lions, Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia 76ers. US Olympic Training Centers also use the Anti-Gravity Treadmill. NBA players Kobe Bryant and LeBron James and former marathon record holder Paula Radcliffehttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/5246677/Paula- Radcliffe-Fame-and-Fortune.html use the Anti-Gravity Treadmill for physical therapy and training. Tom Brady, quarterback for the New England Patriots, purchased two of the Anti-Gravity Treadmills.  In medicine  The company's products are used in medical centers and physical therapy clinics for various types of rehabilitation. In the United States, the products are used by Johns Hopkins Medicine, the Mayo Clinic, University of San Francisco, UNC Health Care, and Stanford Medical Center.

A French lady, her name was Elisabeth Marie (nicknamed: Majotte) (n√©e: Tong Lee A Tai). She was of Vietnamese descent born in Paris, France in 1883. Born and bred into French society, Elisabeth Marie came from a wealthy Vietnamese family who had established themselves within the French culture. After ending up in French Guiana and meeting Rudolf J. Tjin-A-Djie, they decided to marry on September 15, 1904. Upon her marriage in Suriname, Elisabeth Marie \\"[she] took not only her √©lan, her savoir vivre, her French hats and porcelain, but also the French language and introduced all of that into the extended Chinese family system.\\" Elisabeth had a fascination for fashion, craftsmanship, and artistry. As a result of this, she heavily influenced the creations of the Tjin-A-Djie crest and constructed it into the family's tableware, including the plates, pure silver cutlery, and the pure crystal glassware. Since Elisabeth was influenced by the French culture having being born in Paris, after marriage and moving to Suriname with Rudolf, she also established a millinery shop, creating and selling beautiful hats in Suriname. Although Rudolf spoke Dutch and Elisabeth spoke French, they communicated Sranan Tongo to each other, the Surinamese language. In his family life, Rudolf was a stern but kind man, often taking his grand kids riding on his horses when they were little. For example, Reginald and his younger twin brother Randolf would take turns sitting in front of him on the horse, enjoying a ride on a warm summer's day. Typically, Reginald would always ride first then Randolf. Apart from being a proprietor at the gold mines, Rudolf also owned at least one grocery store and as of 1938 was the owner of the Hollandia bakeryDBNL Literatuur Uit Nederland & Vlaanderen (2011).

Tjin-A-Djie and Elisabeth Marie had 9 children of high social standing, and moved from Albina, Suriname to Paramaribo, Suriname when the children were little. Enjoying a privileged life, the children later then flourished in the areas of business, sports, education, and politics. #Eduard Leo Henri (October 15, 1905 ‚Äì 1933) (Studying to be a doctor when died) #Henriette Magdalena Antoinette (February 14, 1907 ‚Äì 1967) (Teacher) #Herman Rudolf Johan (November 6, 1910 ‚Äì 1975) (Tennis champion,p.181 Zijlmans G.C. and Enser H.A.

The blade is also referred to as Sewah by the Gayo people, Seiva by the Minangkabau people, Siva by the Alas people, and Siwaih by the Acehnese people.  Description  The sewar is a short-bladed dagger used in traditional Indonesian close-quarter fighting styles. The weapon has a slightly curved single or double-edged blade. From the handle's base, the blade either narrows or widens at the tip, depending on the style. The double- edged sewar has a back edge that runs from the tip of the blade to the base of the hilt. Typically, the blade is either flat ground, without a mid-line ridge, or hollow ground. Sometimes it has a slightly hollow grind and a reinforced (integral) back, or comes with several slightly hollow sections. Unlike other traditional combat weapons, the sewar's handle lacks a finger guard. Usually a ferrule made of brass is mounted at the base of the handle to better secure the handle and the blade. For ceremonial versions, a ferrule clamp is extremely ornate (Tampo). Its design can be rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, or triangular (Glupa). Traditionally the handle is made of wood and often decorated with carvings or metal ornaments. Various versions of the handle are crafted differently, in styles such as the Hulu Boh Glimo or the Akar Bahar. The sheaths are usually made of wood, with oval-shaped cross- sections, and are decorated with carvings. Expensive versions are often decorated with precious metals or embedded with gems. The sheath consists of two pieces of wood held together with rattan or silver and gold bindings. On one side of the sheath's \\"throat\\", where the protrusion of the daggers are visible, more expensive examples are covered with plique-√†-jour mountings worked in precious metal and filled with enamel. The Sewar is regarded as outstanding for slashing. The sewar is similar to the rencong and the , but its blade is longer, heavier and rests in a distinctly different sheath. The sewar has functional, ornamental and cultural similarities to the kris, found on the Indonesian island of Java, with variants indigenous to Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the southern Philippines.  Culture  = Tari Sewah = The Tari Sewah (meaning \\"Sewah Dance\\") is a traditional Minangkabau dance performed by two or three dancers wielding the Sewar. If there are two dancers, only one carries the Sewar. With three dancers, two carry the dagger to portray offensive dance movements towards the unarmed dancer. The Sewar is never used by dancers who hold personal grudges against the unarmed dancer. This traditional dance is one of the Tarian Pancak, a category of traditional dance influenced by some styles of traditional Indonesian martial arts, Pencak Silat.

Walter was born in Mecklenburg, Germany in about 1831 and arrived in Victoria in the 1850s. Botanical work Prostanthera walteri Walter discovered and collected a new species of mint bush on Mount Ellery which was named in his honour as Prostanthera walteri by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1870 . It is thought that Walter accompanied the geodetic survey team headed by Government Astronomer Robert L. J. Ellery which surveyed East Gippsland and the border with New South Wales from 1869 to 1871. He collected plants on behalf of Anatole von H√ºgel and was accompanied by missionary George Brown in exploring the Bismarck Archipelago in 1875. In 1889, Walter collected the type specimen of Eucalyptus x brevirostris in the Upper Yarra region in 1889. During the 1890s, Walter collected plant specimens in the Australian Alps, accompanied by Charles French junior. From the 1890s until his death in 1907, Walter was head of economic botany at the Technological Museum in Melbourne. In 1906, Walter described a new subspecies of the orchid Diuris punctata in The Victorian Naturalist, based on plant material collected at Mount Arapiles by St. Eloy D'Alton. He named it Diuris puncata var. d'Altoni, subsequently revised to daltoni. Photography Walter set up a photographic studio in Melbourne, promoting himself as a \\"Country Photographic Artist\\" or \\"Landscape Photographic Artist\\". For a twenty-year period starting from about 1862, he would periodically travel to eastern and alpine regions of Victoria with camera equipment and camping gear in a backpack. In 1866 Walter took 106 photographs of Aboriginal people at Coranderrk east of Melbourne, which were exhibited at the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia in Melbourne in 1866-67.

It is named after B. Gompertz. It can be defined by the continued fraction : G = \\\\frac{1}{2-\\\\frac{1}{4-\\\\frac{4}{6-\\\\frac{9}{8-\\\\frac{16}{10-\\\\frac{25}{12-\\\\frac{36}{14-\\\\frac{49}{16-\\\\dots}}}}}}}} , or, alternatively, by : G = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\frac{3}{1+\\\\frac{3}{1+\\\\frac{4}{1+\\\\dots}}}}}}}}. The most frequent appearance of G is in the following integrals: : G = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\ln(1+x)e^{-x}dx=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\frac{e^{-x}}{1+x}dx=\\\\int_0^1\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\log(x)}dx. The numerical value of G is about : G = 0.596347362323194074341078499369279376074\\\\dots When Euler studied divergent infinite series, he encountered G via, for example, the above integral representations. Le Lionnais called G the Gompertz constant because of its role in survival analysis. In 2009 Alexander Aptekarev proved that at least one of the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant and the Euler-Gompertz constant is irrational. This result was improved in 2012 by Tanguy Rivoal where he proved that at least one of them is transcendental. Identities involving the Gompertz constant The constant G can be expressed by the exponential integral as : G = -e\\\\textrm{Ei}(-1). Applying the Taylor expansion of \\\\textrm{Ei} we have the series representation : G = -e\\\\left(\\\\gamma+\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(-1)^n}{n\\\\cdot n!}\\\\right). Gompertz's constant is connected to the Gregory coefficients via the 2013 formula of I.

According to the art historian Sharyn Udall, Lefranc was a woman \\"on the edge of the avant-garde\\". Lefranc produced portraits, figures, florals, still lifes and landscapes in a variety of compositions. Her media included oil, watercolor, gouache, pastel, drawing, etching and monotypes. At age eighteen, she received accolades from Alfred Stieglitz and, in November 1928, aged twenty-two, received rave reviews in La Revue Moderne, when her works Dancer and Mme M. en Pyjama were shown in Paris. Early life Margaret Lefranc was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Abraham Frankel and Sophie Tiplitz Frankel, immigrants from Moscow and Tibilisi, respectively. During their marriage, Abraham owned a shirt factory, a shipping line, distributed Western films, built the Lowe's theater in Brooklyn, owned other real estate and was the first person to have a small orchestra in vaudeville. They had four children, but one son died. They spent summers in Hunter, New York, at a farmhouse built in 1776 which Abraham purchased. Lefranc was often in poor health which made it difficult for her to attend school regularly. Lefranc was the youngest child and at the age of six, she decided to become an artist. The Brooklyn home inspired her young artistic inclinations with colorful medallions and portraits of famous people on the library ceiling and a print of Rosa Bonheur's Horse Fair on a wall. Eventually her mother, tired from housekeeping, talked Abe into moving into two suites at the Hotel Pennsylvania located in Manhattan. Margaret spent a lot of time alone when she wasn‚Äôt in the hands of a caregiver. Early Education and Berlin Starving Woman in Germany, 1921. Charcoal on paper by Margaret Lefranc. In New York City, Lefranc attended Adelphi Academy and Hunter College Model School. At the age of twelve and living at the Pennsylvania Hotel, she was chauffeured to her formal classes at the New York's Art Students League where she attended for three or four hours. She worked in charcoal drawing reproductions. Abe's shipping business closed with the beginning of World War I, when one of his tankers was torpedoed by the Germans and the survivors were shot in their lifeboats. Abe was commissioned by the U. S. Government to scrap the German fleet, and the girl's parents moved to Germany but left the children in the U.S. Celeste, the elder, who was nine years older and married, looked after Margaret. Lefranc finished the last few months in school, and at the age of thirteen, traveled by freighter to join her parents in Berlin where she contracted rheumatic fever. She spent almost a year in bed, didn‚Äôt speak German until six months later, and, at that time, wasn‚Äôt exposed to the widespread hardship in the city. Abe built her a small studio on the roof of their apartment building where Margaret drew in charcoals under the tutelage of a young art student who eventually told her parents to leave her alone and let her develop on her own. Once he brought an old woman he had met on the street to pose by Lefranc's bedside for a small amount of money. Lefranc was aware that the money from the sketch would allow the woman to buy some food. When Lefranc was well, she took classes in charcoal drawing and charcoal portraits at \\"Kunstschule des Westens\\", the School of the West. After a year in Berlin, the Frankel's moved to Paris. Paris, 1922 to 1932 Self Portrait, 1927. Oil on canvas by Margaret Lefranc. Returning to New York, to renew her passport, aged eighteen, Lefranc was introduced by Claude Bragdon, a close friend her sister, to Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe and Alfred Stieglitz. Stieglitz looked at her art very seriously and said, \\"Young lady, you‚Äôre very gifted. But you are also very French. Come back after you‚Äôve lived in America for ten years.\\" In Paris, Lefranc became interested in contemporary developments. She saw the works of Marc, Kollwitz, Lehmbruck, Heckel and other artists of Die Br√ºcke, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. She loved the great old masters, but it was the modernists, particularly Lovis Corinth, who stimulated her profoundly. She practiced the use of light and shadow in the development, on a two-dimensional surface, of forms in a three dimensional space. Diane Armitage, freelance writer and digital video artist, wrote about one of the artist's self-portraits, \\"Lefranc appears to have ‚Äòcome into her own‚Äô early on when faced with the prospect of confronting a ‚Äòpersona‚Äô‚Ä¶by the way of realist techniques which slid into abstraction‚Ä¶she was able to incorporate some of the ‚Äòisms‚Äô of the day.\\" Lefranc studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, the Russian Academy, \\"Academy Russe in Paris\\". Her teachers included Basil Tchoukaieff, Antoine Bourdelle and Charles Bissiere. With Andr√© Lhote, she learned how to apply paint to create flat, dryly handled planes of color, inspired by Cubism, and also more literal descriptive passages. Hunter House, 1936. Oil on canvas by Margaret Lefranc. Felice Swados Writing Novel, 1940. Oil on canvas by Margaret Lefranc. Lefranc struggled with her signature signing \\"MF\\" then \\"FRA\\" and also \\"Frankel.\\" When she was older she graduated to signing \\"Lefranc.\\" Lefranc returned to New York in 1932, and seven years later exhibited in the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, New York. But her first task was to save the family's 1776 farmhouse from the courthouse steps in Hunter, New York, and set about repairing it. She immediately set up the Hunter Colony and invited her young friends she had met when teaching art at Camp Allegro: Felice Swados and her future husband, Richard Hofstadter, and their friends, all who paid a stipend and spent summers working on projects whether painting, music, a thesis, or a book. Lefranc painted portraits including her own, the apple orchard and other landscapes. A portrait of Felice Swados typing her book, House of Fury, while sitting in an evening gown in Lefranc's apple orchard, now resides in the library of St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico, along with the Swados book. As Susan Ressler, author, noted, \\"Lefranc's portraits are unflinching in their honesty and often experiment with abstract form. Her landscapes seem gentler and more empathic‚Ä¶reveling in the beauty and the wonder of the West.\\" Clifton Fadiman, author, radio and television personality and Lefranc's brother-in-law's brother, dubbed the artist \\"Ur\\" Hippie. Lefranc's next door neighbors were Betty Comden (Mrs. Steve) and Betty's working partner for many musicals, Adolph Green. There was a mutual sharing of parties, in Lefranc's swimming pool and Comden's tennis court. Also, frequenting were Leonard Bernstein, Judy Holliday and others interested in the theater. Guild Art Gallery, 1935-37 In 1934-35, Lefranc was a guest of Rene d'Harnoncourt on the Art in America radio programs speaking about American and European art. During that time Lefranc decided to fund, open and direct an art gallery for gifted Americans located on the fifth floor of Thirty-seven West Fifty-Seventh Street. The Guild served as the launch site for Arshile Gorky with his first New York one- man exhibition. When he was starving, Lefranc also fed him at L√ºchow's Restaurant. She released him from his contract when Julien Levy promised Gorky an income of twenty-five dollars a month, which she couldn‚Äôt match, plus exhibitions. Levy did give him $700, but an exhibition didn't occur until 1944, almost nine years later. Lefranc also represented the sculptor Chaim Gross, Saul Baiserman, Theodore Roszak, Ary Stillman, Jean Liberte, Lloyd Raymond Ney, Donald Forbes, Philip Reisman, Max Weber, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and many others. On vacations and on weekends Lefranc painted five paintings a day in Hunter, often the subject of her work during those years, including self- portraits because, as Lefranc said, \\"I was the cheapest model I could find.\\" Lefranc closed the gallery in 1937. In 1980, Lefranc was asked to contribute her papers of the Guild Art Gallery to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian. Taos, New Mexico, Summer 1939 Hopi Woman Basket Maker, 1956. Etching on paper by Margaret Lefranc. In 1939 Lefranc took a trip with her friend, the photographer Annette Stevens Rada to Florida, then travelled on to Texas and north to Las Vegas and finally to Taos, New Mexico to visit her friends, Dr. Rudolph and Majorie Kieve. Through the Kieve's, Lefranc met Frieda Lawrence and rented a townhouse from her. At the same time, having been apprised by Thomas Mann of the arrival of his son-in-law in Taos, the Kieves met W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman at the bus station in the center of the village. Auden was traveling as tutor and paid companion to Kallman. Auden insisted on accompanying Lefranc to California. It was a journey and vacation Lefranc would never forget. She wrote about Frieda Lawrence, Auden and Kallman, Witter Bynner and others in an article published in 1992 and later serialized. Before she left Taos, Lefranc promised Frieda Lawrence that when she had one thousand dollars saved, she would return to live in New Mexico. New York, 1939-45 The years from 1939-45 were disappointing for Lefranc. Mixed in with the vacation to Taos, Lefranc assisted in her family's real estate investments, worked as a textile designer and stylist (1938-1944); and served on the staff of the Cooper Union Museum (1944-1945). She also met and lived with Raymond Elton Schoonover, a book store owner of Dutch descent, for a year. Though he was thirteen years her junior, they married in 1942 and divorced in 1945. At Cooper Union, Lefranc, now known as Margaret Schoonover, had been hired as a curator, but that never came to fruition. Lefranc did, however, arrange exhibitions for the art students upstairs. Lefranc also donated several of her own works of art to the museum. \\"During my vacations and every weekend that I could, I returned to Hunter to paint. In November 1945 when the war had ended, I trained three people to take over my job at Cooper Union, which I thought was terribly funny.\\" By the time she left Cooper Union, Lefranc had already met Alice Marriott, author and anthropologist, who had come to New York in 1940 to help to set up the landmark American Indian Exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, along with Rene d'Harnoncourt, Mary and Frederic Douglas and Kent Fisher. Lefranc had already met D'Hornoncourt when guesting on his Art in America radio program. D'Harnoncourt, Frederic \\"Eric\\" Douglas and Alice Marriott were all friends. Margaret joined the group soon afterwards when Dr. Rudy Kieve wrote a letter of introduction for Marriott to present to Margaret when Marriott was in New York. After that, friendships continued by correspondence and then vacations. 1945 was a busy year. Once Lefranc realized that her husband wouldn‚Äôt change his rambunctious nature, she placed all of his belongings on the apartment landing, called him to retrieve them, rented out the apartment, divorced him on June 19, 1945, then escaped from family and former husband and went West by invitation of Alice Marriott when she said, \\"Why don't you come out West to live?...We can arrange to work together.\\" Marriott had received a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study the Indian potters of San Ildefonso Pueblo, near Nambe and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The war was over, so Lefranc decided to give it a trial for six months, team up with Marriott and paint as much as she could in the Southwest. Nambe, New Mexico, 1945-55 Lefranc arrived in Santa Fe in her old 1935 Dodge to disruptive events. Plans had changed due to Marriott's explosive temper directed toward the owner of two casitas. Lefranc and Marriott were suddenly homeless as it was the end of World War II, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory had swallowed all rental property in and around the area. They did find an empty house in Nambe consisting of three small rooms in a row, each with a door to the outside. It looked exactly like a railroad car with a discreet privy fifty feet away. It had no heating, no water, no electricity and no furniture either. It was a life experience which Lefranc illustrated for Marriott in The Valley Below and a story detailed for Lois Katz, author, and for Sandra D'Emilio. The Corral, Nambe New Mexico, 1948. Oil on canvas by Margaret Lefranc.In Nambe, Lefranc saw the spectacular distant sierras which she painted regularly along with other scenery. The lives of these two independent women were complicated with adventures and misadventures while attempting to produce art and books. It was full of Indian dances and socializing with neighbors of different languages and cultures. Nambe, 1953. Crayon and charcoal on paper by Margaret Lefranc. Lefranc completed Indian illustrations of pottery in the round (instead of the usual flat panel), portraits of Maria Martinez and her home life, illustrated and painted in oils Indian dances at the Pueblos as well as her Spanish neighbors and their environs. Also part of the time included trips to Oklahoma to meet with the University of Oklahoma Press in Norman regarding her illustrations for Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso (still in print) and five other books. She also illustrated Alma Big Tree, a Kiowa Medicine Woman and traveled to Southern Cheyenne Reservation to paint an elder, Mary Inkanish, who was an expert on beadwork, which gouache was used as a frontispiece for one of Marriott's book. Additional trips included Iowa, Wyoming, Montana and other states intermixed with her own exhibitions at the Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe; the Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa Oklahoma; the Oklahoma Civic Center, Oklahoma City; and others. She collected pottery, assisted Marriott in establishing small historical museums set up in store fronts, and traveled for research and artifact gathering. A noted painter, illustrator, and editor, in 1948 Lefranc received a \\"Fifty Best Books of the Year\\" award from the Library of Congress in conjunction with the American Institute of Graphic Arts for her synoptic illustrations of pottery in Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso; and in 1952 for Indians of the Four Corners, she was honored by the same organizations with a \\"One Hundred Best Books of the Year\\". Eventually she was adopted by a Nambe Pueblo Indian medicine woman, Leonidas Romero y Vigil, and also later became trusted friends of Maria Martinez, Laura Gilpin, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, and many others which included her Spanish and Indian neighbors. As Lefranc explained to Diane Armitage, \\"When the Indians had a fight at the Pueblo, the elders came over one evening with a package and they handed it to me. Keep it for us. We‚Äôre having a fight. This is our sacred fettish. We're afraid someone might try to steal it. I never opened it. I kept it for two years.\\" Lefranc illustrated several books written by Marriott: * Dance Around the Sun, T.Y. Crowell, 1977 * Hell on Horses and Women, University of Oklahoma Press, 1953 * Indians of the Four Corners, T.Y. Crowell, 1952 * Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso, University of Oklahoma Press, 1948 * The Valley Below, University of Oklahoma Press, 1948 * Indians on Horseback, T.Y. Crowell, 1948 Autumn Foliage, 1990. Monotype on paper by Margaret Lefranc.In 1945 Lefranc bought property in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1954 she built a house at the same time when Marriott became indisposed and their thriving partnership broke apart. Lefranc eventually sold the Nambe house, and they went their separate ways, for which Marriott later expressed deep regret. Lefranc rented her house in Santa Fe until 1969 and moved to Florida to care for her ailing parents. In 1956 Lefranc donated ninety-two pieces of pottery to what is now the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma. Before the contribution, this collection Lefranc exhibited artistically on a rust colored adobe wall in Nambe in a new living room which she had just finished building when Georgia O'Keeffe and Maria Chabot arrived for tea. \\"Georgia walked in, didn‚Äôt say a word, looked around very seriously and then turned to Maria and said, ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I have a room as beautiful as this.‚Äô Miami and Santa Fe, 1956-98 Margaret Lefranc with Winter. Photograph by Klara Farkas. Upon leaving Nambe in 1956, Lefranc moved to Miami, Florida to care for her parents. She assumed the management of their real estate, invested in the stock market and eventually bought the second oldest house in Coconut Grove which she restored. Lefranc successfully sold her art, and exhibited at various museums throughout the United States while taking classes at the University of Miami to see what the \\"youngsters\\" were doing. She even accompanied them to Yanhuitlan Oaxaca, Mexico. There the artist abstracted the essence of figures by using blocky color forms to make up their shapes and thin brushstrokes to give the forms their figural presence. There were a number of paintings in gouache and casein on paper‚Äîportraits, fans, figures of female and male Indians, churches and street scenes. Margaret Lefranc, Governor Bruce King, and Sandra McKenzie, President of Margaret Lefranc Art Foundation Margaret Lefranc following the Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts‚ÄîPainting, 1996. Photograph by Matt Gray. Until 1997 Lefranc continued to visit Santa Fe to make repairs on her home, to visit her adopted Indian family at the Nambe Pueblo, and to paint. She also traveled to the Hunter home in the Catskills which she still owned all and continued taking care of her parents and their interests. After her parents died during the 1960s, her traveling included Greece and a brief trip to Paris, but she mainly established a pattern of six months living in Miami and then Santa Fe and keeping up with her friends, Laura Gilpin, O'Keeffe, and others. After Gilpin's death, Lefranc's life took a new turn with her business manager and companion's collaboration, Sandra McKenzie. McKenzie began cataloguing all of Lefranc's art first in Miami and then in Santa Fe, where McKenzie chauffeured the artist. In 1994, the artist and McKenzie formed the Margaret Lefranc Art Foundation to protect her art collection. First as Director, and later appointed President, McKenzie read and organized file drawers of newspaper articles, exhibition announcements, reviews, invitations, one-person and group exhibitions, and compiled all educational background and awards. Any articles Lefranc had written, McKenzie found an audience. McKenzie nominated, unknown to Lefranc, and later Lefranc received the 1996 Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts, Painting, presented by Governor Gary Johnson and New Mexico's First Lady, Dee Johnson. Over the years, McKenzie captured eighty-five years of Lefranc's art history ‚Äî a legacy of research preserved for the future including the first book, A Lifetime of Imaging: The Art of Margaret Lefranc, and then produced a film by the same name. Defining Lefranc's art at this time were major exhibitions at the Governor's Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the Independent Spirits exhibition at the Autry National Center, Los Angeles, California, which traveled to other museums; and also the State Department's Breaking Boundaries, American Women Artists in France, exhibition in Paris.

His most notable contribution came in his publication of Essai sur un nouveau mode d‚Äôexposition des principes du calcul diff√©rentiel (Essay on a system of exposition of the principles of differential calculus) in 1814, where he first introduced the mathematical terms for commutative and distributive. Life Servois was born on 18 July 1767 in Mont-de-Laval, France to Jacques-Ignace Servois, a local merchant, and Jeanne-Marie Jolliet. Not much is known about his early life except that he had at least one sibling, a sister with which he would eventually move in with after his retirement. He attended several religious schools in both Mont-de- Laval and Besan√ßon with the intention of becoming a priest. He was ordained at Besan√ßon near the beginning of the French Revolution. His life as a priest was short lived though. As tensions in France, prior to the French Revolution, began to escalate, he left the priesthood to join the French Army in 1793. He officially entered √âcole d'Artillerie (Artillery School) at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne on 5 March 1794, and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the First Foot Artillery Regiment by 13 November of that same year. During his time in the Army, Servois was actively involved in many battles, including the crossing of the Rhine, the Battle of Neuwied, and the Battle of Paris. It was during his leisure time in the army that he began to seriously devote himself to the study of Mathematics. He suffered from poor health during his years as an officer and this led to him requesting a non-active military position as a professor of mathematics. He gained the attention of Adrien-Marie Legendre with some of his work and through Legendre's recommendation, he was assigned to his first academic position, as a professor at the √âcole d'Artillerie in Besan√ßon in July 1801. He would go on to teach at a number of different artillery schools through France, including ones in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne (March 1802 - December 1802), Metz (December 1802 - February 1808, 1815‚Äì1816), and La F√®re (February 1808 ‚Äì 1814, 1814-1815). Work in mathematics Like many of his colleagues who taught at the military schools in France, Servois closely followed the developments in mathematics and sought to make original contributions to the subject. Through his experience in the military, his first publication, Solutions peu connues de diff√©rents probl√®mes de g√©om√©trie pratique (Little-known Solutions to Various Problems in Practical Geometry), where he drew on notions of modern geometry and applied them to practical problems, was well received and prominent French mathematician, Jean-Victor Poncelet, considered it to be > \\"a truly original work, notable for presenting the first applications of > theory of transversals to the geometry of the ruler or surveyor's staff, > thus revealing the fruitfulness and utility of this theory\\" Servois presented several memoirs to the Acad√©mie des Sciences at this time including one on the principles of differential calculus and the development of functions in series. He would further publish papers to the Annales de math√©matiques pures et appliqu√©es, where his friend, Joseph Diaz Gergonne was the editor, where he started to formalize his position on the foundations of calculus. As a disciple of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, he strongly believed that structure of calculus should be based on power series as opposed to limits or infinitesimals. Frontpage of Servois' Essai (1814) In late 1814, he consolidated his ideas on an algebraic formalization of calculus in his most celebrated work, Essai sur un nouveau mode d'exposition des principes du calcul diff√©rential (Essay on a New Method of Exposition of the Principles of Differential Calculus). It was in this paper, when considering abstract functional equations of differential calculus, that he proposed the terms \\"commutative\\" and \\"distributive\\" to describe properties of functions. Servois' 1814 Essai was published well before the modern definitions of functions, identities and inverses, so in his paper, he attempted to formalize these ideas by defining their behavior. In many occasions throughout the document, he discusses operations on functions to not only describe ordinary functions of an independent variable but also to describe operators, such as difference and differential operators. It is here where we first see a formal definition of the distributive property. Servois asserts the following statement: :Let\\\\phi (x+y+...)=\\\\phi (x)+\\\\phi (y)+... > \\"Functions which, like\\\\phi, are such that the function of the (algebraic) > sum of any number of quantities is equal to the sum of the same function of > each of these quantities, are called distributive\\" He goes on to further describe the commutative function as follows: :Letffz=ffz > \\"Functions, which like f and f, are such that they give identical results, > no matter in which order we apply them to the subject, are called > commutative between themselves.\\" Retirement and recognition Servois went on to publish two more articles in the Annales des math√©matiques pures et appliqu√©es, but they were far less influential than his previous papers. He was assigned to his final position as the curator of the Artillery Museum in Paris on 2 May 1817, where he stayed until 1 June 1827. During his time as the curator, Servois was made a Knight of Saint-Louis for distinguished service to the military on 17 August 1822. After his retirement, he returned to his hometown of Mont-de-Laval and resided with his sister and his two nieces until his death on 17 April 1847 at the age of 79.

History Courage was founded in 1976 by a group of ten Berlin women from the Kreuzberg Women's Centre who wished to create an autonomous leftist- feminist newspaper. Although they had little prior journalistic training and no start-up capital, their aim was to encourage other women to advocate for increasing power and political responsibility. The title was inspired by the central character of Bertolt Brecht's 1939 play Mother Courage and Her Children, whom the editors saw as a \\"self-directed woman ... not a starry-eyed idealist but neither is she satisfied with the status quo\\". To raise funds for the printing of the first issue, the editors held a women's festival in Berlin. For the first year of publication, the staff of Courage worked as volunteers but by 1978 the newspaper's sales were high enough that they were able to earn a reasonable wage for their work. Courage published articles about a number of taboo topics, and aimed to represent a diverse variety of opinions from within the feminist movement. Some of the issues addressed by Courage writers included abortion, forced prostitution, women's sexuality, systematic exclusion of women in male-dominated fields, sexual violence, child abuse, women in the military, menstruation, and female genital mutilation. The newspaper's circulation began at 5,000 and had increased to 20,000 by the third issue; it peaked in the late 1970s with a readership of over 70,000. Four months after the first issue of Courage was released, another group of German women created Emma, another feminist newspaper (later published as a magazine, and still in publication as of 2011). Before Emma first publication, the editors of Courage offered to work together to create a single newspaper but were turned away. Tensions were high and disputes common between the editing teams of both newspapers as they competed in the same market and often published opposing interpretations of feminism. Faced with criticism from Emma and the male press, conflicts arose amongst the Courage editors as the newspaper's readership fell. In 1984, they declared bankruptcy and Courage ceased publication.

Bobby Sichran (real name Robert Lichtman, died February 2015) was a Jewish-American alternative hip hop musician. His music was often described as combining hip hop with several other musical genres, such as blues rock and folk music. His fusion of these genres has led many critics to compare him to Beck, and, in some cases, even say that he originated the fusion of folk and hip hop before Beck made it famous. Others have compared him to Bob Dylan, but Sichran criticized such comparisons, saying that he would \\"never want [his] music to exist on comparisons to someone else.\\" Early career A native of Long Island, Sichran dropped out of Columbia University in the early 1990s, looking for a musical career. While doing so, he worked as a furniture mover for some time before getting his big break after knocking on the door of Public Enemy's studio. After Hank Shocklee let him in at his request, Sichran ended up working as an apprentice engineer in their studio, and later played guitar on and produced Das EFX's debut album, Dead Serious. Solo career On May 3, 1994, Sichran released his debut album, From a Sympathetical Hurricane, on Columbia Records. It was preceded by the single \\"Stray Dog.\\" Record executive David Kahne said with regard to the album that \\"Every time I listen to this record, I hear more stuff.\\" Nevertheless, the album was not promoted by Columbia, and ended up being a commercial flop. After the album was released, its title track was also released as a single. Billboard named this single a \\"pick\\" and wrote that it was \\"fueled with the raw rhythm sensibility of a hip- hop jam, and topped with a classic pop/rock melody and freewheeling instrumentation that is positively funky.\\" Sichran went on to release a 7\\" single in 1997 entitled \\"All the Psychotics in My Building\\" on Messenger Records, the B-side of which, \\"There's So Much You Could Love,\\" appeared on \\"Wouldn't it Be Beautiful?\\", a 1999 Messenger compilation album. He released a 12\\" in 1998 entitled \\"Smoke of the Ghetto\\", which was described as being a preview of an upcoming album of the same name; however, this album was never released. He later helped compose the music for the musical Fetish, which was first performed at the theatre of Marymount Manhattan College Theater in 1998. Sichran released his second studio album, Peddler in Babylon, in 2007. According to the Columbia Spectator, Sichran conceived Peddler in Babylon as \\"a concept album about the modern American's crisis of faith\\". Reviews The Calgary Herald gave From A Sympathetical Hurricane a B+ grade, writing that it \\"...won't lift you off your feet, but it will move you farther down the road with its cool, cool breeze at your back.\\" A review of its title track and single in Billboard described the track as \\"fueled with the raw rhythm sensibility of a hip-hop jam\\" and its instrumentation as \\"positively funky\\". Robert Christgau wrote that there were only two good songs, or \\"choice cuts\\", on the album: its title track and \\"Don't Break My Heart, Kid\\". A review of Peddler in Babylon in the Jerusalem Post described it as \\"a heady meditation on spiritual exile that doesn't badger the listener with yiddishkeit, but clearly bears a Jewish soul.\\" In a less favorable review, Charles Ubaghs of Drowned in Sound gave the album a 4 out of 10 rating, writing that \\"It‚Äôs a nice effort, but that‚Äôs the problem with Peddler In Babylon: it‚Äôs nice, and nothing more.\\" Discography =Studio albums= *From a Sympathetical Hurricane (1994) \\\\- Columbia Records *Peddler in Babylon (2007) \\\\- Bombi Beat Media =Singles= *Soundboy Limbo (1994) \\\\- Kings Crown (as Singing Teeth with Vincent Hans) *All the Psychotics in My Building (1996) \\\\- Messenger Records (7\\") *Smoke of the Ghetto (1998) \\\\- (12\\") Soupfly Records References Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Alternative hip hop musicians Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Long Island Category:American hip hop record producers Category:Jewish American musicians Category:American blues singer-songwriters Category:Jewish rappers Category:Jewish hip hop record producers ","title":"Bobby Sichran"},{"id":"42809473","text":"Eurysthea lacordairei is a species of beetles in the family Cerambycidae.

It is the longest standing record on the books, although mostly because that distance is not ran anymore. His record time, set on a cinder track in 1961 as a high school junior at Herbert Hoover High School in Glendale, California was hand timed at 20.2 and equaled the world record for the imperially measured distance.http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2004-05-15/news/export10244_1_kirt- kohlmeier-hoover-high-school-o- brien/3https://newspaperarchive.com/us/california/oakland/oakland- tribune/1966/05-22/page-47 Later in his high school career, he also set the record for the 100-yard dash at 9.4, just .2 off the world record in that event. He was also spectacular on the football field for the school.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HIGH+SCHOOL+FOOTBALL+EXTRA+%3A+RIVALRY+WEEK.-a083628062 He won both races at the CIF California State Meet (coming out of the tunnel at East Los Angeles College) in 1961, repeating in the 100y in 1962.http://www.cifstate.org/images/Track_and_Field/Track_and_Field_Records_through_2013.pdf He was named the CIF Southern Section Athlete of the Year in 1962, the same award he shared with future Olympic Champion Ulis Williams in 1961. He was also Track and Field News High School Athlete of the year in 1962. After graduating, Beaty ran for the University of California, Berkeley, and was part of their NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship mile relay team in 1964 and repeated in 1965.http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208216519 His hand-timed, converted 440 yard time, which equalled Grover Klemmer's former world record is still ranked tied for the #3 time on the school's all time list. He also briefly played football as a running back, gaining all of 4 yards in four attempts. He participated in the 1964 Olympic Trials, in the 400 meters, failing to qualify. Rather than pursuing his career in the sport, he focused on his medical education at the University of California, San Francisco.

On 2 August 2012 he did not travel to Seattle, Washington for club side Caledonia AIA's 3-1 loss to Seattle Sounders. Football career Shabazz was a press officer for CONCACAF from 1997 to 1998. After time coaching in his native country, he served as the manager and technical director of Guyana from 2005 to 2008. He established the side as a regional power with a series of results including 11 consecutive wins in 2006 and they reached their highest FIFA World Ranking of 86 in 2010. Shabazz led the Trinidad and Tobago women's football programme in 2010 before returning to take charge of Guyana in August 2011. He led the Golden Jaguars to the third round of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, marking the furthest the national team had advanced in its history. This run included eliminating Shabazz's home country with a 2-1 win on 11 November 2011, ironically while Shabazz remained employed by the TTFA's coach education development programme. He left Guyana for the second time in November 2012. The Morvant native is also technical director for club side Morvant Caledonia United in his home community, and has acted as head coach in between his international commitments. He was in charge during the 2012 CFU Club Championship victory and 2015 name change from Caledonia AIA. In 2012 Shabazz had a spell as co-coach of his country's men's team with Hudson Charles, who had previously been on the opposing side as part of the military force responding to the 1990 coup attempt. At the time of their joint appointment, Shabazz remained a member of the religious organization Jamaat while Charles continued in his career as a warrant officer with the country's Defence Force. The duo lasted just 4 months at the helm before Leo Beenhakker and former Stephen Hart were brought in as technical director and head coach, respectively. Shabazz's third spell with the Guyanese national team was announced at a press conference on 12 January 2015 ahead of a friendly against Barbados, and he signed a 2-year deal with the Guyanese football association in March. He left the team on the expiry of his contract at the end of 2016 and took up duties as head coordinator of the TTFA's technical programmes. In December 2016 he was appointed alongside Russell Latapy as an assistant to Tom Saintfiet with the men's national team. He took over the women's national team after Carolina Morace left in 2017 and resigned from the role on 8 August 2018. In 2019, Shabazz received a two-year appointment to the IFAB Football Advisory Panel. In May it was reported that he had signed a 2-year deal to become head coach of St. Lucia ahead of the 2019-20 CONCACAF Nations League. With no immediate action scheduled for the team, who failed to qualify for the 2019 Gold Cup, Shabazz had been warming up with the country's elite women's programme. On November 19, 2019 St. Lucia lost 1-0 at home to Montserrat and were relegated to League C.

Founded after the initial federal land sale in Madison County in 1809, the farm has been in the McCrary family throughout. It was recognized as an Alabama Century & Heritage Farm in 1979, and reaffirmed on its 200th anniversary in 2009. Additionally, the house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1979 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Thomas McCrary was born in Laurens County, South Carolina, in 1789, the son of a wealthy farmer. Though he had inherited 150 acres (61 ha) from his father, McCrary sold the land and moved to what is now North Alabama in 1809. He purchased 320 acres (130 ha) near other settlers from Laurens County. His farm grew to over 600 acres (240 ha) by 1833 and to a peak of 2,250 acres (900 ha) in 1850. McCrary built a log cabin shortly after arriving on the property. He married the daughter of one of his neighbors in 1812, but she died in 1821. He remarried in 1823, and the next year built a two-story house with large halls on each floor. It was constructed of bricks handmade by slaves on the farm. McCrary also lent his brickmaking capacity to the construction of a new building for the nearby Enon Baptist Church; the church would move to Huntsville in 1861 and became the First Baptist Church of Huntsville. Around 1840 a two-story, partially sunken ell was added to the rear of the house, containing a dining room downstairs and sitting room upstairs. McCrary's business interests extended beyond the farm. He acted as a cotton factor in Huntsville, and was also involved in tanning yards and groceries. McCrary's other investments included the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, which ran through Huntsville, and a turnpike which allowed easier transportation of goods to the Tennessee River. From 1856‚Äì60 he was a member of the Madison County Commissioners Court. After Thomas McCrary's death in 1865, the farm and house passed to his son, Williams. Between 1868 and 1870, at the behest of Williams' wife, who did not like living in a two-story house, the family home was rebuilt, reusing bricks and interior trimwork from the original 1824 house. Architecture The current house is built with brick from the original 1824 house. The main portion is T-shaped with a cross-gable roof. A porch covers the main entrance, which opens into a small hall. The hall leads to two bedrooms and a parlor, which leads to another bedroom. A semi-enclosed louvered gallery running the length of the main house separates it from the Federal-style 1840 ell. Half a story above is a sitting room, and below is a dining room. See also: In 1971 a \\"keeping room\\", functioning as an apartment and containing a kitchen, den, and bath, was built behind the ell on the site of an earlier kitchen.

He is considered one of the pioneers of liberation theology in Brazil. Biography Assmann was born on 22 July 1933 in Ven√¢ncio Aires, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He did his studies in philosophy at the Central Seminary of Saint Leopold (1951‚Äì1960) and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (1954‚Äì1958). Assmann also studied sociology at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany. Ordained priest, he received his doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Back in Brazil, Assmann settled in Porto Alegre, where he was vicar of the parish of Our Lady of Montserrat and teacher at Viam√£o Seminary. During this period his work has developed around the theology of development through the seminary magazine. With the advent of the military regime in Brazil, Assmann went to Uruguay, then to Bolivia and Chile of Salvador Allende. During this period he developed his reflections on the theology of revolution. In 1973 he published Teologia desde la praxis de la Libertacion, which marked the transition to liberation theology. With the fall of Allende, Assman went to Costa Rica, where along with Franz Hinkelammert, developed his theological reflections on the relationship between theology and economics in the Department of Ecumenical Investigaciones (DEI), founded by both. This center would be one of the leading producers and trainers of liberation theology. Assmann also helped found the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians and the Brazilian Society of Theology and Religious Studies. Back to Brazil in the early 1980s, he was Professor of Philosophy of Education and Communication at the Methodist University of Piracicaba. His work has a strongly interdisciplinary and ecumenical character, transitioning between economics, social sciences, communication, and pedagogy. His reflection was not focused on dogmatic questions, but from the practices of liberation. Assmann was one of the first theologians to use the categories of Social Sciences in theological discourse. He was also critical of the theological presuppositions of liberal capitalism and the market absolutism, or \\"idolatry of the market\\" which, in his view, requires the sacrifice of human lives. His life was dedicated to fighting poverty and social exclusion, calling the church and society to take this fight. Assmann died on 22 February 2008 in Piracicaba, S√£o Paulo. The collection of his works (books and journals) was donated by his family to the Ecumenical Library Program Graduate in Sciences of Religion of the Methodist University of S√£o Paulo (UMESP).

Synopsis In the fictional universe of Taylor Robin's Never Satisfied, young magicians compete to become their city's magical representative to their nation's king. The cast of the webcomic competes in a series of games in order to prove themselves to be the most competent magician, but one competitor, the confident and suave non-binary person Lucy, managed to stay in the running without using any kind of magic at all. Lucy is able to do this with the help of their familiar cat Ivy, as well as through resourcefulness and luck, but may also hold a more complex secret. Never Satisfied features a varied cast of characters, and many of which are LGBT, such as the non-binary apprentice Tetsu and the lesbian Ana. Each character has a unique ethnicity, body type, and color scheme. Each of the teenagers in Never Satisfied has a mentor or teacher somewhere in the city, and are therefore generally referred to as apprentices.

He was the youngest son of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau (often spelt phonetically as Thakambau), King of Fiji, 6th Vunivalu of Bau, King of Bau, and his first wife, Adi Litia Samanunu, daughter of the Roko Tui Bau. In reporting official occasions he was referred to by Australian newspapers as Prince Joseph Celua of Fiji. Birth and family His date of birth is unknown but he was said to be 17 in 1872, and 19 in 1874, suggesting an 1855 birth date although at the time of his death, in 1886, he is said to be 26 which suggests an 1860 birth. Celua had four older siblings and three younger half-siblings from his father's second marriage. His brother one above him, Ratu Timoci Tavanavanua (Timothy) was born in 1847. His father had unified all the tribes of Fiji under his reign in the mid-1800s and subsequently ceded the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. Education in Australia In 1872 Celua came to Australia and was in the care of the Rev Francis Tait until he was enrolled at Newington College under the Presidency of the Rev Joseph Horner Fletcher.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863‚Äì1998 (Syd, 1999) Newington had already become a school for students from Fiji as a son, and two grandsons, of Alexander Salmon and the brother, and two nephews, of Queen Marau had been educated there from 1869 until 1871. At the time the college was still at Newington House and Celua arrived with \\"two native servants and a huge outrigger canoe, which became for the boys a source of great fun\\" on the Parramatta River. \\"Almost as much of a sensation [was] the concertina which he played at request at any hour of the night ‚Äì hymn tunes being his speciality.\\" Josefa Celua was educated at Newington House on the Parramatta River, Silverwater. In the April of his first year in Australia he attended a picnic to farewell Charles St Julian, who had been appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: \\"I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land ‚Äì a land of cannibal cruelty ‚Äì but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji.\\" On 30 April 1872 he was a special guest at the opening of the NSW Parliament. At the Queen's Birthday celebrations in Sydney in May 1872, Celua was part of the Newington College Cadet Corps (50 in number) who fired an honour salute. He and the Rev Francis Tait were later presented to the Governor of NSW. During vacations Celua spent time with the families of his Newington friends. In the winter break of 1873 he was in the Maitland, New South Wales, district when he helped to save a ten-year-old boy from drowning in the Hunter River. Celua left Australia on 20 December 1873 for Fiji on board a ship bound for San Francisco. The Empire newspaper article of the time only mentions one passenger in steerage so it is unsure what became of his second servant. Given the claims of Antonius Tui Tonga (1850‚Äì1905) to be the son of the King of Fiji and to have been educated at Newington it is likely that he was Celua's second servant and on staying in Australia he migrated to Mackay, Queensland. Celua's education in Australia, appears to have had a marked influence on his life. In Cannibals & convicts: notes of personal experiences in the Western Pacific by Julian Thomas, the author describes him as being \\"a striking example of the success of the pious training of the Wesleyans at Newington College, in Sydney.\\" Cession of Fiji to the British Crown Celua was actively involved in the meetings in Fiji and in Sydney for the formal cession of Fiji io the British Crown. He was by his father's side when Sir Hercules Robinson visited Levuka and when as Ex-King he visited Sydney. It was said by the Melbourne newspaper The Argus that \\"Joseph is a good looking lad of 19, who dresses in European clothes, and looks well in them. He spent 18 months in Newington College, Sydney, where he learned to speak and read and write English. This young scion of the house of Cakobau does not appear to have any ambition beyond that of getting through life comfortably ... Joe however, has very agreeable manners and he has one special good quality ‚Äì he is strictly temperate as regards intoxicating liquors. Marriage and later life Celua married Adi Mere Kulabui in 1879 and had a son, Epeli Popi Seniloli. In the book Cruise of the Alert ‚Äì Four Years in Patagonian, Polynesian, and Mascarene Waters (1878‚Äì82), Dr R. W. Coppinger speaks of his visit to Levuka and meeting Celua. The author describes him as \\"a fine-looking man, twenty-three years old ... He surprised us all by speaking exceedingly good English, and possessing an intimate knowledge of the ways and manners of civilized life ... There was no topic of general interest on which he did not possess a fair amount of knowledge. He wore his hair in the fashion of the country, i.e., in a mop frizzled out to an immense size, and in other respects he was got up as a native chief of distinction. He spoke favourably of British rule, although, as we were otherwise informed, he himself had recently acquired a practical experience of the unpleasant consequences attending the commission of an indictable offence, in having to undergo a sentence of three months' hard labour.\\" This book talks about Celua spending three years at University after returning to Sydney with his father in 1874 but no other reference to his tertiary education can be found. Little more is known of his life until he died in Fiji. The Cootamundra Herald carried the following notice on 27 October 1886: \\"Ratu Joe, son of the late King Thakambau, of Fiji, and a student of Newington College, has died of leprosy at Levuka, aged 26 years.\\" The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser reports him as dying on 21 September 1886. He is more likely to have been 31 and was survived by his wife and young son who went on to hold the regnal title of Vunivalu of Bau from 1914 until 1936. Celua did not know his grandson, Ratu Sir George Kadavulevu Cakobau, GCMG, GCVO, OBE, Governor General of Fiji from 1973 to 1983, although George and a great-grandson, Ratu Josefa Celua Cakobau (born 1965), also both attended Newington College, in the 1930s and 1980s respectively, making three generations of the family Old Newingtonians.

Life Born at Totnes, Devon, on 20 May 1776, he was the son of Walter Venning, a merchant, by his wife Mary Ann. He was educated at Totnes grammar school, and at age 14 was placed in the counting-house of Messrs. Jackson & Co., a firm of Russia merchants in London. Venning went to St. Petersburg in 1793, and made as successful career there as a merchant. His interest in the condition of Russian prisons was aroused by his brother Walter Venning; and in 1819, on the foundation of the St. Petersburg Society for the Improvement of Prisons, he became its treasurer. After his brother's death in 1821, he visited prisonsin Sweden, Germany, France, and England. He made reports and suggestions, which he submitted to the Russian government, meeting both Alexander I and Nicholas I. In addition to prison reforms, he worked for improvements in lunatic asylums. In 1830 Venning settled in Norfolk, where he took part in benevolent and evangelical work. He died at Norwich on 11 April 1858. Family Venning was married on 13 September 1805 to the daughter of James Meybohm, a merchant of St. Petersburg. She survived him and left children.

(2013). Organismic Computing. In P. Michelucci (Ed.), Handbook of Human Computation (pp. 475‚Äì501). Springer New York. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8806-4_36 within human groups toward goal-directed behavior. This biomimetic approach to augmenting group efficacy seeks to improve synergy by allowing a group of individuals to function as a single intelligent superorganism. __TOC__  Rationale  For many tasks, increasing the size of a group leads to diminishing returns. That is, each new person contributes less to overall group performance. This suggests that the benefit-cost ratio associated with adding a new person decreases as the group gets larger. The organismic approach to augmenting group efficacy seeks to leverage the quadratic growth in the number of possible relationships among group members, as described by Metcalfe's law. By increasing the number of relationships realized and by sufficiently increasing the utility of those relationship, each new group member would add more value to the group than previous members.  Approach  The organismic model of group efficacy assumes that enabling real-time distributed sensing, reasoning, and acting, using the right augmentation methods, will increase group efficacy via synergistic effects that result from more and improved connections among individuals in a group. Indeed, organismic computing research is focused primarily on the pursuit of augmentation methods that are optimal for different applications of group behavior. Additionally, the application space may dictate a greater emphasis on one of the following members of the \\"synergistic triad\\". = Shared sensing = Shared sensing is the notion that individual or aggregated sensory experiences are shared in real-time across members of a group, toward greater awareness of information relevant to an individual's goals. = Collective reasoning = Collective reasoning includes a broad space of methods that enable the creation and dissemination of information due to distributed cognition. = Coordinated action = Coordinated action involves methods that enable effective, synchronous group behaviors.  Challenges  A key challenge in developing effective organismic computing methods is the problem of information overload. Because humans are limited capacity systems, which include both attentional and processing bottlenecks, the availability or imposition of additional information may create interference that reduces goal-related performance.  Evidence  A 2013 pilot studyGreene, K., & Young, T. (2013). Human Stigmergy in Augmented Environments. In B. Hartman & E. Horvitz (Eds.), HCOMP. AAAI. Retrieved from http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hcomp/hcomp2013.html#GreeneY13 examined performance in a hide-and-seek task within a simulated augmented reality environment. Synergistic effects seemed to increased with group size and level of augmentation. A 2010 collective intelligence study of group problem solving performance revealed strong evidence that \\"Group IQ\\" correlated strongly with the social intelligence of each group member and only weakly with individual IQ, suggesting that interaction dynamics among group members is a better predictor of group problem solving performance than individual problem solving abilities.  Applications  Organismic computing, due to its emphasis on agency, is best suited to interaction in the physical, simulated, or augmented world. Thus, potential applications include crisis relief, first response, and counter-terrorism, as well as problem-solving in artificial environments by recasting abstract problems using real-world metaphors.

She was the first licensed African American female doctor in Denver, Colorado, and practiced gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics from her home for half a century. Biography Justina Laurena Warren was born in 1871 in Knoxville, Illinois several years after the Civil War. She was one of many children and often accompanied her mother, a nurse, when she tended to patients. In 1892 she married Baptist minister John Ford and subsequently moved to Chicago, where she graduated from the Hering Medical College in 1899. Ford worked briefly at an Alabama hospital before relocating to Denver in 1902. There, she was given her medical license, although she was told by her examiner, \\"I feel dishonest taking a fee from you. You've got two strikes against you to begin with. First of all, you're a lady, and second, you're colored\\". Since African Americans were barred at the time from working in hospitals or joining the Colorado Medical Association, Ford set up a private practice in her home in Five Points, where she specialized in gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics. In 1915, she and her husband divorced; she later married Alfred Allen. Ford practiced medicine from her home for 50 years, serving a diverse clientele that included \\"poor whites, African-Americans, and non-English speaking immigrants who were turned away from hospitals\\". Her patients often exchanged goods and services for consultations, rather than paying in cash. \\"She strongly believed that if at all possible, children should be delivered at home\\". She delivered nearly 7,000 babies during her career. She was affectionately called \\"The Lady Doctor\\" by her patients. In 1950, Ford was allowed to join the Colorado and American Medical Associations; she also became a member of the Denver Medical Society and began working in the Denver General Hospital. At that time, she was still the only female African American doctor in Denver. Dr. Ford received the Human Rights Award from Denver's Cosmopolitan Club, in 1951. Ford continued to practice medicine until two weeks before her death in 1952. Posthumous honors In 1988, Ford's home in Five Points, Denver, was converted into the Black American West Museum and Heritage Center. One room is devoted to an exhibition of her life and work. Ford was admitted to the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985 and was named a \\"Medical Pioneer of Colorado\\" by the Colorado Medical Society in 1989. In 1998, a sculpture of Ford holding a baby, made by Jess E. DuBois, was erected outside her house.

It is headquartered in Portland, Oregon. It also has an office location in Seattle. With a revenue of US$1.4 billion in FY2017, Hoffman was the 4th largest privately held company in Oregon and SW Washington by revenue in FY2017. It was the second largest general contractor in the Portland metro area in April 2019. History Lee Hoffman (born May 15, 1850) moved to Portland in the 1870s with his family and worked constructing bridges and other projects until his death, including the Bull Run pipeline.Beckham, pp. 10-11, 34, 44. After his accidental death on July 21, 1895, his wife Julia removed to Boston, Massachusetts, with their children, including Lee Hawley Hoffman.Beckham, pp. 47-48. Lee Hawley entered Harvard College in 1902, but the family returned to Oregon partly in 1903.Beckham, p. 49. Lee Hawley graduated with a degree in architecture from Harvard in 1906, and the family returned to Portland that year, living in their home on NW 23rd avenue.Beckham, p. 50. Portland Business Journal reported Hoffman as the second largest general contractor in the Portland metro area in place as the second largest general contractor in the Portland area in April 2019. The Hoffmans still owned various real estate in Portland due to the success of Lee Hoffman's earlier construction businesses, and they were turned into the family owned Wauna Land Company in 1903.Beckham, p. 49-50. Lee Hawley began working for Morris H. Whitehouse‚Äôs architectural firm in 1908, with the firm later also consisting of Edgar M. Lazarus and J. Andr√© Fouilhoux. Hoffman then married Caroline Couch Burns on June 9, 1910.Beckham, p. 52. Over time, Hoffman began to focus more on projects for Wauna Land Company and less on his architectural work, leaving the firm by 1917.Beckham, pp. 53-54. He started working as a contractor in 1919, and by the end of 1921 had the firm of Hoffman & Rasmussen.Beckham, p. 58. The current company was founded in 1922 by Hoffman. The company started out building primarily apartment buildings and industrial structures in Portland, and had grown to more than 400 employees by 1928.Beckham, pp. 59-60. One of the company's first prominent projects was building the Terminal Sales Building in 1926.Beckham, p. 63. The next year Hoffman completed the Public Services Building, which was the tallest building in the city upon completion.Beckham, p. 67. That year they also built the new Heathman Hotel, the Portland Theater, and an office building all on the same block on Broadway in downtown Portland.Beckham, p. 65. In 1928, Hoffman constructed the 12-story Buyer's Building (now Loyalty Building) in just over six months.Beckham, p. 71. Hoffman expand to Seattle in 1929 with the construction of a 12-story apartment building at 1223 Spring Street. The firm also built Cushman Dam No. 2 that year near Shelton, Washington, for Tacoma Power and Light. Oregon State Library in Salem After the onset of the Great Depression, projects for the firm mostly dried up.Beckham, p. 75. Hoffman went from 32 contracts in 1929 to just ten in 1932. The last big project was a joint venture on expanding the Meier & Frank Building in Portland in 1930, with the next large project not coming until ten years later. In 1932, the firm moved its offices into the Ladd Carriage House, where it remained until 1970.Beckham, p. 94. During the Depression, much of the company's work shifted to government contracts, such as post offices in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Those included large ones in Salem, Longview, and Marshfield (now Coos Bay). Other public works included the Jackson County Courthouse, Tillamook County Courthouse, the Oregon State Library, the Quartz Creek Bridge on U.S. 26, Powerhouse No. 1 on the Bonneville Dam, and several viaducts in Oregon.Beckham, pp. 76-82. Hoffman also built the Portland Art Museum in 1931 and its 1938 expansion, as well as a new library at Willamette University in Salem (now Smullin Hall).Beckham, p. 80. With World War II raging elsewhere, the firm was contracted to build several buildings at Fort Lewis and a new hospital at the Vancouver Barracks in 1940, and barracks for the Navy in Bremerton in 1941, all in Washington.Beckham, p. 84. They also built the hospital at the Cushman Indian School in Tacoma, Washington, in 1941. Following the entry of the United States into the war, Hoffman continued work on military projects including more buildings for the Navy in Bremerton and construction on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and surrounding area, both as joint projects with other firms.Beckham, pp. 86-87. In all, Hoffman did $49 million in work for the federal government during World War II, including work at Camp Abbot, Camp Adair, Umatilla Army Depot, and a Navy hospital in Astoria, all in Oregon.Beckham, pp. 88-89. Other wartime construction included an aluminum rolling mill near Spokane, McCaw General Hospital in Walla Walla, and lots of housing near industrial centers in Washington. =Post World War II= After the war, the firm began a long-term relationship with Crown Zellerbach Corporation in which Hoffman remodeled Crown's pulp and paper mills in West Linn and Camas.Beckham, pp. 91-94. Hoffman also received several projects from the First National Bank of Oregon in 1946 to remodel and expand several branches in Portland and build a new one in Salem. Also during the 1940s, the firm built a store and warehouse for Sears in Eugene, along with expanding the Portland store. The next significant project came with constructing the new Oregonian Building in 1947 in downtown Portland.Beckham, p. 95. The next year the company started construction on a new plant for Nabisco in Portland,Beckham, p. 96. and in 1950 finished an aluminum plant for Alcoa in Vancouver, Washington.Beckham, p. 98. During the 1950s Hoffman completed many projects for lumber industry companies such as Weyerhaeuser, Boise Cascade, Crown Zellerbach, and Georgia-Pacific, among others, plus more work at Hanford.Beckham, pp. 101-102. In 1955, Burns Hoffman became president of the firm, with the company now called Hoffman Construction Company and owned by brothers W. Burns and Eric as father Lee Hoffman moved away from day- to-day work.Beckham, pp. 105-106.Beckham, pp. 10-11. Eric Hoffman (1923‚Äì2016) became president of the company in 1956 and became chairman in 1974. Lee Hawley Hoffman died on August 8, 1959.Beckham, p. 110. Standard Insurance Center in Portland, Oregon The firm also built Portland's Wilson High School, finishing the project in 1956,Beckham, p. 104. and expanded the Public Services Building that same year.Beckham, p. 105. Hoffman's next big project was building the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, along with a Sheraton Hotel in the Lloyd District, both in 1959.Beckham, p. 107. In the 1960s, the company continued with industrial construction from British Columbia to Northern California.Beckham, p. 113. Burns Hoffman resigned as president and left in 1965, with brother Eric buying out his brother and becoming president as well the sole owner. Cecil Drinkward came to Hoffman in 1967 as a vice president, and his son Wayne joined in 1985. Cecil Drinkward became president in 1974. In the late 1960s, the company shifted emphasis from paper and forestry industry where they started to commercial construction. As the 1970s began, the company finished construction on the Georgia-Pacific Building (now Standard Insurance Center), the new headquarters for Georgia-Pacific.Beckham, p. 115. In 1970, it finished the building, and moved its own headquarters to one of the 30 floors.Beckham, p. 120. That year it also won the contract to build the First National Bank Tower (now Wells Fargo Center) in Portland, which was completed in 1971.Beckham, pp. 120-122. Additional projects in the 1970s included the new campus of St. Vincent Hospital west of Portland, St. Peter Hospital near Olympia, part of the campus of The Evergreen State College, the Health Sciences Building on the Sylvania campus of Portland Community College, and Salem's new civic center.Beckham, pp. 122-124. The company also completed the new federal building in Seattle in 1974, the now Edith Green ‚Äì Wendell Wyatt Federal Building federal building in Portland in 1975, and the Federal Office Building Complex in Anchorage in 1977, all for the General Services Administration (GSA).Beckham, pp. 125-127. Additional federal work and oil- related work in Alaska caused Hoffman to open a permanent office in Anchorage in 1975.Beckham, p. 127. Hoffman also built power plants in the 1970s, such as most of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon, parts of the Washington Public Power Supply System‚Äôs nuclear plants at Hanford, and part of the Boardman Coal Plant in Eastern Oregon.Beckham, p. 129. Also in Eastern Oregon, they built the largest cement plant in the Pacific Northwest at Durkee starting in 1978.Beckham, p. 130. One Union Square in Seattle, Washington At the end of the decade, Hoffman finished the Sixteen Hundred Bell Plaza tower in 1977 and then finished One Union Square and the Westin Building both in 1981, all in Seattle.Beckham, pp. 133-136. Meanwhile, in Portland the company finished One Main Place in 1980, the Portland Building in 1982, the PacWest Center in 1985, the Justice Center in 1982, the Performing Arts Center in 1987, and the One Financial Center (now Bank of America Center) in 1987.Beckham, pp. 136-141. Other notable projects in the 1980s included the Farm Credit Banks Building in Spokane, plus the ARCO Tower and SOHIO Alaska Petroleum Company Headquarters in Anchorage, as well as water treatment plants in California and Alaska.Beckham, pp. 138-141. In 1983, the company moved its headquarters to what is now Unitus Plaza at 1300 SW Sixth in Portland. During the 1990s Hoffman shifted much work to construction for hi-tech companies such as Intel. This included work at Intel's Aloha Campus, New Mexico fabs, Chandler, Arizona fabs, and at its Hillsboro campuses.Beckham, pp. 146-150. Other projects included the Casey Eye Institute at OHSU in Portland in 1991, the Snake River Correctional Facility, the new Doernbecher Children's Hospital, as well at projects at Willamette University, Reed College, Oregon State University, Lewis & Clark College, Linfield College, and the University of Portland.Beckham, pp. 153-154. It also built the Oregon State Office Building in 1992 and Metro's headquarters in 1994, both in Portland's Lloyd District, and Portland's new federal courthouse.Beckham, pp. 158-161. Outside of the Northwest, the firm had projects in Washington, DC, Hawaii, and New York.Beckham, p. 161. By 1994 the firm had grown to $613 million in contracts.Beckham, p. 166. The younger Drinkward took over as Hoffman president in 1992. =Twenty-first century= After Hoffman completed an expansion at the Snake River Correctional Institute in Eastern Oregon, the state audited the work on the project in 1999. Auditors alleged some overpayments, while the company and the Oregon Department of Corrections disputed those allegations. Hoffman moved into the Fox Tower in downtown Portland in 2000 after constructing the building, and added a permanent lobby exhibit showcasing the company's history. In 2013, the firm was listed as one of Oregon's most admired companies. The Intel D1X project built by Hoffman was named as the largest construction project in Oregon history in 2017. Intel hired Hoffman for this project in 2010. The newspaper reports \\"several billion dollars\\" but the exact amount is a \\"closely guarded secret\\". In 2015, Hoffman filed a $50.8 million lien on the D1X, and the lien stayed in place two years later in June 2017. In December 2017, The Oregonian followed up to report that Hoffman had withdrawn the \\"mysterious $50 lien\\". According to a statement provided by Intel, \\"\\"We are pleased that the dispute has been amicably resolved. The terms and conditions of the resolution are confidential,\\"  Health and Safety  Portland Tribune's Joseph Gallivan named Hoffman's 1715 S.W. Salmon St and Lincoln High School sites as those still carrying on business as usual during the COVID-19 pandemic. A worker interviewed by Willamette Week on the Hayward Field renovation project site reports while Hoffman has issued strict social distancing instructions, it is realistically not being followed in the field. The same newspaper article also discussed a complaint filed against Hoffman with the Oregon OSHA on March 30, 2020 concerning the project at Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact which reads \\"Multiple employees are working in lifts next to each other, and lunch shacks are packed full of employees sitting next to each other\\". Daily Journal of Commerce also identified Hoffman's 5 MLK, a mixed-use 17 story project near the east end of Burnside Bridge as a site where an OSHA complaint has been registered over social distancing and lack of hand-washing stations.

He is serving as the editor-in-chief of Zee News and hosts the prime-time show Daily News And Analysis (DNA) on Zee News. Career Chaudhary has been working in the television news industry since the 1990s. Belonging to the first generation of television journalists, he was in live television reporting and then 24 hours news television. Chaudhary was told to have been in the squad which has covered the Vajpayee‚ÄìMusharraf Indo-Pak meeting at Islamabad, after the Lok Sabha attack in 2001. In 2003, he left Zee News. He was instrumental in the launch of Sahara Samay, the Hindi news channel of the Sahara group. He also joined India TV for a brief time. In 2012 he rejoined Zee News, where he hosts the news show Daily News & Analysis (DNA). Controversies and criticism  = Fake sting against teacher = In 2007 Live India ran a sting operation on a Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya teacher, Uma Khurana, and called her a pimp for forcing students into prostitution. As a result she was beaten up by a mob and sent into judicial custody thereafter. Sudhir Chaudhary was the CEO of Live India at the time, he said \\"The entire sting is not fake but yes there are weak links\\". During the sting, a journalist Rashmi Singh, posed as a schoolgirl. The court let Uma Khurana go and subsequently Uma Khuara withdrew her complaint and settled the matter directly with the media house, \\"Since the matter has been settled/compromised between me and the channel and Chaudhary, I do not want to pursue this case against other accused TV reporter also. I am withdrawing this complaint against all accused.\\" =Blackmailing charges and arrest= In November 2012, Chaudhary was arrested, alongside his colleague, Sameer Ahluwalia on charges of extortion. This followed a complaint that had been filed by Congress MP and businessman, Naveen Jindal. Jindal had alleged that the two journalists had tried to extort Rs. 100 Crore worth of advertisements from his company in exchange for dropping stories that linked the Jindal Group with the Coalgate scam. The two were sent to 14-day judicial custody in Tihar jail and were ultimately released on bail. The Broadcast Editors Association suspended Chaudhary as its Treasurer in the wake of these charges. Having scrutinised video footage from the incident, it determined that Chaudhary had acted in a manner prejudicial to the interests and objectives of the Association. In July 2016, the Supreme Court ordered Chaudhary and Ahluwalia to provide voice samples to the investigating agencies to further the investigation. In July 2018, the Jindal Group wrote to the investigating agencies requesting them to withdraw the allegations against the journalists and file a closure report in the case. =Allegations against Mahua Moitra= Chaudhary accused Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra of plagiarising speech of Truman Longman pointing out early signs of fascism in India while both Longman and Moitra had denied of plagiarising the speech. Mahua Moitra filed criminal defamation case against Sudhir Chaudhary after which Chaudhary on his daily prime time show accepted that only a part of Mahua Moitra's speech was broadcast and showed his regrets. Zee Media also filed a defamation case against her for calling it 'chor' and 'paid' news. = Accusations if Islamophobia = On April 10, on Zee News, Chaudhary openly accused Muslims of impeding India‚Äôs coronavirus war. Chaudhary said on his show DNA that the ‚ÄúTablighi Jamaat betrayed the nation.‚Äù In May 2020, Kerala Police filed a first informationr report against Chaudhary for his March 11 broadcast of DNA, in which Chaudhary discusses the \\"types of jihads\\", which were criticized as Islamophobic.

Actress Mannat Singh defended the scene by stating she was in actuality drinking apple juice. In praising the film, Jasmine Singh of Tribune India wrote that a film does not require, \\"a battery of high-riding actors and comedians, endless nonsensical and repetitive gags or garishly dressed up villains to put together a good or let's say a watchable film,\\" and offered that Arsho iacts as an example of how a good script can pave the way for a good film, further noting that by successfully writing, producing, acting, and singing in the film, director \\"Dakssh breaks every notion that a single person cannot multi-task in a film; let's be more precise, in a Punjabi film.\\" The director did well against other similar romances by \\"not exaggerating a single scene,\\" and this acknowledgement also stands in praise of the film's editor. Further was made toward the film's backdrop and locations and pacing.

Ritchie was born in Perth, the son of John Ritchie. He was a member of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve at the end of the First World War before graduating via the junior football ranks to become a mainstay for Hibs throughout the 1920s, and a full Scottish international. He played in the Scottish Cup finals of both 1923 and 1924, though finished on the losing side in both. In August 1928, English First Division side Everton brought Ritchie down to England team up again alongside his former Easter Road and current international teammate and right-wing partner Jimmy Dunn. Hopes were high that, together again, Dunn and Ritchie would rekindle the dazzling form they had displayed together at Hibs and supply further ammunition for legendary Toffees striker William Ralph 'Dixie' Dean, who had just scored his record breaking 60 goals as Everton became League Champions for the third time in 1927/28. Both players struggled initially at Goodison Park and, though Dunn would find his feet and go on to win League Championship and FA Cup medals with Everton, Ritchie would return to Scotland, signing for Dundee in February 1930, barely 18 months after his arrival on Merseyside. Following the end of his football career, Ritchie worked in the dairy industry, at first back home in Perthshire, then in Nottingham, where he died at Nottingham General Hospital on 3 July 1941, following an operation. He was 41 years of age. He was buried at Carlton Cemetery, Nottingham, on 7 July 1941.

History  Established by David Bellamy and Dooley Crighton-Bellamy in northern Tasmania in 2000, Bellamy's was an early entrant into the organic food market, firstly processing and marketing all of Tasmania's organically certified beef, lamb and pork and then producing Australia's first organically certified baby food in 2004, and the first main-stream, supermarket sold, organic baby formula in the world, when it was launched in the Australian market in 2005. To date Bellamy's is the only Australian-made organic infant formula on the Australian market. The company was founded by David and Dooley, who were supported by a small group of \\"friends and family\\" investors, and was acquired by a larger consortium of investors using the company, Tasmanian Pure Foods Ltd in 2007. In June 2014 Tasmanian Pure Foods was renamed Bellamy's Australia. Following a highly successful July 2014 IPO, Bellamy's Australia Limited (BAL) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) (Newcastle) on 5 August 2014. Heavy trading and a more than 30% rise in initial share price saw the launch of the company deemed an \\"outstanding success\\" by financial industry commentators. Bellamy's Australia CEO and Managing Director Laura McBain was named as the 2013 Telstra Tasmanian Business Woman of the Year, and went on to be named Telstra Business Woman of the Year 2013 (Private and Corporate). In December 2016 Bellamy's Australia suspended trading of shares following a tumultuous fortnight for the organic group, which had half a billion dollars wiped off its value on Friday, 2 December. In April 2017, Bellamy's confirmed acting CEO Andrew Cohen as its permanent chief executive. In June 2016, Cohen, formerly of Bain & Company, was appointed to the role of Chief Operations & Strategic Officer, before being appointed acting CEO in January 2017. The appointment of financial advisor and Acting CFO Nigel Underwood was also finalised in April 2017. Underwood, formerly CFO of transport operator Keolis Downer, was appointed to the role of Acting CFO on in January 2017 and subsequently made permanent in that role in April 2017. In May 2017, Bellamy's Australia appointed John Ho of Hong Kong-based investment firm Janchor Partners as chairman On 16 September 2019 Bellamy's announced that it had entered into a $1.5 billion takeover scheme with China Mengniu Dairy Company and that its board is urging shareholders to approve the deal. On 15 November, the $1.5 billion takeover was approved by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who explained the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) had undertaken extensive consultation about the takeover, and unanimously recommended the deal was \\"not contrary to the national interest\\". But the sale was approved with conditions, including that the majority of Bellamy's directors are Australian citizens, the company must keep its headquarters in Australia for at least a decade, and it continues to invest $12 million in the local processing facilities in Victoria.  Range of products  The company's product range includes infant formula, follow-on formula, toddler milk, baby rice, baby porridge, apple and cinnamon breakfast, teething rusks, brown rice pasta, baby macaroni and spelt pasta, grain and fruit snacks, ready to serve baby meals, and vegetable macaroni. Products are developed for three specific age groups, targeting newborns (0‚Äì6 months), infants (6‚Äì12 months) and toddlers (1‚Äì3 years). In 2014 this range was expanded to include organic milk drinks for children in the 3+ years age group. Bellamy's Ready2Go UHT product is a supplementary food for children created to complement the dietary needs of toddlers and children who may require additional energy and nutrients.  Certification  In Australia, the company's products are certified organic by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia (NASAA), which is an independent certifying body authorised by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and which also holds accreditation under the US National Organic Program (USNOP) and the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS). The principal competitive advantage and differentiator of the Bellamy's brand within its markets is their Australian-made and certified organic product guarantee. The company backs the authenticity of this statement by maintaining a rigorous focus on their supply chain and source of raw materials, as well as by maintaining independent Australian certification for each product. This guarantee is increasingly important with respect to the Chinese market, where the gradual erosion of the credibility of locally produced and certified \\"organic\\" products link has seen local buyers increasingly preferring \\"premium\\" and \\"super-premium\\" imported organic products. Bellamy's has held individual organic certification for China since 2008, however in May 2014, Beijing required companies to go through a new registration process to import infant formula into China, temporarily halting imports. Bellamy's has since secured Chinese certification for its organic milk formula product, along with accreditation to register a company in China. The company's formula and cereal products are certified Halal by the Islamic Coordinating Council of Victoria (ICCV). ICCV is the major Islamic organisation responsible for the certification, monitoring, and supervision of Halal food exports from Australia.  Domestic market  Bellamy's produces Australia's only certified organic infant formula product and is positioned as a \\"premium\\" brand within that domestic market. In 2013, the baby food and formula category in Australia experienced 9% current value growth largely due to baby formula which experienced a 12% value increase. Bellamy's had approximately 3% share of the overall baby category in 2014, with approximately 10% of the baby formula market share and 12% of the baby cereals and snacks market share. As at 2014, Bellamy's has an estimated 95 per cent share of the organic segment of that market. Bellamy's has established a large distribution footprint in Australia, selling directly to major and independent supermarkets and pharmacy networks. In addition, Bellamy's has established a successful online sales capacity. Bellamy's product range is sold in more than 3,000 outlets in Australia, including Coles and Woolworths supermarkets, Chemist Warehouse, Toys R Us and Big W; as well as independent stores, and through an online retail portal. Export market and growth It is estimated that 15% of the company's revenue for the 2014 financial year came from offshore. The company is a major exporter of organic infant formula to the (estimated 2014) $1 billion per annum Chinese organic infant formula market and is positioned as a \\"super premium\\" brand within that market. The company also exports certified organic food to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and New Zealand; with plans to expand into the US and the UK in 2016. The increasing demand for organic baby food and infant formula in the Chinese market has been \\"spurred by a series of food scares, the worst being the death of six children who had consumed baby formula laced with melamine\\". Bellamy's began exporting organic baby formula to China in 2008, prior to the 2008 Chinese milk scandal; with that market currently comprising 50 per cent of Bellamy's total business. The company has reported a growth rate of 70% per annum over the period 2008 to 2013, and revenue growth of 900% over those five years. Latest company reporting has the business forecasting increased sales to China of 264% in FY2015. Increased focus on the development of the greater Asian market has seen the company establish subsidiary businesses in Shanghai and Singapore to handle marketing and distribution of Bellamy's products in China and South East Asia. Sales of organic infant formula are forecast to increase by 151% in the 2015 financial year, with organic food sales forecast to rise by 178% for the same period. Bellamy's has also flagged plans to expand into the currently $650 million US and $225 million UK organic baby food markets in 2016. In June 2017, Bellamy's acquired the Camperdown Powder canning facility in Braeside, Victoria. The reinstatement of Camperdown Powder's CNCA licensing by the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China, following a short-term suspension in July 2017, saw the company's shares price increase by 37 cents, or 4.7 per cent, to reach a 2017 high of $8.25 on 9 August 2017. Bellamy's 2017 Annual Report upgraded its financial outlook for 2018 to forecast revenue growth of between 15% and 20%, with EBITDA margin growth of 17% to 20% (excluding its newly acquired Camperdown Powder plant). At Bellamy's annual general meeting on 26 October 2017, chief executive Andrew Cohen advised shareholders that the company's turnaround strategy was on track and that sales had stabilised and were gaining momentum.  Public Listing  In July 2014, Bellamy's parent company - Bellamy's Australia (formerly Tasmanian Pure Foods) - sold 25 million new shares and 10.9 million existing shares to raise nearly $36 million, in what was described by the Australian Financial Review as \\"one of the best-performing initial public offers of the year\\". Listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 5 August 2014, Bellamy's Australia Limited (BAL) shares were \\"quickly embraced by investors\\", surging in value as much as 34% in the first day of trading. Described by stock analysts as an \\"outstanding success\\", prices rose to a high of $1.34, before closing 30.1% above the $1 offer price at $1.31, giving the company a market capitalisation of $124 million. The issue price has valued the company at 19-times forward earnings for Financial Year 2015, with an indicative dividend of 1.6%. Share prices remained strong in the following week's trading with a mid-week high of $1.47 settling to $1.39 at closing on Friday 15 August.  Awards and recognition  The company's expansion into the Chinese market and associated rapid growth have garnered significant attention within both media and academic circles, both in Australia and internationally. Former high-profile CEO and Managing Director Laura McBain is widely credited as recognising the potential for Bellamy's in the Chinese organic import bonanza, making the decision that turned the company into a major Chinese food brand.

The microbrand specializes in creating automatic watches, using Asian movements from Tianjin Seagull, Miyota, and Seiko. Its name is a phonetic take on the Chinese Mandarin phrase 'luen huey', meaning reincarnation or rebirth. History The company was founded in 2012 by Chris Vail, producing its first run of watches in late 2013. The initial Kickstarter campaign for the companies first watch, the Riccardo, had reached only $10,781 of its $40,000 goal when it ended on June 16, 2013. However, a second campaign for the same watch exceeded the same goal after raising $42,699 between June 19 and August 18, 2013. The company continued to fund many of its new projects via kickstarter, with its last project ending unsuccessfully in December 2014. Watch models Lew & Huey produces automatic watches with Chinese and Japanese movements at price points varying between $325 and $750 USD. Currently, Lew & Huey has several models: * Riccardo: The first watch by Lew & Huey, it is an automatic chronograph that features a sunburst pattern with applied indices. The Riccardo also has anti-reflective coating and sapphire crystal displays on both sides of the watch, and provides a ST1940 chronograph movement by Tianjin Seagull. The ST1940 is the modern equivalent of the Venus 175 movement (a celebrated Chinese chronograph caliber) and features a 33 jewel movement that beats 21,600 times per hour. * Acionna: Named after the Gallo-Roman religion water goddess, the Acionna is built around a hacking and hand-winding 24 jewel Miyota automatic movement that is capable of providing a 42-hour power reserve when fully wound. * Cerberus: Designed as a reference to the Cerberus, the mythical three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell, the Cerberus is also created to a versatile 'everyday' wear, with styling cues taken from classical designs. It is built around a hacking and hand-winding 24 jewel Miyota automatic movement that is capable of providing a 42-hour power reserve when fully wound. * Orthos: The first purpose-built diving watch of Lew & Huey, it features combination of modern and vintage styling cues. The movement used in this watch is a hacking and hand-winding 24 jewel, 21,600 BPH Seiko automatic movement that is capable of providing a 41-hour power reserve when fully wound. In early February 2015, a lengthy discussion developed on WatchUSeek over the Orthos when a WUS members wrote that, \\"After setting the time, crown doesn't click back into the date/winding mode properly when i push it in.\\" There were varied opinions of what constituted a faulty mechanism. In the end, many users wrote of consistent behaviors with identical movements in other brands of watches. * Spectre: Featuring a sunburst patterned dial and brushed/polished surfaces, the Spectre is a pilot watch built with functionality and uncluttered design in mind. The movement used in this watch is a hacking and hand-winding 24 jewel, 21,600 BPH Seiko automatic movement that is capable of providing a 41-hour power reserve when fully wound. Watch movements The movements featured in Lew & Huey watches are either Chinese or Japanese. Currently, Miyota, Seiko and Tianjin Seagull movements are employed. Distribution As of right now, Lew & Huey watches are only available through direct contact with founder Chris Vail or through the official Lew & Huey website.

A hardcover edition of the book was published in English and Spanish on November 4, 2014, by Celebra, a division of the Penguin Group. A portion of the proceeds from True Love goes to the Lopez Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization co-founded by Lopez that is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women and children.  Background and development  While on her first headlining concert tour Dance Again World Tour, Lopez began writing what she described as \\"a diary of the year I went on tour\\". To her surprise, as the tour progressed, she came to the realization that what she was writing was a book. Lopez was nervous about writing about certain topics for the book, but later realized that in doing so, she could have a chance to save others from \\"suffering their own bumps and bruises\\". According to Lopez, she had to do a lot of \\"soul searching and praying\\", as she did not want it to be \\"mistaken for anything other than it was\\", which is \\"sharing something I learned with people I could help.\\" In True Love, Lopez also discusses suffering from low self-esteem issues as a result of her successes. The book was officially announced on May 19, 2014, by Celebra, a division of the Penguin Group. Of the novel, Lopez said: ‚ÄúWriting 'True Love' has been a deeply cathartic, personal, and vulnerable experience. If it were not for the love and courage given to me by my children, this story wouldn‚Äôt have been possible. While I struggled with the decision of whether or not to release this book, I recognized that if it could touch even just one person then it would honestly become one of the most fulfilling endeavors of my life.\\" Lopez initially did not intend to include content about her recent divorce from Marc Anthony in True Love, but said \\"the book evolved into something different than what I had intended it to be because of what I went through\\". Reception True Love reached number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list, and number five on the Hardcover non-fiction chart. In a review, Elise De Los Santos of RedEye remarked, \\"Like a broken record, she repeats her ‚Äúlove yourself‚Äù mantra again and again throughout the book, which devolves at certain points into a one-sided life-coaching session.\\" Santos, however, also noted that \\"Her strongest suit is showing the human side of the celebrity tabloid fodder we all eat up.\\"  References  External links *AALBC.com True Love - Book Review Category:Works by Jennifer Lopez Category:American autobiographies Category:Books about actors Category:Books about singers Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Literature by Hispanic and Latino American women ","title":"True Love (book)"},{"id":"42810300","text":"Tomer Yosef (middle) performing with Balkan Beat Box Tomer Yosef (in Hebrew ◊™◊ï◊û◊® ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£; born in Kfar Saba, Israel on 8 September 1975) is an Israeli singer and lead vocalist for the Israeli-American electronica-world fusion band Balkan Beat Box.

She currently holds records as the youngest qualifier for the U.S. Women's Amateur and the U.S. Women's Open. She is the second-youngest qualifier for the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links, and the youngest ever to advance to match play in that event. Li was an age group winner at the inaugural Masters Drive, Chip, and Putt Championship in Augusta, Georgia. As of 2014, she is a student of Jim McLean. Background Born in Stanford, California, Li now lives in Redwood Shores, California. Her father, Warren Li, is a San Francisco Bay Area computer consultant and stockbroker. Her mother, Amy Zeng, is a former Hewlett-Packard employee. Warren and Amy were raised in China and moved to the United States from Australia in 1998. Warren has a Ph.D. in computer science, while Amy has a master's degree in the field. Lucy was born in 2002. She lived with her aunt Tao Zeng four months per year to train in Florida near Trump National Doral Miami and McLean's Golf School. Li is homeschooled. She performs some of her schoolwork through independent study in the months she is in Florida. Li took diving lessons at Stanford University and was platform diving from at age 4. She was also active in gymnastics and music. Some sources claim that she began practicing at Mariners Point Golf Center at about age 4 or 5, with informal coaching from her mother and aunt. Other sources claim that she began playing golf at age 7 while watching her older brother Luke, a Princeton University student, who was hitting balls at a driving range. Li likes to tell the latter story, but Mariners Point head pro, Joby Ross, confirmed that at about 3 or 4 years old Li was very boisterous about her interest in the sport to the point of throwing tantrums when being asked to leave. At age 7 her parents called Jim McLean, who also coaches or has coached Lexi Thompson, Cristie Kerr, Keegan Bradley and Erik Compton, and arranged a visit to meet him at Doral. Afterwards, the family made summer living arrangements with her aunt. Then, McLean began working with her. Li's practice course is Cinnabar Hills in San Jose. Amateur career Li holds record for youngest match-play qualifier in U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links history (10 years, 8 months, 16 days), surpassing Michelle Wie's 2000 record by a mere 7 days. Li was the second-youngest qualifier in May 2013 for the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links before becoming the youngest to advance to match play that June. The lone person younger than Li was Allisen Corpuz, who qualified in 2008. She is also the youngest U.S. Women's Amateur qualifier, surpassing Latanna Stone's 2012 record age of 10 years, 11 months and 2 days by beginning the first day of the tournament at age 10 years, 10 months and 4 days old on August 5, 2013. In 2014, at the first ever Drive, Chip and Putt Championship on the Sunday preceding the 78th edition Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club, she won the Girls 10‚Äì11 age division. The event was televised on the Golf Channel and was sponsored by the United States Golf Association, Professional Golfers' Association of America and Augusta National to increase youth participation in the sport. Over 10,000 youth from over 110 sites participated in a qualification process that yielded 88 qualifiers from 8 age/gender brackets from each of 11 regions. On May 19, 2014, she became the youngest (age 11) to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open, surpassing Thompson's record (12 years, 4 months, 18 days) from the 2007 Open. Notably, Li not only qualified, but she won her qualifying event by seven strokes at Old Course at Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Thompson missed the cut in 2007 with a 36-hole 168 total. Li was the second-youngest to compete; nine years prior to the introduction of qualification in 1976, Beverly Klass played in the 1967 Open at age 10 years, 7 months, and 21 days. Although Li's qualification was largely heralded, some were befuddled at the state of the sport when a sixth grader could even qualify for one of the most prestigious events of the year. Li, who had reached a 1.5 handicap by April, had a handicap better than threshold 2.4, making her eligible to participate in qualifications. Li was 11 years, 8 months, and 19 days on June 19, the opening round of the 2014 U.S. Women's Open, held at Course No. 2 of Pinehurst Resort & Country Club. Edel Golf designed custom clubs that Golf Digest described as \\"blinged-out\\" for Li to use in the Open. In the first round on Thursday, Li shot a 78 (+8), which had been the highest score that anyone who made the cut in the 2013 Open had tallied. She followed that up with a second 78 on Friday for 156 (+16) and missed the cut by seven strokes. She then walked the course as a fan that Sunday. She scheduled an appearance in the July U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links in DuPont, Washington next. Li shot 74 and 70 to qualify for match play where she lost to Alice Chen in sudden-death of the first round after posting a stroke play equivalent of a 71. She did not schedule any other USGA events in 2014, deciding instead to play local events and be an 11-year-old. In 2015, she did not qualify for the 2015 U.S. Women's Open. In August 2016, Li won the Junior PGA Championship. The following month, she was on the winning team for the 2016 Junior Ryder Cup. She earned low amateur honors at the 2017 ANA Inspiration by being the only amateur to make the cut. She was named to the Junior Solheim Cup team for the United States, who won 14.5‚Äì9.5. In October she won The PING Invitational, and she won her next event, Rolex Tournament of Champions, in November. On May 14 at the Contra Costa Country Club, Pleasant Hill, California, Li qualified for the 2018 U.S. Women's Open, where she was again the youngest player in the field. She was one of seven amateurs to make the cut, and she finished tied for 55th with a 299 (+11). Li was selected to represent the USA in the June 8-10, 2018 Curtis Cup. The United States won by the widest margin in the history of the event (17‚Äì3) and Li won her singles match against India Clyburn 5 and 4. At the 2018 U.S. Women's Amateur, Li was co-medalist and earned the number one seed for the match play portion of the event. She lost in the quarter-finlas to eventual champion Kristen Gillman on the 19 hole. She contributed to the 2018 Junior Ryder Cup victory. At the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, Li teamed with Akshay Bhatia to win the mixed team silver medal. In 2019, the USGA investigated Li's amateur status after she appeared in an Apple Watch advertisement. Rule 6:2 states: \\"even if no payment or compensation is received, an amateur golfer is deemed to receive a personal benefit by promoting, advertising or selling anything, or allowing his name or likeness to be used by a third party for the promotion, advertisement or sale of anything. A person who acts contrary to the rules may forfeit his amateur status and as a result will be ineligible to play in amateur competitions.\\" She was given a warning but maintained her amateur status. Li was named to the 2019 Junior Solheim Cup team. Professional career Li turned professional in late 2019. She will have status on the Symetra Tour in 2020.

The problem of transposing in vitro results is particularly acute in areas such as toxicology where animal experiments are being phased out and are increasingly being replaced by alternative tests. Results obtained from in vitro experiments cannot often be directly applied to predict biological responses of organisms to chemical exposure in vivo. Therefore, it is extremely important to build a consistent and reliable in vitro to in vivo extrapolation method. Two solutions are now commonly accepted: *(1) Increasing the complexity of in vitro systems where multiple cells can interact with each other in order recapitulate cell-cell interactions present in tissues (as in \\"human on chip\\" systems). *(2) Using mathematical modeling to numerically simulate the behavior of a complex system, whereby in vitro data provides the parameter values for developing a model. The two approaches can be applied simultaneously allowing in vitro systems to provide adequate data for the development of mathematical models. To comply with push for the development of alternative testing methods, increasingly sophisticated in vitro experiments are now collecting numerous, complex, and challenging data that can be integrated into mathematical models.  Pharmacology  IVIVE in pharmacology can be used to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD).. Since biological perturbation depends on concentration of the toxicant as well as exposure duration of a candidate drug (parent molecule or metabolites) at that target site, in vivo tissue and organ effects can either be completely different or similar to those observed in vitro. Therefore, extrapolating adverse effects observed in vitro is incorporated into a quantitative model of in vivo PK model. It is generally accepted that physiologically based PK (PBPK) models, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of any given chemical are central to in vitro - in vivo extrapolations. In the case of early effects or those without inter-cellular communications, it is assumed that the same cellular exposure concentration cause the same effects, both experimentally and quantitatively, in vitro and in vivo. In these conditions, it is enough to (1) develop a simple pharmacodynamics model of the dose‚Äìresponse relationship observed in vitro and (2) transpose it without changes to predict in vivo effects. However, cells in cultures do not mimic perfectly cells in a complete organism. To solve that extrapolation problem, more statistical models with mechanistic information are needed, or we can rely on mechanistic systems of biology models of the cell response. Those models are characterized by a hierarchical structure, such as molecular pathways, organ function, whole-cell response, cell-to- cell communications, tissue response and inter-tissue communications.

Background =Inventor= In 1976-77, while Kall was a graduate student, he learned of the physiological finding that cold hands can result from the vascular constriction that indicates stress. He then developed the \\"Bio-Q ring\\" to detect stress through use of 13 liquid crystals to detect changes in the temperature of the hand. The concept was that if a wearer were forewarned of approaching tension, they could mitigate their actions and thus reduce stress. In 1978 and 1979, he took early design samples of the Bio-Q ring to BSA meetings in Albuquerque and San Diego. Encouragement from biofeedback experts Thomas Budzynski, Edward Taub, and others, kept him focused on the concept. Raising money as a freelance medical writer, he founded Futurehealth Inc as a manufacturer of biofeedback instrumentation/materials. By 1984, 185,000 Bio-Q units had been sold, and according to the Futurehealth.org website, by 2014 that quantity has reached over 300,000 units sold in over 50 countries. =Radio= =OpEdNews= Rob Kall relates how in early 2003, he had heard a Colin Powell speech about why the United States \\"had\\" to go to war with Iraq and felt that Powell's reasons were disingenuous.

Wohlgemuth in his publications, was a German/British businessman who lived in England and made significant contributions to psychology, conducting research into visual perception, memory, and imagery. Biography Wolgemuth was born on 1 November 1868, in Berlin, North German Confederation, the son of Eduard Albert Maximilian Wohlgemuth and Louise Berend.Deutschland, Geburten und Taufen 1558-1898, index, FamilySearch:, (accessed 23 Sep 2014), Gustav Adolf Wohlgemuth, 11 Jan 1869; FHL microfilm 70510. According to Wade, Thompson and Morgan (2014), he travelled to London some time before 1891. Although little is known of Wohlgemuth's early life, once in London he became a British citizen in 1897 and by 1903 had established a business importing and exporting sausage casings. Despite running his business, in 1902 Wohlgemuth enrolled for a degree course in psychology at University College London, graduating with a third-class science degree in 1905. He then enrolled for a DSc in the Psychological Laboratory, supervised by William McDougall, completing his thesis in 1909 and being awarded a degree the following year. Wade et al. (2014) reported that Wohlgemuth remained at the Psychological Laboratory after 1909, although he never became a member of its staff. He also ran his business until the end of his life. Wohlgemuth married Clemence Morrelet in 1913 but \\"the union was neither fruitful nor happy\\"(p. 233). Wohlgemuth formed a close friendship with a fellow research student, Nellie Carey, but \\"On 6 June 1918 Adolf was shot in the back by his jealous wife\\".(p. 233) According to Valentine (2008), it proved impossible for the bullet to be removed. After Wohlgemuth had recovered from his wounds, Morrelet was tried in September 1918, was convicted for unlawful wounding, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Carey took Wohlgemuth's name; they had a daughter, Joan, in 1921 and a son, Bryan, in 1929. Wohlgemuth and Carey married in 1936, after the death of Morrelet. Wohlgemuth died on 2 March 1942.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35641/page/3221/data.pdf Contributions to psychology During studies for his DSc, Wohlgemuth was described as \\"a brilliant research student\\" (p. 233). His 1911 paper \\"On the after-effect of seen movement\\", based on his thesis, has been described as \\"the most comprehensive single article on the phenomenon [of the motion aftereffect]\\"(p. 229). Wohlgemuth then worked on memory and imagery, corresponding with Bertrand Russell. In 1923 Wohlgemuth published A critical examination of psycho-analysis and it is claimed that he \\"is perhaps best known for his critical assessment of the scientific basis for psychoanalysis\\" (p. 232).

Artur Franciszek Oppman (born August 14, 1867 in Warsaw, died November 4, 1931, Warsaw) was a Polish poet of the Young Poland period, who wrote under the pen name \\"Or-Ot\\". Biography Oppman was born August 14, 1867 in Warsaw to a burgher family with German roots, which had arrived in Poland in 1708 from Thuringia. The family quickly became attached to Poland and cultivated Polish patriotism; Artur's grandfather took part in the Polish November Uprising and his father in the January Uprising. Artur studied initially at a gymnasium in Warsaw, but due to severe Russification pressure (Warsaw at the time was part of the Russian partition of Poland) he moved to an alternate trade school. It was there that he began writing poetry. His peculiar pen-name materialized in the publication of his second poem, when an abbreviation of his name, \\"Ar-Op\\", was mistakenly rendered as \\"Or-Ot\\" by the type-setter. His first poems were published in magazines such as Kurier Warszawski, Wƒôdrowiec and Kurier Codzienny, which sought to promote new talent. Between 1883 and 1885 he also published in Tygodnik Ilustrowany, K≈Çosy and ≈öwit. Between 1890 and 1892 he studied philology at the Jagiellonian University, in Krak√≥w. He was particularly interested in the literature and the Polish language of the sixteenth century. In 1892 he married W≈Çadys≈Çawa Trynkiewicz and suspended his studies, returning to Warsaw. He frequented the city's Old Town, and studied the borough's people, lifestyle, customs and local legends. On the basis of these experiences in 1893 he published a collection of poems Ze Starego Miasta (\\"From the Old Town\\"), and in 1894 a related volume Pie≈õni (\\"Songs\\"). In 1920 he enlisted in the army of the newly reconstituted Republic of Poland, as a private in the infantry. He was made the editor of the army's magazine, ≈ªo≈Çnierz Polski (\\"Soldier of Poland\\"). Works His poems which celebrated the charms of Warsaw's old towns were especially popular. His poems were also published in several other magazines, and between 1901 and 1905 he became the editor of Wƒôdrowiec. Oppman established extensive contacts in Warsaw's literary world, and often met with Boles≈Çaw Prus, Stefan ≈ªeromski, Felicjan Fale≈Ñski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian, Antoni Lange, Wojciech Kossak, Jan Lecho≈Ñ and others.

This game was a browser-based soccer simulator in which users could create a team and play against other users from all around the globe. Additional benefits were offered to those that purchased the Club Membership. Following a decline in interest from users in the game, it was announced that on May 16, 2016 Power Soccer would come to an end, encouraging users to join their sister game ManagerZone. The announcement was made months before the closure date, which led to many posts in the forums where some users even wanted to donate to keep the game afloat but to no avail, and in the early hours of May 16, 2016, the game closed. Gameplay Power Soccer let users create their own team and play against people from all around the world. Starting with a soccer team, their mission was to level up, improve and fight between the game's best players. Users had the option to customize their players, use any tactic, change their team colours and uniform, plus playing with any playing style. In order to buy digital goods such as tattoos, personal coaches and more, users had to use Tickets or Power Tokens.  Game Modes  = Tournaments = Tournaments were competitions that usually lasted a couple of days. They offered the chance to join a competition that started right away, throwing the teams straight into the action. They offered a great way to earn a reputation as having one of the top teams around. Users could make their way through several level spans, and they could join a new one if they were eliminated. = Quick games = Quick Games were 1 on 1 multiplayer games where users competed for rank points. This game mode was available for all users that were above level 5. Their opponents would be mostly people that were close to their location, and that had a similar level & ranking. = Cups = This game mode allowed users to play cups, which could be played with a different number of players, and the more players it had, the more matches it would bring. The winner was the user that got the highest number of points. Users would always face opponents that were near their position in the cup. There were two kinds of cups: *Basic Cups: Everyone could join if they fit the requirements, and they would compete as an individual. The first place would receive a trophy, while sometimes the second place and even third place may receive a trophy, depending on the number of players of each cup. *Clan cups: Users competed representing their clan, and earned points in order to help it. The cup owner would decide how many players competed for each clan, which means it could be 1vs1, 2vs2 and more. The clan that got the highest number of points would receive a clan trophy, and the user that reached the highest number of points would receive a \\"Most Valuable Player\\" medal (also known as MVP). = Clans = Clans were groups of players cooperating to be the best. They competed in clan cups, which were of different sizes. Both normal members and Club Members could join clans for free, but only Club Members could create them by paying 1000 Tickets. If their clan reached a good ranking position, users would be able to compete on the Clan League, which allowed them to compete against the best clans of the game. = Practice = This was a free-for-all mode, that let users train their skills in an Open Field or against the CPU teams. There were three modes to practice: *Tutorial: Small tutorial that let users learn the basics of the game. *Open Field: This is a mode that let users finetune their technique on an open field, free of opponents. *Training match: This let users play against the CPU controlled teams. Users could choose between playing against the Easy Team, Medium Team and Hard Team.  Club Membership  The Club Membership was the best, the most important and the most relevant thing of the game. Being a Club Member allowed users to access the whole game, including all its game modes. They could do things like setting attitudes, nicknames and names for their players, receive exclusive tactics, play exclusive tournaments, receive an exclusive home stadium, level up faster, create cups, create clans, create their own team badge, access the Team Progress Analyzer, get exclusive uniforms, store & display additional highlights, and more. The Club Membership could be acquired via cash, and only monthly.  Store  The game had a store that let users buy many digital goods that could satisfy them. Regular users got access to style items like hairstyles, facial hair, dribbles, celebrations and being able to change their player's skin colour. In order to get full unlimited access to shoes, coaches and other skill enhancing goods that could boost their team's skills, users had to buy the Skill Package. They could buy it by paying cash, or 10000 Tickets. If they bought it, they could access all the skill boosting items for free. Depending on their package's length, their items would be taken away when their package expires, but they still could renew it whenever they wanted. = Virtual Currency = Tickets were the virtual currency in Power Soccer. Users got them through various achievements such as leveling up, winning cups, advancing in tournaments, inviting friends, and more. Club Members had the best chance of racking up Tickets, but non-members still had a limited opportunity to do so. Power Tokens used to be the official currency of the game, and they represent real money. With Power Tokens you could buy lots of cool stuff in Power Soccer. As of August 13, 2015, it was no longer possible to purchase Power Tokens, but users who owned Power Tokens could still spend them through the player shop, or by adding extra Club Membership or Skill Package time to their accounts.  Community  The game had a big community with people from all around the world, as it was available in 18 languages. Players could communicate using the forums, private chats, public chatrooms and through their guestbooks. = Administrators = The game had a big list of admins that focused in different aspects. The admin roles were the following: *Master Assistant (MA): They were the bosses, and the responsible to design admins and supervise all the other admins. They also monitored the community to make sure everything was fine, and took actions if necessary. *Chat Admin (CA): They were the responsible for moderating the chatrooms. *Forum Admin (FA): They were the responsible for moderating the forums. *Language Assistant (LA): They had to translate the site content (forums, news, etc.) from English to their language. *Reporter Assistant (RA): They released articles and news related to the game, and they published it in their corresponding site (English or Spanish). Additionally, the \\"Crew\\" term was adhered to the people that worked for the game.

The book chronicles the financial downfall of the public sector airline. The book was withdrawn after a defamation suit was filed by former Aviation Minister Praful Patel. The book is now available as an ebook on Amazon Kindle Store. Hard copies are also available on Amazon India since January 2016 after the author self-published the book. Overview In the book, Bhargava argues that the public sector airline Air India reached a bad state, due to government interference and bad decisions. He also writes about the servile attitude of Air India towards minister Patel. He also points out other reasons of its downfall, which include bilateral agreements which were unprofitable, cancellation of flights on profitable routes or giving them to other airlines, and acquisitions of planes at high prices and selling them at very low prices. The book claims that the deals to buy 111 planes from Boeing and Airbus in 2005-2006, along with the merger of Air India with the public sector domestic airline Indian Airlines led to its downfall. The book places the responsibility on Praful Patel and V. Thulasidas, former Air India chairman. The book notes that not much thought was given to how the debt from the acquisitions will be serviced. It also says that Praful Patel was aware of Air India's shrinking marketing and yet was giving bilateral rights to foreign airlines. The book points out the frequent changes in the management of the company. Lawsuit and withdrawal The book was originally released on 11 October 2013. In November 2013, lawyer Satish Maneshinde filed a criminal defamation lawsuit in Mumbai metropolitan court, on behalf of Praful Patel. The publishers Bloomsbury settled in an out of court agreement in January 2014. They withdrew the book and agreed to pulp all remaining books in their stock. They also issued a public apology to Praful Patel. Maneshinde told the newspaper DNA India that no pressure was put on the publishers to withdraw the book, but it was the result of the settlement. Patel also denied pressuring the publishers, but added that he was forced to seek legal recourse as the allegation against him in the book were baseless. Bhargava claimed that the book was based on existing documents. He added that the decision to withdraw was carried out unilaterally by the publishers and he was not consulted. Later, he released the book as an ebook on Amazon Kindle on 12 March 2014 and hard copies of the book were self-published in January 2016. Copies are available on Amazon India. The defamation case filed by Praful Patel was withdrawn in February 2017 from the Metropolitan Court.

From the beginning of establishing the Devergo brand to nowadays, products are characterized by novelties, brave colour and fabric solutions and the strong appearance of graphic fashion elements. Devergo has been present on the jeans market since more than twenty years ago, mainly in Europe. Devergo Hungarian Headquarter. History The Devergo brand was established by Renata Sartori and Paolo Bolzonella‚Äôs MAGICAL POOL s.r.l. at the end of the 80‚Äôs in Noale situated in Northern Italy. During these years ‚Äì together with the newly appeared Energie, Replay and Diesel brands ‚Äî a new youthful approach and a fresh attitude was introduced to the Italian denim market. In Hungary, a small business enterprise Flas Kft. was established by a Hungarian and a Greek young man and it began to distribute the Devergo products in October 1992 in a shop called ‚ÄúRolling Store‚Äù under S√≠p street 9. At the time, ‚ÄúRolling Store‚Äù was the biggest jeans shop in Budapest amongst ten other shops of similar profile. Wholesale distribution started in 1994 by participating in the ‚ÄûBudapest Fashion Days‚Äù exhibition by Hungarian Fashion Institute. Later, taking into consideration the specialties of the Hungarian market, the manufacturing right was purchased for Devergo products which were not originally distributed by the Italian parent company. Following this, the export right was also acquired and distribution to neighbouring countries began. In the first six years parallel sales was carried out in the Italian and Hungarian headquarters. By 1999 the Hungarian enterprise managed to purchase the Devergo brand name and protect it worldwide, both for manufacturing and distribution. Nowadays an international team works in the Budapest headquarters of the company, consisting of Greek, Ukrainian and Russian young people alongside Hungarian colleagues. Design and production The leader of the international designer group, from the beginning and since today, has been the Italian fashion designer Cristiano Berto. Under his leadership several young designers learn to and work on designing and manufacturing jeans based on current trends. More than half of the products are manufactured in the European Union.

The plant was commissioned in 1899 and supplied power to the city until 1958, when it was replaced by a newly constructed state-owned power plant in Norrforsen. Klabb√∂le Kraftverk is now a museum located at Ume River's south bank, below the village of Klabb√∂le, about upstream from Ume√•. History In the 1500s there was a water mill in Klabb√∂leforsen which was used for grinding flour and for powering a saw.Ahnlund, p. 136. A steam-powered plant was located in the centre of Ume√•, but by 1892 it needed to be replaced and the city agreed to use the rapids to build a hydroelectric plant in 1897. The work was subcontracted to the Qvist & Gjers engineering company in Arboga. Qvist & Gjers designed, engineered, and built the plant with two turbine-generator units totaling 400 kW, along with extra space for two more should they be needed in the future. Due to financial constraints and the so-called kungs√•dra (an old law preventing part of the waterways from being blocked), the whole stream was not dammed.Brunnstrom & Spade, p. 26. Instead, a diverter was built which created a watercourse for the power plant. The plant supplied power to Ume√• for the first time on 6 December 1899. After a few weeks, problems arose due to slush, something that became a recurring problem. This was due to the plant's location at the lower part of the stream, between Norrfors and Klabb√∂le, where the water cools off to the point that it becomes supercooled. Initially, the plant utilized only 10 cubic meters per second of the river's average discharge of 430 cubic meters per second.Brunnstr√∂m & Spade, p. 24. To increase capacity, the power plant was expanded in 1904 with a third unit of 200 kW. Axel Rudolf Bergman then built a new plant of brick and concrete next to the old one. This new plant was completed on May 28, 1910, and a smaller expansion was added in 1914. Meanwhile, the Ume√• municipality wanted the state-owned company Vattenfall to start constructing a power plant in Norrforsen, which they were told would happen. However, during and after World War I, there were no financial resources available for this project, so Klabb√∂le was expanded again in 1931. Finally, in 1958, the state-owned Stornorrfors power plant was inaugurated in Norrforsen.Lantz, p. 43. With this new facility in place, the newer expansions of the Klabb√∂le power plant were demolished. The older machinery was retained and has been incorporated into a power plant museum, as part of the Ume√• Energy Centre.Ahnlund, pp. 196‚Äì203.

This is preferred as the starting material over 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane as less fluorine is required. Properties Perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane is chemically inert and thermally stable (to over 400 ¬∞C). It is non-toxic.

Sergeant Alwyn Sawyer, his assailant, was convicted of manslaughter, the most recent case of a British police officer to be convicted of killing someone in custody. Arrest and death On 11 February 1985 Foley, a widower from Pitt Street, Southport, had been playing dominoes and drinking at Southport Railway Club with his long standing friend Frederick Rigby. Describing Foley's state on leaving, Rigby said: \\"He was merry. It was not my view that he was drunk.\\" Outside the club Foley was arrested for being drunk and incapable, arriving at the town's police station shortly after midnight. Police intended to release Foley before 6am on 12 February but because he refused to mop up some urine in his cell it was decided to detain him further. At 7am Sergeant Ivor Richardson took over the duty of custody officer. At approximately 7.40 am he went to release Foley but was allegedly subjected to a sustained attack. It was claimed that Foley hit him in the face and he fell over, banging his head, with Foley continuing to punch and kick him. Sergeant Richardson crawled into the corridor shouting for help. Other officers rushed to the scene and overpowered Foley, cuffed his hands behind his back and returned him to the cell. Richardson was taken to hospital with facial injuries, and his duties were taken by Sergeant Alwyn Sawyer. The 45-year-old Sawyer had served in Southport police since 1962, in which time he had received a commendation for plainclothes work, as well as a Royal Humane Society medal for saving five men from a fire in 1978. Sergeant Sawyer went into the cell where Foley still had his hands cuffed behind his back. Sawyer's repeated stamping or kicking of Foley's abdomen damaged Foley's spleen, caused a complete rupture of the small bowel. and total detachment of his left kidney. Foley also sustained bruising to the head and chest. Later in the morning two detectives saw Foley complaining of stomach pain and asking for a doctor. A police surgeon examined him around midday and sent him to hospital where he died at 7.45 pm from a heart attack as a result of his injuries. Sawyer visited Sergeant Ivor Richardson in hospital, telling his colleague, \\"you are well covered and well out of it.\\" Two days later Richardson spoke to Sawyer on the phone, asking \\"did you give Foley a good wellying?\\" Sawyer replied: \\"You have nothing to worry about.\\" Alwyn Sawyer's trial Cumbria police were brought in to investigate. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Stainton interviewed Sawyer 12 days after Foley died. Asked if he had ever punched, kicked, stood on, stamped on or kneeled on Foley in any way, Sawyer said, 'no, to each part of the question - I didn't go into the cell'. He offered no alternative explanation for how Foley sustained the injuries. Foley's shirt had a footprint on the abdomen. Forensic examination showed the only one at the police station it could match was Alwyn Sawyer's left boot. He was charged with murder. In February 1986, Sawyer stood trial at Southport Law Courts. He pleaded not guilty, but did not take the witness box to give any explanation of what happened to Foley, nor his part in it. The prosecution suggested that assault was retribution for attacking Richardson, who had been celebrating his 25th anniversary as a police officer on the day Foley assaulted him. On 18 February 1986 the jury took just over four hours to reach a verdict of Not Guilty of murder but Guilty of manslaughter. Mr Justice MacPherson sentenced him to seven years saying: \\"This is, of course, a tragic day for you, but this was a gross act.\\" Henry Foley's daughter Collette Major praised the investigating officers from Cumbria police. Citing family members who were police officers, she said: \\"The enquiry was the sort of policing you are brought up to believe in when you are a little child,\\" and said she felt that Sawyer's sentence was reasonable.

Pratek Man Tuladhar (Devanagari: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§§‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ‡§ß‡§∞) (1924-1991) was a Nepalese trader and philatelist. Born in Kathmandu into a family of hereditary merchants, he spent his youth in Lhasa, Tibet where they owned a business house. During his stay in Tibet(1939-1960), alongside his main occupation of conducting trade between India, Nepal and Tibet, he developed an avid interest in collecting photographs, postage stamps and coins. Tuladhar also corresponded with penpals around the world. As a rare letter writer from Tibet, his name became renowned worldwide among philatelists. His letters bearing Tibetan stamps delighted his foreign friends, and today they have become major resources for collectors specializing in Tibetan postal history. Biography Pratek Man was the eldest of the three children of father Triratna Man Tuladhar and mother Punya Maya Kansakar. His grandfather was the celebrated trader and philanthropist Dharma Man Tuladhar. His younger sister Tara Devi Tuladhar was a social worker. Pratek Man went to Lhasa for the first time in 1939 to join his family business house Chhusingsyar, one of the largest traders in Tibet at the time. The firm maintained branches in Gyantse and Phari besides Ladakh and Kolkata in India. Tuladhar returned after nine years and married Jagat Shobha (1933-1981). He went to Lhasa again in 1952 and returned to Kathmandu for the last time in 1960, after spending a total of 17 years in Tibet. Tuladhar was among the last of the traditional Lhasa Newar merchants. The historical trade ended after the caravan route linking India and Tibet through Sikkim was shut down by the Sino-Indian War in 1962. After returning to Nepal, he devoted his time to serving Buddhism. He acted as a translator for Tibetan lamas translating their sermons into the local language besides writing articles on Buddhism for magazines.

The trophy was presented by the Gaelic Society of Glasgow in order to encourage shinty in the South.

However, by the late 1980s, the tournament had fallen into abeyance and the trophy itself went missing. The St Andrew's Sixes was re-established in 1999 and has been played most years since.

Whereby the new SPICe form helps the companies to get incorporated in one day. However, one-day company registration in India is not possible as there required certain documents, preparation of which takes time. Classification of the Companies on the basis of Incorporation (i) Companies incorporated under Royal Charter This was practiced by the British Government. For example, East India Company came under Royal Charter, which means it was granted Charter by the King or the Queen of British and was controlled by the Charter. However, this is not much in practice now. (ii) Companies that are incorporated by the special Act of Parliament These Companies are incorporated under specified act of Parliament or State Legislature . These companies are formed with the fulfillment of some specified objects at the National level. These Companies are also called as Corporations. For example, Reserve Bank of India or State Bank of India. (iii) Companies incorporated under Indian Companies Act of 1956 These companies come under the memorandum of association and articles of association. Types of companies *Sole Proprietorship - A sole proprietorship, also known as a trader firm or proprietorship exclusively owned by one person, is a business form that is owned and run by one individual. A sole proprietor may use a trading name or business name other than his or her name. *Registration not required - In summary, the biggest advantage is quick formation and low compliances. However, the biggest disadvantage is an unlimited liability. *Partnership - liability is joint and unlimited. It's also not a mechanism to be driven by Separate legal entity. Registration is not compulsory. Active partners take part in day-to-day operations of the business, in addition to investing in it. Active partners are entitled to a share of the enterprise's profits. Sleeping partners invest in the business and are entitled to a share of its profits, but do not participate in day-to-day operations. *Limited Liability Partnership - Liability is limited *HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) - businesses owned by a joint family belonging to Hindu religion. Even though Jain and Sikh families are not governed by the Hindu law, they can still form a HUF. *Cooperative * Dormant company - A company which has been created for a future project or for holding assets including intellectual property of the company *Family Owned Business *Pvt Ltd (Private Limited Company): ‚âà Ltd (UK) - May have 2‚Äì200 shareholders; shares are held privately and cannot be offered to public. * Small company - A company other than a public company whose paid up share capital is not more than 50 lakh and turnover does not exceed crore. *Ltd (Public Limited Company): ‚âà plc (UK) *Public sector undertaking (PSU) - Alternatively known as Public Sector Enterprise (PSE). It may be public limited company listed on stock exchanges with major ownership by a state government or a central government of India or it may be unlisted entity with major ownership by a state government or a central government of India. Some of these entities are formed as business entities through special legislation, where these entities are governed by the statutes of these legislation and may or may not be governed by company laws like a typical business entity. *One- person company - It is a type of private company which can have only one director and member. At the time of incorporation of such company, the member needs to introduce a nominee of himself. *Unlimited Company - A company, similar to its limited company (Ltd, or Pvt Ltd) counterpart, but where the liability of the members or shareholders is not limited. *Incorporated Company FI INCORPORATON 1)Memorandum of association Duly stamped signed by directors. in the case of public company should signed by 7 members. In the case of private company signed by 2 person sufficient 2)Articles of association It is the rules of internal management .pvt company can adopt table a .this is model of articles of association 3)Consent of preposed director The consent of preposed director act as director and purchase of share Corporate governance Corporate Governance =Company constitutions= =Governance of the board= Under CA 2013 section 149, the provision mandate that every company shall have board of directors. Under CA 2013 section 169, the basic rule is that any company director may be removed by the general meeting with a simple majority vote, after giving \\"special notice\\" of 28 days. In companies which elect the board by proportional representation according to section 163, there is an exception so that directors appointed by one particular group of members cannot be ousted by the majority. Those directors can only be removed by the members that appointed them, so as to protect the system of proportional voting. =Employee rights= It was the view of many in the Indian Independence Movement, including Mahatma Gandhi, that workers had as much of a right to participate in management of firms as shareholders or other property owners.As Gandhi said, \\"my advice to the employers would be that they should willingly regard the workers as the real owners of the concerns which they fancy they have created\\" in 'Harijan' (31 March 1946) reproduced in R Iyer (ed), The Moral and Political Writing of Mahatma Gandhi (1987) vol 3, 197-199 Article 43A of the Constitution, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1976,See Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act 1976 s 9 created a right to codetermination by requiring the state to legislate to \\"secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings\\". However, like other rights in Part IV, this article is not directly enforceable but instead creates a duty upon state organs to implement its principles through legislation (and potentially through court cases). In 1978 the Sachar Report recommended legislation for inclusion of workers on boards, however this has not yet been implemented.Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, Report of the High-Powered Expert Committee on Companies and Maintenance of Restrictive Trade Practices Acts (1978) The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 section 3 created a right of participation in joint work councils to \\"provide measures for securing amity and good relations between the employer and workmen and, to that end to comment upon matters of their common interest or concern and endeavour to compose any material difference of opinion in respect of such matters\\". However, trade unions had not taken up these options on a large scale. In National Textile Workers Union v Ramakrishnan1983 AIR 75, 1983 SCR (1) 9. Noted by J Cottrell, 'Indian Judicial Activism, the Company and the Worker: A Note on National Textile Workers Union v Ramakrishnan' (1990) 39(2) The International and Comparative Law Quarterly 433 the Supreme Court, Bhagwati J giving the leading judgment, held that employees had a right to be heard in a winding up petition of a company because their interests were directly affected and their standing was not excluded by the wording of the Companies Act 1956 section 398. *Excel Wearv. Union of India A.I.R. 1979 S.C. 25, 36 =Directors' duties= Directors' owe a range of duties to the company, which primarily involve acting within the constitution, avoiding conflicts of interest and performing their role to a desired standard of competence. The Companies Act 2013 section 166 lists directors' duties in seven simple sections, which reflect the existing principles developed by the case law in the courts around most Commonwealth countries, in common law and equity. Part of the reason for codification of directors' duties was to provide a transparent statement of the duties directors owe, and therefore to publicise principles of best practice. However, because of their generality, the case of law of the courts matters to interpret how duties will apply in specific situations. =Corporate social responsibility= In a new with the Companies Act 2013, section 135 requires companies to spend 2% of their net profit on socially responsible projects, if they have a net worth of over rupees 500 crore, or a turnover of over rupees 1,000 crore, or a net profit over rupees 5 crore. Socially responsible projects are defined in Schedule VIII, and mainly involve community development.

The club has also benefited from players playing for both the Aberdour Shinty Club and Shinty in the United States, gaining valuable experience. The club has achieved great success off the pitch, with a membership which far outstrips most shinty clubs in Scotland. The team has many secret traditions handed down from chieftain to chieftain. The club's women's team has also been successful in recent years. The club originally played in the Women's Shinty League setup but were often overmatched.

Instead he had been assassinated by the Taliban regime, for his all too progressive convictions according to Taliban standards. In Afghanistan all girls have to wear the burka, only infants are exempt. Her handicapped oldest sister was beaten, for an ankle that was visible for a moment outside in the street. After her father was killed in Kabul by the Taliban and shortly thereafter her elder brother disappeared, Hamidi fled Afghanistan in 2001 with her mother and sisters. Her mother and her uncle had to pay people traffickers in order to escape to Western Europe when she was 13 years old. After many ordeals and travels through Russia, Hamidi arrived in Belgium as a 15-year-old refugee. She and her family were assigned a house in Antwerp.

It is the analysis of Karma yoga which finds its source in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book for Hindus. According to him, the real message behind the Bhagavad Gita is Nishkam Karmayoga (selfless action), rather than Karma Sanyasa (renouncing of actions), which had become the popular message of Gita after Adi Shankara. He took the Mimamsa rule of interpretation as the basis of building up his thesis. This book consists of two parts. The first part is the philosophical exposition and the second part consists of the Gita, its translation and the commentary. The book was written by Tilak in pencil with his own handwriting while being imprisoned at the Mandalay jail from 1908 to 1914. The more-than-400 pages of script was written in less than four months and is hence in itself considered as \\"remarkable achievement\\". Although the writing was completed in the early years of his term, the book was only published in 1915, when he returned to Poona. He defended the ethical obligation to the active principle or action, as long the action was selfless and without personal interest or motive. In a speech on his, Gita Rahasya Tilak said \\"Various commentators have put as many interpretations on the book, and surely the writer or composer could not have written or composed the book for so many interpretations being put on it. He must have but one meaning and one purpose running through the book, and that I have tried to find out\\". He finds the message of the subservience of all yogas to Karmayoga or the yoga of action rather than the yoga of sole knowledge (jnanayoga) or of devotion (bhaktiyoga).

Built in 1850, it was a well- preserved example of Italianate styling. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, at which time it was still owned by Hill's descendants. The house and carriage house were demolished in July 2016.

It was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and Italianate styling. The roof eave was deep and studded with brackets. The main facade was three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a portico supported by fluted square columns and pilasters, with brackets also found in its roof eave. A series of ells extended to the rear, and the property included a period carriage house with cupola. The interior had high-quality period woodwork, with some alterations dating to the early 20th century. The house was built in 1850 for Alpheus Dwight Burgess, a machinist, on land he had purchased in 1847. The house was typical of houses built during this period, which was a boom time in the city, producing a large number of houses of this type. Burgess sold the house in 1855 to Varnum Hill, in whose family it remained at least into the 1980s. Ownership by a single family contributed to its state of preservation relative to similar houses nearby, which were often demolished or extensively altered. This house was demolished in 2016.

It is a scheduled ancient monument and is located a short distance northwest of Bodedern. It is maintained by Cadw. Tombs There are two neolithic tombs at this site, which is located about south of Llyn Llywenan and about northwest of the village of Bodedern. The southern tomb is the more complete; it has a capstone some , supported by three stout upright stones at the south end and by a single more slender stone at the north. Additionally there is a wooden frame beside the north upright that may provide some additional support. The northern tomb is considerably damaged with two remaining uprights at the north end; the capstone has fallen and is leaning against them. During the eighteenth century, when this site was first recorded, the northern tomb was already in a state of disrepair. It is unclear whether these chambers, which are only a few metres apart, were part of the same structure or were independent. A report in The Archaeological Journal in the mid-nineteenth century states that at that time the chambers were surrounded by a large number of small stones. Nowadays, this stone debris is no longer visible, but its former presence may indicate that at one time, both chambers were buried under a single mound, as is the case in the multi-phase burial tomb at Trefignath, some west of Presaddfed. Investigation and protection Presaddfed was described by Richard Gough in his 1798 version of William Camden's topographical survey Britannia. It was described in numerous nineteenth century articles in Archaeologia Cambrensis, and was included in J.E. Griffiths' 1900 book, 'A Portfolio of Photographs of the Cromlechs of Anglesey and Caernarvonshire'. Early reports suggest quantities of cairn material surrounded the cromlechs, which is no longer evident, so may have been removed in the nineteenth century. There appears not to have been any formal archaeological excavation on the monument. The monument now has legal protection as a Scheduled Monument, and is in the care of the state, managed by Cadw under a Guardianship agreement. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales curates the archaeological, architectural and historic records for the site. These include digital photographs, colour and black and white photographs, drawings, NMR site files, and Cadw guardianship records. About half a mile east of the burial chamber, on the ridge between Tre-Iorwerdd and Presaddfed, there is a tumulus with a circumference of about . It was excavated in 1870 and a jet bead and cremation urns were unearthed. Media The HeritageTogether projectHeritageTogether project has used photogrammetry to create 3D models of the site.3D model of Presaddfed Burial Chamber Access The site is open to the public, free of charge, throughout the year, save for 24, 25, 26 December and 1 January. Access is through a kissing gate and across a grassy field, a distance of about , and there is a pull-in by the roadside which is large enough for two cars.

Plot Felix tries to put three kittens to bed as part of their nap time. He then goes to the living room to chat with his iceweasel buddy. It appears the little cats are not sleepy as they cry in boredom. While Felix wonders what he should do, his friend offers a suggestion of taking the kittens to a cinema. Felix and the kittens are off to a cinema in town. He tries to purchase tickets at a booth but it appears cats are not permitted in the theater as the seller shoos them away. They then disguise themselves as a man, and manage to buy a ticket without the seller realizing. Their disguise, however, does not keep them covered for long when a guard at the cinema entrance spots some bizarreness on top. Feeling completely exposed, they split up and flee. The four cats are still desperate in wanting watch as they sneak through a tiny opening in the cinema's walls. Finally inside, they get to see a film, and the one starring in it turns out to be Felix himself, much to the kittens' enjoyment. But when the Felix character in the film gets attacked by a lion, the angry kittens rush forth and assault the screen, therefore causing a commotion from the audience. On a field just outside town, the kittens are weeping about never getting to watch something, and Felix is still wondering what he should do next. In no time Felix comes up with an idea, and tells the little cats that they should create their own film. Hours later, Felix and the kittens return to the field, bringing with them a crank-operated movie camera. Using the device, Felix takes videos of a ballet dancer, a marching band, a rising hot air balloon, and a female swimmer in the lake whom Felix romances with. The kittens also take some shots too. They then return home that night to watch the film they made. The characters in the film, however, appear upside down but Felix is able to make quick adjustments. It appears the female swimmer whom Felix dated is the iceweasel's girlfriend, much to the annoyance of that guy who's in attendance. The iceweasel mercilessly batters Felix. The kittens are too frightened to intervene, knowing the iceweasel is more powerful than the lion in the cinema film. Felix is left covered in a lot of bandages, an image he would display again in Whys and Other Whys.

Mann flew forty-eight missions over Europe as a member of the 332nd Fighter Group during the war. Mann was a member of the \\"Red Tails,\\" as the Tuskegee Airmen were called at the time, so-called because the tails of the P-51D Mustangs flown by the African-American pilots in combat missions were painted crimson red. (The term \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" did not come into use until the creation of a veteran's organization in 1972). Mann nicknamed his own fighter plane \\"The Iron Lady\\" after his wife. Early life He was born in New York City on May 23, 1921. His parents had moved north from Alabama to New York in search of better opportunities. The family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, when Mann was still a toddler, where he attended integrated schools. As a child, Mann dreamed of becoming a pilot, often building model aircraft. By his own admission Mann thought he had little chance of piloting actual aircraft, telling a Florida newspaper in 2008, \\"We made model airplanes. I used to save my pennies to go to the hobby shop and buy balsa wood to make airplanes...I never thought I would have a chance to actually fly an airplane.\\" Mann found work as a bellhop at the Hotel Cleveland after graduating from high school. He told the hotel that he was 21 years old instead of his actual age, which was 18 at the time. He left the hotel for a job at a steel-and-wire manufacturer when he learned that employment related to the defense industry would help delay mandatory military service. However, the work at the factory proved exhausting and he soon left the position. Mann also attended Philander Smilth College in Little Rock, Arkansas where he met and married his wife, Kathadaza \\"Kitty\\" Mann, in 1940.He was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. The couple returned to Cleveland after approximately one year, where Mann resumed his former job as a bellman at the Hotel Cleveland. Red Tails and World War II Ramitelli, Italy (March 1945) Hiram Mann, while still working as a bellman, hoped to fly for the United States as a pilot during World War II. He faced a number of obstacles: his race, his marital status, and his level of education. His first application was rejected because of his race. Mann wrote a letter to the U.S. War Department but was rejected, \\"The first letter of rejection I received said ‚Äî in no uncertain terms ‚Äî there were no facilities to train Negroes to fly in any branch of the American military service. That ticked me off.\\" Mann applied for a second time and received a second rejection because he was married and had completed only one year of college (the military wanted single men and required two years of college). Mann recalled, \\"There I was with three strikes against me ‚Äî [only] one year of college, married and black.\\" Meanwhile, the U.S. government had begun training African-American aviators at Sharpe Field in Alabama in 1941. Mann applied for third time. Mann received a reply letter on December 7, 1942, saying that his application was on file and that he would be contacted when an opening becomes available. He was finally accepted into the military pilot training program in 1943 on his third attempt, based on a series of mental and physical examinations. His wife, Kathadaza, moved back with her parents in Chicago and finished college when her husband entered flight training program. She worked as a high school teacher during the war. Mann completed his flight training and received his silver wings in June 1944 and became a \\"Red Tail,\\" later known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Mann flew 48 combat missions over Europe during the war. Mann flew just two P-51D Mustang planes: He lost the first plane when it \\"was shot out from under me.\\" He nicknamed both P-51Ds \\"Boss Lady\\" and \\"The Iron Lady,\\" which were affectionately named for his wife. His flights included a number of strafing missions. He recalled the mission in 2008, \\"I could see silver streaks coming out from my plane. Then, I could see silver streaks flying past me. I thought, 'Gee, I'm flying faster than my bullets.' But in reality, it was the enemy's bullets coming back past me.\\" Later life and career Lt. Col. Hiram Mann poses with airmen outside a C-17 Globemaster III at Joint Base Charleston (November 2012) Mann pursued a career in the U.S. Air Force after the war and then entered the civil service. He retired from the military as a lieutenant colonel in 1972. He completed his bachelor's degree utilizing the G.I. Bill and later obtained a master's degree as well. Hiram and Kitty Mann retired to Titusville, Florida, in 1974. Mann spoke extensively on his experience as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. He often spoke at college campuses and school advocating for education and perseverance. In 2005, he attended the unveiling of a bust of Charles P. Bailey, a fellow Tuskegee Airman, which was placed on display at the DeLand Naval Air Station Museum in Deland, Florida. In 2013, he was one of four Tuskegee veterans who rode in a Model A Ford in Orlando, Florida's, Veterans Day Parade.

She is noted for her contributions to Detroit, Michigan through city politics, civil service and activism. Biography Gomon was born Josephine Fellows in 1892 to Mary Walsh and Augustus W. Fellows in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan, and moved to Detroit after graduating in 1913 to teach physics and mathematics at Wayne State University (then called the College of the City of Detroit). She married R. Louis Gomon in 1916 and had five children with him: Bobby Lou, William, Howard Garner, Jeanne and R. Louis, Jr. While raising her children, Gomon worked as a teacher in Detroit's public school system and wrote a column about education for The Detroit News. In the 1920s Gomon became active in Detroit's birth control movement. She helped launch Planned Parenthood nationally and served as the president of the organization's Detroit chapter. After unsuccessfully running for public office in Detroit in 1929‚Äîbeing one of the first women to do so‚ÄîGomon began working for politician Frank Murphy in 1930 as an assistant on his mayoral campaign. After he was elected, Gomon became Murphy's executive secretary; he appointed her to the position of chairwoman on the Mayor's Unemployment Committee and she assisted him with the creation of several New Deal programs. Gomon became the director of the Detroit Housing Commission in 1933, where she supervised the construction of the city's first public housing until she was pressured to leave in 1938. She made a second bid for public office in 1935, but she was not elected. In 1941 she was recruited by Henry Ford to the role of Director of Women Personnel at the Ford Motor Company's Willow Run bomber plant for the duration of World War II. Gomon made her third and final bid for public office in 1941, and although she was unsuccessful again, she had a significant following. She later worked as an advisor for Walter Reuther and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Gomon effectively retired from politics and public service after World War II. She ran a radio show called \\"Opinion Unlimited\\" on WKMH from 1945 until 1948. She then dedicated her time to social justice projects for welfare and human rights through Americans for Democratic Action, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1960 she was honored at a tribute dinner attended by 300 people, including many of Michigan's high- profile politicians, and in 1961 she was awarded an honorary degree by Wayne State University. Gomon continued her efforts in political activism until shortly before she died in 1975 at the age of 85. Her obituary in the Detroit Free Press described her as \\"a spirited Detroiter\\", the \\"City's Conscience\\", and \\"one of the most influential women in the city's history\\".

The building exterior is largely unmodified except for the removal (sometime after 1946) of a small dome, and the addition to its rear of a wing housing additional offices. Construction of a new courthouse in Nashua was authorized in 1901, after significant population growth in the region taxed the existing county's facilities. The county purchased land from Dr. Edward Spalding, and retained Daniel Woodbury of the Boston firm Dana & Woodbury to design the new building. The building was completed in 1903, housing probate facilities and county offices on the ground floor, the main superior court chamber on the upper floor, and vaults and jail cells in the basement. The two-story wing in the rear was added in 1946.

The track opened in 1971 but closed just three years later in 1974 due to financial problems. The oval track was relaunched in 1985 thanks to a new promoter. The track hosted many races of the American Canadian Tour series, whether the ACT Pro Stock Tour, the ACT Late Model Tour or Quebec's S√©rie ACT. The original road course was of 2.5 km length, using the oval track and climbing the hill near Route 132. A new shorter road course (1.7 km) was laid out in 2000, still using the oval track.

The case remains unsolved to this day. Many have speculated that her uncle may have been responsible for her death, but others believe that the crime was committed by someone local to the area. Journalist James Renner has published his theory that the case may be connected to the murders of Tina Harmon, Krista Harrison, Deborah Smith and Amy Mihaljevic. Background Barnes was described as having been a soft-spoken girl who did well in school. She was in eighth grade and attended the nearby Harding Middle School. Because of the short distance between her home and her school, she walked to and from it every day, along with many other students. Her father had been shot to death in 1989, which had affected her to the point where her personality had changed. Disappearance and murder It was reported by a classmate that Barnes was walking to school in her hometown of Steubenville, Ohio when she was abducted on December 7, 1995. After she failed to return home, an investigation began, including statewide searches. On February 22, 1996, her remains were discovered by surveyors in a riverbed and the cause of death was determined by examiners to have been by strangulation; she had also been raped. Investigation Although her body was discovered near the property of her uncle, Louis Boyce, he was not charged with her murder. Boyce has remained under suspicion due to the fact that he reportedly did not pass a polygraph test regarding the murder of Barbara. A friend of Boyce expressed that it was unlikely that her uncle had anything to do with the murder, stating that it was not likely for him to have harmed any of his relative's children. However, the same man was suspected by police to have played a part in the murder of her father years earlier. Other leads include a Florida man convicted of abducting children who had been present in Steubenville when Barbara Barnes was abducted. Although some members of the police department are skeptical, supporting the theory that she may have been murdered by someone native to the area.

History Prior to 1947, Chirala had a military outpost of the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces. In October 1947, it was held by two Gorkha companies of the 7th Battalion of the State Forces, commanded by Captains Dalbir Singh and Lachman Dass. At the beginning of the October, the post was attacked by the Poonch rebels and subjected to \\"continuous mortar and medium machine-gun fire\\". Reinforcements were sent from Srinagar on 3 October, consisting of two companies of the 8th Battalion under Lt. Col. Maluk Singh . After passing Kohala, the force found that \\"every ridge, hilltop and track- bend\\" was held by the rebels offering stiff resistance. The reinforcements eventually reached the post on 7 October and evacuated the Gorkhas and the refugees taking shelter there. En route to Bagh, the forces again faced rebels along the way. After a stiff fight at Arja, they eventually reached Bagh on 13 October. Abdul Haq Suharwardy states that the rebel resistance was organised by Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan.

The spectrum in question is that of the Laplacian matrix associated to a family of quotients of a discrete group Œì; and the gap is that between the first and second eigenvalues (normalisation so that the first eigenvalue corresponds to constant functions as eigenvectors). Here Œì is a subgroup of the rational points of G, but need not be a lattice: it may be a so-called thin group. The \\"gap\\" in question is a lower bound (absolute constant) for the difference of those eigenvalues. A consequence and equivalent of this property, potentially holding for Zariski dense subgroups Œì of the special linear group over the integers, and in more general classes of algebraic groups G, is that the sequence of Cayley graphs for reductions Œìp modulo prime numbers p, with respect to any fixed set S in Œì that is a symmetric set and generating set, is an expander family. In this context \\"strong approximation\\" is the statement that S when reduced generates the full group of points of G over the prime fields with p elements, when p is large enough. It is equivalent to the Cayley graphs being connected (when p is large enough), or that the locally constant functions on these graphs are constant, so that the eigenspace for the first eigenvalue is one-dimensional. Superstrong approximation therefore is a concrete quantitative improvement on these statements. Background Property (œÑ) is an analogue in discrete group theory of Kazhdan's property (T), and was introduced by Alexander Lubotzky.http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/what-is.pdf For a given family of normal subgroups N of finite index in Œì, one equivalent formulation is that the Cayley graphs of the groups Œì/N, all with respect to a fixed symmetric set of generators S, form an expander family. Therefore superstrong approximation is a formulation of property (œÑ), where the subgroups N are the kernels of reduction modulo large enough primes p. The Lubotzky‚ÄìWeiss conjecture states (for special linear groups and reduction modulo primes) that an expansion result of this kind holds independent of the choice of S. For applications, it is also relevant to have results where the modulus is not restricted to being a prime. Proofs of superstrong approximation Results on superstrong approximation have been found using techniques on approximate subgroups, and growth rate in finite simple groups.

Plot When Bart disrespects his father Homer's authority, Homer tries to be a stricter parent to Bart. Bart later refuses to eat one piece of broccoli at dinner, so Homer decides to sit at the table until Bart eats his broccoli, even though they both miss out on important things (Homer's fantasy football draft and Bart being able to watch as Martin Prince beating up Nelson Muntz). To end the impasse, Lisa makes two identical smoothies where one contains broccoli and the other doesn't, so that Bart can drink it and Homer can feel that Bart did something well. But Bart deliberately spills the smoothies, and his fighting with a newly enraged Homer leads Marge to send them both to a \\"Relation Ship\\" with Captain Bowditch (Nick Offerman), where they can solve their relationship problems. While Homer recovers from scurvy, Bart enjoys and excels at sailing and ends up being promoted to mid-ship man, who can give out direct orders to the crew members, much to Homer's chagrin. Homer rebels against Bart's newfound position and eventually gets drunk of a flask of rum. When the captain snatches the rum off Homer, and reveals that he became a captain due to him being a recovering alcoholic, the captain gives into temptation and drinks the rum, becoming drunk with Homer. A huge storm begins, and Bart is left in charge of the ship due to the captain's intoxication. Bart wants to sail around a lighthouse inlet to reach safe harbor, but Homer first says they need to drop anchor and batten down the hanches and then responds to Bart's complaint about Homer ignoring his authority by screaming that Bart never listens to Homer's authority. To Homer's shock, Bart holds out a piece of broccoli he brought from home, eats it and then asks Homer to trust him. Homer does do so, and they combine to get the ship safely home, their relationship now in a much better place. Meanwhile, Marge had to draft Homer's fantasy football team called \\"Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe\\" despite knowing nothing of the sport and horrifies him by choosing a roster made mostly of placekickers. Initially put off by the trash talking from Homer's friends, she is advised by Patty and Selma to beat them in fantasy football to end the impasse. She and Lisa study football in detail and realize that a coming major storm event in the U.S. will lead to teams attempting and making record numbers of field goals, and thus her roster ends up piling up huge amount of point and defeating all challengers, proving as the narrator says that \\"fantasy football is mostly just luck.\\" Production Nick Offerman voiced the captain. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Parks and Recreation actor Nick Offerman revealed that he had been recommended for the voice of Captain Bowditch by Mike Scully, a writer on both The Simpsons and Parks and Recreation. Offerman never before thought that he would play a role on The Simpsons as \\"They‚Äôre writing parts for Paul McCartney\\", and was delighted to be cast as a sailor due to his interest in naval literature. Reception The episode received an audience of 4.27 million, the highest rated show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, stating ‚ÄúHomer‚Äôs journey in any good episode is funny and resonant because of the emotional realities involved, even if, the next time we see him, he has to learn the same lessons over again to drive the next plot. In fact, this infinite cycle is touching in its way, pointing out the futility of the Simpsons‚Äô efforts even as it rewards them for trying. The show‚Äôs heart makes the struggle worthwhile, even if there‚Äôs never going to be any real progress because of the world the show‚Äôs set in.‚Äù References  External links   \\"The Wreck of the Relationship\\" at theSimpsons.com Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 26) episodes Category:Fantasy sports ","title":"The Wreck of the Relationship"},{"id":"42812471","text":"\\"Super Franchise Me\\" is the third episode of the 26th season of the animated series The Simpsons, and the 555th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 12, 2014. The episode sees Marge open a sandwich franchise after her sandwiches become popular, but begin to struggle when Cletus opens with the same franchise across the road. The episode was dedicated to the memory of Jan Hooks, who had died on October 9. Plot Ned Flanders and his sons are trying to reduce their use of electricity in the house but discover that Homer is using their electricity to power a Ferris Wheel and a freezer full of meat. When Flanders takes the freezer away (since Homer had \\"borrowed\\" it from him), Marge puts the meat to use by making sandwiches, which prove popular at Springfield Elementary School when Bart and Lisa take them there as currency. Trudy Zangler of Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard advises Marge to open a franchise with the company. It initially struggles due to its incompetent staff (Marge fires Gil Gunderson for doing two jobs at once and Shauna Chalmers for stealing the register money), but begins to make a nice profit when the family takes over. However, business slows again when an express outlet with the same franchise opens across the road, operated by Cletus and his family. Marge is depressed and goes to Moe's, who tells her a scam to get out of her contract with the franchise. Homer goes into the restaurant in disguise and has hot coffee spilled on his crotch and gets hit by a fire extinguisher; Marge then tells a previously unsympathetic Trudy that the family's lack of emergency medical training is a violation of her franchise contract. To prevent a massive lawsuit, Trudy reluctantly gives Marge back all of her costs and Marge exults that things turned out relatively well for the family as they broke even. The episode ends with a scene showing a caveman Homer making the first ever sandwich from ground sloth meat between two squirrels, but then he wanders to his death inside a tar pit. In the present, Homer admires the fossilized sandwich. Cultural references The episode's couch gag parodies the cover of the album Tea for the Tillerman by Cat Stevens. The couch gag for the episode parodies the cover of the 1970 album Tea for the Tillerman by the British musician Cat Stevens, and has the album's title track playing over it. During the sandwich making scenes, part of L'Estasi dell'Oro by Ennio Morricone is played. Near the end of the episode, a \\"Simpsonized\\" version of the famous French painting \\"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\\" is briefly shown. The character Edna Krabappel, despite having died - and being eulogized by Ned Flanders in Season 25 - is shown standing with Jasper in the background. Reception The episode received an audience of 7.33 million viewers. It was the second most watched show on Fox that night, after The OT. \\"Super Franchise Me\\" received generally positive reviews. The A.V. Club gave the episode a B. Dennis Perkins wrote in the review, \\"Possessed of a unity of purpose, 'Super Franchise Me' allows its characters to breathe. Written by Bill Odenkirk, the episode sees Marge opening a franchised sandwich restaurant. No guest stars, no special events, no B-story‚Äîthe episode avoids much (if not all) of the clutter that‚Äôs been distracting in many of the Simpsons episodes of the last few years and focuses on the story at hand. If that story isn‚Äôt anything special, it‚Äôs at least peppered with enough funny little character touches and low-key laughs to make the show resemble itself at its best.\\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a rating of 3.0/5, calling it an \\"okay episode\\". The Hollywood Reporter contrasted the nostalgic couch gag with the futuristic Don Hertzfeldt-directed one for the episode \\"Clown in the Dumps\\" which aired two weeks prior.

It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on September 28, 2014, with \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", a crossover episode of Family Guy with The Simpsons, airing afterwards. This episode was dedicated in memory of Louis Castellaneta, the father of The Simpsons voice actor Dan Castellaneta. It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore, with Don Hertzfeldt directing a sequence in the opening titles. Jeff Ross, Sarah Silverman and David Hyde Pierce guest starred as themselves, with Jackie Mason and Kelsey Grammer reprising their respective roles as Rabbi Krustofski and Sideshow Bob, while Maurice LaMarche voiced several minor characters. In the episode, Krusty the Clown is offended by a comedy roast and asks his father, Rabbi Krustofsky, if he believes that he is funny. His father disagrees and then dies, leaving Krusty upset that his father did not admire his work. After an alcohol-induced coma, Krusty vows to do good in the world, and eventually with the help of Bart discovers that his father did enjoy his work. Meanwhile, due to the death of Krusty's father, Lisa obsesses over the health and safety of her father Homer. In October 2013, during the promotion of the previous season of the show, executive producer Al Jean revealed that a character would die in this episode. In July 2014, on the announcement of the title of the episode, several media outlets incorrectly presumed that Krusty would die. The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti-climactic due to Rabbi Krustofsky's minor role in the show, although other reviewers praised its conclusion to the relationship between Krusty and his father. Plot Krusty the Clown appears on a comedy roast by Jeff Ross and Sarah Silverman, and is offended by them. He seeks the advice of his father, Rabbi Krustofsky, on whether he is funny; the rabbi says he always thought he was \\"eh...\\", but dies then and there, right before he's about to tell Krusty what he really thinks of his comedy. As his father's last words seemed to be dismissive, and believing that nobody finds him funny anymore, Krusty quits his show. Bart attempts to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but he picks up on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofsky then appears and tells Krusty that Jews do not believe in Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofsky's favorite rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary. Triggered by the death of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with protecting her own father, Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus plows into the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer to take it easy on himself and just let him live his life. Production The Simpsons producer Al Jean made headlines when he revealed that a character would die in this episode. In October 2013, in a conference to promote the 25th season of the show, producer Al Jean said that a major character would die in this episode. He stated that the character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, following the death of Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed that it would not be her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that it would not be one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that it would not be Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask. In July 2014, when Jean announced the title of the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying \\"I was like, 'What? \\"In the dumps\\" doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character\\". He said of the episode, \\"It turned out bigger than we thought it was going to be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered.\\" Jean confirmed that the possibility was open for Jackie Mason to reprise his role as Rabbi Krustofski in dreams or flashbacks, and that Krusty would become a more generous character in the knowledge that his father admired his work. After the episode \\"Simpsorama\\" later on in the season, which implied that Ralph Wiggum would die in 2017, Jean told Entertainment Weekly that he had \\"learned [his] lesson\\" from the death of Rabbi Krustofski, therefore there would be no more deaths in the series. The first instance was in the 28th season episode \\"The Nightmare After Krustmas\\", aired in December 2016, Rabbi Krustofsky appears when Krusty has a near-death experience while being baptized in icy water for his conversion to Christianity. In addition to Mason, the episode guest starred Jeff Ross and Sarah Silverman as themselves roasting Krusty. Maurice LaMarche voiced both a television critic and the late comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who had himself guest starred on the show in the 1996 episode \\"Burns, Baby Burns\\". Kelsey Grammer reprised his role as Sideshow Bob in a scene showing him arguing with his replacement on Krusty's show, Sideshow Mel. David Hyde Pierce, who had previously appeared as Bob's brother Cecil, had a cameo as himself acting in the role of Felix in The Odd Couple. The episode's couch gag was the work of Academy Award-nominated surrealist animator Don Hertzfeldt, who was recommended to the show by Mike B. Anderson. It depicts Homer using a time-traveling remote control to regress to his original 1987 character model, then accidentally going into a distant future incarnation of the show called The Sampsans where he and his family have evolved into grotesque, mindless, catchphrase-spouting mutants. Jean deemed it \\"crazier than we thought\\" and \\"the most insane one we've ever done\\". Reception The couch gag by Don Hertzfeldt (pictured above) was praised as \\"staggering\\" by a CNN writer. The episode polarized critical opinions. Carey Bodenheimer of CNN wrote that > Instead of dropping the mic and resting on its collective laurels, [The > Simpsons] kicked off season 26 with a staggering, Don Hertzfeldt directed > intro sequence and then went on to prove that, in a world where shows can > flame out after just a few episodes, 'The Simpsons', which premiered in 1989 > still has plenty of jokes left in their comedic arsenal. Time wrote \\"If 'Clown in the Dumps' is not a classic on the level of season three's 'Like Father, Like Clown', it was still a fitting, sweet conclusion to the story of Hyman and Herschel\\". TV Fanatic gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing \\"Simpsons Season 26 starts off with a bang, with plenty of laughs and even a few sentimental moments\\". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting > 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be considered a classic episode now, but after > a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on > FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on > the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which > sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding > These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to > guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character > death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of > appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of > television. Nothing special‚Äîreally, it was just another Krusty episode, and > not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons > has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling > for Matt Groening's deathless creation. The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, commenting \\"Fresh off a summer of Simpsonsmania, thanks to the phenomenally successful FXX marathon of every episode ever, The Simpsons returns for its 26th season with a nondescript, anti-climactic premiere whose overstuffed cameos and would-be big character death amount to little more than a disspiriting confirmation that its best days are, indeed, long gone.\\" IGN rated the episode 5.8, concluding \\"Between an anticlimactic death and a redundant conflict, The Simpsons didn't start Season 26 off on the right foot\\". Executive producer Al Jean responded that the episode had been over-hyped, and that a quote attributed to him he never made: he said that he was quoted as saying that an \\"iconic\\" character would die, when in actuality, he said a \\"beloved\\" character would die. The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 28, 2014, as the premiere of the twenty-sixth season of The Simpsons. It was watched by approximately 8.53 million people during this broadcast. It received a 3.9 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18‚Äì49 (up thirty-four percent from the last season's premiere), and an eleven percent share. The Simpsons became the second highest-rated program in the 18‚Äì49 demographic on Fox that night, finishing with a higher rating than Brooklyn Nine-Nine but a lower rating than the Family Guy episode \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", a special hour-long crossover episode with The Simpsons. The Simpsons was, however, the most-watched show in the lineup in terms of total viewers.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 19, 2014. The episode, like the other Treehouse of Horror episodes, comprises three self-contained segments. In \\"School Is Hell\\", Bart finds his ideal new school in Hell; in \\"A Clockwork Yellow\\", Moe leads a Clockwork Orange gang; and in \\"The Others\\", the Simpson family are visited by their former selves. A clip from the episode was first shown to the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014, and showrunner Al Jean gave an interview about \\"The Others\\" in September. The final segment features a sequence in which the Simpson family is animated in the styles of several other media franchises, in which Pixar's John Ratzenberger provides the guest voice of a computer-generated Homer. The episode was watched by an audience of 7.76 million. It received a positive reception from critics, although opinions were divided on which segments were the strongest, and there were differing views on the quality of the Stanley Kubrick references in \\"A Clockwork Yellow\\". \\"Treehouse of Horror XXV\\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. Plot The episode opens with Kang and Kodos narrating a Johnny Carson-style opening (complete with clips from classic \\"Treehouse\\" episodes). All of the celebrity guests announced (e.g. Clint Eastwood, George Clooney, John Travolta) have been killed and displayed to spell the episode's title. =School is Hell= Principal Skinner has put Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, he finds an Aramaic inscription. Lisa uses an app to translate it which transports the pair to Hell, which is a school. Bart excels in all of his diabolical subjects (including torture, destruction, and making sure that Major League Baseball rules ensure the unending dominance of the New York Yankees) and asks his parents if he can study there permanently. For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer lets him. A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as \\"maledictorian\\". =A Clockwork Yellow= Moe has a Clockwork Orange-style gang in London along with Lenny, Carl and Homer. Homer falls for a girl (Marge) who convinces him to quit and the gang falls apart. Years later, Moe is attacked at home in a style similar to his gang's former ways and asks Homer to bring the gang back together; Lenny and Carl (who have become police officers) join them. They attack an Eyes Wide Shut- style masked orgy and several other of Stanley Kubrick's films are parodied in a fight sequence. As Moe gets beaten by two party guests, he narrates that he was \\"Beaten, bruised\\" and \\"couldn't score at an orgy\\" but was happy to be back with his old gang. Kubrick is then shown in an editing room and asks for the entire film to be re-shot. =The Others= In a parody of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty chocolate milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who turn out to be the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost by putting her head in the oven. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer unconscious with a toaster while he is in the bathtub, causing him to drown and then reappear as a ghost. Bart leaps across to a tree to escape the ghosts, but when Lisa chases after him, she misses the tree and falls to the ground, unknowingly killing herself, her ghost then chokes Bart with his slingshot as revenge, causing him to also fall to the ground and die instantly, becoming a bitter ghost. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. After encountering Dr. Marvin Monroe, who is in spiritual limbo and can't walk fully through walls, Marge settles her differences with her older counterpart and both women force Homer to choose between them. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost after she wins him over with an emotional speech. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together. Production \\"A Clockwork Yellow\\" references several of the films of Stanley Kubrick, most notably A Clockwork Orange. A clip from \\"A Clockwork Yellow\\" was first shown at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014. Executive producer Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta‚Äôs portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright‚Äôs voicing of Bart changed as well, because \\"it was lower-register, and you can see in the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [between the two versions of the Simpsons] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn‚Äôt have to ask‚Äîwe already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons.\\" He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating \\"if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it.\\" In the first segment, Bart summons Hot Stuff the Little Devil, who has been sentenced to Hell for his \\"lame\\" comics. The second segment in this episode titled \\"A Clockwork Yellow\\" parodies Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and features references to his other films, including Eyes Wide Shut. In the finale of the third segment, Lisa asks if there is a possibility that \\"an evil marketing entity\\" could produce millions of others. The family is then reproduced in the animation styles of numerous other series including Adventure Time, Archer and South Park, as well as Japanese anime, the Minions from Despicable Me and alternative versions from other episodes of The Simpsons. A computer-generated Homer is voiced by guest star, Pixar voice actor John Ratzenberger. Reception The episode received an audience of 7.76 million, a rise of 0.31 million viewers from the previous week's episode, \\"Super Franchise Me\\". It was the second most watched show on Fox that night, after The OT; and in the 18-49 demographic, it was the highest rated scripted show of the night (3.5) on all four networks only beaten by NBC's Football Night in America. The episode received positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, praising the cinematic quality of the first two segments while concluding that the third was the poorest. He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a \\"perfunctory checklist\\", and how the director's \\"ow\\" at the end had \\"comic aplomb\\". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage \\"smart and silly\\". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were \\"occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good\\". He concluded that \\"there‚Äôs something in Treehouse of Horror XXV for everyone. A little like a Halloween bag of candy\\". The episode was nominated for the Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, losing to the Cartoon Network miniseries Over the Garden Wall.

Plot Superintendent Chalmers organizes an exchange of the very worst tenured teachers between the schools in the district, moving several teachers, including Mr. Jack Lassen to Springfield Elementary School where he will teach Bart's class. He bullies Nelson and gives Bart an embarrassing haircut, so Bart schemes to bring him down, with the help of Milhouse. Using a fake social network profile in the name of Miss Hoover, they discover that Lassen is the \\"Ignis\\" or \\"Chosen One\\" at a desert festival called \\"Blazing Guy\\" where he will set fire to an eponymous effigy. Meanwhile, Homer has forgotten to book a campsite, which upsets Marge. Bart solves both of their problems by telling Homer to take the family to Blazing Guy. Marge, who is disturbed by the eccentric campers, drinks a cup of tea to relax, although it contains hallucinogens, making her delirious. Bart and Milhouse use fire retardant substance to make sure that the effigy will not light, therefore ruining Mr. Lassen's important moment. He is furious and grabs a burning tuba, from which he blows fire in an attempt to kill Bart and Milhouse on top of the effigy. Homer tries to save the boys by using a catapult to launch himself onto the effigy, but falls short and breaks its leg, destroying it. The other campers form a wall around Lassen and declare him to be shunned from the festival, while Bart and Milhouse escape safely. Superintendent Chalmers and Principal Skinner fire Lassen from teaching at Springfield Elementary or any other school. Lassen then finds a new job as a prison guard. While ordering lights- out to the inmates, he encounters inmate Sideshow Bob. Discovering that they both murderously detest Bart Simpson, Lassen offers a partnership to kill Bart, which Bob nearly accepts. But when Lassen declares that they share the final kill, Bob rejects the deal. Reception The episode received an audience of 6.70 million, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, commenting that Lassen \\"fell flat\\" because Dafoe's reputation as a menacing actor comes from his physicality rather than his voice. He also observed that the series increasingly used Bart's misbehavior for jokes and plot development rather than emotional impact, but that this episode featured ‚Äúclassic Milhouse\\" moments in the episode, including urinating himself on Lassen's entrance and joining in with Lassen in bullying Nelson.

Early life and education Born August 20, 1945 in post-war Bucarest, Jos√© Eisenberg comes from a long line of textile manufacturers. He is the only son of Sally and Marcel Eisenberg. He spent his childhood in Romania during the communist post-war era. His family's home, businesses and possessions were confiscated by the new political regime. From an early age, his parents instilled in him strong values, an appreciation for excellence and unconditional respect for France. His father, once a student at the Sorbonne in Paris, inspired a lifelong love of the French lifestyle. Jos√© Eisenberg was greatly influenced by his courageous uncle, Aurel Eisenberg, a French citizen and World War II resistance fighter killed by occupying forces on the same day Paris was liberated. Jos√© Eisenberg is self-educated. At age 13, he left school and held several jobs: newspaper deliveryman, poster maker, handyman in workshops which still employed Renaissance art-making techniques. He eventually passed the baccalaureate as an independent candidate. He is fluent in 6 languages.  Entrepreneurship  At age 21, Jos√© Eisenberg established his own fashion design studio and factory in Florence, Italy. He designed his own creations and produced collections for known fashion names. He is a pioneer of the democratisation of fashion in Europe. In 1972, Italy awarded him honorary citizenship for his immense contribution to the industrialisation of the Basilicata region. Without abandoning his fashion design roots, Jos√© Eisenberg embarked on his second entrepreneurial project in 1974, investing time, energy and resources into artificial intelligence research, still in its infancy at the time. He founded JE Contrex in Boston, recruiting graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though JE Contrex was able to successfully develop a functioning artificial eye, work had to be abandoned due to the slow processing speed of the era‚Äôs computers. In 1976, he launched a second technology company, Eisenberg Data Systems (E.D.S.). E.D.S developed and marketed PCs, including the first PC with a detachable keyboard, an invention which benefited from E.D.S.'s own software.  Eisenberg Paris  In 1985, Jos√© Eisenberg embarked on his most ambitious project. Wanting to combine his two passions, beauty and technology, he began work on the creation of a beauty brand focused on helping women and men achieve timeless, natural beauty. After thirteen years of scientific research in Switzerland and two years of medical, clinical, toxicological, molecular and pharmacological testing at the University of Pavia, he developed what would become his beauty brand‚Äôs signature innovation, the Trio-Molecular¬Æ Formula, patented worldwide. A discovery, not an invention, the Trio-Molecular¬Æ Formula synergises three molecules found in nature which, when combined, regenerate, energise and oxygenate skin, helping it preserve or regain the natural functions of youthful skin. In 2000, he launched his brand, Jos√© Eisenberg Paris, shortening the brand's name to Eisenberg the following year. The Trio- Molecular¬Æ Formula became the cornerstone of Eisenberg Paris, used throughout the brand's numerous skincare lines. Jos√© Eisenberg is involved in every creation and the day-to-day operations of the brand. In addition to skincare products, he has also created two perfume collections and a range of smart cosmetics which infuse make-up with skincare benefits, providing a single-step ‚Äòmake-care‚Äô solution. Personal life Jos√© Eisenberg has three children, two daughters and a son. His son, Edmond, joined Eisenberg Paris in 2011. Together, they steer the direction of the brand‚Äôs product development and global development strategies. Edmond Eisenberg has said, ‚ÄúEisenberg is primarily a family business. This allows us to remain faithful to my father's authentic vision, to his values, and to be free and independent to maintain our authenticity.‚Äù References External links *Eisenberg Paris Category:Living people Category:French cosmetics businesspeople Category:Italian fashion designers Category:Perfumers Category:People in information technology Category:Technology company founders Category:1945 births Category:Computer designers ","title":"Jos√© Eisenberg"},{"id":"42812556","text":"Ilustration by G.

Ross has specialized in the causal dynamics of OPT. Using quantitative research, Ross developed Attributes of Terrorism in Canada (ATIC), the first data base on OPT in Canada, which was later acquired by the Solicitor General of Canada. This research led Ross to be an expert witness for the Canadian Senate's Special Committee on Terrorism and Public Safety (1986). This source of data, was used in a series of quantitative research studies Ross conducted during the late 1980s and early 1990s. =Policing= In the field of policing, Ross has examined the challenges facing police departments operating in both western and non-western communities; how incidents of police violence/excessive force come to public attention, and whether this sets an agenda for the police organization to change; and the myths of community policing. Ross has written two books in this area: Making News of Police Violence (Praeger, 2000), and Policing Issues: Challenges and Controversies (Jones and Bartlett, 2011). =Corrections= Ross‚Äô research in the area of corrections has focused on understanding problems in this branch of the criminal justice system. Ross is also interested in high security prisons, and edited The Globalization of Supermax Prisons (Rutgers University Press, 2013). Ross is the co-author of Behind Bars: Surviving Prison (Alpha Books, 2002) and Beyond Bars: Rejoining Society After Prison (Alpha Books, 2009).

It is a scheduled monument and is maintained by Cadw. The monument is near Bethel. Three phases of use have been identified, all dating from the Neolithic period. It is Burial chamber Din Dryfol is the remains of a burial chamber, part of a passage grave, a neolithic structure erected in several stages, and a type of burial structure more frequently found in Ireland than in Wales. The first part may have been constructed about 5,000 years ago. The dolmen is located on a level platform on the flank of a small hill and is oriented northeast to southwest. Excavations in the 1960s and 1970s have identified the different phases of the development. The first chamber was constructed with side slabs and a capstone, making a rectangular box some and about tall. This is the main structure that can be seen today, the capstone having slipped to one side to rest upon the ground. The second chamber was constructed to the northeast of this, and nothing remains of it now. However two post holes show where a wooden portal or some other structure stood. The third chamber was built to the northeast of the second one. It was about long and parts are still visible in the form of a small upright, a large portal stone standing high and some way away from the other stones, and a stone stump, perhaps the remains of another portal. The whole structure would have been covered with a mound of earth or rubble, probably small and circular over the original chamber, but much longer and rather wider when all three chambers had been constructed. Although this mound has disappeared, excavations suggest that it stretched for about and was about wide. Excavations have revealed pieces of pottery and cremation sites. Disturbance and Excavation The site showed evidence of disturbance during the Roman period, with Romano-British pottery unearthed during the 1970s excavations. It was also affected by road-building in the 18th and 19th century, when here was quarrying in the area. There is now no sign of a cairn or mound. The monument was recorded in 1871 by H Pritchard, and excavated by F Lynch, firstly in 1969 to 1970 and again in 1980, which identified the phases of construction. Wooden entrance posts to the second of three chambers, to the east of the earlier structure, were also identified.

It deals with themes of social, political, religious, cultural structures and provides commentary or criticism on them typically under the guise of dark humor or respective music genres. Topics include sexuality, race, culture, religion, politics, institutions, taboo subjects, morality, and the human condition.

Satire in counterculture Counterculture and avant-garde music scenes characterized by being \\"aggressive in sound, challenging in content\\" that spawned popular music such as hip hop and heavy metal display satirical taboo transgressions. According to British sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris, \\"tongue- in-cheek attitude\\" and irony has been a fundamental \\"part of the UK extreme scene\\" by often adopting camp and comic elements to trangress what outsiders to the scene find \\"acceptable;\\" e.g. appropriating Holocaust imagery to advance a position pertaining to abortion or animal rights. Other times, like in the case of black metal,K. Kahn-Harris, Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge (Berg Publishers, 2007), p. 148, exaggerating tropes and behaviors within music cultures or society.Powell, Gary Botts (2013). \\"Heavy Metal Humor: Reconsidering Carnival in Heavy Metal Culture.\\" Master's thesis, Texas A & M University.

Vaporwave, an Internet music genre, samples corporate video work, old advertising jingles, and music of the so-called economic boom period of the 1980s like smooth jazz or contemporary R&B;, and distorts them to produce a sort of repetitious slowed- down, pitch-shifted, intentionally low-fi music that was praised as a commentary on \\"corporate cultures of capitalism\\" or consumerism for its ambivalent satirical musical tone.Tofalvy T, Barna E (2020). Popular Music, Technology, and the Changing Media Ecosystem: From Cassettes to Stream, Springer Nature, p. 187, . One of vaporwave albums utilizing satire is James Ferraro's album FARSIDEVIRTUAL (2011).Cook N, Ingalls M.M., Trippett D (2017), The Cambridge Companion to Music in Digital Culture, Cambridge University Press, p. 120, . Satire in popular music Ambiguity of satire has contributed to popular misinterpretations of music that adopted it. For instance, Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" (1984) listed in Rolling Stones \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" and RIAA's Songs of the Century was written as a satire yet canonized as a \\"patriotic rock anthem,\\" a designation that ignores the message \\"how far political leaders had strayed from the values the country was founded on,\\" criticizing the establishment with the memorable chorus.Caroline Madden, Caroline (2020). Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television, McFarland, p. 50, . As Springsteen adds, it is about the working-class man going through Popular satires =Parody= Parody music in the truest sense is a type of work that seriously imitates a well-known original and simultaneously covertly satirizes the environment of which that original is a part (compare, pastiche which does not perform the latter and is conflated with \\"homages\\") while at worst is copying an original composition for a \\"parodic effect\\" only.Schwabach, Aaron (2013). Fan Fiction and Copyright: Outsider Works and Intellectual Property Protection, Ashgate Publishin, p. 73, . =Comedic satire= Overtly comedic strains of satire include comedy and novelty music, typically focused on broad-appeal jokes and caricatures. Both arriving with popular music in the 1940s and 1950s, comical spoofs of music genres and performers contributed to a popular mainstream strain of satire.

On the other hand, Tom Lehrer is known for his style of comic morbid juxtapositions and satirical culture criticisms, e.g. \\"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\\" pairs inoffensive melody with Charles Addams-esque lyrics: Meanwhile, \\"My Home Town\\" catalogues prostitution, pornography, murder, arson among common people using a nostalgic tone. Lehrer's humorous music with social and political satire overtones attracted censorship and negative press which he reprinted on the sleeve of his albums. By word-of- mouth reputation he sold 370,000 copies by the end of the 1950s and developed a following in Australia, Denmark, and England. Lehrer contributed with \\"The Folk Song Army,\\" \\"National Brotherhood Week,\\" \\"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\\" \\"So Long, Mom (I'm Off to Drop the Bomb,\\" and \\"We Will All Go Together When We Go\\" which examine society and the failings of both left- and right-wing.

Taylor purchased 40 acres of land for the campus of Bryn Mawr College in 1878, three Victorian cottages were located on the property, later known as the Deanery, the Betweenery, and the Greenery.Merriam, Ruth.A History of the Deanery (Bryn Mawr, PA, 1965) p. 3 In 1885, M. Carey Thomas moved into the Deanery, a modest building of five rooms situated downhill and approximately 100 meters (330 feet) to the west of what was then the central campus building, Taylor Hall.Lower Merion Library System, Historical Atlases of Lower Merion, Bryn Mawr College campus, 1881 The residence underwent a minor expansion in 1888 ‚Äì the first of three renovations ‚Äì when two small rooms were added to the rear of the house for the storage of books and records.Merriam, Ruth.A History of the Deanery (Bryn Mawr, PA, 1965) p. 4 = 1894‚Äì1896 Renovation = In 1894, the college architect Walter Cope drew up plans for a second expansion of the Deanery at the request of M. Carey Thomas, shortly after she was appointed to the college Presidency. The Philadelphia firm of Cope and Stewardson had been commissioned to design and construct several campus buildings in the 1880s and 90s, including the dormitories Radnor (1885) and Denbigh (1891).Bryn Mawr College.

Mary Elizabeth Garrett: Society and Philanthropy in the Gilded Age(Baltimore, MD, 2008) p. 205. The renovation completed in 1896 made four major changes to the existing building. The house was re-oriented away from its existing veranda, and a new entrance facing campus replaced the existing entrance. On the second floor, a library and guest bedrooms were created, and a third floor was added, containing more guest rooms and the servants' quarters. A large northwest wing was also added to the existing house, located off of the original dining room and containing the kitchen, pantry, and storage areas.Merriam, Ruth.A History of the Deanery (Bryn Mawr, PA, 1965) p. 4 = 1908‚Äì1909 Renovation = Archer & Allen blueprint, 1908 In 1907, Mary Garrett decided to fund another major renovation project to expand the Deanery for a third time. The plans were drawn up by the architectural firm of Archer and Allen, with Lockwood de Forest as consultant.Merriam, Ruth.A History of the Deanery (Bryn Mawr, PA, 1965) p. 5 The expansion began in 1908 and took nearly two years and $100,000 to complete.Finch, Edith.

In addition, Mamie Gwinn's bedroom on the second floor was transformed into Garrett's very large bedroom with an elaborate bath. When completed, the Deanery had been transformed from its origins as a simple Victorian cottage into a sprawling, 46-room mansion. It was an elegant residence where M. Carey Thomas could entertain the college's important guests, students, and alumnae, as well as her own immediate family and friends. = Alumnae House and demolition = M. Carey Thomas convinced the Board of Trustees to give control of the Deanery and its property, which technically belonged to the college, to the Alumnae Association, pursuant to the same conditions on which she herself had held it. The contents of the house, with the exception of her personal belongings, some furniture and books, and a few valued treasures, Thomas gave to the trustees, who held them in trust for use in the alumnae house. Operation of the house was overseen by alumnae organized into a newly formed Deanery Committee.Finch, Edith. Carey Thomas of Bryn Mawr (New York, 1947) p.306. The Deanery building was demolished in 1968 to make space for a new library building.

Decoration  = Lockwood de Forest = Stenciling on the ceiling and walls of Mamie Gwinn's study by Lockwood de Forest The design and decoration of many of the Deanery's interior spaces was entrusted, in large part, to the American artist Lockwood de Forest. A student of the landscape painter Frederic Church, de Forest enjoyed moderate success as an artist, exhibiting his work at a variety of venues including the National Academy of Design in New York.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 27-30 De Forest made his living, however, as a designer and an importer of exotic goods. In 1880, he and Louis Comfort Tiffany established the firm of Tiffany & de Forest, which focused largely on the importation of East Indian decorative arts.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 41-42 By 1883, de Forest had set up his own import business, based in New York City, which distributed carved teakwood furniture, tracery panels, jewelry, and textiles, some of which were produced in his workshop in Ahmedabad, India.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 92-93 For the second and third renovations of the Deanery in 1894‚Äì1896 and 1908‚Äì1909, M. Carey Thomas consulted de Forest for the design and decoration of the Deanery's interior.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 180-181. De Forest's hand is clearly detectable through his incorporation of East Indian materials and designs, as well as Tiffany glass.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 180-181. Stenciling in Dining Room by Lockwood de Forest The most perceptible element of de Forest's design aesthetic in the Deanery is his stenciling, a technique for which his Indian workshop was known.\\"'The Very Best Woman's College There Is': M. Carey Thomas and the Making of the Bryn Mawr Campus.\\" Bryn Mawr College Library Special Collections. September 21 ‚Äì December 20, 2001. Web exhibition by Marianne Hansen. Accessed 22 May 2014.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 180-181. Geometric designs were stenciled on the walls or on the ceilings throughout the house, as, for example, on the ceiling of the Blue Room, as an upper border in the dining room, a mid-height border in the corridor between the studies, and as an upper border and on the ceiling in Mamie Gwinn's study.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 181. Even the floors of the dining room were stenciled, as Thomas noted in a letter to de Forest: \\"You remember it was so with my dining room. In four years the stenciling under the wax which we put on the floors was entirely worn off.\\"Letter from M. Carey Thomas to Lockwood de Forest. Dated 11 July 1908. M. Carey Thomas Papers (microfilm 35, frame 382) Bryn Mawr College Archives Several pieces of furniture were also transformed into \\"art furniture\\" by the addition of stenciled designs, possibly as a cost-saving measure, as the 1894‚Äì1896 renovations cost over $14,000.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 174. In addition to the stenciling, de Forest's touch can be seen in the incorporation of other Eastern designs and Tiffany glass. De Forest used carved teakwood, like that produced by the Ahmedabad Woodcarving Company, in the molding along the outer edge of the fireplace in Mamie Gwinn's study, as well as some picture frames in the corridor between her and Thomas's study (the Blue Room).Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 180. In the third expansion of the house in 1908, de Forest decorated the ceiling of the Dorothy Vernon Room with thin sheets of patterned brass in a variety of East Indian designs.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 184.

Carey Thomas, which came to be known as the \\"Blue Room,\\" referring to the room's dark blue walls. The decoration of the Blue Room was inspired by Japanese art, a departure from the East Indian influence that permeates the majority of de Forest's designs in the Deanery.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 181. The celebrated gold designs that de Forest stenciled on the ceiling were reminiscent of Japanese textiles, and the spiked flowers of the Japanese pagoda tree were the model for the stencil designs on the sofa and daybed.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 181.

Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 141‚Äì142. Garrett' Baltimore home was never photographed before it was destroyed by fire in 1939 Photographs from before Garrett moved into the Deanery in 1904, and after de Forest's redecoration of the house in 1894‚Äì1896, show only a fraction of the known pieces by de Forest in Bryn Mawr's collection from the Deanery. The absence of the furniture in these photographs, in addition to shipping labels still attached to several pieces indicating Garrett as the sender and the Deanery as the final destination, support the idea that the majority of the de Forest furniture was originally from Garrett's Baltimore home.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) pp. 141-142. Furthermore, if the furniture was from this earlier period, then it is likely that it was produced in de Forest's workshop in Ahmedabad, India.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 144. The swing-settee, which was later installed in the Dorothy Vernon room, is one of the most recognizable pieces of de Forest to have come from Garrett's Baltimore home.Mayer, Roberta. Lockwood de Forest, Furnishing the Gilded Age with a Passion for India (Newark, DE, 2008) p. 184. In addition to the furniture created by de Forest, Garrett also brought a set of 19th century cherry furniture with starfish, moon, and flower (or star) motifs that included two wardrobes, several cupboards, a set of side chairs and a washstand. = The Dorothy Vernon Room = As part of the 1908‚Äì1909 renovations of the Deanery, the sitting room was expanded into what was later termed the \\"Dorothy Vernon Room.\\" The design and the name were inspired by Thomas' love of Charles Major's 1902 novel \\"Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall,\\" a fictionalized version of the life of Elizabethan heiress, Dorothy Vernon.Mayer, Roberta.

From a 1908 photograph of the room, one can see some of Garrett's teakwood furniture from Baltimore (e.g. Deanery.382‚Äì383), as well as the swing settee by de Forest and his Ahmedebad Wood Carving Co. The settee is composed of intricately carved teak panels and hangs from four elaborately designed brass chains that depict three- dimensional birds, elephants, and human figures.

(b) The reproduction probability peaks early in life at sexual maturity and then steadily decreases as an individual ages, with the remaining share of the population decreasing with age as they enter the selection shadow. The selection shadow is a concept involved with the evolutionary theories of aging that states that selection pressures on an individual decrease as an individual ages and passes sexual maturity, resulting in a \\"shadow\\" of time where selective fitness is not considered. Over generations, this results in maladaptive mutations that accumulate later in life due to aging being non-adaptive toward reproductive fitness. The concept was first worked out by J. B. S. Haldane and Peter Medawar in the 1940s, with Medawar creating the first graphical model. Model The model developed by Medawar states that due to the dangerous conditions and pressures from the environment, including predators and diseases, most individuals in the wild die not long after sexual maturity. Therefore, there is a low probability for individuals to survive to an advanced age and suffer the effects related to aging. In conjunction with this, the effects of natural selection decrease as age increases, so that later individual performance is ignored by selection forces. This results in beneficial mutations not being selected for if they only have a positive result later in life, along with later in life deleterious mutations not being selected against. Due to the fitness of an individual not being affected once it is past its reproductive prime, later mutations and effects are considered to be in the \\"shadow\\" of selection. This concept would later be adapted into Medawar's 1952 mutation accumulation hypothesis, which was itself expanded upon by George C. Williams in his 1957 antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis. A classical requirement and constraint of the model is that the number of individuals within a population that live to reach senescence must be small in number. If this is not true for a population, then the effects of old age will not be under a selection shadow and instead affect adaptation and evolution of the population as a whole. At the same time, however, this requirement has been challenged by increasing evidence of senescence being more common in wild populations than previously expected, especially among birds and mammals, while the effects of the selection shadow remain present.  Medawar's Test Tube model  Peter Brian Medawar, the scientist/biologist behind the test tube theory. This theory was created to demonstrate how older test tubes are continuously replaced when they are broken, thus decreasing older test tube population numbers as time progresses. The test tubes were symbols for individual subjects in a species. Medawar developed a theoretical model to demonstrate his thought process which explained that most animals will die before aging will be the ultimate cause for death in that animal. This would be from environmental factors such as large storms, drought, and fires, and predation. Medawar wanted to demonstrate this possibility by using test tubes to get his point across. The test tubes would be used to represent a population of species. If one of these test tubes were to theoretically break, this would represent an individual animal dying. Randomly, test tubes would then be broken in the population to keep his model realistic. The broken test tubes would be replaced with a new one, which represents a new animal being born into the population. Overtime, the model showed that test tubes over a certain age would decline in the population as new test tubes were put in. The overall results in Medawar‚Äôs thought model demonstrated an exponential decline in the survivor curve which resulted in the population having a half life. The amount of older animals, or test tubes in the population would then be harder to maintain and ultimately die. Medawar created this model to ultimately explain what would realistically happen in actual life. Criticism Some scientists, however, have criticized the idea of aging being non-adaptive, instead adopting the theory of \\"death by design\\". This theory follows the work of August Weismann, which states that aging specifically evolved as an adaptation, and disagrees with Medawar's model as a perceived oversimplification of the impact older organisms have on evolution. It is also claimed that older organisms have a higher reproductive capacity due to being better fit in order to reach their age, rather than their capacity being equal as in Medawar's calculations.

The bill would alter current law, which allows access to such counseling only to active duty members of the military, so that members of the Reserves and National Guard would be eligible. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Military Sexual Trauma (MST) is a term used by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to refer to rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment that occurs during military service. While sexual assault within the military is monitored by the Department of Defense (DoD) Sexual Assault and Prevention Response Office (SAPRO), MST is more broadly defined and is monitored within the DVA by the Military Sexual Trauma Support Team. MST may include any sexual activity performed against one's will, either through physical force, threats of negative consequences, implied promotion, promises of favored treatment, or sex without consent due to intoxication etc. Other events that may be categorized as MST may include: unwanted sexual contact, threatening, offensive remarks and unwelcome sexual advances. It is widely believed that the rates of sexual trauma are underreported in both the military and the Veterans Administration (VA),Turchik, J. & Wilson, S. Sexual assault in the military: A review of the literature and recommendations for the future. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 15, 267-277 In 2007, the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) reported rates of MST were approximately 22% among female Veterans and 1.2% among male Veterans.Kimerling R, Gima K, Smith MW, Street A, & Frayne S. (2007). The Veterans Health Administration and military sexual trauma. American Journal of Public Health, 97(12), 2160-2166. Military sexual trauma is a stronger predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder than serving in combat is. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 2527 would extend a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) program of counseling and care and services for veterans for sexual trauma that occurred during active duty or active duty for training to veterans who experienced such trauma during inactive duty training. Procedural history H.R. 2527 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 26, 2013 by Rep. Dina Titus (D, NV-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health. Debate and discussion The organization VetsFirst testified before Congress that it \\"strongly supports\\" H.R. 2527. According to VetsFirst, the legislation would expand mental health and well-being services to \\"a greater number of our brave men and women\\" so that they could have \\"timely access to quality VA health care\\" when they are dealing with a military sexual assault. The organization Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) testified before Congress that they strongly supported the bill, but pointed out a number of additional related challenges and problems that needed to be solved to improve the treatment of MST related conditions in veterans. The WWP did a study of its alumni and found that \\"almost half of the respondents indicated accessing care through VA for MST related conditions was 'Very difficult'. And of those who did not seek VA care, 41% did not know they were eligible for such care.\\" The WWP also testified that in addition to expanding access to MST care, the VA needed to improve care itself, because veterans report \\"inadequate screening, providers who were either insensitive or lacked needed expertise, and facilities ill-equipped to appropriately care for MST survivors.\\" The Servicewomen's Action Network (SWAN) fully supported the passage of the bill because it \\"only makes sense\\" that the VA close the \\"gap in protections to veterans who need counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *List of counseling topics *Military sexual trauma *Sexual assault in the United States military References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2527 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2527 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2527 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2527 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2527 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Sexual assault in the United States military ","title":"H.R. 2527 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"42812790","text":"Joseph M.

Background A native of County Laois, Bowe was Director of Capital Markets of Anglo Irish Bank Corp. PLC (known as Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited). Other positions he held include NOL Group's businesses and operations in the US, Canada and Latin America, and President of Americas of NOL Group of Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. Bowe became a number of former members of Anglo Irish Bank who were at the centre of a controversy in June 2013, concerning recorded comments they made some years previously in matters during the run-up to Ireland's economic crisis. His comments included: > If they saw the enormity of it up front, they might decide they have a > choice.

The anime were broadcast by TV Tokyo (TX Network) from 1981 to 1984, the 80's trilogy was animated by Kokusai Eiga-sha and produced by Movie International Co.Ltd. In 2014, a fourth series was announced to be in production for a 2016 release, with the original creative and production team reunited after 30 years. Shared concept Each of the anime broadcast featured a team of robot pilots variably known as \\"J9\\" whose role changed from series to series. Each was also advertised as being the \\"robot anime version\\" of another popular fictional motif. In each series, the cast of heroes were voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe, Kaneto Shiozawa, Katsuji Mori, and Y≈çko Asagami. Yu Yamamoto was head screenwriter for all three series, and Masayuki Yamamoto composed the theme songs for the trilogy, as well. Music was also an overarching motif in the series, with the eyecatch always featuring the team leader playing some sort of musical instrument (Blaster Kid and a double-neck electric guitar in Braiger, Billy the Shot and a keytar in Baxinger, and Nukiuchi Rock and a harmonica in Sasuraiger). Yu Yamamoto later revealed that he had named the series after Sony's flagship SL-J9 Betamax video player, which at the time was out of his price range. Series *: Broadcast from October 1981 to June 1982, it drew inspiration from TV Asahi's Hissatsu franchise of jidaigeki. In the year 2111, Team Cosmoranger J9, with their giant robot Braiger which transforms from a flying car, protects the Solar System from different criminal syndicates that the police cannot handle, and must stop the leader of Nubia, Khamen Khamen, from succeeding in his plans in destroying Jupiter to create 30 new planets, which as a result would destroy the Earth. *: Broadcast from July 1982 to March 1983, it drew inspiration from the popular fiction surrounding the Shinsengumi. In the year 2711 (600 years after the events of Braiger and the destruction of Jupiter), the Solar System is mostly peaceful under the Bakufu government, but it remains lawless. The J9-II team is formed to protect the peace of this new era using their giant robot Baxingar that transforms from cosmic motorcycles. *: Broadcast from April 1983 to January 1984, it drew inspiration from Around the World in Eighty Days. In the year 2911 (200 years after the events of Baxingar), a gambler makes a bet with a criminal syndicate boss that the now 50 planets of the Solar System can be each be visited within a year. He then forms the JJ9 team to travel the Solar System on a space train for the bet, fighting the syndicate's minions with their robot Sasuraiger. *: This series was planned for broadcast in 2016, and would have taken inspiration from the classic Chinese literary work Water Margin. Yu Yamamoto and Masauki Yamamoto have already written and composed the series' theme song and are currently in the process of auditioning the cast and the theme song singer. Yu Yamamoto stated that he wished to bring back \\"original anime\\", as in having no manga (or video game) to base it off of, as he believes this practice of adapting from a manga is detrimental to new screenwriters. It will also be fictionally unrelated to the original trilogy, but it will have a certain \\"J9 taste\\" to it. Characters for Jinraiger were designed by artist Kanhou Murase. Following the death of Yamamoto, the project was cancelled in 2019.

Therese was a that served with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Sainte-Th√©r√®se-de-Gasp√©, Quebec. After the war she was converted to a and served until 1967. Ste. Therese was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 18 May 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 16 October later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 May 1944 at L√©vis, Quebec. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in St. Margaret's Bay and Bermuda, Ste. Therese returned to Halifax in mid-August 1944. She left for England in October to join escort group EG 25. She remained with that group patrolling the waters around the United Kingdom until February 1945 when she was reassigned to escort group EG 28, based out of Halifax. She was Senior Officer's Ship of the group for at least the period of 14 March to 20 April 1945.Rohwer, p. 400 She returned to Canada and served locally around Halifax until the end of the war. She was paid off on 22 November 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and laid up at Shelburne in reserve. =Postwar service= Ste. Therese was chosen to undergo conversion to a Prestonian-class ocean escort as part of the need to expand the anti-submarine force within the navy. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti- submarine mortars. On 1 January 1955, Ste. Therese was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. She emerged from her conversion at Saint John to be recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy with the new pennant 309 on 22 January 1955. From 26 July to 3 September 1955, the newly recommissioned Ste. Therese was used by the Pacific Oceanographic Group to survey parts of the North Pacific Ocean as part of a joint mission between Canada, the United States and Japan. In November 1955, Ste. Therese was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California. She returned again as an oceanographic survey platform in 1957. In January 1960, Ste. Therese and three other Prestonian-class ships made a tour of South American ports, visiting San Diego, Balboa, the Galapagos Islands, Callao and Valpara√≠so, Talara and Long Beach. Ste. Therese was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Adak, Alaska, Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. She served until 1967 on the west coast when she was paid off for the final time on 30 January 1967.

Retrieved 20 May 2014. Archived here. He was a pioneer in writing the history of South Africa and later an important historian of the British Empire, though by the end of his life his work was seen as dated and Eurocentric. Early life and education Walker was born in Streatham, London on 6 September 1886 to William Walker, a mercantile clerk of Scottish descent, who worked for Union-Castle Line and Jessie n√©e Goodman. He began his education at Mill Hill School, followed by a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, from where he graduated in modern history with a first class (1908).  Career  =South Africa= Walker was employed as a lecturer at the University of Bristol for a short time, where he co-wrote a textbook for secondary schools on English history that remained in publication for a long time. In 1911, he ventured south to the newly formed Union of South Africa, where two of his uncles were already employed. He took up a lectureship at the South African College in Cape Town, subsequently the University of Cape Town, where he was soon appointed as a Professor of History at the age of 24. He introduced a first-year survey course in 1923, that was taught for sixty years. In the early 1930s, he became the dean of the arts faculty. Walker was a prolific writer and contributed to South African historiography immensely. He wrote the first historical atlas of South Africa in 1922, the first one-volume history of South Africa for the school-final examination in 1926, and in 1928, the first important general history of South Africa. The latter was reflected pro-British leanings and replaced the settler-centric historiography of George McCall Theal and George Cory to be the official textbook until the 1950s. He was also an accomplished biographer, writing the lives of Lord Henry de Villiers, the former chief justice of the Cape Colony (1925) and W.P. Schreiner (1937) in a sympathetic fashion. His history of The Great Trek (1934) was couched in the narrative of a romantic adventure and he later deemed it to be his best work. In 1930, Walker gave an influential lecture in Oxford, printed as The frontier tradition in South African history (Oxford University Press, London, 1930), in which he outlined his theory that the origins of the apartheid system in South Africa lay in conflict between blacks and whites on the frontier regions in the nineteenth century which was then imported into the interior where it was institutionalised in the constitutions of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.Trends in South African historiography and the present state of historical research Paper presented at the Nordic Africa Institute, Uppsala, Sweden, 23 September 2004 by Wessel Visser, University of Stellenbosch. Retrieved 21 May 2014. Walker's theory owed much to Frederick Jackson Turner and The Oxford History of Historical Writing described him as \\"in some respects the George Stanley of South Africa\\". His ideas in this area have since been largely rebutted. He was a captain in the Cape Garrison Artillery, but left due to cardiac ailments from lifting of heavy ammunition. =Cambridge= In 1936, Walker became the Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History at Cambridge University.\\"Easter Term at Cambridge\\" in The Times, 6 May 1936, p. 11. He continued to write, but with a wider focus than previously now that his chair enjoyed the title of \\"Imperial\\". He acted as an air-raid warden in Cambridge in World War II. By 1942, he was the only history professor still teaching at the university; most of the students and teaching staff had left for the war. In February 1944, Jan Smuts made an offer for him to return to South Africa to be the editor-in-chief of a volume of South African war history. Before Walker was able to take a decision, he suffered a mental breakdown, being treated in a mental hospital for over a year. In July 1946, Walker underwent a leucotomy and was subsequently able to resume teaching. On the whole, says Ronald Hyam, the war and his mental breakdown meant he had little impact at Cambridge. =Retirement= Walker retired in 1951, but continued to write. He produced a third edition of his history of South Africa in 1957 (retitled A History of Southern Africa) and edited the second edition of the South African volume of The Cambridge History of the British Empire, published in 1963. This last, however, was criticised for not following the latest historical methods. In 1968, Walker, and wife Lucy, returned to South Africa where he died in Durban in 1976. Personal life He had two sisters and two brothers one of whom was Graham William Walker. His nephew, through Graham, is motorsport commentator Murray Walker. Walker married Lucy Stapleton (1883‚Äì1977) in 1913 in Cape Town. They had two daughters: Jean (1914‚Äì1985) and Hilary (1919‚Äì2006). Walker had a keen interest in fishing.

The memorial, assembled by members of the local community in the months following the crash, features a cairn of granite and boulders supporting a jarrah cross. The names and details of the deceased airmen ‚àí Flying Officer Lynton Birt, Sergeant Geoffrey Debenham, Sergeant Noel Nixon, and Sergeant Kenneth Hugo ‚àí are carved into the cross. Birt was interred in the Northam Cemetery, and later reinterred in the Perth war cemetery and annex (N.A.8) while the others were buried at Karrakatta Cemetery. Over the years, the memorial was forgotten and lost, overgrown by shrubs and trees. Upon its rediscovery in the early 1980s, the memorial's history and significance were researched, and it was restored in 1984 by volunteers from the Perth branch of the Royal Australian Air Force Association. Since then, the association has held annual memorial services at the site. In 2013, the Northam RSL spent $14,700 on safety and accessibility works, funded by Lotterywest and the Northam RSL. Background On 9 October 1942, an Avro Anson aircraft (No. W2262), piloted by Sergeant Geoffrey Debenham and carrying Flying Officer Lynton Birt, Sergeant Noel Nixon, and Sergeant Kenneth Hugo, crashed near Clackline, Western Australia. The airmen, all from 68 Reserve Squadron based at Geraldton, were on a training mission, flying from Cunderdin to Pearce air force base. Partway along what should have been a routine flight, the aircraft crashed and burned, leaving no survivors, and destroying the aircraft. =Crew= Kenneth Colin (Les) Hugo was born in Perth, and attended school at Armadale. He went on to study at Perth Technical College, and then worked in the Vacuum Oil Company's Perth office. According to his father, he was a \\"lover of sport\\", enjoying cricket, football, swimming and yachting. Hugo enlisted in the air force in 1941, where he was a wireless operator air-gunner. He was 21 at the time of the crash. Lynton Vennel Howard Birt originated from Subiaco, Western Australia. He attended Hale School from 1931 to 1933, where he played cricket and football, and was \\"above average\\" academically. Following his schooling, he worked for the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, and continued to play sports, as a wing for the Old Haleians hockey club. At the outbreak of World War II, Birt enlisted in the RAAF, where he eventually became a navigator. He was 25 at the time of the crash. Noel Louis Nixon was the son of Mr. L. W. Nixon of Bundaberg, Queensland. Geoffrey Lancaster Debenham was the son of Mr. P. Debenham of Kempsey, New South Wales. Nixon was 28 and Debenham was 25 years old at the time of the crash. =Crash= The Avro Anson crashed soon after 1:00 pm, on private property leased by Mr George Edward Harvey, west of Mokine. Mrs Irene May Harvey (n√©e Marston) saw the aircraft coming in close to the ground, looking like it was going to hit her house. It passed over the building, and beyond nearby trees, before crashing approximately three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from the homestead. There was a large explosion and rising columns of smoke from that point. Mrs Harvey hurried over to the crash site, but was unable to give any assistance as the wreckage was burning fiercely and machine gun ammunition was continually cooking off. The crash was loud enough to be heard across several miles, and attracted close to fifty people within half an hour. The aircraft had crashed approximately past a tree into rising ground, in which it gouged trenches and two large holes, exposing boulders from below the surface. The wreckage ended up in front of a large tree close to a rock outcrop, the crew had been flung out of the cabin, and the rudder was found away in the branches of another tree. =Aftermath= Within an hour, the Avro Anson was reduced to a smouldering pile of material and metal. An RAAF ambulance transported the crew's bodies to the Northam morgue; two days later the Air Force Inquiry Board inspected the scene, and their salvage unit removed the wreckage. Birt's remains were interred in the Northam Cemetery's Anglican section on 11 October 1942, while Hugo's remains were interred at Perth's Karrakatta Cemetery. Debenham and Nixon were buried at Karrakatta Cemetery on 14 October 1942, following a service at St George's Cathedral at 9.30 am, conducted by the Dean of Perth, R. H. Moore. Memorial =Description= The memorial site is located on the low side of Avro Anson Road, in a small park approximately south-east of Clackline. The memorial is constructed of granite and boulders gathered nearby and formed into a cairn measuring approximately at the base, high and at the top. It is surmounted by a wooden cross approximately high. The cross is of West Australian jarrah and was made by an Australian Army Works Unit in nearby Spencers Brook. The names of the four deceased airmen and other details are carved into the cross. =Installation= The memorial was assembled by members of the local community in the months following the crash. It was dedicated and consecrated on 12 December 1942, at a ceremony conducted by Senior Chaplain Lieut.-Colonel Elvey. Afterwards, wreaths were laid by relatives, members of the armed forces, and children from the nearby Clackline School, while the RAAF and Volunteer Defence Corps provided a guard of honour. =Restoration= Over the years, the memorial was forgotten and lost, overgrown by shrubs and trees. A Shire of Northam survey team came across the memorial in the early 1980s; subsequently, the Perth branch of the Royal Australian Air Force Association (RAAFA) assisted with researching the site's history and significance. The ravages of time and the effects of an earthquake at Meckering had taken their toll, and in early 1984, a small band of volunteers (all of World War II vintage) set about the task of restoration. This work involved the rebuilding in part of the stone cairn, refurbishing and painting of the cross, the erection of a low steel post and chain fence around the memorial and the provision of a bronze plaque. The wording on the plaque reads: =Legacy= The RAAFA WA Division has held annual memorial services at the site since October 1985, on the nearest weekend to the anniversary of the accident. The Northam RSL membership keep the site clear of rubbish and inspect the memorial for damage on a yearly basis. In 2013 a meeting between RAAFA officers and Northam RSL Secretary Reg Stevens, formalised an agreement whereby control of the site was passed from the RAAFA to the Northam RSL. In 2013, under the supervision of Project Manager and Secretary Reg Stevens, the Northam sub branch of the RSL spent $14,700 on the site, funded by a $13,700 grant from Lotterywest and a $1000 contribution from the Northam RSL. The grant was administered by the Shire of Northam as land owners. The renovation works, designed to improve visitor safety and accessibility, included a concrete path and handrail, which were used and appreciated on the day of the 2013 memorial service.

Formerly, scholars generally called the tribe Laoighis or Laeighis in Irish, while they Anglicized the name as Leix (Latinized: Lagisia). Lo√≠gis is also the name of the territory in western Leinster that the tribe settled during the third century AD, and of the minor kingdom that the Lo√≠gis chieftains ruled until 1608. County Laois derives its name from Lo√≠gis, although the present county encompasses baronies that were not traditionally part of the territory of Lo√≠gis. Background The name Lo√≠gis stems from the name of the tribe's first chieftain, Laigse(a)ch, Laeighsech, or Lo√≠gsech. Historical texts render that chieftain's full name variously as Lugaid Laigsech; Lugaid Lo√≠gsech Cennm√°r; Lugaid Laigseach, and Laigsech Ceandmar. One nineteenth-century analysis says that Laeighsech Cenn-mor and Lugaidh Laeighsech were actually two distinct individuals, the former being the father of the latter. Laeighsech Cenn-mor, who was a son of the famed Conall Cernach, would according to that account be the father of the tribe's eponymous ancestor, Lugaidh Laeighsech. A twelfth or thirteenth century gloss on the tribe's name says that Lo√≠gsech comes from '. The word ', literally 'calf or fawn', has the figurative meaning of 'favorite or darling', while ' means 'more than; above or beyond'. Before migrating to Leinster, the Lo√≠gis belonged to the northeastern Irish D√°l nAraidi, a confederation of tribes that claimed descent from the eponymous ancestor Fiachu Araide (Fachtna Araide). The D√°l nAraidi were part of the Cruthin, a people whose name is considered to be related etymologically to that of the Picts, although current scholarship questions whether there was any cultural or linguistic relationship between the Irish Cruthin and Scottish Picts. The Lo√≠gis tribe received their territory from the king of Leinster in reward for contributing troops to expel a Munster occupation of western Leinster. A record of that campaign appears in Keating's early-seventeenth-century Foras Feasa ar √âirinn (The History of Ireland). Another early seventeenth-century account of the campaign is contained in McGeoghegan's translation of The Annals of Clonmacnoise. The campaign has provisionally been dated to the third century AD. Although the Lo√≠gis were originally from Ulster in the north, Lugaidh Laeighsech led his tribe into the southern conflict at the request of his foster father, Eochaid Find Fuath nAirt ('Eochaid the Fair, Art's Abhorrence'). Initially, the king of Leinster, Cu Corb, had sought military aid from Eochaid, whose nephew, Art mac Cuinn, the High King of Ireland, had shortly before exiled Eochaid. According to one source, the High King banished his uncle for sneaking a human head into Tara to desecrate a royal feast. Another account says that Art exiled Eochaid for killing Art's brothers, Connla and Crionna, leaving their only surviving brother with the name Art √ìenfer ('Art, the Solitary'). Regardless of why he left Meath, Eochaid brought his forster son (dalta) Lugaidh Laeighsech into the alliance with Leinster's king, who consequently granted the Lo√≠gis tribe the territory in western Leinster that the allies recaptured from Munster. For his own part in that campaign Eochaid similarly won for the Fothart tribe, which was named after him, territories in what are now Counties Kildare, Wicklow, and Carlow. As compensation for expelling the Munster men from Leinster, the Lo√≠gis tribe received not only the territory that came to bear their name, but also certain hereditary rights that the king of Leinster bestowed on the tribe's chieftains, who were from that point recognized as kings of Lo√≠gis (r√≠g La√≠chsi/ r√≠ La√≠[gh]si) in their own right. Many of the Lo√≠gis king's rights acknowledged that there were seven Lo√≠gis of Leinster ('). Those seven were what early seventeenth-century English records would later call the seven septs of Leix. The king of Leinster covenanted, for example, to retain in his employ seven of the followers of the king of Lo√≠gis, while the latter agreed to provide seven oxen and to maintain seven score of warriors to fight for the king of Leinster. English etymologists since the eighteenth century have held that the word sept, which specifically applies to the Irish clan structure, is derived from the Latin ', meaning literally 'a hedge or fence' and figuratively 'a division'. One nineteenth-century scholar of Irish history, however, suggested that sept might alternatively have derived from the Latin ', 'seven', and argued that the number seven had particular relevance to peoples of Cruthin or Pictish origin, like the Lo√≠gis, who invariably divided their tribes into seven parts. The Lo√≠gis maintained such a seven-part division until English authorities transplanted the tribe to Kerry in 1608. The Lo√≠gis had already been identified with the number seven in a poem attributed to Mael Mura of Othain (fl. ninth century), which was perhaps the earliest texts that mentioned the tribe. Nevertheless, no text explicitly named the seven septs before 1607, when they were identified as the \\"Moores and their followers, the Kellies, Lalors, Clanmelaughlins, Clandebojes, Dorans, and Dolins\\". That appeared in a report to the Privy Council, where Arthur Chichester (1563-1625), the Lord Deputy of Ireland, said that chronic rebellions throughout the island had been inspired primarily by the seven septs of Queen's County. Among the seven, the Moore sept claimed an uninterrupted succession to the chieftainship of Lo√≠gis since the reign of Lugaidh Laeighsech, although they only assumed the surname Moore around the eleventh century. The Annals of the Four Masters record in 1018 the killing of Cernach Ua M√≥rdha, meaning Cernach, grandson of Mordha, from which derives the surname O'More, or Moore. The pedigree of the kings of Lo√≠gis (Genelach Rig Laigsi) in the Book of Leinster says that Cernach was the son of Ceinneidigh, who was the son of Morda [\\"Cernaig m Ceinneidig m Morda\\"]. It was not until the nineteenth century that all of the seven Lo√≠gis septs were definitively identified with a fixed group of surnames, which were the \\"O'Mores, O'Kellys, O'Lalors, O'Devoys or O'Deevys, Macavoys, O'Dorans, and O'Dowlings\\". With the exception of the O'Devoys or O'Deevys and the Macavoys, Chichester's 1607 report named the other five septs. In a 1608 agreement with the English, the sept leaders relinquished their hereditary landholdings in Queen's County in exchange for new grants in County Kerry. Only six groupings of families signed that agreement, namely the \\"Moores, the Kellies, the Lalours, the Dorans, the Clandeboys, and the Dowlins\\". Clandeboys and Clandebojes, was a variant form of the Macavoy/McEvoy sept name. The agreement does not mention any representatives of the O'Devoy/Deevy sept.

Currently under private ownership, the pier is now a tourist attraction with gift shops, tourist attractions, and restaurants. History The pier was originally built for the John B. Agen Company. It was built in 1902 by the Miller and Geske Construction Company and repeatedly modified over the course of the next decade. In 1909, the pier passed into the hands of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, the last of four transcontinental railroads to reach Seattle. The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul was commonly known as the \\"Milwaukee Road,\\" so the pier became known as the \\"Milwaukee Pier.\\" It soon became the terminal for the McCormick Steamship Line, the Munson McCormick Line and Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and by the mid-1930s was also known as the \\"McCormick Terminal.\\" In the 1950s, at least part of the pier was used for fish processing.

Miners Landing on Pier 57 Seattle businessman and waterfront developer Hal Griffith has envisioned a Ferris wheel on Elliott Bay for nearly 30 years. Along with his family, he is the owner of the Pier 57 upon which the Seattle Great Wheel is located. In addition to the wheel, the pier is the location of Miner's Landing, which consists of souvenir gift shops, tourist attractions, and variety of seafood restaurants. During the 1980s, Griffith began developing plans to ensure the perpetual existence and success of the family's business ventures on the pier. His plans had long included continual development of the waterfront on Puget Sound to provide entertainment and recreational opportunities for tourists and local residents. His goal was to drive success through innovative ideas, staying a step ahead of the competition. Griffith often met logistical and political roadblocks that inhibited development on the waterfront, but he was determined to build the Ferris wheel on Pier 57, located adjacent to the Alaskan Way Viaduct. While Griffith applied for building permits in November 2010, the project took approximately three years to complete. General work outside of actual building included retrofitting the pilings that support the pier. In June 2012, the Seattle Great Wheel opened. The 175 foot Ferris wheel has 42 climate- controlled gondolas, each holding up to six passengers. During development and acquisition of the wheel, the State of Washington, King County, the City of Seattle, and the Port of Seattle solidified plans to dig a tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which had been damaged in an earthquake in 2001. The plans included creating a tunnel that would run beneath the city's downtown core. The initial phase of demolition and removal of the viaduct began on October 21, 2011. Griffith was concerned that without a large tourist attraction, many waterfront businesses would suffer and go out of business during construction. The Seattle Great Wheel was designed to resolve these issues and draw visitors to the waterfront.

The film was written by Arnold Drake and Leon Tokatyan. Plot Norah Dain (Juliet Prowse), a nightclub disc jockey and aspiring actress living alone in a Manhattan apartment, receives a series of obscene phone calls from someone who seems to be watching her on a daily basis. She also finds a decapitated teddy bear in her apartment. At first it is not clear to either the viewer or Norah who is making the calls. A police detective, Lt. Dave Madden (Jan Murray), whose own wife was raped and murdered, takes a personal interest in Norah and her case. Lt. Madden engages in suspicious behavior such as suggesting to Norah several times that he himself could be the caller, secretly tape recording his discussions with Norah, listening to tapes of Norah and other women talking about obscene phone calls, and obsessively studying pornography and the behavior of sex perverts, despite the fact that he is exposing his ten-year-old daughter to such adult concepts and he is being reported to his superiors at work. However, midway through the film, it is revealed to the audience (but not to Norah) that the obscene caller is actually Lawrence Sherman (Sal Mineo), a waiter at the nightclub where Norah works. Lawrence lives with and cares for his 19-year-old sister Edie (Margot Bennett), who is brain damaged and has the mind of a child. Edie's brain damage is apparently the result of an accident when she was a little girl and saw her older brother, Lawrence, having sex with an unidentified older woman (possibly their mother, although this is not made clear); she ran away in horror or fear and fell down the stairs. Lawrence is unable to have a normal romantic or sexual relationship due to his guilt over the accident and his duty to look after Edie following the death of their parents. He is also frustrated when Edie dresses up in an adult dress, high heels and makeup and seems to make advances towards him. He tries to get rid of his frustration by visiting adult bookstores and movies in Times Square, but still is obsessed with watching and calling Norah. Despite Lt. Madden's warnings that the caller might be someone Norah knows, Norah never suspects Lawrence until it is too late. Instead she is friendly to him and even attracted to him, complimenting him on his body when they meet at the gym, and offering to stay late after work to teach him to dance. Marian Freeman (Elaine Stritch), the older, experienced manager of the nightclub where Norah works, also takes a personal interest in Norah and tries to advise and protect her. She offers to spend the night with Norah at her apartment so Norah will not be alone and afraid. While Marian is visiting, Norah receives yet another telephone call and starts to cry. Marian consoles her, but Norah senses that Marian is actually making a lesbian pass at her and, revolted, asks her to leave the apartment immediately. Marian leaves in a huff, still wearing Norah's coat, which she had been using as a bathrobe. Lawrence, who is outside, sees Marian leaving in Norah's coat, and mistaking her for Norah, chases after her and kills her. Lawrence finally attacks Norah after closing time in the empty nightclub and violently rapes her, but does not kill her. Lt. Madden, who has just figured out that Lawrence was watching Norah through the reflection of a mirror, arrives too late to save Norah from the rape. He beats Lawrence and then, inexplicably, lets him leave the club. Lawrence runs through traffic in Times Square imagining that he is running through Central Park towards a welcoming Norah. Police officers chase him and ultimately gun him down as the film ends. Cast * Sal Mineo as Lawrence Sherman * Juliet Prowse as Norah Dain * Elaine Stritch as Marian Freeman * Jan Murray as Lt.

Reception Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one and a half out of four stars, calling it \\"sleazy\\", and \\"a waste of talent\\". It has gone on to develop a cult status among film students for its exploration of voyeurism, pornography as instigator of sex crimes, arson, masturbation, child abuse, transvestism, loneliness, and lesbianism in a time when American and British films usually kept these concerns at a sanitary distance.

It is owned and run by businessman and crime lord Morgan Edge. Fictional history Galaxy Communications is one of the world's leading telecommunications companies and a major economic engine of both Metropolis and the United States. It has a broadband division that supplies Americans with digital television, internet and phone services, and also produces several periodicals and books through its subsidiary Galaxy Publishing. Originally spearheaded by Morgan Edge, an article by Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent revealed that Edge was also in command of Intergang, one of Metropolis's most notorious criminal organizations. This eventually led to Morgan's father Vincent Edge taking over Galaxy Communication. However, he too was ousted from the corporation, as it was exposed that he continuously made Cat Grant the victim of repeated sexual harassment. Galaxy Communications shares a loose alliance with the Daily Planet, as they are two of the leading centers for truth and accuracy throughout the city's media. They are aggressively opposed by LexCorp, which operates WLEX-TV, a major television station in Metropolis; and LexCom, an internet site that serves as a digital news center. As it is offered over the internet, LexCom has a great access to mainstream America, minus the costs of publishing. LexCorp's owner, Lex Luthor, manipulates nearly two-thirds of Metropolis business. Galaxy Communications stands as the leading major media empire which provides the citizens of Metropolis with information and entertainment. WGBS-TV, flagship station of the Galaxy Broadcasting System (GBS) television network, both subsidiaries of media conglomerate Galaxy Communications.Superman (volume 1) No. 233, January 1971 Popular shows included The Midnight Show Starring Johnny Nevada (a fictional version of NBC's The Tonight Show, with Johnny Nevada being an analogue of Johnny Carson).Action Comics No. 442, December 1974 There was a real-life WGBS-TV, in Philadelphia from 1985 to 1995; the call letters stood for Grant Broadcasting System, the original owners. The call letters were changed in 1995 to the current WPSG, after acquisition by the Paramount Stations Group and conversion into a UPN outlet; it is currently an affiliate of The CW and is owned by CBS Television Stations. Between the early 1970s and mid-1980s, both Clark Kent and Lois Lane worked for WGBS after Galaxy Communications purchased the Daily Planet in a 1971 storyline, with Clark as the anchorman for the WGBS evening news.Superman (volume 1) No. 317, November 1977 He was eventually joined by Lana Lang as a co-anchor. After John Byrne's revamp of Superman's origins, though, Clark and Lois were reverted to working at the Daily Planet once again. Galaxy Broadcasting and WGBS-TV still exist post-Crisis, however, and are usually used in any story where a television station or network is needed or shown. Post-Crisis, Clark, Lois and Lana never worked for the station. During the 1990s however, both Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant did work there. =The New 52= With the reboot of DC's line of comics in 2011, the Daily Planet was shown in the Superman comics as being bought by Morgan Edge and merged with the Galaxy Broadcasting System, similar to the Silver/Bronze Age continuity.Superman (vol. 3) No. 1 (September 2011) In Action Comics, it is revealed that in the new history/universe, Clark Kent begins his journalism career in Metropolis roughly six years before Galaxy Broadcasting merges with the Daily Planet. Along with being a writer for the Daily Star, partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of everyday citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the Star, Clark meets Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lane's work at the Daily Planet, eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves the Daily Star on good terms and accepts a position at the Daily Planet. After the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the \\"Superman beat.\\" But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the Daily Planet is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clark's friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.

The female protagonist, Genie (played by actress Melinda Cordell, credited here as Melinda Plank), a talented ballet dancer, is made pregnant out of wedlock by her underachieving boyfriend, Brian (played by Robert Hogan (actor)), a would- be novelist. Rather than leave him in order to take up a professional dancing role she has been offered which involves touring, Genie stays in the flat they share, but Brian, after the damning rejection of his novel by a publisher upon whose patronage he was depending, absents himself for several days with an ex- girlfriend, Anne (played by Sunja Svensen), a society woman several years older who inhabits the periphery of bohemia, sometimes in the company of a genial young advertising copywriter, George (played by James Cresson). Not aware that Genie is pregnant, Brian has made their marriage conditional upon his success as a writer. Genie fears that Brian, who is emotionally immature (something noted by the publishers in their dismissal of his submitted novel), will reject her out of hand on learning about her pregnancy. One possible solution is for Genie to visit an illegal abortionist, having sold her late mother's brooch to raise the cash. Meanwhile, Brian is informally mentored in the ways of the world by a more cynical and experienced bohemian, Norman (played by James Frawley), and tempted into the world of Madison Avenue by George, with whom he has struck up a friendship. While away in the Berkshires with Anne, whose advances he gently shuns, Brian, still unaware of Genie's true condition, comes to the realisation that he loves and wants to marry her. He hurriedly returns to Greenwich Village, but Genie proves difficult to trace there. The film was shot on location in Greenwich Village and The Berkshires, including a nude swimming scene filmed on Lake Garfield, Massachusetts. According to the director, the sounds of motorboat engines in this sequence threatened to take over the scene's audio and were replaced in the final soundtrack by pre-recorded crickets. The director himself had earlier worked as second assistant director on Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (1960), while cinematographer Baird Bryant later worked as uncredited assistant to L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs on Easy Rider (1969), in which he was responsible for filming the LSD trip sequence in the cemetery in New Orleans.

The Committee was involved in making recommendations regarding matching military certifications and equivalent civilian certifications so that veterans can smoothly shift into civilian life. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would reestablish the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through December 31, 2019. (The Committee terminated on December 31, 2006.) Under the new legislation, the committee would not terminate until December 31, 2019. Procedural history H.R. 2942 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on August 1, 2013 by Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D, AZ-1). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. Debate and discussion The Department of Veterans Affairs supported the legislation. According to the VA's representatives who testified before Congress, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would \\"be able to receive recommendations and seek advice from the Committee with regard to licensing and certification programs\\" if the Committee were reestablished. The American Legion strongly supported the bill, arguing that the legislation would \\"benefit service members, as well as those who eventually employ veterans in civilian work- force easing the placement of qualified veterans in civilian careers, and matching civilian employers with skilled veteran employees.\\" The American Legion argued that this committee was important to the process of matching military certifications with their corresponding civilian ones, smoothing that transition for veterans, and that the committee provided much needed expertise on these matters to the VA. The American Legion said that \\"there is a definite need to resume this independent body with expertise in matters relating to licensing and credentialing which can present new solutions to VA's senior leadership and congressional members as well as other stakeholders.\\" The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) also supported the bill, calling the advisory committee \\"critical\\" and very important \\"at a time when the Department of Labor anticipates a significant influx of veterans into the civilian workforce.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2942 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2942 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2942 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2942 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2942 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Veterans' affairs in the United States Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs ","title":"H.R. 2942 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"42813241","text":"Strangers in the City is a 1962 feature film written, photographed, edited and directed by Rick Carrier.

Origins and rise  Baha al-Din Sam II was the son of Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Masud and an unnamed sister of his relative Sultan Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad. Baha al-Din also had an older half-brother named Abbas ibn Muhammad, whose mother was Turkic. In 1192, their father died, and Abbas shortly ascended the throne. However, Ghiyath al-Din and his brother Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad shortly deposed Abbas, and replaced him with Baha al- Din.  Reign  Shortly after his ascension, Baha al-Din became famous among his subjects, and patronized many scholars such as the prominent Iranian philosopher Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi. In 1198, Baha al-Din wrested Balkh from Kara-Khitan control after the death of its governor. During the same year, war broke out between the Ghurids and the Khwarazmian dynasty, which was supported by their suzerain Kara-Khitans; the Khwarazmians attacked Herat, while the Kara-Khitans invaded Guzgan, and demanded tribute from Baha al-Din. However, the Ghurids shortly managed to inflict a heavy defeat on the two empires, and then used the opportunity to conquer Marv, Sarakhs, Nasa, Abiward, Tus, and Nishapur. Several Ghurid princes were shortly appointed as the governor of the cities, which included a nephew of Baha al-Din's grandfather Fakhr al-Din Masud, Taj al-Din Zangi. In 1202, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad died of illness, and was succeeded by his brother Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad as the head of the Ghurid dynasty. Shortly after Ghiyath's death, however, the Khwarazmian-shah Muhammad II invaded the Ghurid Empire, and besieged Herat. Mu'izz, along with his general Husain ibn Kharmil, quickly managed to Muhammad from Herat and then pursued him to Khwarezm, where the Ghurid army besieged the Khwarazmian capital of Gurganj. However, the Ghurids were shortly forced to retreat back to Ghur, but suffered a heavy defeat during the defeat. After Mu'izz's return to Ghur, he, along with Baha al-Din prepared a new Ghurid expedition into Khwarezm. During the same period, a Ghurid prince named Ala al-Din Atsiz married a daughter of Baha al-Din. However, Mu'izz al-Din was soon assassinated in 1206, which resulted in a civil war; Baha al-Din Sam was supported by the native Iranian soldiers, while the Turkic ghulams supported Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad's son Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud. Baha al-Din Sam II, however, died a few days later of illness, and was succeeded by his son Jalal al-Din Ali, who, along with his brother Ala al-Din Muhammad, were supported by their father's supporters.

Research has revealed remains of important buildings, which have since been preserved and made visible in the Archaeological Park. It was declared a National Monument on June 3, 1931, and is now considered cultural heritage under the official denomination Bien de Inter√©s Cultural which comes with extensive legal protections.Ministry of Public Instruction and Fine Arts.

BOE. 12/12/2001; (297): 46.808-9. Although the city is in ruins, its state of conservation is more than acceptable in comparison with remains elsewhere in the peninsula. A tour of the site offers an idea of what life was like in ancient cities.  Toponymy  Celtiberian language. Places with place names in -briga The name Seg√≥briga originates from two terms of the Celtiberian language, an extinct subset of the Indo-European Celtic branch. Sego- means victory, and this prefix also present in the name of the cities Segovia, Segorbe, Segeda and Segontia; and the suffix -briga, may broadly mean city or fortress. This suffix appears in other toponyms from the Celtiberian region, for example, Juliobriga.https://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.htmlhttps://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.pdf The name's translation would be something approximating \\"Victory City\\" or \\"Triumphant Fortress\\". History Plan of the main buildings In the year 1888, a collective burial ground from the Bronze Age (more precisely, 2nd millennium BC) was found in a cave. The cave is known as cueva de Seg√≥briga, near the cerro de Cabeza de Griego, and it was excavated in limestone. The tombs belonged to a celtiberian settlement. This finding was published in the year 1893. Both human remains and common tools and supplies were discovered. It is hypothesised that it was initially a celtiberian castro (fortress) that dominated the basin located north of the city, with the defensive advantage of the Cig√ºela river which served as a moat. Remains of the fortress have not appeared, but a ceramics fragment from 5th century BC Attica provides testimony of the area being populated that much earlier. The first recorded mention of Seg√≥briga is a brief reference by Greek geographer Strabo,Strabo, Geography, 3.iv.13 stating that Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius fought in the Wars of Sertorius, in the Celtiberian region around B√≠lbilis and Seg√≥briga. This places the city right in the middle of Celtiberian territory. This ancient area belonging to the Olcade tribe was thus pillaged in the aforementioned wars and replaced by Roman Seg√≥briga. It is thanks to some 3rd and 2nd century BC texts that we know to call the inhabitants of the area towards the Cuenca mountain chains Olcades, those approaching La Alcarria and the province of Guadalajara, Lusones, and toward Toledo, Carpetani. Therefore, the inhabitants of the area and the old city would be Olcades or Carpetani. 7 km away there isVillas Viejas, an archaeological site associated with the Contrebia Carbica, a Carpetani city. Writing in the first century AD, Sextus Julius Frontinus mentions Seg√≥briga twice.Frontinus, Strategemata, 3.10.6, 3.11.4 He describes the attack by the Lusitanian Viriathus against Seg√≥briga (146 BC) which was allied to Rome: 1) \\"Viriathus, arranging his troops in ambush, sent a few to steal cattle from the Segobrigenses; they like to go in large numbers to punish, they ran, fleeing ...\\" 2) \\"Viriathus turned back and ran into unsuspecting Segobrigenses, when most were busy at their sacrifice\\". Pliny the Elder Pliny the Elder, Natural History, xxxvi.160. mentions the exploitation of lapis specularis, a variety of translucent gypsum much appreciated at the time for the manufacture of window glass and an important part of the Segobriga economy. This material was mined in \\"100,000 places around Seg√≥briga\\" and Pliny assures us that \\"the most translucent of this stone is obtained near the city of Seg√≥briga and extracted from deep wells\\". Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, in section 3.24, lists the towns belonging to the Caesaraugustan Conventus, among which they appear the Ercavicenses (of the city of Ercavica, neighbors of the Segobrigans). Later he defines Seg√≥briga and its area as caput Celtiberiae ('head of Celtiberia'), Pliny the Elder, Natural History, iii.25. which reached to Clunia (finis celtiberiae), following a geographical order from the South to the North, which suggests, together with the previous data, that the Seg√≥briga zone was the boundary between the Celtiberians and the Carpetanis. He also indicates that Seg√≥briga was a stipendiary (tributary) city of that Conventus. Later, in book 36 of his Naturalis Historia Pliny mentions the exploitation of lapis specularis, Pliny the Elder, Natural History, xxxvi.160. Translation: The stones described above are allowed to cut with the saw; but the specular stone, because it also receives the name of stone, given its much more treatable constitution, is split and separated into thin sheets as desired. Formerly it was only in the Hispania Citerior, and not in the whole province, but only in the area of one hundred thousand steps around the city of Seg√≥briga a variety of translucent specular gypsum that was very popular at the time for the manufacture of window glass and that would be for a long time an important part of Seg√≥briga's economy. This mineral was extracted from mines found in \\"100,000 steps around Seg√≥briga,\\" and Pliny assures us that \\"the most translucent of this stone is obtained in the Hispania Citerior, near the city of Seg√≥briga and extracted of deep wells. One of these mines can be found in the nearby village of Carrascosa del Campo, which also had a manufacturing and mining enclave in service in this municipality. Amphitheater of Seg√≥briga, 75m long and of an irregular elliptic shape, is the biggest monument of Seg√≥briga and had capacity for 5,500. Agrippina the Elder in Seg√≥briga As of the Segobriga mint. After its Roman conquest at the beginning of 2nd BC, in the Celtiberian Wars, Seg√≥briga had to become an oppidum or Celtiberian city. After the wars of Sertorius, among 80s and 72 BC, it became the center of all that part of the Meseta Central, with the control of a large territory. In the time of Augustus, around year 12 BC, ceased to be a stipendiary city, which paid tribute to Rome, and became municipium, city ruled by Roman citizens, increasing the status of the city notably, which led to its economic boom and a large program of monumental constructions that must have ended in flavian epoch, towards 80, to which public leisure buildings and the wall that can be admired today. The city was an important communications center. From this time is also the issue of currency in its mint and the construction of a part of the wall. At the end of the mandate of Vespasian the city was at its highest point, having completed the works of the theater and amphitheater, and being fully integrated socially and economically in the Roman Empire. Archaeological findings indicate that in the 3rd century there still existed in Seg√≥briga important elites who lived in the city, but in the 4th century are already abandoned their main monuments, proof of its inexorable decline and its progressive conversion in a rural center. At the Visigoth time, as of the 5th century, it still had to be an important city, since remains of several basilicas and an extensive necropolis are known (according to findings of 1760 - 1790), its bishops arriving to attend various Councils of Toledo, specifically to the Third Council of Toledo in year 589, and the Sixteenth Council of Toledo in 693. Its definitive depopulation had to begin after the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, when its bishops and governing elites fled towards the north, looking for the shelter of the Christian kingdoms, as it is known that it happened in the neighboring city of Ercavica (Ca√±averuelas, Province of Cuenca). From these dates are the remains of a Muslim fortification that occupies the summit of the hill. After the Reconquista, the population of the contours moved to the current town of Saelices, located 3 km further north, next to the fountain that nourished the aqueduct that had supplied the ancient city of Seg√≥briga. Forgotten and to its name, the hill that it occupied happened to be denominated \\"Cabeza del Griego\\", with a small rural population dependent on the town of Ucl√©s, located to only 10 km, coming to use ashlars extracted of the ruins for the construction of its convent-fortress. Since then its gradual abandonment was accentuated until only the small hermitage built on the ancient Monumental Baths remained, the last testimony of the ancient city preserved until the present time.  Conservation  The landscape of the Archaeological Park of Seg√≥briga is threatened by the upcoming construction of a wind farm nearby, promoted by the company Energ√≠as E√≥licas de Cuenca. The deposit will be altered with the installation of 14 wind turbines of 121 meters in height that will also affect the Historic Site of Ucl√©s.El tesoro de Seg√≥briga, recuerdos del esplendor romano en tierras de Cuenca, 20 minutes (November 17, 2016).

Its source was Byzantine law and it was written in Old Church Slavonic in the late ninth or early tenth century.Ludwig Burgmann, \\"Zakon Sudnyj Ljudem\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (Oxford, 1991 [online 2005]). In the all-Slavic legal tradition this legal monument is considered to be the first actually Slavic, but in the Bulgarian legal tradition it is preceded by the so-called Krum's laws. The oldest (short) version contains thirty chapters primarily of penal law adapted from the Ecloga. Parts of this version are word-for-word translation of the source. The place of origin of the Zak√≥n S√∫dnyi Li√∫dem is a topic of controversy. It has been assigned to Great Moravia, the First Bulgarian Empire or Macedonia. On the basis of Frankish and Bavarian legal patterns in the text, the Slovenian legal historian Sergij Vilfan suggested the late 9th century Principality of Lower Pannonia as a likely place of origin, as part of the state-building process initiated by prince Kocel;Sergij Vilfan, Pravna zgodovina Slovencev (Ljubljana, 1996), p. 118 the plausibility of this thesis has been recently supported by historian Peter ≈†tih.Peter ≈†tih & al, Slovenska zgodovina (Ljubljana, 2016), p. 79 Its English translators, Dewey and Kleimola, prefer the Moravian theory. Despite its origins, all surviving manuscripts come from Russia. The text itself seems to have reached Russia before the end of the tenth century. It was widely copied in Russia and has some influence on Russian law, but outside of Russia it was forgotten.

Snider, 502 F.2d 645 (1972) was a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It was a consolidation of two separate cases: the first was a conviction for violation of 26 U.S.C. ¬ß7205, which prohibits submitting fraudulent tax information to an employer. The second was a conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß401, which prohibits \\"misbehavior ... as to obstruct the administration of justice.\\" On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the tax form was so clearly incorrect that it could not be considered an actual attempt to defraud the federal government. Thus the specific intent to violate this law was absent, and so no conviction would stand. As to the contempt charges, the court found that the appellants' actions did not obstruct the administration of justice, and so they had not violated that statue either. The court specifically declined to address the appellants' First Amendment arguments.  Background  Lyle and Sue Snider were Quakers living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In May 1972, Lyle Snider submitted a W-4 form to his employer. This form is kept by the employer and used to determine an estimate of how much to withhold in federal income taxes. In the box for the total number of allowances he wished to take, he wrote \\"3 billion.\\" He enclosed a letter with the form, which read: Lyle's employer forwarded the form and letter to the Internal Revenue Service, which launched an investigation. The IRS concluded that Snider could only claim four (for his four children), and so the form had been fraudulent. This led to Lyle's arrest on December 15, 1972. During Lyle's trial in June 1973, the Sniders refused to rise when the judge entered or exited the courtroom, as is traditional in most U.S. courts. The judge cited both of the Sniders for contempt of court. The jury ultimately convicted Lyle Snider of submitting fraudulent tax documents to his employer. The judge imposed a sentence of eight months' imprisonment for this charge, and an additional 30 days for contempt. Sue Snider was sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment for contempt, which was suspended for two years. They appealed their convictions, and the cases were consolidated, meaning they were heard as one case for appeal purposes.  Opinion of the court  = Majority =  Fraudulent tax documents  The court first addressed Snider's argument as to the interpretation of the wording of the statute, which prohibits \\"false or fraudulent\\" statements. The trial judge instructed the jury that a \\"false\\" statement is one that is both incorrect and known to be incorrect at the time that it was made. A \\"fraudulent\\" statement, he said, was one that was false and made with an intent to deceive. The Sniders argued in their appeal, on the other hand, that the word \\"false\\" should include the intent to deceive, or in the alternative, that \\"false or fraudulent\\" meant \\"false and fraudulent.\\" The majority explored Congress's intent in passing the law, and also looked at other examples of the phrase \\"false or fraudulent\\" in other areas of law. While the general, dictionary definition of \\"false\\" does not include the intention to deceive, courts in the past have interpreted that word to have an element of intent in it.For example, the Bankruptcy Code prohibits making \\"false\\" statements, and courts have viewed this use of the word as being more than simply \\"untrue.\\" The majority also concluded that since showing civil tax fraud via \\"false\\" statements made on an income tax return requires more than simply showing the information on the return to be wrong, the \\"false and fraudulent\\" language under which Snider was charged must require an element of intent. The majority's opinion also looked at the meaning of the phrase \\"false or fraudulent\\" itself: The end result was that the government must prove an intent to defraud the tax system, not merely that Snider made an untrue statement. The majority then concluded that Snider's claiming three billion adjustments was so clearly outside the realm of possibility that there was no way a jury could conclude that he intended to deceive his employer or the IRS into giving him credit for three billion adjustments.  Contempt  As to the contempt charges, the court first explained that the purposes of contempt are to ensure the smooth operation of court proceedings, and to protect the dignity of the court system. The majority cautioned, however, \\"against [judges'] confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.\\" In other words, there must be some \\"material obstruction\\" to the court's duties that is to be prevented. Even if refusing to stand is a distraction to others in the court room, \\"we think the fault may better be resolved by compelling silence and attention than by coercing a gesture of respect.\\" While declining to address the Sniders' argument that their contempt conviction violated the Free Exercise Clause, the court did suggest that a rule that refusing to stand was automatically contempt would violate citizens' rights to freedom of expression. The court quoted an earlier Supreme Court case finding that a school system could not force students to salute the American flag:W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, . Thus the Sniders' action did not fall within the meaning of contempt as described by the law under which they were charged, and so their convictions were dismissed. = Dissent = Judge H. Emory Widener wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he disagreed with the majority's conclusions as to both issues. He decried the majority's ruling as \\"fl[ying] in the face of precedent, undermin[ing] statutory law required for the administration of a voluntary tax system, and in its reversal of the contempt charges, impair[ing] the administration of justice.\\"  Fraudulent tax filing  Judge Widener noted that the tax system in the United States is largely voluntary, and that the majority's ruling would allow those with political disagreements to escape prosecution for tax fraud: He went on to cite cases from other circuits which had concluded that, since the crime under which Snider was charged was a misdemeanor, it was not necessary for the government to show an intent to defraud in order to secure a conviction. He concluded then that the trial judge had properly instructed the jury in the meaning of the \\"false or fraudulent\\" language. He criticized the majority's opinion for allowing political views to serve as an excuse for violating the law.  Contempt  Here, Judge Widener began by noting the trial judge's findings that there was a great deal of protest surrounding the Sniders' trial, and that the Sniders' refusal to stand was indeed disruptive. He criticized the majority's ruling as actually allowing an encroachment of the Sniders' religious beliefs and declared that \\"[s]uch a ruling simply adds another crack in Mr. Jefferson's wall.\\" In other words, \\"the Sniders had no more business regulating affairs in the courthouse than the judge would have had regulating affairs in the meeting house.\\" = Subsequent proceedings = As is standard practice, the case was first heard by a three-judge panel. One of the judges on the court requested that a vote be taken as to whether or not to grant a hearing en banc, which would mean that all sitting judges would re-hear the case. A majority voted against doing so, with Judges Widener (who wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, see above), Field, and Russell voting for a rehearing and joining in a brief dissenting opinion as to the decision not to re-hear, written by Judge Field. Judge Field largely stated his support for Judge Widener's earlier dissent, and argued that the majority's opinion allowed Snider to have the best of both worlds: \\"to disobey, yet to be absolved of punishment for disobedience.\\" He also added that the majority's decision regarding the contempt charge undercut the authority of \\"already beleaguered district judges\\" who must see to day-to-day trial administration, and who \\"do not live in the sterile and sometimes unrealistic environment of the appellate ivory tower.\\"  References   External links  # Full text of the opinion from Justia.

In the Portugui vineyards part of an extensive Celtiberian cemetery has been excavated, with incineration graves of the 3rd-2nd century BC. Sections of the aqueduct can be seen cut into tunnels in the solid rock on the edge of the ancient city. Finds are numerous and significant and are displayed in the Soria Celtiberian Museum and the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid. They include sculptures, Roman capitals, iron weapons, including inscriptions, republican and imperial coins, ceramics, glass objects, and a set of horse bronzes. There is also a modest museum, open only in the summer months, about 2 kilometers from the old fort along the N-122.

Born into a family long associated with London merchant circles, Barne accumulated sufficient wealth to purchase an estate in Suffolk and became prominent amongst local freeman. Dunwich in Suffolk, his constituency, was a pocket borough, controlled by the Downing land-owning family; Barne, the local Vanneck family and the freemen of the borough slowly ousted the Downings' influence and Barne established himself as one of the town's new members, which gave his family the seat until it was abolished in the 1832 Reforms. Early life Born in October 1718, Barne was the only son of Miles Barne, a London merchant and a Director of the East India Company who was the great-grandson of the MP Sir William Barne. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Solomon Snowdon, of York.Sedgwick (1970a) Sotterley Hall, the home which Barne purchased in 1744. Member of Parliament The family had long been merchants in London and Miles Barne had accumulated enough funds to purchase a country estate in Suffolk which he did, in 1744, buying lands at Sotterley in that county;Sedgwick (1970a) his 1745 marriage to the heiress of Nathaniel Elwick also secured him an inheritance in Kent, should he have issue.Hasted (1797), p. 274 Meanwhile, the \\"Rotten Borough\\" of Dunwich in Suffolk was effectively under the control of the local land-owner (see Pocket Borough), Sir George Downing, 3rd Bt., who attempted to have returned to Parliament his cousin and heir, Sir Jacob Downing, 4th Bt., as the second Member of Parliament for the seat; however, the local freemen disagreed and they asked Miles Barne, who had recently purchased his estate, to stand at the next election as their representative.Sedgwick (1970a) He was returned in 1747 along with Sir George and was listed as a supporter of the Government, but Sir Jacob was able to reaffirm his control over the borough after Sir George's death in 1749Sedgwick (1970b) and won back the seat in the following election (1754), when Barne was not returned;Brooke (1964) however Barne continued to exert influence in the area, being patron of the Parish of Sotterley from 1758,Suckling (1846), pp. 81-96 meanwhile Elwick's death in 1750 also brought his estates to Barne.Hasted (1797), pp. 275 He promised that, if he were still alive after Downing's death, he would contest the seat again.Drummond (1964) When Downing died in 1764, the freemen once again offered the seat to Barne, who agreed with the Vannecks (also a family of former merchants who had purchased a seat in Suffolk) to be joint patrons of the borough, thus ousting the Downing influence.Drummond (1964) Barne was elected in 1764 and served until 1777, voting infrequently, but usually with the Government, and listed as a friend of the Newcastle and Rockingham ministries; he resigned in 1777, citing ill health.Drummond (1964) His efforts helped to secure for the Barne family a stake in the seat and four of his sons and a grandson (Frederick Barne) would be returned as members of the seat from that time up to 1832.See the articles of his children: Miles Barne, Barne Barne, Snowdon Barne, Michael Barne; and his grandson, Frederick Barne Family and later life  Barne was married twice: firstly, in May 1745, to Elizabeth Elwick, daughter and heir of Nathaniel Elwick of Crayford, Kent, a Governor of Madras; she died on 20 September 1747 and Barne married, secondly, on 23 September 1752, Mary Thornhill, a daughter of George Thornhill of Diddington, Huntingdonshire, and his wife Sarah Barne, daughter of John Barne of London and of Kirkby, Lincolnshire.Sedgwick (1970a) for details of both marriages, including the names of the wives' fathers; Watson (1775), p. 196 for the parentage of Miss Thornhill and particulars of her marriage; see also Burke (1871), p. 1377 for details of the Thornhill family of Diddington.

Its impressive ruins are located on an spectacular site near the modern town of Valeria (Cuenca, Castilla-La Mancha). History Valeria was founded on land conquered from the celtiberians, between 93 and 82 BC when Valerius Flaccus became proconsul of Hispania Citerior, since when it has preserved the name that refers to its founder. Site Valeria is located on a tongue of land between limestone gorges at an altitude of a 1000 metres. Excavation began in the 1950s, but more scientifically since 1974. Since then, systematic excavations have focussed primarily on the space occupied by the forum as well as on private villas. The major urban development of Valeria dates to the 1st century AD, when construction of the forum was undertaken. The centre of the site comprises a series of public buildings around an immense square platform in the centre of which the forum stood. It is one of the most complete Roman fora situated on a platform. Built into the platform are cisterns to store rainwater collected from above. Cisterns built under the forum to collect and store rainwater under Claudius The Basilica is located to the north side of the forum while on the west side are the Exedra (Hall of the imperial cult) and Cryptoporticus, a vaulted underground gallery functioning as a street or storerooms that also served as foundation to the floor of the Exedra and which occupies the whole side of the platform from the Basilica to the southern limit of the Forum. To the south lies a monumental staircase to the forum, a series of shops and the most iconic building of Valeria, the Nymphaeum, over 100 metres long. The ensemble is bounded by streets. The extent and status of the remains indicate that it was a Municipium. The Nympheum (foreground) and shops =The Nymphaeum= On the east side of the forum lies this very original fountain building dedicated to the nymphs and rivers. It is very large at over 105m long of which more than 80 belong to the fountain proper. This makes it one of the largest known throughout the Roman Empire and, of course, the largest in Hispania. The Nymphaeum did not perhaps figure in the first, late-republican, forum and was perhaps devised when forum was raised in level in the remodelling of the first century AD in the Claudius era. It is, however, a very old example since its construction must date from the early years of the 1st c. AD, and therefore well before the great nymphaea of Africa (2nd c. AD) so that Valeria is closer to the older Hellenistic types. The hillside fell abruptly on this side of the Forum and it was necessary to build a high retaining wall which would have compromised its aesthetic appearance. Therefore the designer of the forum took advantage of this wall to create a shrine to water gods, typical in the celtib√©rian world. In front of the wall, decorated with rectangular niches and alcoves, shops were built at the foot of the retaining wall. Their roofs served as part of an elongated terrace at a lower floor level of the Forum and divided into two halves, one like a large balcony supporting the retaining wall on the rear and providing a view over all the city, and the other half covered and attached to nymphaeum. A longitudinal gallery ran along the back of the terrace containing a channel connected to the tanks of the city so that water flowing from the channel came out of mouths in niches that decorated the wall. In them would be statues or paintings and water was channelled to ornate fountains below. The water supply and recuperation circuit must have been a remarkable work of hydraulic engineering, of which little remains. The Nympeum is undoubtedly the most emblematic monument of Valeria and one of the best known and most iconic of Hispania. By the 4th century AD the Nymphaeum fell out of use and was perhaps damaged. The area was re-occupied by rather modest private houses and partially dismantled, later to be used as a quarry. =The Exedra= During the first phase of occupation of the Exedra, the cryptoporticus was connected to the ground floor of the building through doors. The Exedra was accessed at street level through two doors located in the east walls of the building from the Cardo (the north-south street) which runs parallel to the building. The exedra underwent various modifications or re-uses in its life. In the 2nd century AD in one of the renovations the doors to the cryptoporticus were blocked up and, after the Forum became ruined and abandoned as a public space in the 3rd century, the exedra was re-occupied as a private dwelling in the 4th century. At this time the debris from the collapse of the building was not removed so it was necessary to build stairs for access to the ground floor of the building, possibly the only space that could be inhabited. Also in this phase they divided up some areas; walls were rebuilt and door openings between rooms modified. View from villa =Other Buildings= On the southern side of the Forum structures is the House of the Adobe. Another example of private urbanism is the \\"Casa del Hoyo\\". The Roman city had a good water supply through an articulated system of aqueducts that can be seen carved into the rock. The objects found at this site are in the museum of Cuenca, including the treasure of Valeria consisting of silver coins dating from the period after the Second Punic War in about 185 BC.

It is heterothallic. Taxonomy Coprinopsis radiata was originally published in 1788 as Agaricus radiatus by English naturalist James Bolton. Samuel Frederick Gray transferred it to Coprinus in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. In 2001, the genus Coprinus was reorganized and this species was moved to the newly created genus Coprinopsis. Morphology After mating and dikaryotic fruiting, the initial fruit body (young) is narrow egg-shaped and white. The mature fruit body is bluish-grey. Research Coprinopsis radiata has been used as a model organism to study basidiospore formation. =Culture conditions= Coprinopsis radiata is successfully cultured on horse dung at room temperature; under these conditions (with no control of external everyday light) the fungus can form a mushroom (mature fruit body). =Basidiospore activation= Coprinopsis radiata produces basidiospores from its fruit body that, under proper conditions, will germinate. Spores are activated by specific chemicals or temperatures that may act synergistically. Chemically, those resembling heterocyclic, unsaturated rings with or without small side groups, such as furfural, activate spores. Salt also causes slight activation. In the study, only low concentrations of chemicals were needed for activation. In nature, it is postulated that the combination of the following can lead to activation of dormant spores: temperature from the animal, dung heat (active organisms produce heat) and furans found on the dung (basis of compounds like furfural).

It is located in the sparsely populated municipio of Montejo de Tiermes (Soria, Castile and Le√≥n). During the Iron Age it was a Celtiberian hill fort. It resisted the Romans, and was allied to Numantia during the Celtiberian Wars. It is believed that the Romans gave it the status of municipium. The original name was Romanised as Termes or Termantia. It is remarkable for its impressive site on an arid red sandstone hill and for the way buildings have been carved in the solid rock. Roman history Ancient rock-cut houses The wealth of Termes in Celtiberian and Roman times came possibly from sheep farming (there are indications of an annual transfer of flocks between the northern plateau and Extremadura) and from deposits of iron ore and other metals in their area of influence. The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula by Rome was a long process that lasted two centuries. One of the highlights was the Celtiberian Wars that led to the incorporation of much of Celtiberia up to the middle of the upper Duero after the fall of Numantia in 133 BC. During this phase Termes was attacked by the Roman consul Q. Pompey in 141 BC, who signed a treaty with Termes in 139 BC, along with Numantia. The treaty was overruled by the Roman Senate, though continued hostilities did not directly affect Termes. Finally, at the end of the 2nd century BC, Rome restarted the conquest beyond Numantia; Termes fell in 98 BC, after the assault of the consul Titus Didius, who forced the inhabitants to move down to the plain, which according to archaeological data lasted only one or two decades. Afterwards Termes paid tribute (civitas stipendaria), beginning a slow process of Romanisation. From 70 BC the city began major urban renewal, using the three terraces of the hill, especially the middle, where the most important buildings would be located in the future. The city was probably given the title Municipium during the reign of Emperor Tiberius. Termes was assigned to the Conventus Cluniensis and thereafter the Hispanic-Roman city began to take shape, whose period of greatest splendour was between the first and second centuries AD. It was endowed with large public buildings, two fora (first Julio-Claudian and later a Flavian forum), thermal baths, a possible theatre, an aqueduct and urban development suited to the location of the city on a sandstone bluff surrounded by river gorges and forests. A particular characteristic of Termes, and most spectacular today, is the technique of carving buildings into the solid rock, later perfected with the introduction of Roman construction techniques. The city has numerous remains of buildings with this type of architecture, both private buildings (House of the Niches, Aqueduct House ...) and public (rock bleachers, Theatre, ...) and infrastructure (urban channels aqueduct, drainage, pathways, ...). The construction of the wall in the late third century AD indicates that the city maintained its character which lasted at least until the middle of IVth c. AD. Termes faded during late antiquity. Post-Roman history Very little of what happened in the city during the Visigoth and Islamic periods is known. There is a Romanesque church, which as the area is now depopulated has the status of eremita (hermitage). Archaeology The archaeological remains are located on several terraces and in the southern plain: Flight of steps carved into the rock: monumental public space of uncertain date and function, with steps divided into sectors and access stairways, near the door of the Sun, one of the ancient entrances. Southern rock complex: the remains of homes probably originating Celtiberian era, carved into the rocks on two floors, in the back, and with masonry facade of the Roman era. There are 11 houses divided into two zones, separated by a staircase. The \\"house of the Niches\\", among them, also shows an upper floor. Canal aqueduct: carved into the rock, it brought water from the hill to the Roman city, partly underground West Gate: pedestrian access to the city \\"House of the aqueduct\\", residence of 1800 sqm with 35 rooms on different levels connected by stairs. The foundation was cut into the hill, while the walls were plastered and decorated with murals. Forum with a temple dedicated to the imperial cult, arcaded square and a macellum with taverns. =Gallery= File:AcueductoDeTermancia.jpgRock-cut Aqueduct File:Yacimiento arqueol√≥gico de Tiermes (1 de mayo de 2006, Montejo de Tiermes) 08.JPGRock-cut Aqueduct File:ForoFlavioTiermes.jpgFlavian Forum File:Tiberius_(M.A.N._Madrid)_01.jpgSculpture now in the National Archaeology Museum Conservation and Museum The site is protected as a Zona Arqueol√≥gica.

September 10, 1927 ‚Äìd. May 17, 2010.) was a Mexican painter who was best known for his surreal and magically themed work as well as his mentorship of the artistic community in his hometown of San Miguel de Allende. Some of his early work was noticed by Diego Rivera, who declared that the artist would be ‚Äúa monster of painting.‚Äù Although he studied and exhibited abroad and his works can be found in collections in various parts of the world, Cu√©llar dedicated most of his career in his studio in San Miguel de Allende. Life Artist as a young man in 1957 with painting on the roof of his house in San Miguel de Allende Nicol√°s Cu√©llar was an artist, who was born and lived his entire life in the same house in the center of San Miguel de Allende (2¬™. Calle de Jes√∫s # 42). He is one of the few of this artists‚Äô enclave who is from the town. He began painting by copying religious images, in part because his mother was religious and because the nuns at his school encouraged him, when they knew his skills with pencil and oil. He initially went to study art at the Academy of San Carlos in M√©xico City, in 1954, but left shortly after to study at the Instituto Allende from 1955 to 1957, which suited his disposition better and considered it a major element in his development. In 1962, he received a scholarship to study at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, in New York. There he attended the class of Mark Samenfeld and had some exhibitions and was commissioned to paint two murals at the Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. After that, he got a teaching position in Maine. He went back to Mexico in 1963, shortly before finishing his studies. He rejected a teaching position at the Brooklyn Museum Art School because he was disappointed for the J.F. Kennedy assassination, but at the same time he was with new ideas and knowledge. When he returned to Mexico, he traveled all over the country to reencounter his inspiration roots. During and after that time he spent his time painting and experimenting, and he was very impressed by the Mexican old indigenous cultures, so he started archeology studies by himself and got more motifs and feelings to incorporate to his art works. Temporarily, he accepted a teaching position at San Carlos. Some time after 72-73, he signed various painting series and some sculptures as Tonatiuh Cu√©llar or T. Cu√©llar, instead of only Cu√©llar. This name is an Aztec word which means Sun. At that time he used to wear white clothes and his daughter remembers him as elegant, preferring light colored clothing and always wearing a hat, which he began wearing in the 1940s to cover the thick hair on his head. Every day the painter would leave his home in San Miguel de Allende to spend time in the main plaza of the city, after painting for several hours in the morning. Cu√©llar developed most of his career in San Miguel de Allende, becoming well-respected in the artistic community as a mentor. His house hosted hundreds of artists and taught many of them. The house hosted a small gallery and studio, where an old Singer sewing machine table covered in a hand painted cloth served as the reception desk. In his later life, he lived with a parakeet and two cocks. Cu√©llar was married with Mar√≠a Socorro Gonz√°lez (named \\"Coco\\" for him), and had eight children. He always was very proud of his family When he died in San Miguel Allende in 2010, his family was with him. In 2012, the city of San Miguel Allende paid tribute to \\"The painter from San Miguel Allende to the World\\", at the Angela Peralta Theater. Career Painting mural at the Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn in 1963 Nicol√°s Cu√©llar in his early career he also did work in making jewelry (common for artists in San Miguel de Allende), ceramics, sculpture, weavings and furniture making. In 1957, Diego Rivera saw some of Cuellar‚Äôs lithographs and exclaimed that he would be ‚Äúa monster of painting.‚Äù. His first exhibition was in 1955 at the Instituto Allende. These were followed by other local exhibitions in Guanajuato (1956), El Patio (1957) and at the Zaguan Gallery (1958) in San Miguel de Allende. In 1961 he exhibited at the Art Center L‚ÄôEly See, El Greco Gallery, the University of Montreal and the French Library in Montreal, followed by solo exhibitions at the Rotary Club in San Miguel de Allende and in Quer√©taro. In 1963 he exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York and in 1965 at the Gallery Mardi Gras in Mexico City. In the 1980s he exhibited at the Saint Paul Episcopalian Church in San Miguel Allende (1981), the Instituto Allende (1983), the Casa de Cultura in Monterrey (1985), the San Miguel Library in San Miguel de Allende (1985), the Celaya Casa de Cultura (1986), Casa Fargo and Allende House Museum in San Miguel de Allende (1987) and Gallery 14 in San Miguel de Allende (1988). In the 1990s he exhibited at the Office Pack, Open House and Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende (1991), Gallery Eugenia in San Miguel de Allende (1992), Museo Diego Rivera in Guanajuato (1993), Allende Museum House, Rotary Club and Juan Leny Gallery in San Miguel de Allende (1995), Del Valle University in San Miguel de Allende (1996), and at the Sacred Stone Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the 2000s, the exhibited at the Instituto Allende and Cuellar Gallery in San Miguel de Allende (2001), the Casa de Cultura in Monterrey (2002,2004 and 2009), AR Gallery in Monterrey (2008) and the Santa Fe Galleries in New Mexico (2008). Cu√©llar created two murals during his career. The first was at the New York Methodist Hospital in 1963 and the second is at the Hermanos Aldama Elementary School in San Miguel de Allende, created in 1971 and restored in 2000. Cu√©llar taught art at the Academy of San Carlos and at the Instituto Allende but later in his life he stopped working with institution, but continued to have private students. His works can be found in collections in Mexico, the United States, England, Canada, Germany, Australia, Central and South America. About 600 of his works have been catalogued more remain. Artistry Nicol√°s Cuellar is best known for his surrealism and the Expressionism-Surrealism work, which he dedicated most of his creative life; this period of his work, is where we might consider his contribution to the fine arts. But not only, he contributed to the Abstract Art, also with his magical and surrealistic point of view. His inspiration fountain had many manners, styles, interpretations and sizes, some of them obsessions: one was the towers of his main church¬¥s town (San Miguel Archangel Church), which represent one of the center of his universe, the lands of his brain, to his veins. Sometimes the church acts like another true original signature of himself and appears in paintings like \\"Children playing around the temple\\", \\"Eve seduction\\", \\"Moshe\\". His works shows a mixture of pre Hispanic, fantasy and Biblical elements, drawing on Mexican folklore and the mysticism of medieval Europe. His work has been compared to Bosch, and he stated that his influences included De Chirico, Brugel, Monet, Laktionov and William Lake. This focus took root after his return to Mexico in the 1960s, when he began to paint medieval themes in somber tones, witches, prostitutes, magicians, astronomers, clergy along with peculiar and fantastic figures such as men and women with multiple heads. Backgrounds often contained images of houses and mountains, and mountains that looked like cities. In this work he often played the role of a magician, conjuring a fantasy world, magical and often scary. He wrote once that he wanted to be ‚Äúa harlequin and a goblin, a magician and an artist, a chess pawn and a king. Some of his paintings are: \\"Song of the Moon\\" (1958), \\"Nicholas¬¥games\\" (1977), \\"Moshe\\" (1980\\"), \\"Erotism\\" (1992),\\"New York 11-09\\" (2001).

It is a practice consisting in preparing certain data or data set(s) for public use thus to make them available to everyone to use as they wish. This practice is an integral part of the open science movement. There is a large and multidisciplinary consensus on the benefits resulting from this practice. The main goal is to elevate data to be first class research outputs. There are a number of initiatives underway as well as points of consensus and issues still in contention. There are several distinct ways to make research data available, including: * publishing data as supplemental material associated with a research article, typically with the data files hosted by the publisher of the article * hosting data on a publicly available website, with files available for download * hosting data in a repository that has been developed to support data publication, e.g. figshare, Dryad, Dataverse, Zenodo. A large number of general and specialty (such as by research topic) data repositories exist. For example, the UK Data Service enables users to deposit data collections and re-share these for research purposes. * publishing a data paper about the dataset, which may be published as a preprint, in a journal, or in a data journal that is dedicated to supporting data papers. The data may be hosted by the journal or hosted separately in a data repository. Publishing data allows researchers to both make their data available to others to use, and enables datasets to be cited similarly to other research publication types (such as articles or books), thereby enabling producers of datasets to gain academic credit for their work. The motivations for publishing data may range for a desire to make research more accessible, to enable citability of datasets, or research funder or publisher mandates that require open data publishing. The UK Data Service is one key organisation working with others to raise the importance of citing data correctly and helping researchers to do so.  Methods for publishing data  = Data files as supplementary material = A large number of journals and publishers support supplementary material being attached to research articles, including datasets. Though historically such material might have been distributed only by request or on microform to libraries, journals today typically host such material online. Supplementary material is available to subscribers to the journal or, if the article or journal is open access, to everyone. = Data repositories = There are a large number of data repositories, on both general and specialized topics. Many repositories are disciplinary repositories, focused on a particular research discipline such as the UK Data Service which is a trusted digital repository of social, economic and humanities data. Repositories may be free for researchers to upload their data or may charge a one-time or ongoing fee for hosting the data. These repositories offer a publicly accessible web interface for searching and browsing hosted datasets, and may include additional features such as a digital object identifier, for permanent citation of the data, and linking to associated published papers and code. =Data papers= Data papers are ‚Äúscholarly publication of a searchable metadata document describing a particular on-line accessible dataset, or a group of datasets, published in accordance to the standard academic practices‚Äù. Their final aim being to provide ‚Äúinformation on the what, where, why, how and who of the data‚Äù. The intent of a data paper is to offer descriptive information on the related dataset(s) focusing on data collection, distinguishing features, access and potential reuse rather than on data processing and analysis. Because data papers are considered academic publications no different than other types of papers they allow scientists sharing data to receive credit in currency recognizable within the academic system, thus \\"making data sharing count\\". This provides not only an additional incentive to share data, but also through the peer review process, increases the quality of metadata and thus reusability of the shared data. Thus data papers represent the scholarly communication approach to data sharing. Despite their potentiality, data papers are not the ultimate and complete solution for all the data sharing and reuse issues and, in some cases, they are considered to induce false expectations in the research community. =Data journals= Data papers are supported by a rich array of journals, some of which are \\"pure\\", i.e. they are dedicated to publish data papers only, while others ‚Äì the majority ‚Äì are \\"mixed\\", i.e. they publish a number of articles types including data papers. A comprehensive survey on data journals is available A non-exhaustive list of data journals has been compiled by staff at the University of Edinburgh.https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/datashare/Sources+of+dataset+peer+review Examples of \\"pure\\" data journals are: Earth System Science Data, Journal of Open Archaeology Data, Open Health Data, Polar Data Journal, and Scientific Data. Examples of \\"mixed\\" journals publishing data papers are: Biodiversity Data Journal, F1000Research, GigaScience, GigaByte PLOS ONE, and SpringerPlus. Data citation Data citation is the provision of accurate, consistent and standardised referencing for datasets just as bibliographic citations are provided for other published sources like research articles or monographs. Typically the well established Digital Object Identifier (DOI) approach is used with DOIs taking users to a website that contains the metadata on the dataset and the dataset itself.Australian National Data Service: Data Citation Awareness (Accessed 20 March 2012)Ball, A., Duke, M.

Thus, a Hardy L-function cannot be half-exponential. There are infinitely many functions whose self-composition is the same exponential function as each other. In particular, for every A in the open interval (0,1) and for every continuous strictly increasing function g from [0,A] onto [A,1], there is an extension of this function to a continuous strictly increasing function f on the real numbers such that f(f(x))=\\\\exp x. The function f is the unique solution to the functional equation : f (x) = \\\\begin{cases} g (x) & \\\\mbox{if } x \\\\in [0,A],  \\\\exp (g^{-1} (x)) & \\\\mbox{if } x \\\\in (A,1],  \\\\exp (f ( \\\\ln (x))) & \\\\mbox{if } x \\\\in (1,\\\\infty),  \\\\ln (f ( \\\\exp (x))) & \\\\mbox{if } x \\\\in (-\\\\infty,0).  \\\\end{cases} Half-exponential functions are used in computational complexity theory for growth rates \\"intermediate\\" between polynomial and exponential.

Unlike the other two (which are only used on rare occasions such as Coronations) the Lord Mayor's Coach is used annually at the Lord Mayor's Show, and as such it is deemed to be the oldest ceremonial vehicle in regular use in the world.Report of The City Surveyor (CS.230/12) 2 July 2012 Details of the design The coach in use at the Lord Mayor's Show (2007) The carriage is of the type known as a Berlin. It is constructed substantially of wood, which is richly carved, ornamented and gilded. The body of the coach is attached to the undercarriage by four thick leather straps, each held in place by a huge, intricately decorated gilt buckle featuring the City's coat of arms. The roof of the coach is red painted with gilded ornamentation; there was formerly a central carved feature (depicting four boys holding baskets of fruit) only the base of which now remains. There is a large box seat in front for the coachman, whose foot- rest is in the shape of a scallop shell. The Lord Mayor's Coach has undergone a number of programs of restorations, with the wheels being replaced three times between 1711 and 1731 alone. On all four sides of the coach there are painted panels attributed to renowned carriage painter Giovanni Cipriani. Each shows an allegorical scene: The front panel shows figures representing Faith, Hope and Charity (Hope is shown pointing towards the dome of St Paul's Cathedral). The rear panels depict a figure representing the City of London receiving gifts from Riches and Plenty, Trade and Commerce. The right-hand panels include a Mayor being presented to the figure of the City, with the spire of Old St Paul's Cathedral in the background. The left-hand panels include the god Mars pointing to a scroll held by Truth on which is inscribed the name of the first Mayor, Henri Fitz Alwin.Weinreb & Hibbert, The London Encyclopedia, Macmillan, London 1983 The ceiling of coach has twice been painted blue, rather than the current red, and the Museum of London estimates there to be approximately 100 different layers of paint. Today, the carriage is supported by Kevlar bands, although they are disguised by more traditional- looking leather straps. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-24855882/lord- mayor-s-show-guided-tour-of-the-state-coach The carriage measures 6.55 m (21.5 ft) in length and 2.23 m (7.3 ft) in width, with a height of 3.17 m (10.4 ft). The coach weighs 2.9 tonnes. History Sir Marcus Samuel to the Coronation of Edward VII in 1902. From 1711 the Lord Mayor was transported around the city using a hired coach, following an incident where the incumbent, Gilbert Heathcote, was unseated from his horse by a drunken flower girl in 1710, breaking his leg. This arrangement continued until 1757, when city banker and Lord Mayor Elect, Sir Charles Asgill, persuaded the aldermen to finance the purchase of a 'new Grand State Coach'. The coach was commissioned on 4 April 1757 and completed in good time for Asgill's inauguration on 9 November that year. It was constructed by Joseph Berry, of Leather Lane, Holborn, at a total cost of ¬£850. It was designed by sculptor and architect Sir Robert Taylor, who had previously worked on private commissions for Asgill, as well designing the pediment fronting The Mansion House. Since then, the coach has been used regularly, generally once a year, by successive Lord Mayors. It has been more or less regularly maintained over two and a half centuries of use, and periodically regilded. The last major overhaul was in 1952, when the carriage was entirely stripped down and cleaned, with parts repaired or replaced where necessary and the wood preserved and strengthened, before being regilded, revarnished reupholstered and reassembled. Overall, though, changes to the original design have been minimal: an interior lamp was added in 1939, and brakes were only installed in 1951. Present-day use Lord Mayor's Show 2006. Each November, the coach is used to convey the new Lord Mayor from the Mansion House to the Royal Courts of Justice where they then swears allegiance to The Crown, travelling at the rear of the long procession that constitutes the Lord Mayor's Show. The coach is pulled by a team of six shire horses, with the front pair being ridden by a postillion and the other two pairs driven by a coachman from the box seat. When not in use, the coach is kept on public display in the Museum of London. In advance of the Show, it is moved to a temporary glass carriage house outside the Guildhall, where passers-by can see it being made ready for the procession. The State Harness and the City Marshal's Saddlery are kept in the Park Street Coach House with the other carriages of the Corporation. Other carriages of the Corporation of London Dress chariot The Corporation owns six other 'semi-state' carriages (two semi- state coaches and four dress chariots) four of which are also used in the Lord Mayor's Show. They are used to transport other senior dignitaries of the Corporation: the Chief Commoner and the Secondary, the Lay Sheriff, the Aldermanic Sheriff and the outgoing Lord Mayor and Chaplain. They are elegant carriages with plain black painted roofs and the bodies either maroon, green or blue; each has the City arms painted on its doors. In 2010 the Corporation attempted to sell two of these carriages to raise funds, but failed to attract the desired amount of money and they remain available for standby. Horses Aside from the six shire horses drawing the state coach which are provided by Waldburg Shires of Huntingdon the horses and attendants used in the Lord Mayor's Show are provided on a 'grace and favour' arrangement by the Royal Mews which also provides other carriages where required.

Laurel House in Paco, Manila The Jose P. Laurel Ancestral House (Filipino: Tahanan ni Jose P. Laurel) is a historic house in Manila, Philippines. It is one of the three houses owned by the President of the Second Philippine Republic, Jos√© P. Laurel. It is located in 1515 Pe√±afrancia Street (corner Santo Sepulcro Street) in Paco District (hence also known as \\"Villa Pe√±afrancia\\"). President Laurel purchased the house in 1926 and served as his residence, together with his wife Paciencia Hidalgo and their children, for 29 years before he transferred to his retirement home in Mandaluyong.  Architecture  Originally built in 1861 during the Spanish Colonial Period in the Philippines, this residential structure reflects the architectural style common around that time known as Bahay-na-Bato (\\"House-of-Stone\\"). Masonry materials constitute the lower level or the ground floor of the house while wooden materials and capiz-shell windows dominate the upper floor. The roofing of the house is made of corrugated galvanized iron while its vented eave ceilings are decorated with simple cut-out floral design. Ornate grill works also adorn the windows in the ground floor and the ventanillas (small shuttered openings below the windows) of the upper floor. Adjoining the northwest portion of the house is the garage area with an azotea or rooftop.  Declaration as a Historic Building  The house property was inherited by President Laurel's third son Sotero H. Laurel, which he donated to the Jose P. Laurel Memorial Foundation. Restoration efforts led by Sotero Laurel were made to bring back the former grandeur of the structure and to honor his father's dedicated service in the Philippines. In March 1998, the ancestral house was designated as a Historic Building (House Type) by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in which a marker was placed at the front corner of the property (see List of historical markers in the Philippines).

Barne's father had established himself as co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled one seat; on his father's death, Barne declined to fill the vacancy, and so it went to his younger brother instead. However, in 1791, his brother resigned and Barne reluctantly took up the seat, serving until 1796. Early life and legal career Barne was the first son of Miles Barne of Sotterley, a Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and the only with his first wife, Elizabeth Elwick, daughter of Nathaniel Elwick of May Place, Kent, a Governor of Madras.Stokes (1986a) ; Burke (1837), p. 141 He was admitted at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1762 and matriculated in 1763, before being admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1764.Venn (1940), p. 160 Member of Parliament Dunwich was a Parliamentary constituency in Suffolk, which had largely fallen into the sea and had a dwindling population by the late eighteenth century; it was home to roughly 40 voters.Stokes (1986b) Thus, the voters could be compelled by their land-lords to vote for the land-lord's favoured candidate. The Barne family, who had their seat in Sotterley, near Beccles, in Suffolk, had become the leading co- proprietors of Dunwich (along with the Vanneck family) and so controlled the vote.Stokes (1986b) When Barne's father, Miles, had resigned from the seat in 1777, Barne declined to take it up and his brother, Barne Barne, served instead.Stokes (1986a) However, his brother's ambition and service was driven by his desire for an office and, when he was appointed a Tax Commissioner in 1791, the seat became vacant. With Miles Barne now having little choice, he was returned as Dunwich's Member of Parliament in 1791.Stokes (1986a) He had reluctantly accepted the post of High Sheriff for 1790‚Äì91 and much preferred the living of a country squire than a public servant.Stokes (1986a) Despite being recorded as a supporter of Pitt, he took up the role with little activity and is only recorded voting on a handful of occasions during his five years as M.P. After Parliament's dissolution at the end of 1795, he retired on health grounds.Stokes (1986a) Later life Unlike his kin, he was motivated neither by political service, nor reward. He did not ask, and did not receive, any offices or sinecures for his time as an M.P. Even as a squire, he was content to leave the business of the family's estate to his half- brothers.Stokes (1986a) According to his obituary, in the Gentleman's Magazine, he spent the years after retiring from politics \\"almost constantly at Sotterley, in retirement, seeing very few persons except his near connections and relations.\\"The Gentleman's Magazine (1825, pt. ii), p. 280 He died, unmarried, on 8 September 1825 and his estate passed to his half- brother, Barne Barne.Stokes (1986a) ; The Gentleman's Magazine (1825, pt. ii), p. 280-1 References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Burke, J.

He then created a Cross-Border Accelerator Program called Barcelona Ventures in 2013 to cater to talented startups in Barcelona that can equally compete and have access to the global stage. In June of the same year they made the first Investor Forum between Barcelona and San Francisco by video conference, and in December they closed a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator USMAC.‚Äì Barcelona Ventures connects the capital of Silicon Valley with Barcelona through the collaboration of technical trends (Spanish) Since then every year Barcelona Ventures has kept growing and enhancing its Accelerator Program every year, signing partners such as Rakunest in 2018, the Incubator arm of giant Rakuten and backed up by ACCI√ì, an agency of the Government of Catalonia.  Program  The startups are immersed in a zero- equity 8-week Accelerator Program and the last two weeks are hosted in Silicon Valley. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day, where the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience made up of angel investors and venture capitalists. Mentors and advisors of the program are composed of individuals with deep industry, investment, or entrepreneurship experience from different industries and countries. They look for early-stage and top-class founders attacking large, global markets and solving real problems using technology to join the Accelerator Program to help them unlock smart capital from US investors.

This Android app is a part of the larger TAK family of products.https://takmaps.com/about/ ATAK has a plugin architecture which allows developers to add functionality. This extensible plugin architecture that allows enhanced capabilities for specific mission sets (Direct Action, Combat Advising, Law Enforcement, Protection Operations, Border Security, Disaster Response, Off-grid Communications, Precision Mapping and Geotagging). It enables users to navigate using GPS and geospatial map data overlayed with real-time situational awareness of ongoing events. The ATAK software represents the surrounding area using the military standard MIL- STD-2525B symbology, and customized symbols such as icons from Google Earth and Google Maps for iconography and the Cursor on Target data format standard for communication.https://atakmap.com/p_about.aspx Initially created in 2010 by the Air Force Research Laboratory, and based on the NASA WorldWind Mobile codebase its development and deployment grew slowly then rapidly since 2016. As of 2020, ATAK has a growing base of 250,000 military and civilian users across numerous public safety agencies and US partner nations. And has seen the addition of 15 United States Department of Defense programs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ2okD5RaYc Development and usage ATAK began in August 2010 and was originally based on NASA WorldWind Mobile. The goal was to demonstrate robust information sharing in a mobile format. In 2013, officials at Draper Laboratory said that the system would be compatible with Android mobile operating systems and could be used for navigation, spatial awareness, and controlling drones.Denise Chow, Troops Call for Military Airstrike? There's an App for That, LiveScience (October 21, 2013). In October 14, 2014 U.S. Army Geospatial Center recommended AFRL's Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), over the world-leader Esri's Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit (CJMTK), NASA's World Wind, and the Army's Globe Engine (AGE) for map engine driving the Nett Warrior End User Device. ATAK was selected due to similar capabilities with CJMTK, similar risk, and less than one-third of the total cost. Read the full, public released report Nett Warrior Map Engine Trade Study According to a January 2016 article in National Defense Magazine, \\"[ATAK] has already been fielded to AFSOC units\\". In September 2015, DARPA reported that ATAK was used in a successful demonstration of the Persistent Close Air Support Program, and is in use by thousands of users. Polaris integrated its Ground Guidance software into an ATAK Plugin to allow on and off-road routing for mounted and dismounted soldiers, accounting for terrain, weather, enemy activity and equipment load. In 2018, USAF Security Forces deployed ATAK at Eglin AFB, Florida. The Growing Impact of the Team Awareness Kit The Android Team Awareness Kit or TAK is currently used by thousands of Department of Homeland Security personnel, along with other members of the Homeland Security Enterprise including state and local public safety personnel. It is in various stages of transition across DHS components and is the emerging DHS-wide solution for tactical awareness. TAK‚Äôs exceptional tactical value has already been proven time and again.

The first four letters in the websites name, \\"vine\\", are an acronym for \\"Victim Information and Notification Everyday\\". Vinelink.com displays information, based on the information provided by the various states' departments of correction and other law enforcement agencies, on whether an inmate is in custody, has been released, has been granted parole or probation, or has escaped from custody. In some cases, the website will reveal whether a defendant has been granted parole or probation, but then subsequently violated conditions of their release and become a fugitive. Information provided on Vinelink.com represents metadata, in that the website lists a defendant's custody status; but does not list what the individual is charged with, their criminal history, or the amount of their bail, if applicable. Internet users accessing the Vinelink.com website choose from a map of states and provinces within the United States where they wish to perform a search for an inmate. The user may then search for an individual using the inmate's or parolee's name, or by entering the inmate's specific department of corrections inmate number, if known. When the inmate's custody status changes, users who have registered to be notified of such changes will be notified via email, phone or both. This information is currently released upon request, without the website requesting reasons for the users search or requiring payment, as public records available to the general public. Inmate information is available for most states, and for Puerto Rico, on the website. The states of Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire and West Virginia provide very limited information on the site.

The rock formation lies 5 km southwest of the largest and far better known Devil's Table of Hinterweidenthal, which also has a more impressive \\"table shape\\".  Geography  The rock is located at an elevation of on the northwest slopes of the wooded western spur of the Bichtenberg hill (400 m). To the north are the water meadows of the Salzbach stream, which flows from west to east here and is a right-hand tributary of the Wieslauter. Also to the north is the state road, the Landesstra√üe 486, which runs from Lemberg via Salzwoog to Hinterweidenthal. The Salzwoog Devil's Table is accessible from the valley of Salzwoog on a narrow footpath which branches off the trail to Dahn and climbs through a height of about 80 metres. Above the rock is a rest area which offer a panoramic view over the Salzbach water meadows.  Geology  Like its \\"larger brother\\" at Hinterweidenthal, the Devil's Table of Salzwoog is a bunter sandstone rock formation which resembles a pedestal table. As a result or erosion the surrounding softer surface material was carried away, whilst the hard rock core remained standing. This has left an oversized \\"table top\\" perched diagonally over an equally massive \\"pedestal\\". In the Dahner Felsenland, as the region to the east is called, these types of unusually shaped rocks are very common.

He designed the Coat of arms of Chile, which was adopted by the government in 1834, incorporating the huemul and the condor. He also designed the first stamps of the nascent state. He is considered one of the most influential foreign artists who shaped modern painting in Chile. Biography He was born on 25 April 1792, son of the Irish John Chatworthy Wood and Susan Taylor. From boyhood, he demonstrated his skills in art, working in a ceramics factory in the town of Burslem in Staffordshire. He emigrated to the United States in 1817. There, he started business as a landscape painter in Boston, moving his family a year later. In 1819, he was hired by the U.S. government to embark on a scientific expedition on the frigate Macedonia; this journey took him to the coast of Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. He reached Valparaiso in January 1819, after 80 days of sailing, making plans and sketches of the coasts they visited, and drawing ships and port activities for purposes of military study; Lord Cochrane had just sailed to blockade Callao. Wreck of the Arethusa (El naufragio del Arethusa) by Charles Wood Taylor, 1826. Continued toward the Callao and Downes Commander of the frigate Macedonian invited to a dance on board the General San Mart√≠n the main hall was decorated with the navies of Wood, and Martin felt impressed to contemplate, and knowing by the captain that the author was on board, manisfest√≥ his desire to know. Presented to St. Martin Wood offered him a position that in the Army, which at first was compelled to refuse for their commitments to scientific expedition. In August 1820, he was back in Chile, and at the request of Colonel Don Diego Paroissien, aide of General San Mart√≠n, accepted the post of Lieutenant of Artillery of the Army of Chile, added to the corps of engineers. On 8 October 1820, he joined the liberating expedition of Peru aboard the vessel San Mart√≠n. Charles Wood Taylor carried out numerous military activities: topographic surveys, plans and locations of the enemy, infiltration of enemy lines, eventually being promoted by San Martin to the rank of Captain of Engineers. He sailed to serve Peru on the Callao starting on 2 January 1824, arriving at Valparaiso with custom cross the border Arauco. Sickened by the heavy rains and cold while serving Peru on the Callao, he convalesced in San Fernando. There, he made friends and met the woman who would be his future wife. He had to convert to Catholicism to marry Dolores Chacon Ramirez de Arellano. His artwork consists of drawings, portraits, drawings and paintings characterized by descriptive detail. Along with Mauricio Rugendas, he was the painter who showed Chile at the dawn of the republic. Senior government In 1824 the Chilean government hired him to a study of the region known as La Frontera, traveling to Concepcion. Actively participated in the fighting of 1829 by the Liberals, he eventually became aide of General Francisco de la Lastra in the Battle of Ochagav√≠a. Thanks to his skills as a draftsman, he was kept on as part of the military engineering team. He soon met the Spaniard Antonio Arcos, who designed the current flag of Chile on behalf of Jos√© Ignacio Zenteno and Pozo Silva. Charles Wood Taylor designed the Coat of arms of Chile, adopted by the government in 1834, incorporating the huemul and the condor. Professional life In 1830, he was appointed professor of drawing the National Institute. He then moved to Valparaiso, where in 1833 he made plans for the quartermaster of this port, designed the customs clock tower and the railway line to Cerro Alegre, and in 1837, drew the topographic map of the city. He was appointed inspector of public works of the city, planning the Huth House and Port San Antonio. In 1842, he raised the level of customs buildings in Talcahuano, then the ports of Coquimbo, Copiapo and Caldera. In 1845 he traced the route of the railroad from Caldera to Copiapo, built by William Wheelwright. For his connection with England, he was appointed English naval inspector in Valparaiso. Portrait of Charles Wood Taylor In 1855, he traveled to Europe, as he was suffering from heart disease. He visited Chilean friends living in France, Belgium, and London, England. His health worsened, and he died on 19 February 1856 in London. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Works Participated in urgent work of the new state: * Enabling and construction of ports of San Antonio, Coquimbo, Copiapo and Caldera. * In 1833, he designed the topographic maps of Valparaiso. * In 1842, design drawings customs buildings in Talcahuano. * In 1845, he designed the route of the first railroad from Caldera to Copiapo who built William Wheelwright. * However, his main contribution to his adopted country was the national emblem design in 1834 and by the Spanish Antonio Arcos, made the drawing of the current national flag. Painting His artwork consists of drawings, portraits, drawings and paintings, mainly in watercolor. They are characterized by descriptive detail, seeking to capture the picturesque and colorful landscape. He mainly portrayed boats, historical facts, and naval actions. His best known work is paradoxically his only oil painting, the \\"Wreck of the Arethusa\\".

It uses text analysis of speech and written content (including radio transcripts, transcripts of spoken web content, tweets, and articles) and identification of hate speech patterns within it to predict potential regional violence. History The introduction of Hatebase was announced on the Sentinel Project blog on March 25, 2013. The initiative is led by Timothy Quinn of Mobiocracy. Description In an article for Foreign Policy, Joshua Keating described Hatebase as follows: \\"There are two main features to Hatebase. The first is a Wikipedia-like interface which allows users to identify hate speech terms by region and the group they refer to. This could have some value for researchers, but Hatebase's developers are especially excited by the second main feature, which allows users to identify instances when they've heard these terms used.\\" The example of the Rwandan genocide was cited in that article and also in an article about Hatebase on Maclean's: in the months leading up to the genocide, radio stations attempted to dehumanize Tutsis to Hutus by repeatedly referring to the Tutsis as cockroaches. The regional and multilingual focus of the site was deemed particularly useful for identifying words that could be construed as hate in some languages and contexts but that outsiders would not know of, such as the word \\"sakkiliya\\" in Sinhalese (the language in Sri Lanka) used to refer to a Tamil person as 'a very unhygienic or uncultured person' or the reference to Tutsis as cockroaches by the Rwandan radio stations, that an outsider may simply consider evidence that the region was suffering from a literal cockroach infestation. This relates to the challenge of identifying subtly different uses of the same or similar words, one of which connotes hate and the other doesn't. In the context of language that equates humans with pollution or stains, this is also called the human stain problem. Another related challenge is to control for the ambient level of casual hate speech in society (such as YouTube comments): in some societies and contexts, hateful language may not be accompanied by or followed by violence, whereas in others, it might. For this reason, the evidence was only considered valuable in conjunction with other evidence about the risk and threat of violence, and the project concentrated its efforts on mapping hate speech in regions with a history of violence. API Hatebase provides an Application programming interface and a PHP wrapper/SDK is available on GitHub. Information about the API can be found at Programmable Web and Mashape. Reception The launch of Hatebase was covered in Wired Magazine and the story was picked up and discussed on Slashdot. Hatebase was also covered in Metro News, a Canadian publication. It was also covered in the Canadian weekly Maclean's. Joshua Keating covered Hatebase in an article for Foreign Policy. A week later, the magazine published a response letter by Gwyneth Sutherlin, a doctoral candidate at the University of Bradford, pointing out potential problems and limitations of the approach used by Hatebase. On September 10, 2019, TechCrunch published a feature about Hatebase called \\"Hatebase catalogues the world‚Äôs hate speech in real time so you don‚Äôt have to\\".

The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill. Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. The bill covers appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as for a variety of agencies with a scientific emphasis. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall. In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation. This bill is the earliest to be considered since 1974, according to the Chairman. The appropriations process for fiscal year 2015 was widely \\"viewed as Congress' best chance in years to pass and conference spending bills ahead of the October 1 start of the fiscal year.\\" Provisions of the bill =Original House measure= *Approximately $2 billion worth of spending in the bill is directed at the Drug Enforcement Administration. *NASA gets $17.9 billion, a $250 million increase over fiscal year 2014. *The National Science Foundation gets $7.4 billion, an increase of $232 million. Successful amendments The House considered over 80 different amendments during two days of debate because the bill was brought to the floor under an open rule, a procedure that allows unlimited amendments. *A $19.5 million increase in funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigations's (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The system is supposed to stop people from selling guns to criminals and people who are mentally ill. The amendment was approved 260-145. Only four Democrats voted against the amendment. The National Rifle Association took no position on it. *An amendment offered by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) was adopted 219-189 that would forbid the Justice Department from stopping states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. According to Rohrabacher, \\"despite this overwhelming shift in public opinion\\" towards favoring medical marijuana, \\"the federal government continues its hard line of oppression against medical marijuana.\\" Opponent Rep. John Fleming (R-LA said that the amendment \\"will take away the ability of the Department of Justice to protect our young people.\\" *An amendment offered by Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) was adopted 225-183. The amendment would \\"prevent funds from being used to force journalists to reveal their sources.\\" According to Grayson, \\"it is completely incongruous to say we have freedom of the press, but the federal government can subpoena your sources and put them and you in prison if you don't comply.\\" Objections to the amendment focused on the fact that it was being suggested at 10:30pm and ought to be dealt with at a different time. *An amendment offered by Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) was adopted 229-178 that would \\"prohibit the use of funds to relinquish the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) responsibility of assigning Internet domains.\\" NTIA had oversight over the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, an important Internet governance body. Duffy worried that \\"by relinquishing our core functions to a foreign body, I don't think we will retain the current system of the Internet and the current rights of freedom of speech that the Internet currently enjoys.\\" *An amendment from Rep. Steve King (R-IA provides $5 million to the Department of Justice for their use to \\"investigate the Obama administration's release of illegal immigrants facing deportation who are also criminals.\\" *The Justice Department also received an additional $1 million to conduct a criminal investigation into the allegations about secret waiting lists being kept at Veterans Administration hospitals. =Senate minibus= The Senate amended H.R. 4660 to contain a \\"minibus\\" set of appropriations measures that included funding for the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Department of Transportation, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Departments of Commerce and Justice covered by the original House bill. The bill would appropriate $120 billion. Procedural history The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 15, 2014 by Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA). the bill was reported as an original measure by the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The House voted on May 30, 2014 in Roll Call Vote 269 to pass the bill 321-87. On June 17, the United States Senate voted to end debate on the motion to consider this bill in a vote of 95-3. The Senate will be using H.R. 4660 as a legislative vehicle, amending it to contain the text of a \\"minibus\\" - a set of several appropriations bills in one. The House passage of H.R. 4660 simplifies the process of the Senate amending the bill and then sending it back to the House for a conference committee to reconcile the two versions. Debate and discussion =Failed amendments= These are some of the failed amendments to the original House measure: *Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) offered an amendment, which failed 66-339, that would have reduced the Drug Enforcement Administration's funding by $35 million. Polis argued that the DEA did not need an increase in its current funding because it \\"doesn't have a growing enforcement workload, except in their own minds.\\" Colorado had recently made marijuana legal. *Rep. Jim Moran (D-VA) offered an amendment that would allow the federal government to move detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to places in the United States. The amendment, which would have struck portions of the bill the currently outlaw such transfers, failed in a vote of 169-230. According to Moran, \\"the political and legal expediency of the Guantanamo Bay detention center at is not worth the cost to American's reputation around the world.\\" Opponents, such as Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), said that bringing the detainees to the United States would be dangerous. =Senate minibus= The appropriations bills that were combined to create the Senate's minibus bill did have Republicans support individually, but Republicans in the Senate objected to how the Democrats initially divided up the over $1 trillion in discretionary spending between the 12 regular appropriations bills. According to the Republicans, these allocations were dependent on budget \\"gimmicks\\" that were used to meet the requirements of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Senator John Thune (R-SD) said that \\"we'd like a process that at least allows us to get votes on amendments.\\" Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) also wanted a more open amendment process, saying that \\"as long as members are allowed to bring amendments as long as they want to, I'm certainly prepared to defend the (agriculture) portions of the bill.\\" However, Republicans were not expecting an open amendment process being allowed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Barne's father had established himself as co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled one seat; on his father's death in 1777, Barne's eldest brother declined to fill the vacancy and so Barne accepted the offer, hoping to obtain, by voting with the administration, a paid office. He was eventually offered a post, as a Commissioner of Taxes, and, on accepting it, resigned his seat in 1791. Early life and legal career Barne was born on 25 August 1754, the second son of Miles Barne of Sotterley, a Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and his second wife, Mary Thornhill, daughter of George Thornhill of Diddington, Huntingdonshire.Stokes (1986a) ; Burke (1833), p. 141 He was educated at Westminster School in 1768 and then admitted at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1772, matriculating that year and becoming a scholar in 1773. He received an LL.B. in 1780 and was a fellow of Trinity Hall from 1781 to 1814. Prior to his education, he was admitted at the Inner Temple in 1770 and then called to the Bar later, in 1779. A Bencher in 1811 and Reader 1820, he was the Treasurer from 1820 to 1821.Venn (1940), p. 160 Member of Parliament Dunwich was a Parliamentary constituency in Suffolk, which had largely fallen into the sea and had a dwindling population by the late eighteenth century; it was home to roughly 40 voters.Stokes (1986b) Thus, the two seats belonging to the Borough were essentially controlled by local land-lords; by 1764, it was in the hands of the Barne and Vanneck families, who were co-proprietors of the parish.Stokes (1986b) Barne Barne, having begun his training as a barrister, was therefore returned for Dunwich \\"on the family interest\\" in 1777, when his father resigned, due to his declining health and advanced age, and his eldest brother, Miles Barne declined the seat.Stokes (1986a) As a Member, Barne tended to vote with the administration, hoping to secure himself a commission of some kind; he is not known to have spoken in debate. In 1788, he petitioned Pitt for this, and supported him silently in the hope of a reward. Having been returned again in 1790, Barne was offered the position of a Commissioner of Taxes in 1791 and resigned from the House.Stokes (1986a) ; Drummond (1964) Later life He appears to have developed a reputation for aggressively working in his family's favour in Dunwich, in his attempt to further their interest there. He offered his resignation from the Tax office in 1818 and it was accepted in 1820.Stokes (1986a) He died, unmarried, on 19 June 1828.Stokes (1986a) ; The Gentleman's Magazine (1828, pt. i), p. 648 References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Burke, J.

The train was run into by a passenger train. Nine people were killed and 51 were injured. Accident At 12:32 Moscow Standard Time (08:32 UTC) on 20 May 2014, a freight train derailed between Bekasovo and Naro-Fominsk on the Moscow ‚Äì Kiev railway. The derailed wagons fouled an adjacent track. A Moscow ‚Äì Chisinau, Moldova passenger train collided with the derailed wagons, killing nine people and injuring 51; 29 of whom were taken to hospital. There were 394 passengers on board. The passenger train was operated by Moldovan Railways. It was travelling at before the driver made an emergency brake application, having seen the cloud of dust caused by the derailment of the freight train. The seventh and eighth carriages of the train were those most severely damaged in the accident. The side of one of the carriages was ripped open in the accident. Victims were taken to hospitals in Moscow, Naro-Fominsk, Odintsovo and Selyatino. Two victims were flown by helicopter to a Moscow hospital. The stretch of track which the freight train derailed on was under repair at the time of the accident. A broken rail is suspected to have been the cause of the freight train derailing; however, a broken axle on one of the wagons may also have caused the accident. The line between Aprelevka and station, Naro-Fominsk was blocked by the accident, with buses replacing trains. By late evening, one line was reopened, allowing Moscow commuters to travel home by train. Passengers bound for Moscow were transported by bus. Investigation The Russian Investigative Committee opened an investigation into the accident. A criminal investigation was also opened into the accident. Causes under investigation include a broken rail, the condition of the freight train and the driving of the freight train. Speaking in Shanghai, China, Russian President Vladimir Putin ruled out terrorism as a cause. Subsequent inquiry revealed that the end reason of the derailment was the sun kink on the seamless rail due to thermal expansion and improper maintenance. The problem with the rails was known and attempts to rectify them were made, but couldn't be completed in time before the accident, because the institutional culture discouraged the personnel from interrupting the traffic on a busy line. Additional blame was placed on the maintenance team trying to rectify this problem, which failed to notify the controllers and the train crews about track work they were conducting.

Since glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are major components of cartilage, ingesting glucosamine might nourish joints, and thereby alleviate arthritis symptoms. Some of the evidence for the effectiveness of glucosamine is disputed.The effects of Glucosamine Sulphate on OA of the knee joint. BestBets. A 2008‚Äì2009 review of all known studies of glucosamine supplements for horses, for example, found that almost all studies had failed to meet usual standards and were fatally compromised by basic errors in their execution, including failure to test whether active ingredients were as stated, lack of adequate (or any) control groups or baseline measurements, very small sample sizes, and ignoring prior research or self-evident omissions. The authors highlighted confirmation bias as a significant issue in such studies, in that most studies were undertaken by manufacturers, on products they already produced commercially, and they were usually undertaken to support claims of benefits which could be used to market the product. More recently, other reviews found little evidence that glucosamine and chondroitin supplements were any better than a placebo or at most only slightly better. Glucosamine sulfate may be efficacious in ways that glucosamine hydrochloride is not. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International advises arthritis sufferers to discontinue glucosamine therapy if they notice no benefit within six months and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option. Similar trials have been done with chondroitin. History of trials In general, the clinical trials of the mid-1990s that furnished positive results showing glucosamine efficacy were later deemed to be of poor quality due to shortcomings in their methods, including small size, short duration, poor analysis of drop-outs, and unclear procedures for blinding. At the same time, several independent studies did not detect any benefit of glucosamine supplementation on osteoarthritis. A Cochrane 2005 meta-analysis of glucosamine therapy for osteoarthritis found that only the Rotta brand of glucosamine appeared to be superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic osteoarthritis. However, when the low quality and older studies were discounted and only those using the highest-quality design were considered, there was no difference from placebo treatment. A second 2005 review of glucosamine clinical trials reached a different conclusion. Published in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, the authors of this review concluded that \\"The available evidence suggests that glucosamine sulfate may be effective and safe in delaying the progression and improving the symptoms of knee OA.\\" A systematic review in 2007 found that effect sizes from glucosamine supplementation were highest in industry-funded studies and lowest in independent studies, which may lead one to believe that bias is responsible for the heterogeneity of the clinical study findings regarding the efficacy of glucosamine. An alternative explanation may be that the two commonly available forms, sulfate and hydrochloride, while used interchangeably by the general public and even the medical community, appear to have different pharmacologic effects in vivo. Another 2007 review of the available research concluded that there was \\"compelling evidence\\" that glucosamine sulfate (but not hydrochloride) slowed the progression of knee and hip osteoarthritis. This finding was confirmed by a 2013 meta-analysis of 19 glucosamine trials which concluded that while neither form of glucosamine appeared significantly more effective than placebo at symptom improvement, glucosamine sulfate alone showed efficacy in improving physical function in knee OA as measured by the Lequesne Index in trials lasting more than 24 months. In 2006, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a 24-week, 12.5 million-dollar multicenter clinical trial (the GAIT trial) to study the effect of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin/glucosamine in combination, and celecoxib as a treatment for knee- pain in two groups of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: Patients with mild pain (n=1229), and patients with moderate to severe pain (n=354). When the data from both groups were pooled and analyzed, there was no statistically significant difference between groups taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine/chondroitin; and those taking an inactive placebo or the positive control, the prescription analgesic celecoxib. The authors of the study analyzed the moderate-to-severe pain group and found that in this group, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin was more effective at providing pain relief than the positive control with 79% of the glucosamine group reporting at least a 20% reduction in pain compared to 70% for celecoxib and only 54% reporting a similar reduction in the placebo group. However, the researchers caution that given the small size of the sub-group, these findings should be confirmed with further studies. Despite its size and design, the GAIT trial may have also had some important limitations, however. When considering the entire cohort, none of the treatments studied performed significantly better (or worse) than placebo in improving patient WOMAC pain and function scores. In other words, because of the inclusion of both a placebo and a positive control, and the fact that roughly 60% of each treatment group achieved the same level of improvement, it is difficult to conclude anything about the efficacy or non-efficacy of glucosamine in the treatment of knee OA from this study. In a follow-up study in 2008, 572 patients from the GAIT trial continued their supplementation for 2 years. After 2 years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint space width, when compared to a placebo or celecoxib. As in the original GAIT study, this follow-up study was confounded by unexpected results that made it difficult to conclude anything definitive about the effect of glucosamine on slowing the progression of OA. Despite the fact that the glucosamine group showed less than one-tenth the joint narrowing (0.013 mm) as the placebo group (0.166 mm), none of the groups experienced joint space narrowing to the degree the researchers expected (0.4 mm) over the two-year period based on earlier studies of OA disease progression. Thus, while the researchers rightly concluded that no treatment in this study was found to produce a \\"a clinically important reduction\\" in joint space width loss none of the participants experienced clinically important progression of their disease during the study period either. In another 2-year follow-up study involving 662 patients from the GAIT trial, published in 2010, there was neither significant pain reduction nor improved function when comparing glucosamine and/or chondroitin to a placebo although the positive control also failed to perform significantly better that the placebo in this study.  Quality of clinical studies of glucosamine and chondroitin supplements  Glucosamine supplements are widely used for both human and animal joint conditions, at times supported by clinical studies. However a 2008/2009 metastudy reviewed all existing studies on the efficacy of glucosamine treatments and supplements for horses, and concluded negatively, that these studies were usually fatally flawed due to confirmation bias (studies are funded by manufacturers with an incentive to show that benefits exist and commercial pressures that disfavor larger and more thorough studies which would be expensive) and fatal flaws in the design of the study which undermined the conclusions. The authors observed that existing studies of glucosamine products are \\"usually [undertaken] on products already commercially available and often seeking evidence for efficacy ... but most do not meet a quality standard that provides sufficient confidence in the results\\". A paper by the same authors at the 4th European Equine Nutrition & Health Congress (2008) concluded that research into glucosamine-based supplements, for horses at least, has so far \\"failed to produce substantial evidence for the functionality of these products in this species\\", and that almost every study they had examined had beenCritical review of research evaluating glucosamine-based nutraceuticals for treatment of joint pain and degenerative joint disease in horses ‚Äì Pearson and Lindinge, Proceedings of the 4th European Equine Nutrition & Health Congress, April 2008 compromised to varying degrees by numerous experimental factors including underpowered studies, unbalanced research design, non-existent or inappropriate controls, unclear or non-representative experimental conditions (i.e. models) and uncharacterized or complex, heterogeneous experimental materials\\". The most common flaws included: * Not verifying whether the quantities and condition of active ingredients was as described (\\"a well-known characteristic of the nutraceuticals industry is one of inconsistent quality control\\"); * Ignoring known research in the field and standard precautions, such as accounting for quantities available in blood plasma; * In many of the studies, no reliable control group existed, or there was inadequately controlled control group, or inadequate baseline data, meaning that reliable conclusion could not be drawn about any purported benefits actually resulting from the product. Controls are a fundamental part of such studies, and the authors comment that \\"many cases of lameness ... improve over time without any treatment at all ... which suggests that the null hypothesis tested in this study had a good chance of being rejected even in the absence of any treatment\\" and that \\"having no such controls leaves the authors and readers with no way in which to tease out effects of growth and/or exercise from effects of glucosamine\\". David Marlin, a past senior scientist and head of physiology at the Animal Health Trust in England, commented on his website on the evidence concerning glucosamine-based supplements for humans and animals, including a list of studies since 2009. As at 2016 he concludes that some degree of evidence exists for benefits from supplements, and that \\"[even if] oral joint supplements have little or no efficacy, we might consider that feeding them at least allows owners to feel they are doing something positive for their animals and that any improvement may be due to the placebo effect and therefore there is little risk\\".\\"Equine joint supplements ‚Äì what scientific evidence is there to support their use?\\" ‚Äì David marlin website, 2016--4-07 However against this he highlights concerns of overdosing, that shark cartilage products may promote rather than reduce inflammation, and produces have been found to be contaminated with steroids. He also states that \\"on closer scrutiny\\" studies continue to raise concerns for similar reasons as described in the 2008/2009 study: =Further metastudies= Due to the controversy engendered by these results, additional meta-analyses have been undertaken in an attempt to evaluate glucosamine. A 2009 review found little evidence that glucosamine was better than placebo at reversing or restoring degenerative changes to articular cartilage. One published in 2010 in the British Medical Journal arrived at the following conclusions: > Compared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do > not reduce joint pain or affect the narrowing of joint space. Health > authorities and health insurers should not cover the costs of these > preparations, and new prescriptions to patients who have not received > treatment should be discouraged.Glucosamine Chondroitin Supplements to get > Relief from Joint Pain These conclusions, however, are not shared by all researchers in the field. Specifically, the authors of the 2010 BMJ meta-analysis have been criticized for poor methodology by including too many dissimilar studies in their analysis. In a subsequent discussion the editors of the BMJ concluded that, while they still supported the overall results of the study, they no longer accepted the specific conclusions that glucosamine and chondroitin should not be recommended by health authorities or covered by health insurers, stating that these claims \\"were not directly supported by [the authors'] data\\". Nevertheless, in 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained its position (first published in a comprehensive 2004 letter) that there is no credible scientific evidence to support the proposed health claims regarding consumption of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate and reduced risk of osteoarthritis, joint degeneration, and cartilage deterioration. (Updated 2012.) Also in 2012, a review highlighted the ongoing conflicting clinical data regarding the efficacy of glucosamine concluding both that 1) \\"...glucosamine sulfate shows an effect size superior to (or at least equal to) the commonly used analgesic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but has no rare or adverse effects\\" and 2) the majority of clinical trials assessing glucosamine reported a significant number of subjects who failed to respond to treatment, thereby questioning the benefit of glucosamine./ A 2014 review and analysis conducted by the La Universidad del Zulia located in Maracaibo, Venezuela and funded by the Venezuelan government's Technological, Humanistic, and Scientific Development Council concluded that the preponderance of the available evidence indicates that glucosamine, specifically the sulfate form, has disease-modifying effects and provides symptomatic relief for at least some individuals suffering from OA. The report classified glucosamine as a Symptomatic Slow Acting Drugs for Osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) and states: > Although further research is required...glucosamine supplements have been > more than sufficiently proven to display overtly beneficial risk-to-reward > profiles, and they should remain fundamental components of OA therapy. A further meta-analysis published in December 2014 by the Parker Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark) sponsored by the Oak Foundation concluded that glucosamine sulfate, but not glucosamine HCl, did have a significant effect on osteoarthritis pain but only when one particular brand was used. Once this effect size was corrected for bias and heterogeneity, the effect size became clinically unimportant. =Summary of results= Many randomized controlled trials have been conducted with mixed results. These trials have been summarized: * In 2007, Reichenbach et al. used explicit methods to conduct and report a systematic review of 20 trials and concluded \\"large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.\\" * Also in 2007, Bruyere et al. without using explicit methodology for reviewing trials concluded \\"there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA.\\" The effectiveness of glucosamine is controversial. Most recent reviews found it to be equal to or only slightly better than placebo. A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence no longer recommends its use although the Arthritis Foundation compares the effectiveness of glucosamine to traditional NSAID therapy. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option according to some experts. Chondroitin is not recommended as a treatment for osteoarthritis. Guidelines prior to recent studies Prior to publication of the negative review by Reichenbach and the equivocal GAIT trial, clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of chondroitin. The OARSI (OsteoArthritis Research Society International) recommended chondroitin sulfate as the second-most-effective treatment for moderate cases of osteoarthritis (although the guidelines were published in 2008, the developers closed their search date in January 2006 ‚Äì prior to the GAIT trial). In 2003, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) supported the usefulness of chondroitin sulfate in the management of knee osteoarthritis and granted the highest level of evidence, 1A, and strength of the recommendation, A, to this product. GAIT trial (2006 ‚Äì 2010) The major trial included in the two reviews above was the Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention, or GAIT Trial. GAIT was funded by the National Institutes of Health to test the effects of chondroitin and glucosamine on osteoarthritis of the knee. It reported initially in 2006, with further findings in 2008 and again in 2010. This multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, six-month-long trial found that glucosamine plus chondroitin had no statistically significant effect on symptoms of osteoarthritis in the osteoarthritis patients studied. The study, in addition to an inactive placebo, also included an active control, the FDA- approved prescription analgesic drug celecoxib. The researchers found that those taking the active control drug fared no better or worse than those taking glucosamine, glucosamine and chondroitin combined or the inactive placebo. However, in the moderate-to-severe pain subgroup, the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine was found to be clinically more effective (in 25% of the patients) in treating pain than celecoxib or chondroitin and glucosamine taken individually. Due to small sample sizes in the sub-group (roughly 250 people), the researchers concluded that this needs further validation. The study also found chondroitin sulfate to have no significant effect in reducing joint swelling, effusion, or both. These results indicate that glucosamine and chondroitin do not effectively relieve pain in the overall group of osteoarthritis patients, though it may be an effective treatment for those suffering from moderate-to-severe pain. In a follow-up study, 572 patients from the GAIT Trial continued the supplementation for two years. After two years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint space width, when compared to a placebo. However, no patient group, placebo or glucosamine alone, or in combination, experienced joint space width loss at even half the rate expected during this study, making it difficult to assess the clinical effectiveness of any treatment on the progression of OA. In another two-year follow-up study, there was no significant pain reduction or improved function when compared to either inactive placebo or celecoxib Some of the researchers' ties to Pfizer (which makes celecoxib) have brought into question the validity of the study. The lead author of the GAIT Trial, Allen D. Sawitzke, MD, expressed his disappointment with unexpectedly equivocal findings of the trial, noting in an interview with the Arthritis Foundation, that because of significant limitations, like a small sample size, the GAIT Trial likely didn‚Äôt have enough power to determine whether glucosamine and chondroitin are effective treatments for knee osteoarthritis or not. The LEGS study (2007 ‚Äì 2011) The Long-term Evaluation of Glucosamine Sulfate (LEGS) study ran between 2007 and 2011, to study whether glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate or a combination of both are effective treatments for chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis. 502 patients (from 605 enrolled) were followed for two years. The main outcomes were disease progression, as measured by joint space narrowing (JSN) and knee pain (VAS). The combination treatment did result in a small but statistically significant (0.1 mm) decrease in 2-year JSN compared with placebo but there was no difference in JSN between this group and the other treatment groups and no differences between any group for changes in knee pain. In summary, there was no significant symptomatic benefit detected for these dietary supplements, and a longer study would be required to test the efficacy of both supplements combined.

Five years later, in 1883, it was decided that a choir would be created. Arthur Grimshaw became the first choir master and organist of Leeds cathedral. Because of his role of the founder of cathedral musical heritage he was regarded by the congregation at Leeds Cathedral as the 'father' of the cathedral's music. He remained as the organist and master of the cathedral choir when the original cathedral was demolished in 1899 and a new one built. When he had to be at the organ console for a piece of music, the choir was conducted by Austin Mahoney.Leeds Cathedral from Discovering Leeds, retrieved 20 May 2014 He was one of the first conductors of the Leeds Symphony Society (now the Leeds Symphony Orchestra) which was founded in 1890.

He remained as choir master and organist for thirty years, until his death in July 1913. He was succeeded as organist by Henry Alban Chambers, from Grimshaw's choir. At the time of his appointment, Chambers was eleven years old. Artist Grimshaw followed his father's style by painting moonlight scenes and winter landscapes. His paintings focused on the streets and docklands of large northern cities in Britain including Glasgow, Liverpool and Leeds. However, unlike his father who had work exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, he is not known to have any of his work exhibited in London.Arthur E.

Death Grimshaw was found dead on Hawksworth Moor, near Ilkley, West Riding of Yorkshire , on Friday, August 1st, 1913. The month before, on July 8th, he had left his sister's house in Caledonian Road, Leeds, where he lodged, without informing his sister of his departure. She became alarmed the following day when he had failed to return home the previous evening. West Riding police were informed of the mysterious disappearance and extensive enquiries failed to locate Mr Grimshaw.

He is best known as the author of a Slavic etymological dictionary (letters A-Mor, 1908-1913). In it he collected the inherited Slavic vocabulary, put it into the context of the Indo-European language family, and discussed the most important loanwords in Slavic languages. Although incomplete, this dictionary was of essential influence on the future work in the Slavic etymological studies. He died in Munich.

He was a multi- instrumentalist and usually played all the instruments on his musical recordings.  Background  After leaving school in 1963, Phil Cordell joined North London band Steve Douglas and the Challengers as a guitarist. The band soon morphed into The Prophets, but saw no mainstream success. Following this, Cordell formed a band called Tuesday's Children, and following a few single releases he left in 1967 to go solo. His first single, \\"Pumping the Water\\" was released in 1969 (although is sometimes credited under its B-side \\"Red Lady\\"). On this he was the sole instrumentalist, playing all the instruments himself as well as doing the vocals. Much of his subsequent work would be without vocals. In 1971, under the name Springwater he released the single \\"I Will Return\\" which gave him his first hit, reaching No. 5 in the UK, No. 1 in Switzerland and top three in Germany and the Netherlands. Under this name he released three more singles as well as his debut album Springwater in 1972, none of these could repeat the success however. In 1973 (after a one-off single under the name Variation) he reverted to performing under his own name and released a single \\"Close to You\\" on Motown spin-off label MoWest Records. Concurrent to this he released another single \\"Dan the Banjo Man\\" on another Motown spin-off Rare Earth Records. This single was released under the moniker Dan the Banjo Man and although failed to chart in the UK, became a number one hit in Germany. During 1974 and 1975 he released a number of other singles under both his own name and Dan the Banjo Man, releasing an album under the latter. Around this time he also assisted with production on the Tucky Buzzard album Allright on the Night. In 1977, under his own name he released another album Born Again, but this would prove to be his last album. After a few more singles in the late 1970s he once again performed under the name Springwater, releasing two singles in 1980. None of these found commercial success however. Cordell carried on performing and in 2005 recorded a number of new tracks for a CD release of the Dan the Banjo Man album, including a remake of the title track with his son Charlie. Cordell died on 31 March 2007, leaving behind three children.

He is known as the \\"bionic chef\\" because he cooks with a prosthetic left arm, the result of an accident while hunting in 2011.  Early life  Eduardo Garcia was born in 1981, the son of a Mexican fisherman and chef father and an astrologer, Montessori Teacher and author mother. He grew up in Bozeman, Montana. Part-time job choices there are limited, so Garcia elected to work on the Chico Hot Springs ranch as a prep chef. After high school, Garcia went to college at The Art Institute of Seattle. During college, he worked at a Japanese cafe called Saitos. Career =Early career= While in college, Garcia was offered a job as chef of a 107-foot yacht called Dorothea. He accepted and, upon graduation, spent two and half years aboard the ship. From there, he spent the next decade working as a chef on various private yachts. His job allowed him to travel the world, learning about different ethnic cuisines along the way. Garcia co- founded Montana Mex, a Mexican-inspired line of flavored salts, salsas and hot sauces, upon returning to Montana in 2010. He also began creating a cooking show to be called Active Ingredient. Garcia describes his food as fun, simple, exploratory, and always influenced by the local environment. =Hunting accident= On October 9, 2011, while bow-hunting elk in the Montana backcountry, Garcia came across the dry remains of a bear. Attempting to remove a claw with his knife, he received a severe electrical shock from a 2400-volt power line hidden underneath its carcass. He was knocked to the ground and severely burned. He remembers telling himself to get up, but after that his memory is incomplete - the next thing he remembers is walking on a road a mile away from the accident spot. By the time he found help, Garcia had walked three miles. \\"I was scared,\\" he later recalled, \\"but I was set on learning how to survive\\". While in hospital, Garcia was also diagnosed with stage two testicular cancer. The cancer required him to put his surgeries on hold to undergo three months of chemotherapy. He recalls, \\"I had to get through [the cancer] to get back to business, which was surgery and recovery of self.\\" =Career since accident= Garcia was fitted with a simple prosthetic hook. Although he is right-handed, Garcia quickly found that he could not do everything he could before, but continued to work as a chef. He slowly re-learned basic tasks like chopping and dicing. In September 2013, Garcia was fitted with a bionic hand designed by Touch Bionics and fitted by Advanced Arm Dynamics. The new hand is controlled by Garcia's forearm muscles and is capable of gripping 25 different ways. It allows him to perform tasks requiring a great deal of manual dexterity. The accident made him a more humble person and more willing to rely on other members of his team in the kitchen. Garcia also resumed work on his Active Ingredient pilot. In the show, he draws on his life experiences and his enjoyment of the outdoors to promote healthy food and an active lifestyle. He also preaches \\"a can-do attitude\\" of giving \\"it all you‚Äôve got ... and [having] fun doing it.\\" As of 2013, Garcia was actively searching for a TV network interested in airing the show. In 2014, Garcia decided his five-fingered bionic hand was not ideal for cooking ‚Äì it was not waterproof and got cut on several occasions ‚Äì and switched to a bionic hook instead. \\"When you're cooking ... it's a dance almost,\\" he explains. \\"With the hand I just didn't feel fluid, whereas with the hook ... I just rock and roll again.\\" Montana Mex is due to be launched in stores throughout the United States. Media attention In September 2013, Garcia's story was featured on The Huffington Post. In November, he was profiled by People magazine. In December, he appeared on Good Morning America and his story was featured in Fox News Latino. In January 2014, he appeared on The Chew In May, he appeared on Katie. Garcia has also appeared on Hallmark Channel‚Äôs \\"Home & Family\\" and his recipes have appeared on HGTV.com, Refinery29, and Latina.com. In 2015 a Kickstarter campaign was used to fund a documentary feature film about Garcia. The resulting film, Charged: The Eduardo Garcia Story, was released in 2018.Kickstarter Accessed October 26, 2018 Personal life Garcia is an avid outdoorsman and hunter. He enjoys hiking, surfing, and skate boarding. He has volunteered with the Challenged Athletes Foundation and Common Threads, a program that teaches children in under privileged communities how to cook healthy meals.

Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana. The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area; it is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico, and has been introduced from South America to Puerto Rico and is very common throughout the island, where it is colloquially known as gallina de palo (\\"bamboo chicken\\" or \\"chicken of the trees\\") and considered an invasive species; in the United States, feral populations also exist in South Florida (including the Florida Keys), Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Green iguanas have also successfully colonised the island of Anguilla, arriving on the island in 1995 after rafting across the Caribbean from Guadeloupe. A herbivore, it has adapted significantly with regard to locomotion and osmoregulation as a result of its diet. It grows to in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than with bodyweights upward of . Commonly found in captivity as a pet due to its calm disposition and bright colors, it can be very demanding to care for properly. Space requirements and the need for special lighting and heat can prove challenging to the hobbyist. right right right Taxonomy and etymology The species was first officially described by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. In the two centuries since then, numerous subspecies have been identified, but later classified as merely regional variants of the same species. Using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-sequence data to explore the phylogenic history of the green iguana, scientists from El Salvador, Mexico and the United States studied animals collected from 17 different countries. The topology of phylogeny indicated that the species originated in South America and eventually radiated through Central America and the Caribbean. The study revealed no unique mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for subspecific status, but did indicate the deep lineage divergence between Central and South American populations. Naturalists once classified the Central American iguanas as a separate subspecies (Iguana iguana rhinolopha), the horned Mexican iguana; however, this classification was later thought to be invalid based on mitochondrial DNA and iguanas with similar nose projections appearing randomly in other populations and interbreeding freely with those that do not share this trait. However, genetic studies in the late 2010s recovered I. rhinolopha as a distinct species, along with several other cryptic lineages present in I. iguana. This indicates that only the South American populations may be the \\"true\\" green iguana. Two new insular subspecies were also identified in 2019, endemic to St. Lucia and the Grenadines. A 2020 study also recovered both these subspecies as part of a distinct species, the southern Antillean horned iguana (I. insularis). The study also found the Saban black iguana (I. melanoderma), described in that study, to be the sister group of South American I. iguana, with the clade containing both being sister to that of I. insularis. The word iguana is derived from a Spanish form of the Ta√≠no name for the species: iwana. In some Spanish-speaking countries, males of the species are referred to as gorrobo or ministro and juveniles are called iguanita or gorrobito. Distribution and habitat Green iguana in Maracaibo The native range of the green iguana extends from southern Mexico to central Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia and the Caribbean; specifically Grenada, Aruba, Cura√ßao, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and √ötila. They have been introduced to Grand Cayman, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Scholar search Furthermore, green iguanas colonised the island of Anguilla in 1995 after being washed ashore following a hurricane. Though the species is not native to Martinique, a small wild colony of released or escaped green iguanas endures at historic Fort Saint Louis. In South and Central America, where the green iguana is native, it is an endangered species in some countries because people have been hunting and eating this gallino de palo (\\"bamboo chicken\\" or \\"chicken of the trees\\") for a long time. Green iguanas are diurnal, arboreal, and are often found near water. Agile climbers, Iguana iguana can fall up to and land unhurt (iguanas use their hind leg claws to clasp leaves and branches to break a fall). During cold, wet weather, green iguanas prefer to stay on the ground for greater warmth. When swimming, an iguana remains submerged, letting its four legs hang limply against its side. They propel through the water with powerful tail strokes. While they may often be found in trees, these animals are well-known burrowers. The size of their burrow can range from between 0.3 and 2.4 m deep, with a diameter of 10 to 20 cm. They have been observed burrowing in canals, levees, and dikes and along seawalls in southern Florida. If an individual does not dig their own, they may even use gopher tortoise burrows or usurp those of the Florida burrowing owl.

A few large males can reach or exceed in weight and long.Green Iguana ‚Äì Iguana iguana : WAZA : World Association of Zoos and Aquariums . WAZA. Retrieved on 2012-08-22. Some specimens have even reportedly been measured at a body weight of greater than . Despite their name, green iguanas can come in different colours and types. In southern countries of their range, such as Peru, green iguanas appear bluish in colour with bold blue markings. On islands such as Bonaire, Cura√ßao, Aruba, and Grenada, a green iguana's colour may range from green to lavender, black, and even reddish brown. Green iguanas from the western region of Costa Rica are red, and animals of the northern ranges, such as Mexico, appear orange. Juvenile green iguanas from El Salvador are often bright blue as babies, but they lose this color as they get older. Adult iguanas found on most of St. Lucia, mainly on the northeastern coast, Louvette and Grand Anse, have many differences from other green iguana populations. They are light green with predominant black stripes. Instead of the typical orange dewlap, the iguanas of St. Lucia have a black dewlap. When compared to the common green iguana, females lay about half the amount of eggs, 25 instead of 50. Scales to the back of their head, near the jawbone, are smaller. Their iris is white or cream, whereas other green iguanas have yellow irises. Green iguanas possess a row of spines along their backs and along their tails, which helps to protect them from predators. Their whip-like tails can be used to deliver painful strikes and like many other lizards, when grabbed by the tail, the iguana can allow it to break, so it can escape and eventually regenerate a new one. In addition, iguanas have a well-developed dewlap, which helps regulate their body temperature. This dewlap is used in courtships and territorial displays. Male with spines and dewlap close-up of the head Green iguanas have excellent vision, enabling them to detect shapes and motions at long distances. As green iguanas have only a few rod cells, they have poor vision in low-light conditions. At the same time, they have cells called ‚Äúdouble cone cells‚Äù that give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelengths. This ability is highly useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of UVA and UVB to produce vitamin D. Green iguanas have a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye (also called the third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland), in contrast to most other lizards that have lost this primitive feature. This \\"eye\\" has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images, but is sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement. This helps the iguana detect predators stalking it from above. Green iguanas have very sharp teeth that are capable of shredding leaves and even human skin. These teeth are shaped like a leaf, broad and flat, with serrations on the edge. The similarity of these teeth to those of one of the first dinosaurs discovered led to the dinosaur being named Iguanodon, meaning \\"iguana tooth\\", and the incorrect assumption that it had resembled a gigantic iguana. The teeth are situated on the inner sides of the jawbones, which is why they are hard to see in smaller specimens. In Palo Verde National Park, Costa Rica Primarily herbivorous, green iguanas are presented with a special problem for osmoregulation; plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet metabolic needs. As green iguanas are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, like birds they excrete nitrogenous wastes as urate salts through a salt gland. As a result, green iguanas have developed a lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride. Green iguanas from Guatemala and southern Mexico (which may belong to the distinct species I. rhinolopha) predominantly have small horns on their snouts between their eyes and their nostrils, whereas others do not. Reproductive biology Juvenile green iguana, Grand Cayman Male green iguanas have highly developed femoral pores on the underside of their thighs which secrete a scent (females have femoral pores, but they are smaller in comparison to those of the males). In addition, the dorsal spines that run along a green iguana's back are noticeably longer and thicker in males than they are in females, making the animals somewhat sexually dimorphic. Male green iguanas tend to display more dominant behaviors, such as head bobbing and tail whipping. They also tend to develop a taller dorsal crest than females, as well as taller dorsal spines (or spikes). Large, round, very pronounced jowls are generally a male characteristic. Jowls are located under the jaw and are protected by the subtympanic plate, which is a large, green, circular-shaped scale. Green iguanas are oviparous, with females laying clutches of 20 to 71 eggs once per year during a synchronized nesting period. The female green iguana gives no parental protection after egg laying, apart from defending the nesting burrow during excavation. In Panama, the green iguana has been observed sharing nest sites with American crocodiles and in Honduras with spectacled caimans. The hatchlings emerge from the nest after 10‚Äì15 weeks of incubation. Once hatched, the young iguanas look similar to the adults in color and shape, resembling adult females more so than males and lacking dorsal spines. Juveniles stay in familial groups for the first year of their lives. Male green iguanas in these groups often use their own bodies to shield and protect females from predators and it appears to be the only species of reptile which does this. Behavior Reddish-colored green iguana When frightened by a predator, green iguanas will attempt to flee and, if near a body of water, dive into it and swim away. If cornered by a threat, the green iguana will extend and display the dewlap under its neck, stiffen and puff up its body, hiss, and bob its head at the aggressor. If the threat persists, the iguana can lash with its tail, bite and use its claws in defense. The wounded are more inclined to fight than uninjured prey. Green iguanas use \\"head bobs\\" and dewlaps in a variety of ways in social interactions, such as greeting another iguana or to court a possible mate. The frequency and number of head bobs have particular meanings to other iguanas. Green iguanas are hunted by predatory birds, and their fear of these is exploited as a ploy to catch them in the wild. A hunter will imitate the sound of a hawk by whistling or screaming, causing the iguana to freeze and making it easier to capture. Diet Green iguana eating Bougainvillea leaves Green iguanas are primarily herbivores, with captives feeding on leaves such as turnip greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of upwards of 100 different species of plant. In Panama, one of the green iguana's favorite foods is the wild plum (Spondias mombin). Although they will consume a wide variety of foods if offered, green iguanas are naturally herbivorous and require a precise ratio of minerals (2 to 1 calcium to phosphorus) in their diet. It is important for captive iguanas to have a variety of leafy greens along with fruits and vegetables such as turnip greens, collards, butternut squash, acorn squash, mango, and parsnip. Juvenile iguanas often eat feces from adults in order to acquire the essential microflora to digest their low-quality and hard-to-process vegetarian-only diet. There is some debate as to whether captive green iguanas should be fed animal protein. There is evidence of wild iguanas eating grasshoppers and tree snails, usually as a byproduct of eating plant material. Wild adult green iguanas have been observed eating birds' eggs. Zoologists, such as Adam Britton, believe that such a diet containing protein is unhealthy for the animal's digestive system, resulting in severe long-term health damage, including kidney failure and leading to premature death. On the other side of the argument is that green iguanas at the Miami Seaquarium in Key Biscayne, Florida, have been observed eating dead fish and individuals kept in captivity have been known to eat mice without any ill effects. De Vosjoli writes that captive animals have been known to survive and thrive on eating nothing but whole rodent block, or monkey chow, and one instance of romaine lettuce with vitamin and calcium supplements. However, it is only recommended that captive iguanas not be fed lettuce or meat, and instead receive the vitamins and minerals they need via a purely herbivorous diet. Captivity terrarium The American pet trade has put a great demand on the green iguana; 800,000 iguanas were imported into the U.S. in 1995 alone, primarily originating from captive farming operations based in their native countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, and Panama). However, these animals are demanding to care for properly over their lifetime, and many die within a few years of acquisition. Although green iguanas in captivity will eat meat if presented with it, excessive consumption of animal protein results in severe kidney problems and possible premature death. Misinformed pet owners tend to feed iguanas iceberg lettuce, which provides iguanas with water, but has little nutritional value compared to other vegetables. A captive green iguana's diet should consist of fresh leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, collard greens, dandelion, arugula, or kale, and access to fresh water. Green iguanas will thrive only in temperatures of to and must have appropriate sources of UVB and UVA lighting, or else their bodies cannot produce vitamin D that promotes calcium absorption, which can result in a metabolic bone disease that can be fatal. In some locales (such as New York City and Hawaii), iguanas are considered exotic pets, and ownership is prohibited. Due to the potential impact of an introduced species on Hawaii's ecosystem, the state has strict regulations regarding the import and possession of green iguanas; violators can spend three years in jail and be fined up to $200,000. As an invasive species Young juvenile green iguana, found indoors in Cura√ßao At the Botanical Garden at Portoviejo, Ecuador At alt= =Caribbean= In the aftermath of Hurricane Luis and Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, a raft of uprooted trees carrying 15 or more green iguanas landed on the eastern side of Anguilla ‚Äì an island where green iguanas had never been recorded before. These iguanas were apparently accidentally caught on the trees and rafted 200 miles across the ocean from Guadeloupe, where green iguanas are indigenous. Examination of the weather patterns and ocean currents indicated that the iguanas had probably spent three weeks at sea before arriving on Anguilla. This new colony began breeding on the island within two years of its arrival. In February 2012, the government of Puerto Rico proposed that the islands' iguanas, which were said to have a population of 4 million and considered to be a non-native nuisance, be eradicated and sold for meat. =Fiji= The green iguana is present as an invasive species on some of the islands of Fiji, where it is known as the American iguana. They pose a threat to the native iguanas through the potential spread of disease and to humans by spreading salmonella. They were initially brought to Qamea in 2000 by an American who wanted them to eat the numerous insects on the island, although they are primarily vegetarian. They are now on the islands of Laucala, Matagi and Taveuni. =United States= The green iguana is established on Oahu and Maui, Hawaii, as a feral species, despite strict legislation banning the importation of any reptiles, and in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. As most reptiles carry salmonella, this is a concern and a reason legislation has been sought to regulate the trade in green iguanas. Due to a combination of events, the green iguana is considered an invasive species in South Florida and is found along the east coast, as well as the Gulf Coast, of Florida from Key West to Pinellas County. The original small populations in the Florida Keys were stowaways on ships carrying fruit from South America. Over the years, other iguanas were introduced into the wild, mostly originating through the pet trade. Some escaped and some were intentionally released by their owners; these iguanas survived and then thrived in their new habitat. They commonly hide in the attics of houses and on beaches. They often destroy gardens and landscaping. They seem to be fond of eating a native endangered plant, Cordia globosa, and feeding on nickernut (Caesalpinia) a primary food plant of the endangered Miami blue butterfly (Cyclargus thomasi bethunebakeri); additionally on Marco Island, green iguanas have been observed using the burrows of the Florida burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia floridana), a species of special concern, all of which can make them more of a serious threat to Florida's ecosystem than originally believed. In January 2008, large numbers of iguanas established in Florida dropped from the trees in which they lived, due to uncommonly cold nights that put them in a state of torpor and caused them to lose their grip on the tree branches. Though no specific numbers were provided by local wildlife officials, local media described the phenomenon as a \\"frozen iguana shower\\" in which dozens \\"littered\\" local bike paths. Upon the return of daytime warmth, many (but not all) of the iguanas \\"woke up\\" and resumed their normal activities. This occurred again in January 2010 and January 2018 after a prolonged cold front once again hit southern Florida.  Conservation  The green iguana is listed within Appendix II by CITES, indicating that it is beneficial to regulate trade of this species to ensure that the species does not become threatened. In addition, the green iguana is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, with a mention of habitat depletion from development being a possible concern for green iguana populations in the future.Bock, B., Malone, CL, Knapp, C., Aparicio, J., Avila-Pires, T.C.S., Cacciali, P., Caicedo, J.R., Chaves, G., Cisneros-Heredia, D.F., Guti√©rrez-C√°rdenas, P., Lamar, W., Moravec, J., Perez, P., Porras, L.W., Rivas, G., Scott, N., Sol√≥rzano, A. & Sunyer, J. 2018.

Historically, green iguana meat and eggs have been eaten as a source of protein throughout their native range, and are prized for their alleged medicinal and aphrodisiac properties. Efforts to raise green iguanas in the past have been made to raise green iguanas in captivity as a food source in an attempt to encourage more sustainable land use in Panama and Costa Rica. Cultural references Although eating green iguanas is forbidden in Nicaragua, they are available in markets The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted green iguanas in their art.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames & Hudson, 1997. The green iguana and its relative the black iguana (Ctenosaura similis) have been used as a food source in Central and South America for the past 7,000 years. It is possible that some of the populations in the Caribbean were translocated there from the mainland by various tribes as a food source. In Central and South America, green iguanas are still used as a source of meat and are often referred to as gallina de palo (\\"bamboo chicken\\" or \\"chicken of the trees\\"), because they are said to taste like chicken.

Wolf is the federal lawsuit that successfully challenged the Pennsylvania Marriage Laws, as amended in 1996 to ban same-sex marriage. The district court's decision in May 2014 held that the Marriage Laws violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. Same-sex couples immediately sought and received marriage licenses and the decision was not appealed. One county clerk sought repeatedly without success to intervene to defend the law. Lawsuit On July 9, 2013, following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, the ACLU filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of 23 plaintiffs‚Äî10 couples, 2 of their children, and a widow‚Äîseeking to overturn Pennsylvania's 1996 statutory ban on same-sex marriage. The case, originally Whitewood v. Corbett, was assigned to Judge John E. Jones III. On July 11, Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a named defendant, said that she would not defend the statute as she \\"endorse[d] equality and anti-discrimination laws\\" and that the statute was \\"wholly unconstitutional\\". On July 30, Governor Tom Corbett announced he would defend the statute. Pretrial motions All parties agreed to having Corbett's name removed as a defendant. The remaining named defendants are the state health and revenue secretaries, and the Bucks County register of wills. On November 15, Judge Jones rejected the state defendants' motion to dismiss the suit. The judge found that while Baker v. Nelson was precedent, it did not require him to find that denial of marriage equality is outside federal jurisdiction because \\"[t]he jurisprudence of equal protection and substantive due process has undergone what can only be characterized as a sea change since 1972\\", foremost being the recent Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Windsor. In early December, the state's attorneys asked Jones to allow them to ask the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on whether Baker v. Nelson is binding precedent. Judge Jones denied this interlocutory appeal on December 17, writing \\"this Court is rightfully in position to consider and assess such doctrinal advancements [since Baker].\\" On April 21, 2014, plaintiff same-sex couples filed a motion for summary judgment in Whitewood v. Wolf, which would allow the court to rule solely on the briefs without a trial. The state defendants agreed to dispense with trial as well. U.S. district court ruling On May 20, 2014, Judge Jones ruled in Whitewood v. Wolf that Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional. He applied intermediate scrutiny and declared that the ban violates the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. The ruling was not stayed and same-sex couples in Pennsylvania could request and receive marriage licenses immediately and marry after a mandatory 3-day waiting period. Anticipating legal maneuvers to stay Jones' ruling, dozens of same-sex couples applied for marriage licenses the same day and some obtained waivers of the state's three-day waiting period. At least one couple managed to celebrate their wedding on May 21. Pennsylvania's Republican Governor Tom Corbett announced on May 21 that he would not appeal Judge Jones' decision, effectively making Pennsylvania the 19th state to recognize same-sex marriage. Proposed intervention On June 6, the Schuylkill County court clerk responsible for responding to marriage license applications, Theresa Santai- Gaffney, filed a motion before Judge Jones to allow her to intervene in the case in her official capacity. She wanted the court to stay its decision in Whitewood v. Wolf and to allow her appeal it. Judge Jones denied the motion on June 18, lamenting that a private citizen would use her public office to make a \\"wholly disingenuous\\" intervention. Santai-Gaffney immediately appealed the denial of her intervention to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and asked it to stay the lower court's ruling. She argued that the Supreme Court's order in Herbert v. Kitchen, 134 S.Ct. 893 (2014), is precedent for a stay, that she is likely to succeed on the merits, that sexual orientation is not a suspect class, and that the public interest is served by preventing same-sex marriage. The Third Circuit immediately ordered the case sent to a panel to determine if summary action was warranted. =Court of Appeals dismissal= On July 3, a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit summarily affirmed Judge Jones' dismissal of the Santai-Gaffney's motion to intervene in Whitewood and ordered her appeal dismissed. U.S. Circuit Judge Patty Shwartz, in a two-sentence order, said such dismissal was warranted \\"[f]or essentially the reasons set forth in the Opinion of the District Court.\\" Santai-Gaffney's lawyer then said \\"Our plan is to file something with the U.S. Supreme Court... The people of Pennsylvania deserve to have adequate review of this law.\\" =U.S. Supreme Court action= After the Third Circuit ruling, Santai-Gaffney applied for a stay of judgment from U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit, docketed sub nom. Santai-Gaffney v. Whitewood, No. 14A19 (July 7, 2014). In her application, the clerk attempted to overcome not only the questions of her interest in intervening and standing to appeal, but that she, as a public official, is suffering irreparable harm. Supreme Court rules also require it probable that four Justices grant certiorari on any question presented in order for a stay to be granted. The counsel of record in clerk Santai-Gaffney's litigation, as listed in court filings, is the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit organization. On July 9, Justice Alito denied the clerk's application for a stay, referencing National Organization for Marriage v. Geiger.Supreme Court of the United States: No. 14A19, Santai-Gaffney v. Whitewood, accessed July 10, 2014 =Petition for rehearing= On July 17, 2014, Santai-Gaffney filed a petition in the Third Circuit to rehear her motion to intervene, or to rehear it en banc. With no judge that concurred in denying the original motion asking for rehearing, and all active judges in the circuit voting against, on August 4, 2014, the petition for rehearing was denied.

The title is a play on the film The 40-Year-Old Virgin and the skit 2000 Year Old Man. In the episode, Peter lets Jesus have sex with his wife Lois after Jesus repeats his annual tradition of lying to a friend that he is still a virgin. Plot On a trip to the Quahog Mall before Christmas, Peter and Lois bump into Jesus and discover that he is still hanging around Quahog due to not being entirely comfortable dealing with his own home life with God. Jesus invites Peter over to his place. However, since it is a depressing bachelor apartment, Peter invites him out with Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to have a drink. At the Drunken Clam, they start planning a birthday party for Jesus, and Jesus tells them that he has never had sex: to make his birthday special, they promise to help him lose his virginity. Their attempts to achieve this through speed dating fail, upsetting Peter. Lois tries to find out what Jesus likes, but her nice manners cause him to want to sleep with her. Approaching Peter about his issue to help him, Peter is shocked but agrees to help when Jesus promises him an expensive massage chair in return for sleeping with Lois. He lets Lois know about Jesus' interest in her and she reluctantly agrees. As they head out together, Peter enjoys his chair at the Drunken Clam. During this time, Peter has a fantasy of Lois and Jesus having sex and has second thoughts. Other people at the bar confirm to Peter that Jesus is not a virgin, but pulls this annual stunt every Christmas by bribing men with gifts just so he can sleep with their wives. Peter tries multiple ways to get to their liaison to stop things. Peter rushes to the room to find that no cheating took place as Lois decided that their marriage was too good. Jesus applauds them for learning their ‚Äúlesson‚Äù that he intended, making the excuse that he concocted this charade as a test for them to appreciate loved ones and resist temptation, then Jesus says \\"Who cares? I'm not even real\\", and leaves. On Christmas Day, Rupert gives Stewie a Joni Mitchell CD for Christmas, disappointing him because Stewie had observed Rupert picking out a heart-shaped necklace. As Stewie tearfully listens to \\"Both Sides, Now\\" on the CD, he wonders whom the necklace was for, and it is revealed to be for Mayor Adam West.

Tianna DiMartino of the Media Research Center was strongly critical of the episode, saying \\"MacFarlane, the liberal atheist behind Family Guy, seems to be feeling especially spiteful this Christmas, going above and beyond the usual sacrilege...Family Guy is known for constantly crossing the lines with vulgarity and blasphemy but thus far this latest \\"Christmas\\" episode takes the cake for most blasphemous and vulgar\\".

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 4, 2015, and is written by Alex Carter and directed by Joe Vaux. In the episode, Stewie and Brian take Chris back in time so he can perform well in a history exam. The title is a play on the time travel film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Plot Chris Griffin gives his parents Peter and Lois a note stating that Principal Shepherd wants to speak with them. At school, Principal Shepherd tells Peter and Lois that Chris is at a \\"D-\\" average and will have to repeat the 9th grade unless he passes his history class finals overseen by Mr. Harpington. Peter tries to coach him through to no avail. With Chris left to his own devices, Stewie and Brian quiz him and realize he needs extreme help. Stewie decides to take him for a tour of history in the time machine. Sneaking into his room, they tell him he is dreaming and take off for the past, and Chris believes there are no consequences, and cuts off his own arm. Stewie and Brian fix Chris' mistake and tells them he's dreaming with their consequences. Prior to departure, Stewie tells Rupert he's \\"just going on a business trip.\\" Stopping off in 1803 at one of the locations on Chris' history final, they observe U.S. President Thomas Jefferson trying to convince the U.S. Congress to approve the Louisiana Purchase. In Paris during 1920, they meet Ernest Hemingway who is in good spirits until Brian's prattle drives him to suicide (though Brian does manage to get his pen). Brian and Stewie then take Chris to Brazil before the invention of the soccer ball, Australia before the invention of the shark-tooth necklace, and Italy before the invention of pasta where Stewie calls the Italians a ridiculous people, causing a live-action sequence where Tony Sirico, angered at the Italian joke that was made, warns Stewie about it. Then they visit 1776 during George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River where George Washington is wearing arm floaties. They visit 1944 on D-Day where they witness \\"Double D-Day\\" as big-breasted females in bikinis cause the Germans to stop shooting while the Warrant song \\"Cherry Pie\\" plays. The boys stop to visit Jane Austen to release their time-travel farts. While there, they find that she is attracted to the farts which help inspire her to write Pride & Prejudice. Arriving in the 1990s, Stewie, Brian, and Chris witness a man dancing to Go West's \\"King of Wishful Thinking\\". During the time travel, Brian takes a detour to kill Ivan Pavlov for his experiments on dogs. After an unseen visit to the British Parliament, Stewie gives money to a young Adolf Hitler (whom he mistakes for a young Charlie Chaplin). When they find Chris has learned nothing from the trip (and has no idea what he is being prepared for), Stewie calls Chris a moron. This angers Chris so much that he leaves and boards the RMS Titanic with Stewie's return pad, leaving them to board the ship to stop him. Barely catching a mooring rope, they climb aboard to split up to search for Chris; Stewie tells Brian to go down to the steerage and wade through the \\"gross Irish and Italians\\", leading the live- action Sirico to warn Stewie a second time: \\"That's two\\". Brian searches the lower parts of the deck containing Irish Peter Griffin look-a-likes and makes his way to the ball room where he finds Stewie dining at the Captain's Table with Captain Edward Smith. The two of them then find Chris at another table and convince him to return. Chris wants to know why they cannot avoid the disaster as Stewie tries to make up an excuse about not altering the past. Before Stewie, Brian, and Chris can return to the present, the ship strikes the iceberg and the return pad is destroyed by the rushing water. They find they need to get it to dry land to repair it. Dressing as women, they head for the lifeboats, but find they are too late. This causes Chris to force room for them all in the last boat by throwing a crew member overboard where he comments that he can't swim without his striped one-piece. Stewie apologizes to his brother for calling him a moron and compliments his physical strength. Repairing the return pad and returning to the present, Chris returns to sleep briefly and wakes up still not knowing history after explaining his \\"dream\\" to Brian and Stewie. While going on the computer to look up the casualties of the Titanic, Brian and Stewie find out that the crew member Chris had thrown overboard was a man named Nigel Harpington, and assume that he must be the ancestor of Chris' history teacher, Mr. Harpington. Therefore, Chris has a new history teacher in the form of a hippie who goes by \\"Teacher Doug\\" and claims that he doesn't believe in tests, to which Chris says \\"Yay\\". Superimposed words then appear stating \\"All history facts in this episode were gathered by quick glances at Wikipedia. To learn more about history, check out Yahoo!

When he arrives in the village, Chris forgets what he is going to say and assumes that the news is that Brian is getting another book published. After Chris leaves, the villagers are relieved that the news is not another \\"Meg episode\\". Peter tries to get Brian to look on the bright side of being less intelligent, and together they do low-brow activities like watching a demolition derby and visiting Orlando, Florida. However, Stewie is puzzled about Brian's change in attitude as being very uncharacteristic of him. When Brian suffers a massive nosebleed and collapses, he is rushed to the hospital and Dr. Hartman reveals that Brian has a benign brain tumor, which has caused the decline in his intelligence. The family members are split on whether Brian should have the surgery to remove it, with Stewie wanting Brian to return to his old self and Brian enjoying his newfound life of enjoyable stupidity. Stewie uses the lure of a fake Kenny Chesney concert to take Brian to \\"cultured\\" activities like the opera, yoga, and an upscale restaurant instead. However, Brian fully embraces being less intelligent and Stewie gives up and decides to adjust to the new reality, until Brian and Peter decide to enjoy a garage-set \\"London Fog\\" night where they'll take long and deep breaths as the exhaust from the car envelopes them, and Stewie realizes Brian's behavior is actually going to kill him. Deciding to use his stupidity against him, he tricks Brian into getting the operation by claiming that it was an operation to graft him another penis. Brian agrees to come along as he could watch Black Swan and shoot one load at Natalie Portman and another load at Mila Kunis (Stewie interrupts before Brian can say her name). At the hospital, Brian is returned to his normal pretentious self, and sarcastically thanks Stewie for taking away his life of restful sleep and much casual sex and returning him to being a pompous alcoholic who can only hang out with a baby. Peter comes in stating that he has gotten the two-penis surgery, but the original one falls off. Reception The episode received an audience of 4.12 million, making it the second most watched show on Fox that night after The Simpsons episode \\"Bart's New Friend\\". Seth MacFarlane's role in the episode was nominated for the Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.

A composite of three maps (Leverett 1915) (Leverett 1902) (Larsen 1986) and other sources. Colors represent moraines from the same time period of the Wisconsin Glacial epoch The Marseilles moraine is a terminal moraine that encircles the southern tip of Lake Michigan in North America. It begins near Elgin, Illinois, and extends south and west of Chicago metropolitan area, turning eastward to south of the lake in Kankakee and Iroqouis counties, entering Indiana. It formed during the Wisconsin glaciation. The glacier had been in retreat when it stopped for an extended period, depositing glacial till and sand creating the hills of the moraine. Distribution The Marseilles moraine was preceded by the Bloomington morainic system. The name is taken from the village of Marseilles, located where the Illinois River cuts through the moraine. The moraine is readily traced as far north as South Elgin, south of the city of Elgin, where it is lost in a composite of other materials.The Illinois Ice Lobe; Frank Leverett; U.S. Geological Survey, Monograph, #38; Government Printing Office; Washington, D.C.; 1899, pg 290-316 For south it combined with a till ridge called the Minooka Ridge. This follows the east side of Fox River, past St. Charles, Geneva, Batavia, and Aurora. The east side of each city occupies the outer face of the moraine. The width of the belt is or . The moraine continues south along the line of Will and Kendall counties. It runs about or beyond the river. The Marseilles moraine turns west, at the bluff between Oswego and Yorkville. The Minooka Ridge continues southward to the Illinois River. The Marseilles moraine follows nearly the southeast bluff of Fox River to the mouth of the stream, its outer border being nowhere more than and usually less than from the stream. The width in Kendall County is only 2 or 3 miles, but increases to 5 or 6 miles in northeastern LaSalle County, near the north bluff of the Illinois River. At the Illinois Valley, it changes from south-southwest to a south-southeast course. It maintains a to width through southeastern Lasalle and northern Livington counties. It is associated with Farm Ridge, in Livingston County. The Farm Ridge is an inner ridge of the Bloomington system. In the vicinity of Odell the moraine turns eastward, and near the line of Livingston and Ford counties takes a course northeast, in broad curve of or wide. Reaching the vicinity of Ste. Anne where it turns southeast. Iroquois moraine (continuation) From Ste. Anne, it continues to the southeast, reaching the state line. Here the name changes to the Iroquois. Continuing through Newton and Jasper counties, Indiana. The moraine expands to cover a to in width across the landscapes as far as Medaryville, in Pulaski County, Indiana. To the east, it disappears. It may end here, or its remnants may be obscured beneath the Lake Kankakee sand ridges.The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Marseilles Morainic System, Course and Correlation; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 The rise from the plain to the crest of the moraine on the north amounts to high about and on the south to to in less than . The width of the \\" Iroquois \\" moraine is generally between , but bouldery areas on its north border extend about farther north to the southern edge of an extensive sandy plain traversed by Kankakee River. The southern border of the ‚Äò‚ÄôIroquois\\" moraine lies to north of Iroquois River in Newton and Jasper counties and trends southwest and northeast. In eastern Jasper it turns northward. It dies out as a definite ridge south of Kankakee River. Some uncertainty remains on whether it continues to the east. One possible correlative is a moraine, which begins near Bass Lake, in Starke County. Between eastern Jasper County and Bass Lake, the area is generally sand covered, with a broad low ridge running from the north end of the Iroquois moraine at San Pierre to North Judson. This ridge has patches of boulders in the till line from North Judson to Bass Lake, as do many other moraines in northern Indiana. The moraine from Bass Lake runs to the southeast and was formed by the Saginaw lobe, of the Laruentide glacier and is the outer border of the great Maxinkuckee moraine. Altitude & Topography The crest is around above sea level and varies only about . The outer border of the moraine follows closely along the contour line along its border. The inside border runs close to the . The Marseilles moraine has a well-defined crest, which acts as a watershed divide. North of the Illinois River it lies between the Fox River and the Dupage River, Au Sable Creek, and Nettle Creek. South of Illinois lies between the Vermilion Rivers tributaries and the Kankakee River. A branch of it that runs north of the Iroquois River and south of Kankakee River is split by the Iroquois River at several places. The sharpest relief is in Kendall County, Illinois a ridge stands to above the adjacent part of the moraine. This is unusual, as the crest is a broad undulating ridge of to in width, with depression that is seasonally water filled. The majority of the crest is a series of swells seldom exceeding with easy slopes. In Livingston County the swells reach above the surrounding sloughs. Another prominent set of knolls are along the Kankakee and Iroqouis counties. Here the knolls reach or more above the surrounding moraine. The highest points noted on the Marseilles system in the district north of Iroquois River are north of Rensselaer, where an altitude of to above sea level is attained. Much of the moraine reaches between and . Outwash Along Fox River, in Kane and Kendall counties, a belt of coarse gravel lines the outside of the Marseilles moraine. The deposit lay mostly across the river from the moraine. At Batavia it is chiefly on the west side, at Aurora on the east side, and at Yorkville on the west side. The gravel is so extensive in Kane and Kendal counties and so small farther down Fox River as to suggest that it forms a delta. In the vicinity of the Illinois River, there are indications of a lake-like expansion of outflowing waters. The Illinois Valley, therefore, appears to have been unopened along the section between the Marseilles moraine and the inner moraine of the Bloomington series. The basin now drained by the Iroquois River into the Kankakee was blocked by ice in that direction. The outlet would have been west across the rim of the basin in northern Ford County into the east fork of Vermilion River. Evidence of fine sand and silt covering the till plain show that a Lake Watseka occupied this part of the Iroquois valley.Earth Science Field Trip, Guide Leaflet, Kankakee Area, May 18, 1957; John C.

In the episode, Glenn Quagmire is found guilty of unwittingly committing statutory rape and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. At the same time, his previously promiscuous but now born-again Christian mother returns to his life, and he struggles to forgive her for what he perceives as child neglect. Plot When Meg needs a check for a field trip, Peter finds that his checks are fake so he insists on opening his own checking account. At Quahog Savings and Loans, Peter and Lois find that his birth certificate gives his real first name as \\"Justin\\" with his full name being \\"Justin Peter Griffin\\". Although Lois says it makes no difference, Peter immediately decides to change his persona to what he believes a \\"Justin\\" should be: young and wild. \\"Justin\\" decides to throw a party, where Quagmire meets a girl named Kira. Lois returns and orders everyone to leave, then plans to take \\"Justin\\" to City Hall to change his name back to Peter. The next day, Quagmire learns that Kira is not 23 years old as she claimed, and she is under the age of legal consent in Rhode Island. Joe arrives at Quagmire's house with some police officers stating that he has received an anonymous tip that Quagmire was having sex with an underage girl. Quagmire confesses due to his pride in having had sex with her and he is arrested by the police for statutory rape. He is put on trial and his only chance for leniency is for character witnesses, since he is legally guilty once the proof of Kira's age is revealed. At the courthouse, Peter, Cleveland, and Joe try to claim Quagmire's innocence, which proves difficult due to them being under oath. This causes Quagmire to take the stand himself and explain about his childhood, in particular his promiscuous mother. Despite this, the judge finds Quagmire guilty and sentences him to 20 years in prison. Just then, his mother Crystal arrives in the courtroom; Crystal admits her past then claims to be a born- again Christian and asks for leniency. The judge rejects her request and gives Quagmire 24 hours to get his affairs in order. At home, Crystal tries to get Quagmire to find God and he lashes out at her. She tries to reason with him, but he rejects her advice. Quagmire tells Crystal he will not listen to her and leaves the house to avoid her. Outside the prison, Quagmire starts to say his goodbyes to his neighbors. Just then, the judge arrives with Crystal to tell Quagmire that his sentence has been commuted after \\"new DNA evidence was produced.\\" He is surprised that despite her religious views she would have sex with the judge, but she responds that it was the most Christian thing to do to protect her son.

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 16, 2014, and is written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Julius Wu. Plot The episode begins with a showing of a parody of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the JCPenney Parade. On Thanksgiving morning, Lois sees Peter's photos in which he claims he and Brian ate the entire turkey planned for dinner that night, so Lois sends them out to find a replacement. Searching every store within sixty miles, they finally find the last one at the Highland Park Market. Peter's antics result in Brian making a deal that he will guard the turkey while Peter drives the car; Peter is not familiar with Brian's hybrid car and drives it into a lake, nearly drowning Brian while destroying his car and cellphone. Given a lift to the bus station, the two get on the bus, but are kicked off when Peter defecates into a bag. Peter steals a girl's bicycle off the front of the bus, but his pants fall down and get caught in the chain, causing an accident which destroys the bike. An attempt at hitch-hiking fails when the driver orders Peter at gunpoint to hand the turkey over. Brian calls Peter stupid, to which he responds by telling him that he had eaten the turkey by himself and framed Brian. As a result, Brian stomps off in anger. Meanwhile, Lois' concern about Peter being out allows Stewie to convince Chris to step up as man of the house for the dinner. Stewie tries to coach Chris into his duties as the guests arrive. Lois is forced to stall for time entertaining guests. Lois greets her guests consisting of her parents, Quagmire, the Brown- Tubbs family, and the Swansons, including Kevin's new short girlfriend. Deciding to bail her out when Carter Pewterschmidt talks about the recent development in store products, Stewie finds Chris unable to handle the pressure as he gets inebriated, and Stewie is forced to step in. Despite the bad blood between each other, Peter and Brian have no option but to travel together. Passing the County Zoo, Peter gets the idea to steal a turkey, despite Brian's reservations. They find a turkey, but have to chase it through the zoo, causing all sorts of mayhem. Brian falls into the lion pen, but is rescued by Peter with a dead flamingo. He is grateful as Peter apologizes for his actions. Securing the turkey, they steal the zoo's tram train and arrive home. Just as Stewie is about to do a speech at the dinner table, Peter arrives. When he takes the turkey out back to kill it, Peter finds he cannot go through with it. He apologizes to Lois and gets permission to invite the bird as a guest. As Peter, Lois, and the turkey face their guests, a drunken Chris arrives and shoots the turkey with a shotgun, killing it and providing them with turkey for dinner after all. During a freeze-frame picture of the characters at the table, Peter's narration reveals that he and Lois divorced four years later and Stewie died. Reception The episode received an audience of 4.46 million, the lowest in its timeslot, but the third most watched show on Fox that night after The Simpsons episode \\"Blazed and Confused\\" and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Amanda Wolf of TV Fanatic gave the episode three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Watching felt like a good passage of time for me. It wasn't the best Family Guy, but certainly not the worst.

Plot Lois is informed by Stewie's teacher, Miss Tammy, that he has an attention problem. She takes him to Dr. Hartman, who promptly gives him a prescription to treat ADHD. When he takes the pills, he becomes totally calm. Brian is initially upset about this, but when Meg mentions the creative benefits of it, he decides to try it himself, and becomes hyperactive in contrast to Stewie's calmness. In a creative frenzy, he conceives of a multimedia science fantasy franchise called Space Shire 7; to flesh out the idea, he writes a 2000 page treatment and creates a diorama of the universe and characters. Meanwhile, at the Drunken Clam, Jerome shows samples of some Korean food to Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe. Quagmire claims that he can cook better, and prepares a meal for all of his neighbors; Lois decides that he should have his own cooking show. Channel 5's producer Carson agrees to hire him, but only if Peter joins him due to his silliness; Quagmire agrees to the terms. During the production of \\"Quagmire's Kitchen\\", Peter's antics (including repeat cinnamon challenges) irk Quagmire until he finally fires him. Carson decides to give Peter his own show, which proves more popular due to his bizarre behavior. When Quagmire calls it an insult to cooking, Carson decides to have them compete in an Iron Chef America-style cook-off. Brian and Stewie travel to Hartford, Connecticut, where they meet George R. R. Martin at a fan convention and pitch Space Shire 7, but Martin dismisses it, deeming the concept to be clich√©d and clearly created under the influence of drugs. Ultimately, they both decide that they no longer need the pills and return home. When they leave, another Martin shows up on a motor scooter and claims that the other George R. R.

The assigned secret ingredient for their dishes is butter. During a montage, Joe and Quagmire focus on cooking while Cleveland and Peter play around. Joe eventually destroys Quagmire's cooking supplies, sealing his defeat. Peter, seeing this, has a sudden change of heart and devours his meal for Quagmire to achieve victory. Quagmire is touched by Peter's sacrifice, but decides to forgo the show to preserve their good will to each other. Peter and Quagmire decide to end the production of their cooking shows in the same way that Food Network had ended the production of Paula Deen's cooking show.

Behind far left, journalist Hubert Phillips; second right, Beasley's regular partner Lady Doris Rhodes. Michael Theodore Gottlieb (November 28, 1900 ‚Äì April 8, 1980) was an American bridge player, an original member of the Four Aces team established by David Burnstine in 1935. Gottlieb is recognized by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) as Life Master #9, one of ten named in 1936. He retired from tournament bridge that year. Biography He was born on November 28, 1900 in Manhattan, New York City to Herman Gottlieb and Jennie Berger.He was born on November 28, 1900 under the name \\"Michael Gottleib\\" according to his birth certificate, but his United States passport application uses November 30, 1900 and \\"Michael Theodore Gottlieb\\". The application was approved on April 26, 1924. Gottlieb won 13 United States Bridge Association championship tournaments from 1929 to 1935. He also played for the Culbertson team, as one partner of Ely Culbertson, during the 1931‚Äì32 Culbertson‚ÄìLenz match. He and Theodore Lightner were partners in the Culbertson‚ÄìBeasley match for the Schwab Cup, 1933 in London (see photo). Gottlieb and Schenken toured Europe in 1935 as a pair playing bridge for money. Some, including ACBL, call the Four Aces the \\"first official world champions\\" based on their 1935 victory, back at home, \\"against a French foursome representing themselves as the European champion team\\". : Note. The European Bridge League, established in 1947, recognizes the International Bridge League championships contested in Europe from 1932 to 1939, of which six Frenchmen including Pierre Albarran won the 1935 rendition. Exceptionally, Americans were invited to participate in 1937, two teams from the US did so. The dual tournaments for open and women teams, contested in Budapest and both won by Austria (both as defending champions), are usually called the first world championships. One 1935 press photograph, as presented by the seller of a print at eBay, calls Gottlieb \\"captain of the US Bridge team\\". \\"At the end of 1936, he retired from competition to devote his time to business interests in California and Arizona.\\" In a humorous March 1937 magazine article, \\"Should We Abolish Bridge? Yessir!\\", Silas Bent portrayed Gottlieb as ousted by the Aces from a position of general leadership. : These four had been as inseparable as the Musketeers in Dumas' immortal story [The Three Musketeers]. They had developed their own bidding system and had published a book together. But the Athos of their group ventured to develop \\"certain unsound bidding theories\\", so that Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan combined to depose him; and they did it with the severity of a Soviet casting a Bukharin into outer darkness. Gottlieb returned to tournament play in 1975 and won the open pairs at a regional meet in California. Gottlieb was a Hillsborough, California, resident when he died of cancer at Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame, California on April 8, 1980. He was survived by his wife, formerly Grayce McMahon, and two daughters.  Publications As a member of the Four Aces, Gottlieb was a co-author of their official works.

It was subsequently rebuilt in 174 BC by censors Quintus Fulvius Flaccus and Aulus Postumius Albinus (Livy, 41.27.8). The development of the Porticus coincided with the rapid growth of the city after the Second Punic War. This increase, in both trade and population, placed stresses on the limited space available in the Forum Boarium and underlined the importance of the river link to Rome's main port at Ostia. The Porticus and the Emporium appear to have worked together to facilitate the unloading, storage, and possibly redistribution of goods and foodstuffs, including imported grain for the corn dole, and appear to have been in continuous operation until the 6th century CE. The opus incertum building, in the form of a thin rectangle running parallel to the Tiber, was very large; approximately long, deep and subdivided by 294 pillars in rows of seven. These created a series of 50 aisles, each across. They were roofed by a series of overlapping vaults that rose in line with the slope of the hill, offering protection from the elements while allowing in light and air. The total covered surface was . The building was set back approximately from the Emporium and river access, possibly to mitigate the effects of seasonal flooding. By the Trajanic period this space was filled with additional commercial structures, and the large utilitarian spaces in the Porticus were put to a variety of uses, often modified or subdivided to suit the needs of their users.

The first bombing occurred in a marketplace, and the second near a bus station. Though no group or individual has claimed responsibility, the attacks have been attributed to Boko Haram.  Background  Christians and Muslims had several confrontations in Jos in years preceding the bombings, and militant group Boko Haram was also active prior to the attack. In 2012, multiple churches were bombed by Boko Haram in order to try to start a religious conflict between Christians and Muslims. In the month prior to the attack, Boko Haram abducted over 200 schoolgirls, though Jos had two significant attacks since 2012. One day after the bombings 27 were killed in village attacks.  Attack  The twin car blasts were 30 minutes apart, one at 3:00 and the other at 3:30. The first explosion occurred in the Terminus Market, where there were over fifty casualties. In Terminus there was a \\"teaching hospital, shops, offices and a market\\" prior to the attack. The second explosion took place near a hospital. The second explosion killed potential rescuers who had gone to assist after the first bomb exploded. A large amount of black smoke was also visible. The bombings were likely designed to inflict the maximum number of casualties. The car bomb caused nearby vehicles to alight. =Aftermath = Firefighters and rescue workers tried to reach the sites of the bombings, but \\"thousands\\" of people were fleeing from the area. The bombs had been positioned to kill as many as possible, indiscriminate of religion using a \\"back-to-back blast\\" tactic, whereby a bomb explodes and another that explodes a short time later is designed to kill rescue workers as well as initial casualties. Youths and soldiers created checkpoints in the area, with some carrying out searches of vehicles. The body count is expected to rise, and some bodies were burned beyond recognition. A death count of 46 was rapidly raised to the current figure of 118 as the rubble was cleared. However, some have put the figure as high as 150.  Reactions  = Domestic = * ‚Äì President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the bombings, and called them a \\"tragic assault on human freedom\\", and the bombers \\"cruel and evil\\". = International = * ‚Äì The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey stated that, \\"We have learned with deep sorrow these bombings.

His tribe fought against English forces helping French in the early 17th century. Adirondacs under him drove the Iroquois Confederation out of Canada. Pieskaret is reported to have distinguished himself by going at night just by himself into an Iroquois village, where he hid himself during the day, and for three successive nights attacked and scalped the members of a tribal lodge. He was killed in 1647 when he encountered a large band of Iroquois. Pieskaret.http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Pieskaret.htm The Algonkin name, often written Piskater, of a noted Algonkin (Adirondack) chief, who lived on the N. bank of the river St. Lawrence, below Montreal, in the first half of the 17th century. According to Schoolcraft ( W. Scenes and Remin ., 87,1853) the dialectic form in his own tribe was Bisconace ('Little Blaze'). Although he became noted by reason of his daring, comparatively few incidents of his life have been recorded. Charlevoix (New France, II, 181, 1866) says he was \\"one of the bravest men ever seen in Canada, and almost incredible stories are told of his prowess.\\" His most noted exploit occurred during an excursion into the Iroquois country with but four followers, well armed with guns, when they encountered on Richelieu r., in five boats, a band of 50 Iroquois, most of whom they killed or captured. On another occasion Pieskaret ventured alone within the Iroquois domain, and coming to one of their villages, by secreting himself during the day, succeeded in killing and scalping the members of a household each night for three successive nights. He was ultimately brought under the influence of Catholic missionaries and in 1641 was baptized under the name Simon, after which he was commonly known among the whites as Simon Pieskaret. After his acceptance of Christianity so much confidence was placed in his prudence and ability that he was commissioned to maintain peace between the French and the Indians, as well as between the Hurons and Algonkin; he was authorized to punish delinquents, \\"and especially those who committed any fault against religion. It is wonderful how he discharged his office.\\" (Jes. Rel. 1647, XXXI 287, 1898.) He was present and made a speech at the conference between the French governor and the Iroquois and other tribes at Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, in 1645. Two years later, while a large body of Iroquois were going on a pretended visit to the governor some of their scouts met Pieskaret near Nicolet, r., and treacherously killed him while he was off his guard.

He apprenticed with Ron Holland and Jon Bannenberg for nearly seven years beginning in 1987, and founded Jonathan Quinn Barnett Ltd. (JQB Ltd.) in 1995. Barnett designed the interior of the 414-foot yacht Octopus in 2003; the interior of MV Kirkland in 1996; and the interior and exterior of Caterpillar Financial‚Äìfunded super yacht Monarch in 2011.  Biography  Barnett was born in 1964 to Judith Quinn and Neil Barnett, a portraitist mother and engineer father, who were linked to his \\"creative curiosity\\" in an interview. In He obtained his degree in industrial design at the University of Cincinnati, completing a thesis on yacht design after originally focusing on automobile design. He worked with Tom Tjaarda (designer of the De Tomaso Pantera) at Dimensione Design in Italy (1985‚Äì1986), and then worked with Industrial Light & Magic, modeling Klingon ships for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. He worked with designer Ron Holland for three months (1986‚Äì1987), which led to Barnett's apprenticeship with Jon Bannenberg for nearly seven years beginning in 1987. Barnett later said of his style that, in his career, \\"if there was one man who influenced me most, it would certainly have to be the late Jon Bannenberg.\\" He then moved to Belltown, Seattle, in the Pacific Northwest, where he founded Jonathan Quinn Barnett Ltd. in 1995. His brother Chris Barnett serves as general manager. He has designed exteriors and interiors for yachts of sizes from 50' to 400' and provides related design services. His firm also performs residential projects such as private home and condominium design.

Octopus  The Octopus, the largest private yacht in the world when launched, was built under strict conditions of nondisclosure. Through local ties to the Paul Allen‚Äìfounded Vulcan Inc., Jonathan Quinn Barnett Ltd. designed the interior of the 414-foot Octopus in 2003. With a submarine, a tender, a dual helicopter hangar with two helipads, nine decks, and accommodations for 60 crew and staff, it is frequently at sea and only occasionally at its homeport in Antibes, France. Barnett also performed the 2014 interior refit of the Octopus at Blohm & Voss Repair in Germany.

In the 1970s and 1980s he worked in electronics, specifically with computers and music. He invented the first digital sampling synthesizer. The American musician Stevie Wonder bought Mendell's invention, the \\"Computer Music Melodian\\" and used it on a documentary soundtrack and corresponding soundtrack album inspired by the book The Secret Life of Plants. Wonder worked with Mendell for almost a decade, including almost all the tracks that are on the soundtrack album The Woman in Red, for which Mendell won a Platinum record. Mendell also worked with Bon Jovi. In the late 1980s onwards, Mendell moved into conceptualizing and designing computer algorithms for international finance, and became an expert on global risk management, option trading and volatility research, as well as machine learning and natural language processing. 1970s As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1970s, Mendell took a course during which he studied the Moog synthesizer, an analog synthesizer. He became curious about how a synthesizer could be adapted to computing. His university thesis was on computer vision, and he designed a solid-state imaging system, which was one of the first to be invented. Mendell graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1976, and at about the same time he invented the first digital sampling synthesizer, while working at the Annenberg Center for Communication.University of Pennsylvania website, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Music, Synthesizing Music and Science\\", by Nate Chinen, 2013 accessed 2014-5-20 At Bell Labs from 1976 to 1984, Mendell worked as part of a group developing the Unix system; commenting about this research in the 2013 University of Pennsylvania interview, he said, \\"I actually developed a chip for managing memory, and it's still the same system they use.\\" 1980s In 1980, on National Public Radio, Mendell was interviewed about the \\"Computer Music Melodian\\", his digital sampling synthesizer.Soundcloud website, Harry Mendell, \\"Computer Music Melodian interview on NPR 1980!\\" accessed 2014-5-20 This consisted of a small computer attached to a synthesizer, an amplifier, and a tape deck; Mendell commented, \\"It can take any sound, and it can store that sound in its memory, and then it can sound like whatever you entered into it. So it can sound like any musical instrument, or it can take sounds which aren't from music instruments, like a bird singing, and make that into a musical instrument.\\" When asked what the Melodian could be used for, Mendell explained that, \\"A good example is what Stevie Wonder did with it in \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\"; he wanted to be able to have birds singing a melody which he wrote.\\" Mendell was referring to the 1979 soundtrack album Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\". The Melodian plays a major role in the track \\"Don't Drive Drunk\\", which was used in a public service announcement on nationwide television. In 1984, The New York Times featured an article about two new electronic instruments that were each a keyboard and software combination, designed to work with a home computer, the Commodore 64. One of the two instruments reviewed was Mandell's \\"Melodian\\". The review noted that the Melodian had a keyboard of nearly three and a half octaves, and could produce the sounds of 19 different musical instruments, \\"from the bagpipe to the violin, with calliope, flute, harpsichord, mandolin and organ, as well as various synthesizers and claviers\\". Also available was \\"RhythmMaster\\", a teaching tool to help a beginning musician with various aspects of performing and understanding music. The New York Times review said that RhythmMaster \\"is one piece of educational software that, unlike most of its kinfolk, actually delivers.\\"New York Times website, The New York Times, published December 4, 1984, Science section, \\"Personal Computers: Now every desktop can be a concert hall\\" by Erik Sandberg-Diment, accessed 2014-5-20 In 1987, The New York Times ran a long (988 word) article describing \\"the merging of digital audio recording technology with satellite telecommunications\\". In a session arranged by Mendell, the Kaufmann Astoria Studios in Queens were linked with a studio in Los Angeles in real time, so that Stevie Wonder, with the producer Quincy Jones in Los Angeles were able lay down a harmonica track onto a piece of music (the theme of the television series Moonlighting). Then in the same session, Nile Rodgers in Queens added guitar to Stevie Wonder's song, Stop, Don't Pass Go\\".New York Times website, New York Times Archive, Published: March 4, 1987, \\"Business technology - Advances in Recording; Harmony of art and science lifts a music industry barrier\\" by Peter H.

Late 1980s and 1990s In about 1986, Mendell moved into working in the financial sector, creating algorithms for trading options and managing risk. In 1997, Mendell co-authored (with 15 other financial experts including Peter Carr, the first author) a scholarly article called \\"Towards a Theory of Volatility Trading\\"; the abstract includes the statement, \\"The primary purpose of this article is to review three methods which have emerged for trading realized volatility.\\"Website CiteSeerx, \\"Towards a Theory of Volatility Trading (1997), accessed 2014-5-23 In approximately 1996, the website Risk.net published a news piece, \\"Morgan Stanley Enters 'Phase Two' Of Global Risk Strategy\\" which describes Mendell as \\"Morgan's head of global market risk technology\\". Mendell comments, \\"Understanding our risk is strategic to our business. We need to be extremely precise about risk.\\" He explains that Morgan Stanley has developed the ability to do globally consolidated VAR calculation daily, and in phase two they would develop the ability to do those calculations in real time: \\"Without this type of analysis, you're really going by the seat of your pants to know what kind of exposure the firm is taking.\\".website Risk.net, \\"Morgan Stanley Enters Phase Two Of Global Risk Strategy\\" Page 5 of 15, Accessed 2014-5-23 2000s In July 2001, Cambridge University Press published a hardback book (686 pages) called \\"Handbooks in Mathematical Finance: Option Pricing, Interest Rates and Risk Management\\".

During the next several decades, scientists were unable to detect any trace of the snake in their field studies. After an intensive search in 2013, a team of scientist identified 11 snakes that matched the original description of the species. They conducted a series of DNA tests to confirm that the Islas Revillagigedo nightsnake, formerly viewed as the subspecies Hypsiglena torquata unaocularis, is genetically distinct from related mainland snakes and should be recognized as a full species.News Releases, Smithsonian Scientist Discovers Lost Species of Nightsnake in Mexico, The Smithsonian, May 19, 2014 While never formally declared extinct, this species remained absent from scientific literature due to two main factors: its home on Clarion is extremely remote and only accessible by military escort, significantly restricting the number of biologists who can access this area, and the snake's secretive, nocturnal behavior and dark coloration make it difficult to detect in the field. Because of the lack of follow-up sightings, scientists long presumed that Beebe had provided an incorrect locality for his specimen. Description The snakes are brownish black in color and have a characteristic series of darker spots on their head and neck and grows to be approximately 18 inches long. Geographic range The species is only found on the Mexican island of Clarion in the Revillagigedo Islands. Habitat It lives on black lava rock habitat near the waters of Sulphur Gay. Origins The Islas Revillagigedo nightsnake is believed to be most closely related to populations of snakes from in the Sonora-Sinaloa state border area of mainland Mexico and Isla Santa Catalina in the Gulf of California. The Clarion nightsnake likely originated from the dispersal of an ancestor that traveled by sea from a river basin in Sonora to Clarion. Conservation status While current populations of this species appear to be viable, Clarion's fragile ecosystem is threatened by invasive species such as feral cats on neighboring islands. These cats prey on lizards, which are likely a main food source for the Clarion nightsnake.
