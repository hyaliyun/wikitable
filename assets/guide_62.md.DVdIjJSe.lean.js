The layer of the atmosphere in which they exist is known as the Junge layer, or simply the stratospheric aerosol layer. These particles consist of a mixture of sulfuric acid and water. They are created naturally, such as by photochemical decomposition of sulfur-containing gases, e.g. carbonyl sulfide. When present in high levels, e.g. after a strong volcanic eruption such as Mount Pinatubo, they produce a cooling effect, by reflecting sunlight, and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere. This cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out. An aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas. The sulfate particles or sulfuric acid droplets in the atmosphere are about 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) in diameter. Sulfur aerosols are common in the troposphere as a result of pollution with sulfur dioxide from burning coal, and from natural processes. Volcanos are a major source of particles in the stratosphere as the force of the volcanic eruption propels sulfur-containing gases into the stratosphere. The relative influence of volcanoes on the Junge layer varies considerably according to the number and size of eruptions in any given time period, and also of quantities of sulfur compounds released. Only stratovolcanoes containing primarily felsic magmas are responsible for these fluxes, as mafic magma erupted in shield volcanoes doesn't result in plumes which reach the stratosphere. Creating stratospheric sulfur aerosols deliberately is a proposed geoengineering technique which offers a possible solution to some of the problems caused by global warming. However, this will not be without side effects and it has been suggested that the cure may be worse than the disease. Pinatubo eruption cloud. This volcano released huge quantities of stratospheric sulfur aerosols and contributed greatly to understanding of the subject. Origins Volcanic \\"injection\\" Natural sulfur aerosols are formed in vast quantities from the SO2 ejected by volcanoes, which may be injected directly into the stratosphere during very large (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI, of 4 or greater) eruptions. A comprehensive analysis, dealing largely with tropospheric sulfur compounds in the atmosphere, is provided by Bates et al. The IPCC AR4 says explosive volcanic events are episodic, but the stratospheric aerosols resulting from them yield substantial transitory perturbations to the radiative energy balance of the planet, with both shortwave and longwave effects sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the aerosols. During periods lacking volcanic activity (and thus direct injection of SO2 into the stratosphere), oxidation of COS (carbonyl sulfide) dominates the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosol. Chemistry The chemistry of stratospheric sulfur aerosols varies significantly according to their source. Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume. The chemical reactions affecting both the formation and elimination of sulfur aerosols are not fully understood. It is difficult to estimate accurately, for example, whether the presence of ash and water vapour is important for aerosol formation from volcanic products, and whether high or low atmospheric concentrations of precursor chemicals (such as SO2 and H2S) are optimal for aerosol formation. This uncertainty makes it difficult to determine a viable approach for geoengineering uses of sulfur aerosol formation. Scientific study Stratospheric sulfates from volcanic emissions cause transient cooling; the purple line showing sustained cooling is from tropospheric sulfate Understanding of these aerosols comes in large part from the study of volcanic eruptions, notably Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which erupted in 1991 when scientific techniques were sufficiently far advanced to study the effects carefully. The formation of the aerosols and their effects on the atmosphere can also be studied in the lab. Samples of actual particles can be recovered from the stratosphere using balloons or aircraft. Computer models can be used to understand the behaviour of aerosol particles, and are particularly useful in modelling their effect on global climate. Biological experiments in the lab, and field/ocean measurements can establish the formation mechanisms of biologically derived volatile sulfurous gases.  Effects  It has been established that emission of precursor gases for sulfur aerosols is the principal mechanism by which volcanoes cause episodic global cooling. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 regards stratospheric sulfate aerosols as having a low level of scientific understanding. The aerosol particles form a whitish haze in the sky. This creates a global dimming effect, where less of the sun's radiation is able to reach the surface of the Earth. This leads to a global cooling effect. In essence, they act as the reverse of a greenhouse gas, which tends to allow visible light from the sun through, whilst blocking infrared light emitted from the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. The particles also radiate infrared energy directly, as they lose heat into space. Solar radiation reduction due to volcanic eruptions All aerosols both absorb and scatter solar and terrestrial radiation. This is quantified in the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea- salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber. Aerosols, natural and anthropogenic, can affect the climate by changing the way radiation is transmitted through the atmosphere. Direct observations of the effects of aerosols are quite limited so any attempt to estimate their global effect necessarily involves the use of computer models. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, says: While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time. However, they are mostly talking about tropospheric aerosol. The aerosols have a role in the destruction of ozone due to surface chemistry effects. Destruction of ozone has in recent years created large holes in the ozone layer, initially over the Antarctic and then the Arctic. These holes in the ozone layer have the potential to expand to cover inhabited and vegetative regions of the planet, leading to catastrophic environmental damage. Ozone destruction occurs principally in polar regions, but the formation of ozone occurs principally in the tropics. Ozone is distributed around the planet by the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Therefore, the source and dispersal pattern of aerosols is critical in understanding their effect on the ozone layer. Turner was inspired by dramatic sunsets caused by volcanic aerosols Aerosols scatter light, which affects the appearance of the sky and of sunsets. Changing the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere can dramatically affect the appearance of sunsets. A change in sky appearance during 1816, \\"The Year Without A Summer\\" (attributed to the eruption of Mount Tambora), was the inspiration for the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. Further volcanic eruptions and geoengineering projects involving sulfur aerosols are likely to affect the appearance of sunsets significantly, and to create a haze in the sky. Aerosol particles are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean. Depending on the volume of particles descending, the effects may be significant to ecosystems, or may not be. Modelling of the quantities of aerosols used in likely geoengineering scenarios suggest that effects on terrestrial ecosystems from deposition is not likely to be significantly harmful. Climate engineering The ability of stratospheric sulfur aerosols to create this global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in climate engineering projects to limit the effect and impact of climate change due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. Delivery of precursor gases such as H2S and SO2 by artillery, aircraft and balloons has been proposed. Understanding of this proposed technique is partly based on the fact that it is the adaptation of an existing atmospheric process. The negative and positive aspects of the technique is therefore potentially better understood than are comparable (but purely speculative) climate engineering proposals. It is also partly based on the speed of action of any such solution deployed, in contrast to carbon sequestration projects such as carbon dioxide air capture which would take longer to work. However, gaps in understanding of these processes exist, for example the effect on stratospheric climate and on rainfall patterns, and further research is needed. At least two negative effects, however, are well- established due to the fundamental physics of light scattering, how plants grow, and how solar panels work. *Ecosystem Light Deprivation: Photosynthesis is the basis of life on Earth. By uniformly dimming incoming shortwave radiation necessary for the growth of phytoplanktons, trees, and crops, deployment of the technology assures reduction in primary productivity by between 2-5% from now until the end of the century, proportional to the greenhouse gas levels at that time and their total radiative forcing. This effect would proportionally reduce human's ability to grow food and the ecosystem's ability to regenerate. *Inhibition of Solar Energy Technologies: Uniformly reduced net shortwave radiation would hurt solar photovoltaics by the same 2-5% as for plants . the increased scattering of collimated incoming sunlight would more drastically reduce the efficiencies (by 11% for RCP8.5) of concentrating solar thermal power for both electricity production and chemical reactions, such as solar cement production.

Fenley John McDonald was born on 25 May 1891 in Nagambie, Victoria. By all accounts, he was a strongly built, quietly spoken, and well-mannered young man. Education Educated at the Nagambie State School, he gained a thorough knowledge of cattle and sheep and farming from his family's property, \\"Winbrae\\". In 1910, once he had finished his formal schooling, he moved to Melbourne and began a four-year evening course of studies at the highly regarded Stott and Hoare's Business College, at 426 Collins Street, Melbourne, whilst working in the day time as a stock and station agent with Pearson, Rowe, Smith, and Co., 416 Bourke Street, Melbourne.The well-respected firm of Pearson, Rowe, Smith, and Co. was established in Victoria around 1860; the business was taken over by Goldsbrough Mort & Co Ltd in late 1937 (Goldsbrough Mort & Co.: Old Established Business Purchased, The Age, (Saturday, 27 November, 1937), p.19.) Footballer Two of Fen's brothers played a single VFL match with Essendon, on the same day (Saturday, 9 September 1905): Edwin Patrick \\"Ted\\" McDonald (1875‚Äì1919), and Archibald William Campbell \\"Arch\\" McDonald (1883-1942). Strongly built (at enlistment he stood 5 ft 7¬Ω in, weighed 11 st 9 lbs, and had an expanded chest measurement of 37 in), he was rather fast on his feet, and had some success as a handicap runner. Once in Melbourne, he played in the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association competition, with the Carlton District team. Carlton noticed his impressive performance, signed him up, and he played his VFL first match, aged 20, against St Kilda, on 29 July 1911 (round fifteen). Carlton thrashed St Kilda by 114 points, and none of the forwards saw much of the ball as most of those up the ground were concentrating on feeding the ball to Carlton's full-forward, Vin Gardiner, who kicked 10 goals. Situated in the back pocket, McDonald saw little of the play ‚Äì St Kilda only scored 2.3 (15) ‚Äì yet he did make it down to the forward line and kicked one goal. During the next season (1912) he played nine senior games, mainly in the backline; and at the end of the season, he decided to move to Melbourne. In 1913, he played one senior match for Melbourne, against Essendon on 14 June 1913 (round nine). Essendon beat Melbourne by 41 points. One match report noted that \\"McDonald was another player who did a lot of hard work for Melbourne under discouraging circumstances\\",Football: Essendon's Last Half, The Argus, (Monday 16 June 1913), p.10. whilst another commented that \\"McDonald‚Ä¶ did very good work\\".Essendon (9.17) Beat Melbourne (3.12), The Age, (Monday 16 June 1913), p.11. He then returned to the District team, and did not play another VFL match. He played for the Carlton District team in 1914 as well, and concentrated on completing the last year of his studies. Soldier Leaving his employment with Pearson, Rowe, Smith, and Co., 416 Bourke Street, Melbourne, he enlisted in the First AIF on 17 August 1914, and served, as a private, in the 7th Battalion, A.I.F. His brother, Stanley David McDonald (1888‚Äì1945), also served in the First AIF, enlisting on 20 May 1915, before the news of Fen's death had reached his family.Australian War Memorial Photograph: Private Stanley McDonald (1769); World War I Service Record: Stanley McDonald (1769). Death He died at Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey on during the first landings on 25 April 1915. It is not known how he died; and it is presumed that he was either shot dead or blown up in the process of making the beach. One of his best mates from Melbourne, Harold Denston, who worked as a clerk in a Collins Street insurance office, was also killed in action at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. Claude Crowl who had played his first game for St Kilda on the same day that McDonald made his debut for Carlton, also died in action at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. A special medal named in McDonald's and Crowl's honour was presented to the best player on the ground in the match played between St Kilda and Carlton on the hundredth anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. Remembered His body was never recovered; and, therefore, he has no marked grave. His name is recorded on the memorial at Lone Pine Memorial, Gallipoli, Turkey, and at panel 50 in the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial.

The technology is named after its inventor William Taciuk and the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority. History The research and development of the ATP technology started in 1970. In 1975, its inventor, William Taciuk, formed the UMATAC Industrial Processes (now part of Polysius) to further its development. The first ATP pilot plant was constructed in 1977. The ATP was originally developed for pyrolysis of oil sand. However, its first commercial application in 1989 was dedicated to the environmental remediation of contaminated soils. From 1999 to 2004, ATP technology was used for shale oil extraction at the Stuart Oil Shale Plant in Australia. During that time, of shale oil was extracted before the owner, Southern Pacific Petroleum Pty Ltd went into receivership. The subsequent owner, Queensland Energy Resources closed and dismantled the plant. In 2002, Estonian company Viru Keemia Grupp tested this technology; however, it was not taken into use. Technology The ATP is an above-ground oil-shale retorting technology classified as a hot recycled solids technology. The distinguishing feature of the ATP is that the drying and pyrolysis of the oil shale or other feed, as well as the combustion, recycling, and cooling of spent materials and residues, all occur within a single rotating multi-chamber horizontal retort. Dry thermal processor. Its feed consists of fine particles. Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) retort In its shale-oil applications, fine particles (less than in diameter) are fed into the preheat tubes of the retort, where they are dried and preheated to indirectly by hot shale ash and hot flue gas. In the pyrolysis zone, oil shale particles are mixed with hot shale ash and the pyrolysis is performed at temperatures between and . The resulting shale oil vapor is withdrawn from the retort through a vapour tube and recovered by condensation in other equipment. The char residues, mixed with ash, are moved to the combustion zone, and burnt at about to form shale ash. Part of the ash is delivered to the pyrolysis zone, where its heat is recycled as a hot solid carrier; the other part is removed and cooled in the cooling zone with the combustion gases by heat transfer to the feed oil shale. The advantages of the ATP technology for shale oil extraction lie in its simple and robust design, energy self-sufficiency, minimal process water requirements, ability to handle fine particles, and high oil yields. It is particularly suited for processing materials with otherwise low oil yield. The mechanical transfer of solids through the machine does not involve moving parts and it achieves improved process efficiencies through solid-to-solid heat transfer. Most of the process energy (over 80%) is produced by combustion of char and produced oil shale gas; external energy inputs are minimal. The oil yields are about 85‚Äì90% of Fischer Assay. The organic carbon content of the process residue (spent shale) is less than 3%. The process produces only small amounts of contaminated water with low concentrations of phenols. These advantages also apply to its oil sands applications, including increased oil yield, a simplified process flow, reduction of bitumen losses to tailings, elimination of the need for tailing ponds, improvement in energy efficiency compared with the hot water extraction process, and elimination of requirements for chemical and other additives. A complication of the ATP is that retorting operations can reach temperatures at which carbonate minerals within the shale decompose, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Operations As of 2008, ATP was used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency at a PCB-contaminated site near Buffalo, New York, and at the Waukegan Harbor, Illinois. UMATAC Industrial Processes runs a 5 tons of oil shale per hour pilot processor in Calgary, Alberta for large scale tests of different oil shales. The Fushun Mining Group of China has built a 250 tonnes per hour ATP plant that began commissioning in 2010. Jordan Energy and Mining Ltd planned to use the ATP technology for extracting oil from Al Lajjun and Attarat oil shale deposits in Jordan.

The mostly Celtic tribes of the area were subjugated by successive Roman campaigns aimed at control of the strategic routes from Italy across the Alps to the Rhine and into Gaul, most importantly by Julius Caesar's defeat of the largest tribal group, the Helvetii, in the Gallic Wars in 58 BC. Under the Pax Romana, the area was smoothly integrated into the prospering Empire, and its population assimilated into the wider Gallo-Roman culture by the 2nd century AD, as the Romans enlisted the native aristocracy to engage in local government, built a network of roads connecting their newly established colonial cities and divided up the area among the Roman provinces. Roman civilization began to retreat from Swiss territory when it became a border region again after the Crisis of the Third Century. Roman control weakened after 401 AD, but did not entirely disappear until the mid-5th century after which the area began to be occupied by Germanic peoples. Switzerland prior to the Roman conquest The Swiss plateau, within the natural borders of the Alps to the South and East, Lake Geneva and the Rh√¥ne to the west and the Rhine to the north, was recognized as a contiguous territory by Julius Caesar. This area had been dominated by the La T√®ne culture since the 5th century BC, settled by a mostly Celtic population (Gauls), of which the Helvetii were the most numerous, but which also included the Rauraci in north-west Switzerland centered on Basel, and the Allobroges around Geneva. South of the Swiss plateau were the Nantuates, Seduni and Veragri in the Valais, the Lepontii in the Ticino, while the Raetians controlled the Grisons as well as large areas around it. The Roman conquestEarly contact= The first part of what is now Switzerland to fall to Rome was the southern Ticino, annexed after the Roman victory over the Insubres in 222 BC. The territory of the Allobroges around Geneva came under Roman sway by 121 BC and was incorporated into the province of Gallia Narbonensis prior to the Gallic Wars (58‚Äì51 BC). In around 110 BC, two Helvetic tribes under Divico ‚Äì the Tigurini and the Tougeni, sometimes identified with the Teutons ‚Äì joined the wandering Germanic Cimbri on a march to the West. In the course of the Cimbrian War they defeated a Roman force under Lucius Cassius Longinus at the Battle of Burdigala in 107 BC,Ducrey, p. 54. but after the Roman victory over the Teutons at Aquae Sextiae in 102 BC, the Tigurini returned to settle in the Swiss Plateau. =Defeat of the Helvetii= In 61 BC, the Helvetii, led by Orgetorix, decided to leave their lands and move to the West, burning their settlements behind them ‚Äì twelve oppida, according to Caesar, and some 400 villages. They were decisively beaten by Caesar in the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BC. After their surrender, Caesar sent the Helvetii home, according them the status of foederati or Roman allies, but not yet (as has previously been believed) fully subjugating them to Roman sovereignty.Ducrey, p. 58. Caesar's policy aimed at controlling the territory west of the Jura and Rhine, as well as at blocking the potential incursion routes from the East along the Jura.Ducrey, p. 59. The Raetians, described as savage warriors by Strabo, continued to launch incursions into the Swiss Plateau and also had to be contained. To that end, Caesar charged the Helvetii and the Rauraci with defending their territory and established two colonies of veterans ‚Äì one, the Colonia Julia Equestris (now Nyon) on the shores of Lake Geneva and the other through Lucius Munatius Plancus in northwestern Switzerland, preceding the larger Augusta Raurica founded by Augustus in around 6 AD.Ducrey, p. 60. =Conquest of the Alps= Central Europe in 14 AD: Switzerland is divided between the provinces of Raetia et Vindelicia and Gallia Belgica. Caesar's attempt to open the Great St Bernard Pass for Roman traffic failed in 57 BC due to strong opposition by the local Veragri.Ducrey, p. 61. Concerted and successful efforts to gain control over the Alpine region were undertaken by his successor, Augustus, as the rapid development of Lugdunum (Lyon) made the establishment of a safe and direct route from Gaul to Italy a priority. In 25 BC, an army under Aulus Terentius Varro Murena wiped out the Salassi in the Aosta Valley. At some time between 25 and 7 BC ‚Äì either following the Aosta campaign or, more likely, in the course of the conquest of Raetia in 15 BC ‚Äì a campaign also subjugated the Celtic tribes of the Valais and opened the Great St Bernard Pass.Ducrey, p. 62. That conquest was a consequence of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16 BC, a more thorough campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia ‚Äì and thereby all of Switzerland ‚Äì firmly under Roman control. The tropaeum alpium, built by Augustus in 7 BC to celebrate his conquest of the Alps, lists among the defeated peoples the tribes of Raetia and of the Valais, but not the Helvetii. It appears that they were absorbed peacefully into the Empire during the first century AD, except for their part in the conflicts of the Year of the Four Emperors, AD 69.Ducrey, p. 63. Roman Switzerland The history of Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the Augustan period up until 260 AD, a time of exceptional peace and prosperity. The Pax Romana was made possible by the protection of well- defended and distant Imperial borders and a peaceful and smooth Romanization of the local population.Ducrey, p. 74. The Romans urbanized the territory with numerous settlements and built a network of high-quality Roman roads connecting them,Ducrey, p. 89. allowing for the integration of Helvetia into the imperial economy. =Roman settlements= Political borders and settlements in the area of Switzerland, 90 to 284 AD While the Roman presence was always strong in the Alps, where the crucial North-South connection had to be kept open, the Swiss plateau was not really Romanized until decades after the conquest. The principal Roman settlements in Switzerland were the cities of Iulia Equestris (Nyon), Aventicum (Avenches), Augusta Raurica (Augst) and Vindonissa (Windisch).Ducrey, p. 83. Evidence has also been found of almost twenty Roman villages (vici) established in the 1st to 3rd century AD, as well as hundreds of villas of varying sizes built in the western and central part of the Swiss Plateau. The known vici include:Ducrey, p. 70‚Äì71. * in the Romandie: Eburodunum (Yverdon-les-Bains), Genava (Geneva), Lousonna (Lausanne), Minnodurum (Moudon), Urba (Orbe), Uromagus (Oron), Viviscus (Vevey); * in the Valais: Acaunum or Agaunum (St. Maurice), Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny), Pennelocus, Sedunum (Sitten), Tarnaiae (Massongex); * in central and northern Switzerland: Aquae Helveticae (Baden), Ad Fines (Pfyn), Bern, Arialbinnum (Basel), Cambiodunum (Irgenhausen), Dietikon, Iuliomagus (Schleitheim), Centum Prata (Kempraten), Lenzburg, Lunnern, Olten, Petinesca (Peterlingen), Pierre Pertuis, Salodurum or Solodurum (Solothurn), Tasgetium or Tasgaetium (Eschenz), Tenedo (Zurzach), Turicum (Z√ºrich), Vitudurum or Vitodurum (Winterthur); * in Raetia: Ad Rhenum (Rheineck), Arbor Felix (Arbon), Bilitio (Bellinzona), Curia (Chur), Magia (Maienfeld), Lapidaria, Tinnetie or Tinnetio (Tinizong-Rona). The colonies of Nyon and Augusta Raurica at first had little cultural influence beyond their immediate surroundings. After Roman military defeats in Germania in 12‚Äì9 BC and 6‚Äì9 AD, the frontier was moved back to the Rhine and guarded by eight legions, of which one, originally Legio XIII Gemina, was based in the permanent camp of Vindonissa (Windisch).Ducrey, p. 68. Aventicum (Avenches) was likely the capital of the Helvetii since its founding at the beginning of the 1st century.Ducrey, p. 69. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which he had lived for a time, or a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.Ducrey, p. 72. =Administrative divisions= The Alps were first administered by a legatus pro praetore in Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), then by the procurator of the new province of Raetia.Ducrey, p. 64. The Valais was split from Raetia by Claudius in AD 43 and merged with the province of Alpes Graiae to form a new province, Alpes Graiae et Poeninae. As for the Swiss plateau, its western and central part up to Ad Fines (Pfyn) was administratively part of the province of Belgica and for military purposes part of Germania Superior. Its eastern part belonged to Raetia. This division, established by Augustus in 22 BC, was accompanied by a redistribution of tribal settlement areas. It remained essentially unchanged until Diocletian's reforms in the third century, when parts of Switzerland each belonged to the provinces of Sequania, Vienna, Raetia Prima, Liguria and Alpes Graiae et Poeninae.Ducrey, p. 103. =Government= The colonies of Nyon, Aventicum and Augusta Raurica were governed under republican constitutions similar to that of Rome. Most governmental powers were exercised by a pair of magistrates, the duoviri, elected annually first by all citizens older than 25, and in later times by the city council or ordo decurionum. The 100 members of this council, which corresponded to the Roman Senate, were selected by the duomviri among former officials or priests according to their wealth, and held office for life. Augusta Raurica and Aventicum were also the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had the legal status of incolae (inhabitants) invested with the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were represented by a special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum (\\"Heads of the colonists of Aventicum\\"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici (\\"Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia\\").Ducrey, p. 92. The civitas (tribal community) of the Helvetii was similar to that of the Celtic tribes of the Valais, which were merged into a single civitas Vallensis probably around 40 AD, and given Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny) as their capital.Ducrey, p. 93. Parts of the modern Ticino belonged to the colony of Comum (Como), founded in the 1st century AD. On the local level, the basic administrative units were the vici, replacing the Helvetic pagi, or tribes, which were dissolved at the time of colonization. These villages enjoyed a certain autonomy and were governed by popularly elected magistrates (magistri or curatores). While the governmental system in the central and western part of Switzerland, as described above, is well documented, nothing of substance is known about the political and administrative system in eastern Raetia. However, records of the time show that a great number of local nobles held political and religious offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite. =Culture and society= The arena of Aventicum The theatre of Augusta Raurica Testaments of Roman culture such as baths, floor heating and imported goods (pottery, glass, religious icons and artworks) have been found in even the poorest Roman era dwellings, indicating that Romanization was effective at all levels of society.Ducrey, p. 85. Roman public baths were found in all villages, temples with integrated theaters ‚Äì showing animal or gladiatorial combat ‚Äì in most.Ducrey, p. 78. While the superimposition of Roman culture on the local population appears to have been unproblematic and thorough, the Celtic traditions did not disappear entirely, resulting in a fusion of Roman and local culture that characterized all aspects of society. Latin, the language of government and instruction, only gradually replaced the local Celtic dialects in everyday use. Local artworks and religious icons of the period exhibit influences of ornamental Celtic art, classical Greco-Roman art and even Oriental styles from the far reaches of the Empire.Ducrey, p. 100. An important incentive for the local people to Romanize was the perspective of obtaining the various degrees of Roman citizenship and the rights conferred thereby, including the right to vote, to hold public office and to render military service.Ducrey, p. 91. The hundreds of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, attest to the existence of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners.Ducrey, p. 84. Many villae belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest.Ducrey, p. 83. Of the lower classes, much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting to the existence of guilds (collegia) of boat skippers, doctors, teachers and traders, as well as to the existence of a trade in slaves.Ducrey, p. 94. =Religion=Polytheism Statue of Hercules in Augusta Raurica In the course of Romanization, the Celtic polytheism of the local tribes was merged ‚Äì syncretized ‚Äì with the Roman religion. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under the names of their Roman counterparts. Thus Lugus was replaced by Mercury, Belenus by Apollo, Taranis by Jupiter and so forth, in a practice called interpretatio romana by Caesar, who pioneered it.Ducrey, p. 96. Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as epithets; thus Mars was venerated as Mars Caturix, Mercury as Mercurius Cissonius and Jupiter as Jupiter Poeninus after the god of the Pennine Alps. As oriental religions grew more popular in the later Empire ‚Äì unlike the traditional Roman cults, they promised rewards in the afterlifeDucrey, p. 98. ‚Äì they also percolated into Gaul. Artifacts related to the cults of gods such as Isis, Osiris, Serapis, Kybele, Serapios, Dionysos or Mithras have been found at the site of every Roman settlement in Switzerland. The great significance of religion in the culture of Roman Switzerland is illustrated by the imposing size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, as well as by the great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists. As everywhere in the Empire, the Imperial cult was practiced in Switzerland; it had a particularly prominent temple in the center of the forum of Nyon.Ducrey, p. 97. Christianity The first clear testaments to Christian communities in Switzerland date after 313, when the religion was officially tolerated with the Edict of Milan. It is however certain that, as in Gaul, the Christian faith had already had adherents for some time prior to 313. The first bishop in Switzerland was either Justinianus, bishop of the Rauricans, in 340 (his historicity is not certain) or Theodorus, bishop of Octodurus, in 381 or earlier. The first Christian religious buildings date to the 4th century; they are found in Geneva, Chur and Saint-Maurice, known for the legend of the Theban Legion. Decline of Roman civilization in Switzerland Remains of the colony of Nyon overlooking Lake Geneva =The catastrophe of 260= The order and prosperity that the Pax Romana had brought to Switzerland ended, as elsewhere in the Empire, with the Crisis of the Third Century. In 260, when the Gallic Empire briefly seceded from Rome, the emperor Gallienus withdrew the legions from the Rhine to fight the usurper Ingenuus, allowing the warlike Alemanni to enter the Swiss plateau. There, cities, villages and most villae were raided or sacked by marauding bands.Ducrey, p. 101. The numerous caches of coins recovered from the period between 250 and 280 attest to the severity of the crisis. Only the Valais, shielded by mountains, escaped these predations. =Borderlands= Roman Irgenhausen Castrum near Irgenhausen As the Empire's frontiers receded to the Rhine, Switzerland once again became a border area. Its defenses were strengthened, especially under Diocletian and Constantine, who rebuilt the roads and built castles (castra) alongside. Numerous fortifications were built along the Rhine border and further south, providing for a defense in depth.Ducrey, p. 102. The border fortifications were completed by Valentinian I in 371, who established a chain of watchtowers along the Rhine from Lake Constance to Basel, with each tower no more than away from the next one. But even these efforts could not restore peace and order in Switzerland, and numerous settlements were abandoned as their inhabitants fled to more defensible places or to the South. Urban culture faded away as the cities of Nyon and Augusta Raurica were permanently abandoned during the 4th century, the stones of their ruins serving to fortify Geneva and Basel.Ducrey, p. 104. Aventicum never recovered from its pillages: Ammianus Marcellinus noted in around 360 that \\"the city was once very illustrious, as its half-ruined buildings attest.\\" =Transition to the Middle Ages= the distribution of languages in Switzerland The Roman era of Switzerland is traditionally held to have ended in 401 AD, when Stilicho withdrew all troops from the Rhine and the Danube.Ducrey, p. 105. However, it has been argued that the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411‚Äì413 with the assistance of tribes moving south from Germania.Thomas S. Burn, Barbarians within the Gates of Rome, A Study of Roman Military Policy with the barbarians, CA 375-425, 1994, pp. 129-147 In any case, the fifth century saw the apparently non-violent takeover of western Switzerland by the Burgundians (placed there by Flavius Aetius in 443 as a shield against the invading Huns) and of Northern and Central Switzerland by the Alamanni, a move not opposed by either absent or weakened Roman forces. These settlements established the most important cultural and linguistic division in modern Switzerland: the Burgundian areas eventually became the French-speaking Romandie, while the people in the larger Eastern half ‚Äì called la suisse al√©manique in French ‚Äì still speak variants of Alemannic German.

Although he never scored a century or managed a five wicket haul, Travers made four half centuries and had best figures of 4/65. One of Travers' biggest tests came on his first-class debut, against India in 1946. Oxford batted first and Travers was dismissed for just 13 by Vinoo Mankad, in what would be his only innings of the match.

Chess controversy and politics In 1985 and 1986, Myers wrote in the Myers Openings Bulletin about FIDE President Florencio Campomanes' controversial decision to terminate the 1984‚Äì85 Karpov‚ÄìKasparov World Championship match after 48 games, and schedule a new match later in 1985.Myers 2002, p. 179. Myers argued that the decision to stop the match and start afresh was in Kasparov's interest, since he had been trailing and would have needed three more victories to win the match, while Karpov needed only one.Myers 2002, p. 178. Chess historian Edward Winter later wrote, \\"This reasoning, originally voiced by hardly anyone except ... Myers, is now gaining ground.\\"Edward Winter, The Termination (1988, updated in 2006, 2007 and 2008). Retrieved on 2008-12-27. Myers also asserted that Kasparov's statements, which suggested that Campomanes had terminated the match at Karpov's behest and over Kasparov's opposition, were duplicitous. In 1986, Campomanes hired Myers to write the bulletins at the Chess Olympiad later that year in Dubai, and to work for Campomanes' reelection as FIDE President.Myers 2002, pp. 184-85. Campomanes' opponent was Lincoln Lucena, whose running mate was Raymond Keene, a candidate for General Secretary of FIDE.Edward Winter, The 1986 FIDE Presidential Election. Retrieved on 2009-01-16.Myers 2002, pp. 179, 194. Myers wrote a series of ten bulletins for distribution to national chess federations, entitled F.I.D.E. Facts, that criticized Keene, as well as Lucena supporters such as Kasparov and David Levy.Myers 2002, pp. 186, 188, 193-94.All ten issues of F.I.D.E. Facts are reproduced in Edward Winter, The 1986 FIDE Presidential Election. Retrieved on 2009-01-16. The November 1986 issue of CHESS magazine contained a written response, drafted by Myers and signed by Campomanes, to Keene's charges against Campomanes.CHESS magazine, November 1986, pp. 323-25.Myers 2002, p. 188. Myers also created a cartoon that portrayed Lucena as a marionette controlled by Keene and Levy.Myers 2002, p. 194. Just before the election, Lucena withdrew, ensuring Campomanes' victory. Myers took credit for Campomanes' reelection, writing, \\"It could be reasonably argued that Campomanes was either a good guy or a bad guy, but I'm proud that discovering the truth and telling it proved that his opponents were worse.\\"Myers 2002, p. 193.

Pryce-Jenkins represented Wales twice but he is more notable within the field of rugby for being a founding member of London Welsh. Personal history Pryce-Jenkins was born in 1864 to the rector of Llanllwch, a village outside Carmarthen in South Wales.Jones (1985), pg 5. He was educated at Llandovery College and later Cambridge University. After leaving university, Pryce-Jones took time away from education and joined a touring theatrical company. After four years he returned to London and completed his medical studies, setting up a surgery at Hills Place behind the Palladium. A strong athlete he turned his amateur interest in games into his medical speciality, treating athletic injuries. Notable patients included runners Alfred Shrubb and Reggie Walker.Jones (1985), pg 4. He would later treat players from London Welsh never charging them for his services. Pryce- Jenkins took a leading role in the formation of the London Welsh Battalion at the outbreak of World War I, and became a medical advisor at the London Depot. Pryce-Jenkins was also an amateur writing, completing several short stories and a play, 'Sands of Time'. Pryce-Jenkins died in 1922 at the age of 58, he was buried at Marylebone Cemetery. Rugby career In 1885 a group of rugby enthusiasts met to form a rugby club within London, specifically for Welsh players. An informal meeting took place that year, followed by an official formation at the Arlington Hotel in Fleet Street on 24 June. Pryce-Jenkins was one of those present and became a member of the first committee.Jones (1985), pg 3. Although representing other clubs before this time, Pryce-Jenkins played the majority of his club rugby for London Welsh, and was still playing for the club when he was selected to represent Wales in 1888. His first cap was against Scotland under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, and Pryce-Jenkins scored the only points of the game when he ran half the length of the pitch to score in the first half. Wales are then reported to have killed the game by lying on the ball or kicking it continually out of touch. His second and final international match was an away trip against Ireland, which Wales lost. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 470. * 1888 * 1888 Bibliography * * References Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:1862 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Rugby union wings Category:19th-century Welsh medical doctors Category:20th-century Welsh medical doctors Category:People educated at Llandovery College Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:Wales international rugby union players ","title":"Thomas Pryce-Jenkins"},{"id":"20838404","text":"Alexander Vyacheslavovich Ossovsky (, July 31, 1957) was a renowned Russian musical writer, critic and musicologist, professor at Saint Petersburg Conservatory, pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and friend of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Siloti and Nikolai Tcherepnin.

Tower I is with 41 stories, and Tower II is with 25 stories. Until May 2009, Tower I was the tallest office tower in the Netherlands. Both towers are built over a 4-storey multifunctional podium which adjoins the Rotterdam central station. The entire complex has 28 elevators. The gross floor area in the complex is , and the offices occupy . It was constructed between 1988 and 1991. The cost of the construction was 240 million Dutch guilders, or about ‚Ç¨110 million. Due to a metro tunnel running underneath the complex, advanced construction methods were required, allowing only a single underground floor to be built. The building is also known as Nationale-Nederlanden building, because until 2015 the Dutch Company 'Nationale-Nederlanden' (National-Netherlands) was the main user of the building. Nationale-Nederlanden was the local insurance branch of ING Insurance until 2014. In April 2015, the building was officially reopened by owner CBRE Global Investors as a general-purpose office building with of office space. Nationale-Nederlanden became a tenant renting only a third of the building complex, and hence their logo on Tower I was removed. Since then the building has established its own identity, displaying its own logo on Tower I. Until 2004, an annual race up the building's stairs took place in this building.

He was the official champion of the Duke of Ferrara (1473), served as Governor of Rovigo and the Polesine (1473‚Äì84) then Giudice dei Savi (1497-1505), in which post he was succeeded by his son Ercole Strozzi. Strozzi was included in the entourage that accompanied Borso to Rome, March 1471, to be elevated from marchese to duca di Ferrara by Pope Sixtus IV Della Rovere.

It was operated from 1904 until 1976 as the photographic studio of brothers Ellsworth and Emery Kolb.  History  In 1902, Emery C. Kolb (1881‚Äì1976) and Ellsworth L. Kolb (1876‚Äì1960) first arrived at the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1911, they successfully navigated the Colorado River, filming their journey. Built between from 1904 to 1926, the building which they constructed was both a family home and photographic studio for the pioneering Kolb brothers. The building has evolved through two major additions and countless minor changes during its century of existence at Grand Canyon. After the death of Emery Kolb in 1976, the National Park Service acquired the historic studio. During the 1990s, the Grand Canyon Association renovated the building and converted it to its current state. The Grand Canyon Association now operates an art gallery, bookstore and information inside the building. The bookstore's proceeds go to support the building, and the store features a tribute to the Kolbs‚Äô photographs of mule riders at Grand Canyon. The start of the Bright Angel Trail is to the west of the Kolb Studio. = Restoration project = Restoration work During 2013 and 2014, the Grand Canyon Association was in the process of restoring and rehabilitating this significant building. Work includes addressing the structural degradation of Kolb Studio. : a) rectifying drainage problems from public sidewalks and corresponding retaining walls, : b) stabilizing the concrete entranceway to assure safe continuing access to the facility : c) repairing and replacing exterior building features (e.g. log and shingle siding, structural beams, gutters, wooden porches) in order to assure long-term structural integrity of the building and : d) protecting restored exterior surfaces with paints, sealants and other coatings.

Early years Albert Norden was born in Myslowitz, Silesia on 4 December 1904, one of the five recorded children born to the liberal rabbi (1870‚Äì1943) and his wife, Emilie Meseritz/Norden (1876‚Äì1931). In 1919, he joined the Young Communist League of Germany. The following year, he became a member of the Communist Party of Germany. From 1923 onwards, he held editorial positions in various communist publications. Between 1931 and 1933, he was the editor of Rote Fahne ('Red Flag').Amos, Heike.

M√ºnster: Lit, 2003, pp. 547‚Äì48. In exile In 1933 Norden emigrated to France. He also spent time in exile in Denmark and Czechoslovakia. In 1938, he returned to France. Norden was detained in France 1939‚Äì1940. In 1941, he was able to emigrate to the United States. During World War II, his father died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.Zuckermann, Moshe.

In exile in Paris and New York he worked with various popular front publications. He wrote some chapters, dealing with the international linkages of the German NSDAP, in the widely read 1933 Braunbuch √ºber Reichstagsbrand und Hitlerterror ('Brown Book on Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror').Palmier, Jean Michel. Weimar in exile: the antifascist emigration in Europe and America. London: Verso, 2006. p. 320 In 1940, he married Herta Fischer (1908‚Äì1990), and their son, Johnny, was born in October 1942. In October 1946 he returned to Berlin, where he became editor of the weekly Deutschlands Stimme ('Voice of Germany'). Political career in East Germany Norden at the 6th SED Party Congress (1963) In 1949, he was assigned as head of the Press Section of the Information Department of Ministerial Council of the German Democratic Republic, working under Gerhart Eisler. In December 1952, he was purged from his position in the Press Department, but obtained a professorship at Humboldt University.Herf, Jeffrey. Divided Memory: The Nazi Past in the Two Germanys. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 170. In 1954, he became director of the National Council of the National Front for a Democratic Germany. He would also become director of the Committee for German Unity. In 1955, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). He was elected as one of the secretaries of the Central Committee. In 1958 he became a member of the Politburo of the party. Norden served as head of the Agitation Committee of the Politburo, 1955‚Äì67. He was in-charge of the Information & Foreign Department of the Politburo until 1979. In 1958, he became a member of the Volkskammer (People's Chamber, the parliament of the GDR). In 1960 he became the head of the 'West Commission'. In June 1965 Norden suggested that regional elections in the German Democratic Republic should be open for alternate candidates.Staar, Richard Felix. Communist Regimes in Eastern Europe. Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 1982, p. 109. In 1963, Norden became a member of the National Defense Council, a post he held until 1979. In 1976 he became a member of the State Council. In April 1981, the then ailing Norden was left out of the Central Committee and Politburo at the 10th SED party congress. In the same year he left the Volkskammer and State Council positions. Brown Book Braunbuch After the war Norden argued in several publications, articles and speeches that there was a direct continuation between the Hitler and Adenauer governments. In 1965 the National Front published a work by Norden, Braunbuch ('Brown Book'), in which he accused over 1,900 politicians, state officials and other prominent persons in West Germany of having worked for the Nazi regime in the past. The book became a reference in the West German New Left, which increasingly had begun to question the official historiography on the Nazi period.Herf, Jeffrey.

The book was Barfield's favorite of those he wrote, and the one that he most wanted to continue to be read.Lavery, \\"How Barfield thought\\", p. 15.\\" It was first published in England in 1957, and it was first issued in paperback in the United States in 1965. According to Barfield, the book enjoyed a far greater reception by the public in the United States, where Barfield often accepted invitations to lecture, than it did in England.Barfield, Saving the Appearances, p. 5. The book explores approximately three thousand years of history ‚Äî particularly the history of human consciousness in relation to that which precedes or underlies the world of perception or phenomena. Given the vast field considered by the book, it is concise and brief, about two hundred pages. Barfield describes the growth of human consciousness as an interaction with nature, leading the reader to a fresh understanding of man's history, circumstances, and destiny. Saving the Appearances has in common with some thoughts of Teilhard de Chardin the understanding of idols as appearances having nothing within. \\"[A] representation, which is collectively mistaken for an ultimate ‚Äì ought not to be called a representation. It is an idol. Thus the phenomena themselves are idols, when they are imagined as enjoying that independence of human perception which can in fact only pertain to the unrepresented.\\"Altizer, \\"Review of Worlds Apart\\", page 384.

Altizer said of the work, \\"I believe that this book is potentially one of the truly seminal works of our time.\\"Altizer, \\"Review of Worlds Apart\\", page 385.

Brown to identify the book published in the last decade which he found himself going back most often to, he responded, \\"I want to name Owen Barfield‚Äôs Saving the Appearances\\".Norman Brown, \\"Letter in \\"The Revolving Bookstand\\", page 478. C.S. Lewis referred to Barfield as \\"the wisest and best of my unofficial teachers.\\" SynopsisAn Evolution of Phenomena Correlative to an Evolution of Consciousness= Barfield argues that if, as physics suggests, ordinary appearances‚Äîincluding for example colors, sounds, and smells‚Äîare a kind of subjective response of the human organism to an unknown underlying base of reality, and if what underlies our phenomena and is real independently of us is only what is suggested by science's experimental hypotheses of a subatomic world; if, that is, we must conclude that there is no such thing as unseen color, unheard sound, or unfelt solidity, because physics tells us the only thing existing independently of us is a subsensible or supersensible base symbolized in some detail by particle theory‚Äîthen in that case other sciences besides physics, in particular those sciences that deal with the pre-human past, must be profoundly reconceived. For example, the evolutionary biologist and the archaeologist talk about the pre-human, and even pre-life distant past as if color, sound, solidity, and a phenomenal world rather like that of modern Western humanity were all present even before the advent of life and consciousness, though physics tells us that all that is present in the absence of human beings or life is what can be described quantitatively by the particle theories of physics. Barfield emphasizes that contradiction between physics on the one hand, and on the other, sciences that offer an account of the earth before life and consciousness evolved. Barfield draws out the implications and argues we must learn to conceive of an evolution of phenomena that first begins at the point where life and consciousness manifest. The evolution of phenomena is correlative to the evolution of consciousness. Prior to the point where consciousness, and in particular human consciousness, comes into existence, we should not naively speak as if phenomena similar to our own existed. It is critical to note that Barfield's thesis and intentions in the book, looked at in close enough detail, do not really commit him to accepting the view that all that is present independently of human awareness is what physics describes of a subatomic world. Rather, he is positioned to entertain his fundamental thesis when he merely allows that what \\"underlies\\" the phenomena is at least provisionally somewhat different from and other than the phenomena (this means, for example, that what \\"underlies\\" phenomena could include, in addition to the subatomic world, a non-physical, pre-physical, or spiritual world of \\"potentia\\"). Barfield's thesis also depends on recognizing, as virtually every form of cognitive science, psychology, and recent philosophy does recognize, that perception of a coherent phenomenal world of experience is to a great extent dependent on some kind of organizing activity working in or via the percipient. The activity in question is mostly unconscious, and is or resembles a kind of thinking. When assuming the absence of human percipients (for example in the pre-human past), Barfield says we should no longer naively speak of the world as if phenomena like those of human beings were present. Yet archaeologists and evolutionary biologists still do so all the time, forgetting what physics has been telling us. =¬ß1: The Rainbow= Barfield argues that one key difference between a dream or hallucination of, say, a rainbow and the sight of an actual rainbow is that ‚Äî while they are both appearances or \\"representations\\" (key words for Barfield) ‚Äì the dream rainbow is private, whereas the actual rainbow is shared. He is careful to point out, however, that being shared is not the only difference between an actual rainbow and a dream of one. An actual phenomenon is not merely a dream that is shared. Even if one is alone on a desert island, one can learn from the world itself the difference between appearances that are actually there, and appearances that are there only in the manner of hallucinations. Barfield argues that three components make up an appearance, say, of a real tree: (1) the \\"unrepresented,\\" namely that which is supposed to be independent of human consciousness (2) a person's vision, and (3) other sense-perceptions. Sometimes he refers to the \\"unrepresented\\" as \\"the particles,\\" (such as atoms and subatomic particles) though he does not mean that literally but only as a kind of concession to the conventional view, which he adopts to begin with for the sake of discussion. If one reads him carefully, however, one discovers that by \\"unrepresented,\\" he means a provisionally unknown \\"subsensible\\" or \\"supersensible\\" base; whether that base is in fact merely what physics suggests, or is something more, he leaves open to begin with. During the course of the book, it becomes clear that the unrepresented, while including what physics discovers, is infinitely more. In the first chapter, he says a \\"representation\\" is something I perceive to be there. He wants to establish that > the familiar world which we see and know around us ‚Äì the blue sky with white > clouds in it, the noise of a waterfall or a motor-bus, the shapes of flowers > and their scent, the gesture and utterance of animals and the faces of our > friends ‚Äì the world too, which (apart from the special inquiry of physics) > experts of all kinds methodically investigate ‚Äì is a system of collective > representations. The time comes when one must either accept this as the > truth about the world or reject the theories of physics as an elaborate > delusion.Barfield, \\"Saving the Appearances\\", p. 18. =¬ß2: Collective Representations= Barfield argues that one of the most important tests in distinguishing an appearance or representation that is not really outside us from an appearance that is really present outside us, is to get confirmation from fellow human beings. Barfield also wishes to stress the difference between the collective representations on the one hand and the unrepresented (the subsensible or supersensible base), on the other. He wants to establish that (The book considers not merely representations and the \\"unrepresented,\\" but also the \\"represented.\\") In chapter one, Barfield refers to the unrepresented as that which exists entirely independently of human consciousness. Before human beings came into existence, the unrepresented existed. But now that human beings exist, when our perceptual systems and our consciousness interact with the unrepresented, a phenomenal world is produced, which is the world of collective representations. Barfield argues that in perception it is important to note two things: (1) \\"we must not confuse the percept with its cause\\" (for example, if particles/waves cause sounds, we must recognize that the experience of sound is no more like the theorized waves/particles than drops of rain are like the sight of a rainbow) and (2) we do not perceive with a sense-organ alone, but with a great part of our whole human being. Much besides mere sense perception is necessary. Without things \\"like mental habits, memory, imagination, feeling and ... will\\" the world would be a blooming, buzzing confusion.Barfield, \\"Saving the Appearances\\", p. 20. Barfield insists that these two maxims are consistent with almost any theory of perception: perception depends to a large extent upon the thinking activity‚Äîconscious and mostly less than conscious‚Äîof perceivers. =¬ß3: Figuration and Thinking= Barfield states that there are three different things we can do with representations: (1) We can simply experience the representations. For experience, it is necessary to have two components: (a) sense-organs must be influenced by the unrepresented (subsensible or supersensible base), and (b) the act of figuration, in which the percipient mind combines and construes sensations into a relatively ordered phenomenal world of beings and things. To begin with, figuration is largely unconscious. (2) We can think about the representations. At this point, we are still unconscious of the intimate relationship that these representations have with our own figuration activity. In thinking about representations, we begin to treat the representations as entirely other, or distinct, from us and from each other, so they gradually cease to appear to us as representations: we start to perceive them instead as mere \\"things.\\" For convenience and to avoid the confusion that comes with already loaded popular terms, Barfield calls this thinking about the representations alpha-thinking. (3) We can think about the nature of collective representations and about how they relate to our own minds. We can think about perceiving and think about thinking. Philosophy and psychology study such things. Again, to avoid confusion, Barfield calls this beta-thinking. Barfield points out that despite the distinctions between these types of thinking, they blend into one another and interact in important ways. Saving the Appearances is a study of the relationship between figuration and alpha-thinking, but also concerns the ways in which beta-thinking affects and is affected by the other two phases of mental activity. =¬ß4: Participation= Participation refers to a non-sensory unity between the perceiver and the representations. In this context, Barfield argues against a common view that says 1) the phenomena or representations of primitives are just like ours, and 2) the primitive differs from us in primitively theorizing that spirits are the cause of phenomena. The primitive in that common view is a sort of baby scientist just starting out who comes up with childish, superstitious causal explanations. Barfield disagrees with this portrayal of the primitive mind, citing anthropologists √âmile Durkheim and Lucien L√©vy- Br√ºhl to the effect that primitive people do not perceive the world in the same way as moderns, nor do they propose spirits in an explanatory way as causes. Rather, primitives live in a world of \\"original participation,\\" where the phenomena are not perceived as mere \\"things\\" separate from each other and from the perceiver. Instead, the primitive is aware of a non-sensory link between himself and the representations, and of the representations among one another. He has barely begun to do \\"alpha thinking,\\" i.e., the modern person's detached thinking about the representations that tends to isolate them from himself and from each other. The primitive does not use the idea of spirits as a causal explanation of phenomena: in some sense he actually perceives non- sensory elements in the representations, whereby he participates the representations and they participate each other. Primitive people‚Äôs behavior towards the world (as exemplified for example in totemism and animism in ancient literature, artwork, and philosophy) entails above all a different kind of \\"figuration\\"‚Äînot a primitive alpha thinking applied to the same kind of figuration as that of moderns. The first three chapters of the book focus on the fact that we still participate in the representations, although it is mostly unconscious for us today. Barfield emphasizes that it is no part of his purpose to advocate a return to the primitive's \\"original participation.\\" He explores how our type of figuration grew out of the primitive type, and can evolve further toward a new form of figuration which he calls \\"final participation.\\" More generally, the book is concerned with the evolution of consciousness over the last three thousand years.

Although an ongoing debate involving connection between dietary lipids and CHD sometimes portrays the two hypotheses as being opposed, they are in no way mutually exclusive. Moreover, since the discovery of the role of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the two hypotheses have become tightly linked by a number of molecular and cellular processes.cf.  Origins of the hypothesis  Ross and Glomset initially proposed that endothelial cell uncovering was the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. Other hypotheses have associated the role of infectious agents (e.g. cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori) in inflammatory responses in the arterial wall. Currently, most research seems to focus on inflammatory processes which associate endothelial dysfunction with lipoprotein accumulation.  The inflammatory process  The first phase of the inflammatory process is marked by the accumulation of lipid and low- density lipoprotein (LDL) particles beneath the endothelium. This is followed by the attachment of leukocytes, monocytes, and T-lymphocytes to the endothelial cell surface. Leukocytes migrate to the subendothelial space and aggregate within the intima. In the presence of elevated levels of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), monocytes are converted to activated macrophages. Macrophages accumulate modified lipid particles and become foam cells. The formation of foam cells and their continued accumulation in the intima lead to the formation of fatty streaks. Continued cell migration and proliferation eventually result in the formation of a fibrous plaque.  The role of oxidized LDL  Once LDL accumulates in the subendothelial space, it tends to become modified or oxidized. This oxidized LDL plays several key roles in furthering the course of the inflammatory process. It is chemotactic to monocytes; oxidized LDL causes endothelial cells to secrete molecules that cause monocytes to penetrate between the endothelial cells and accumulate in the intima. Oxidized LDL promotes death of endothelial cells by augmenting apoptosis. Also, through the activation of collagenases, ox-LDL contributes to a process which may lead to the rupture of the fibrous plaque Oxidized LDL decreases the availability of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which, in turn, increases the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium. Moreover, NO is involved in paracrine signalling between the endothelium and the smooth muscle that maintains vascular tone; without it, the muscle will not relax, and the blood vessel remains constricted. Thus, oxidized LDL also contributes to the hypertension often seen with atherosclerosis. Implications for the treatment and prevention of arteriosclerosis The role LDL plays suggests two different approaches to treatment and prevention. The first approach involves discouraging the accumulation of LDL by lowering the levels of serum LDL, an idea more closely associated with the lipid hypothesis. A major breakthrough involved the discovery of statins, a class of drugs which help to clear LDL from the bloodstream. It has been demonstrated conclusively that elevated levels of LDL are associated with higher risk of mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD); it has also been shown that statins substantially lower the risk of mortality in patients with high LDL. A second approach would be to discourage the oxidation of LDL, thereby breaking the inflammatory cycle. Lipoproteins consist of a packaging of triglycerides and esterfied cholesterol within a monolayer shell consisting of phospholipids and a class of proteins called apolipoproteins. The phospholipids are amphipathic, consisting of a hydrophobic tail which faces inwards, binding with the triglycerides and cholesterol, and a hydrophilic head which faces outwards, making the lipoproteins water-soluble. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contained in the outer shell make the lipoproteins especially susceptible to oxidation. However, lipoproteins also contain antioxidants which protect the components, vitamin E and carotenoids being the two major naturally occurring antioxidants in human lipoprotein. Although some studies have shown positive results following anti-oxidant therapy with vitamin C, vitamin E therapy has attracted the most public attention. There have been some positive results, though recent studies have shown no benefit for antioxidant therapy on mortality among patients at risk for CHD.,  Implications for diet: Dietary lipids and LDL levels  An early incarnation of the lipid hypothesis which focused on hypercholesterolemia lead to the suggestion that mortality from CHD might be reduced by controlling dietary input of cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated that increasing dietary cholesterol leads to an increase in both total cholesterol (TC) and LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C), however it also leads to increases in the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), offsetting the effect of the increase in LDL-C. Epidemiological studies which attempted to correlate dietary cholesterol with risk of mortality in CHD have produced mixed results. Recent studies have focused more on the ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet. It has been demonstrated that intake of SFA raises TC in humans, whereas PUFA lowers TC; however SFA also increases the level of HDL-C, once more offsetting the effect of increased TC. Studies of individual fatty acids show that some SFAs, e.g. stearic acid and palmitic acid have little effect of LDL-C levels; stearic acid actually lowers the LDL/HDL ratio due to a greater increase of HDL-C levels relative to TC. Epidemiological studies designed to test the relationship between high SFA/PUFA ratios and CHD mortality have tended to produce mixed results. Two recent studies provide an example of this lack of consensus: a study from Poland correlated a decline in CHD mortality with a decrease in the ratio of SFA to PUFA in the population's diet following the collapse of communism. Yet a large population study from Sweden covering roughly the same time period showed no association between fat intake and CHD.  The AHA guidelines and the beginning of a controversy  The early studies associating the ratio of dietary SFA and PUFA with TC levels led the American Heart Association (AHA) to promulgate a set of dietary guidelines which included the recommendation to replace saturated fats found in dairy and meat products with polyunsaturated fats found in natural vegetable oils such as those derived from \\"corn, cottonseed, and soya\\". This first set of recommendations, published in the Journal Circulation in 1961, specifically sanctioned the use of products containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, i.e. margarine and vegetable shortening. Despite the lack of uncontrovertable epidemiological evidence of their effectiveness, these initial guidelines received widespread acceptance among the medical community in the US. The suggestion to replace saturated animal fats with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils lead to a reaction which will be discussed below. However, is important to note that the AHA's dietary guidelines have undergone several revisions since the initial report. Although the most recent (2006) guidelines still recommend reducing the consumption of saturated fat, they no longer suggest switching to polyunsaturated fats. Moreover, the guidelines now recommend minimizing the intake of partially hydrogenated fats while increasing the consumption of fish and other sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, the position of the AHA is now much closer to that of its critics.  Criticism of the AHA guidelines: the ‚ÄúCholesterol Skeptics‚Äù  Critics of the AHA dietary guidelines point out that incidence of CHD in the US increased markedly during a 60-year period beginning in 1910. During the same period, consumption of saturated fat fell, while consumption of processed vegetable oils rose more than 400%. (Much of the evidence presented to support this claim of a large increase in incidence of CHD in the early part of the century is anecdotal. Statistics covering the period from 1950 to 1980 show that mortality from CHD in the US, although much higher than in most other countries, began to decline slowly after 1966 (mortality in the UK, although initially much lower than in the US, rose continuously during this period). These are mortality figures; the downward trend in the US probably reflects improvements in survival rate and not a decrease in incidence.) This observation led some critics to invert the AHA guidelines. They stress benefits of dietary SFA, citing presence of natural antioxidants in animal fats, while encouraging people to avoid foods containing processed vegetable oils. They focus on deleterious effect of dietary PUFA, often mentioning two factors: (1) the vulnerability of PUFA to oxidation and the formation of free radicals, and (2) the high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA in the more common vegetable oils‚Äîthose derived from ‚Äúcorn, cottonseed, and soya‚Äù. Their considerations are not limited to CHD, they point to an entire litany of inflammatory disorders which can be linked to diet and the consumption of processed vegetable oils. Some critics also question the safety of cholesterol-lowering drugs, suggesting that CHD is best controlled using a combination of diet and exercise.

Playing career Shaw played for Hibs during the interwar period, making his debut during the 1918‚Äì19 season. He played as a left half-back in the Hibs side that reached the Scottish Cup Finals of 1923 and 1924, losing to Celtic and Airdrie respectively.Mackay, pp104. Shaw left Hibs in 1926 to play for Rangers. He played in 36 league games in the 1926‚Äì27 season, but then moved to Hearts. Shaw played in a Hearts team that threatened to challenge for the league championship in 1928, but eventually finished fourth. He later played for East Fife, Leith Athletic and Elgin City. Coaching career Shaw was hired as Hibs' trainer by Willie McCartney in 1936, after McCartney had been appointed manager. Hibs had fallen on hard times in the early 1930s, having suffered relegation for the first time in 1931 and then struggling to regain and retain Division One status. Through the late 1930s and the Second World War, McCartney built the great Hibs side that would largely dominate Scottish football in the late 1940s and early 1950s. With Hibs on top of the league midway through the 1947‚Äì48 season, however, McCartney collapsed during a Scottish Cup match and died later that night.Mackay, pp156. Although Matt Busby was linked with the job, Shaw was appointed as manager within the week, as Hibs faced a match against their main challengers, Rangers. Hibs won that match 1‚Äì0 with a goal in the last minute and went on to win the league championship. Shaw completed the Famous Five forward line by introducing Bobby Johnstone to the team in 1948, with all five playing together for the first time on 21 April 1949.Mackay, pp158. He guided the team to further league championships in 1951 and 1952, while also narrowly missing out in 1950 and 1953. The team also entered the first European Cup competition in 1955‚Äì56, reaching the semi-final. The forward line was broken by the sale of Bobby Johnstone to Manchester City in 1955, and the remaining players were starting to age.Mackay, pp178. Hibs continued to do well in reserve team football, but many of those players failed to impress in the first team, with the brilliant exception of Joe Baker. Therefore, Shaw had to take some of the blame for the failure to replace the great side. After the team struggled at the start of the 1961‚Äì62 season, Shaw resigned in November 1961.Mackay, pp190. He then had a brief spell as Raith Rovers manager. Shaw died in 1976, aged 80.Hugh Shaw, Hibs Historical Trust. In 2003, the Sunday Herald newspaper listed Shaw as 31st in their list of the 50 greatest Scottish football managers, noting his \\"sense and man-management skills\\".Scotland's 50 Greatest Football Managers : 50 to eleven, Sunday Herald, 8 June 2003.

The ruse was organized by Pierre- Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, a French playwright, watch-maker, inventor, musician, politician, fugitive, spy, publisher, arms-dealer, and revolutionary. Weapons and materials were procured to help the Americans fight the British, enemies of France at the time, through the corporation. Background The Seven Years' War had gone badly for France, which had lost nearly all of her North American colonial possessions and had been militarily humiliated by the British. Spain, who had been an ally of France late in the war, had lost the strategically important territory of Florida. Britain, meanwhile, had expanded its colonial territories across large areas of North America. To get out of legal trouble Pierre Beaumarchais pledged his services to the king in order to restore his civil rights.Beaumarchais: The three Figaro plays, translation and notes by David Edney, Doverhouse, 2000. In 1774, Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes was appointed the foreign minister of France by Louis XVI. Vergennes was strongly anti-England, at one point declaring \\"England is the natural enemy of France.\\" His chance to strike at Britain came through Pierre Beaumarchais. The company in operation Beaumarchais, working as a secret agent, had traveled to London in pursuit of Chevalier d'Eon, a cross-dressing agent of Louis XVI, who had threatened the King with blackmail.Georges √âdouard Lema√Ætre. Beaumarchais. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1949 During that period Beaumarchais fell in with the dissolute crowd that surrounded John Wilkes, the Mayor of London. There he received a letter from the Continental Congress, delivered by Arthur Lee. In it Congress suggested to his government that it encourage the rebellion in the thirteen colonies by sending secret military aid disguised as a loan. Beaumarchais believed Britain's economy would be significantly crippled without the thirteen colonies. Louis XVI and Vergennes agreed. Both states were unwilling to openly show their support, at least until after the rebellion had successfully begun. Before the Declaration of Independence was even signed, weapons and other necessities were already flowing via the ostensibly neutral Dutch island of St. Eustatius. Muskets, cannons, cannonballs, gunpowder, bombs, mortars, tents, and enough clothing for 30,000 men were sent. This assistance kept American hopes alive during the spring of 1776.Jones, Crucible of Power. pp. 6 Hortalez & Co. conducted business with the Americans from France through Connecticut merchant Silas Deane, who was sharing a covert trade agency with Thomas Morris the half-brother of Robert Morris (financier). Because this business did not include Arthur Lee, Lee then made it a point that Beaumarchais would never be paid for the goods he provided. He did this, not to harm Beaumarchais, but to deprive a political competitor his commission. As a result of Lee's actions, Deane lived in disgrace and poverty for years, and eventually died trying to prove that he was due the money. Opposition The only major opposition to the plan came from French minister of finance Baron Turgot. He insisted that American independence would occur whether or not France financed the rebellion. He said the funding would add to the already heavy burden of a general French military and naval buildup and would lead to bankruptcy. Turgot eventually resigned in protest.

It forms on open water, when snowpack and ice are mixed together and other conditions. It may be transparent, causing it to look like new black ice. Though it may appear strong, rotten ice is weak‚Äîeven several feet thick may not hold a person's weight. On land, it is difficult or impossible to climb. It melts more quickly than solid ice. Candle ice is a form of rotten ice. One way to tell that ice is rotting would be the grey, splotchy color. Also, the thickness of ice cannot determine how safe it is, because water from underneath the ice can erode the ice and cause it to be thinner without a sign on the surface. Even thick ice may be weak, especially if it has frozen and thawed repeatedly or if it contains layers of snow. Minerals in the water make vertical veins in the ice. These veins melt much faster than the rest of the ice causing vertical channels and the ice to weaken along those channels. Many people tend to question if snow actually warms up ice, making it more likely to crack and break, or if snow actually causes ice to freeze faster. Snow will actually act like an insulating blanket. The ice under the snow will be thinner and weaker. A new snowfall can also warm-up and melt existing ice. Rotten ice is becoming more commonly found in the Beaufort Sea, near Alaska, due to different climate changes. This is concerning, because it is a sign that the amount of multiyear ice is declining, and it is being replaced with heavily decayed ice.

There he started to work for the World Esperanto Association, of which he had been a member since 1909. In 1934 he resigned from the role of Director, as a form of protest, and started working elsewhere. In the end, he worked in an office of the Swiss federation until he retired.

Jakob and Esperanto  In 1920 Jakob became the director of the central office of UEA; he cared after the publication of Jarlibroj and after the magazine Esperanto. He became General Director of the World Esperanto Association in 1924; he left the post in 1934, when he resigned, as a form of protest, during the World Esperanto Congress in Stockholm. Since 1936, when the association split into two branches (headquartered respectively in Geneva and London), he began once again to serve as a redactor for the Genevan association. After the reunification of the two associations, in 1947, he joined the governing council of the reborn UEA and started caring after the magazine. In 1955 he resigned from all the posts as a form of protest, but he was nevertheless awarded the title \\"honorary redactor\\". In 1960 the governing council of UEA learnt that Jakob had been unduly taking some money from the association; a years-long judicial procedure followed suit. When Jakob died, in 1967, UEA inherited part of his money.

A. : Parish of Woolverstone, Section 10) is supposedly derived from Wulfhere, whose ‚Äútun‚Äù or enclosure was at its beginning. There have been numerous archaeological finds in the area, including flint axes and an arrowhead believed to be Neolithic, beaker shards and flints from the Bronze Age, shards and a brooch from the Romans, and a coin and brooch from the Saxons.

The Widows' Homes have two stone monkeys set on the roof, said to relate to an incident where a pet monkey saved a child of the Berners family from a fire. The Cat House (a Gothic-style house) is reputed to have belonged to a man who was sympathetic to boats carrying contraband along the river. When his favoured cat died he had it stuffed and when he could see that no customs boats were patrolling the river, he put it in the window to signal that the \\"coast was clear.\\"TM1939 : Woolverstone Marina at geograph.org.uk Woolverstone House was designed in 1901 by \\"arts and crafts\\" architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and was built for Mrs C.

Other establishments Woolverstone Marina is set in 22 acres of parkland on the River Orwell, with the Royal Harwich Yacht Club nearby. Woolverstone Marina is one of 21 locations owned and operated by Marina Developments Limited (MDL). There are the normal marina facilities, including The Wheelhouse bar and restaurant and a chandlery. There is also a family business based at Woolverstone Marina supplying leisure and marine products for campers, caravanners and yachtsmen. The nearby Royal Harwich Yacht Club is a Victorian yacht club formed in 1843 and has had many Royal connections; Prince Philip is the current Patron. The yacht club moved to its present site soon after World War II after its previous premises had been demolished for the expansion of the Navy Yard at Harwich. In 1973, floating pontoons were stationed at the bottom of the club lawn, which then provided the club with its own marina.

His performances were characterized by a strong voice and a particular sense of cubanismo.  Life  Miguelito Vald√©s was born as Miguel √Ångel Eugenio L√°zaro Zacar√≠as Izquierdo Vald√©s Hern√°ndezBillboard April 25, 1942 on September 6, 1912 in Havana. His father was Spanish and his mother was Mexican from Yucat√°n. He was born in Bel√©n (in Old Havana), and moved to another barrio, Cayo Hueso (in Centro Habana), when his father died. In his youth he worked as an auto mechanic and was a good amateur boxer. In 1934 he won the Amateur Championship of Cuba at his weight. One of his closest friends from his days in the barrio was Chano Pozo, and in his singing style he has been called \\"as black a white guy as you would meet in Havana\\".Sublette, Ned. Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo, p. 440. Chicago, Ill. 2004. In 1936 he married Vera Eskildsen, an aristocrate from Panama City with whom he had a son, Juan Miguel Vald√©s Eskildsen. In 1968 he lived in Palm Springs, California.  Career  He got his start in the night clubs of Havana, and first attracted renown as vocalist at the Havana-Riverside Casino. Vald√©s began his musical career in the Sexteto Habanero Infantil, where he played, variously, the guitar, tres, double bass, timbal and sometimes sang. Soon, his capability as a singer was realized, and from that moment he was constantly in demand. After a brief spell with Mar√≠a Teresa Vera's Sexteto Occidente, he was one of the founding members of the Septeto J√≥venes del Cayo in 1929. In 1933 he moved to the charanga of Ismael D√≠az, and then to the Charanga Gris, directed by the pianist and composer Armando Vald√©s Torres, and to the Orquesta Habana, directed by Estanislao Servi√°.Giro, Radam√©s. Diccionario Enciclop√©dico de la M√∫sica en Cuba. Vol 4, p. 252. La Habana, Cuba. 2007. Vald√©s as a boxer In 1934, he made his first journey abroad, to Panama, and on his return joined the Orquesta Hermanos Castro, which was a leading band of the day. He was their lead singer until 1936. In 1937, he joined a group of top musicians who formed the Orquesta Casino de la Playa. In June 1937 Vald√©s and Casino de la Playa began recording for RCA-Victor, making their debut with Bruca manigu√°, a song composed by Arsenio Rodr√≠guez. He was now perhaps the top singer in Cuba, on the verge of international fame. In 1939, La Playa toured South America and Central America. By that time, their records were highly successful all around Latin America. In 1940, Vald√©s briefly joined the Orquesta Riverside (another of the big Cuban bands) before emigrating to New York City, which became his home base for the rest of his career. In New York City he worked for Orquesta Siboney de Alberto Iznaga, Xavier Cugat, Noro Morales, Tito Rodr√≠guez and Machito. He directed his own orchestra for a few years, and made some successful recordings with it in 1949 and 1950.Miguelito Vald√©s with His Super Orchestra: Mambo Dance Session.

Vald√©s recorded this number with three top orchestras: Casino de la Playa in Havana, and Xavier Cugat and Machito in New York. He recorded with the renowned band Sonora Matancera in 1951 and 1977. Vald√©s was regarded as one of the greatest soneros and guaracheros of his time. Although non-African, his interpretation of Afro-Cuban lyrics was remarkable.

Biography Wagenvoort was born in Minnertsga on August 23, 1886. He began studying classics at Utrecht University in 1904 and took his doctoral degree in 1911. His dissertation was called De Horatii quae dicuntur Odis Romanis and dealt with Horace's so called Roman Odes. After a year of further studies in G√∂ttingen and Rome he began teaching Latin at gymnasiums, from 1912 to 1919 in Arnhem and from 1919 to 1924 in The Hague. In 1924 he became professor of Latin language and literature at the University of Groningen and during the following years he directed his efforts at examining Religion in the late Roman Republic and the early Imperial Rome. He moved to Utrecht in 1930 to succeed Pieter Helbert Damst√© (who directed Wagenvoort's doctoral dissertation) as professor of Latin. His inaugural lecture was called Pax Augusta, in line with his earlier research, but gradually his interest shifted to the religion of the earliest Rome and \\"primitive survivals\\" in later Roman religious life. In 1956, at age 70, Wagenvoort officially retired but he continued to work at the University and in other contexts. Wagenvoort was a deacon in the Reformed Church and a member of the Commission of the Unemployed during the economic crisis of the 1930s. He also served as the president of a number of institutions including the Provincial Society of Utrecht (Provinciaal Utrechts Genootschap) and the Extra-mural University of Utrecht (Utrechtse Volksuniversiteit). Additionally, he served as judge of Hoeufftianum, an annual competition in Latin poetry. In 1942 Wagenvoort became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It was named after Conrad Haas, a medieval rocket pioneer who lived and worked in what is now Romania, and was the first person to describe a multistage rocket in writing.  Haas  Haas was a Romanian carrier rocket, which was developed by ARCA as part of the ELE programme. It was designed to be air-launched from a high-altitude balloon, similar to the American Rockoon experiments of the 1950s. Prior to the development of Haas, ARCA had already launched two Stabilo rockets from balloons. It is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and bitumen. The Haas rocketARCA Space, Haas Orbital Rocket Launcher fact sheet, Dec. 2, 2008 (accessed 22 Sept 2014) was to be a three-stage rocket intended to be capable of placing 400 kilograms of payload into low Earth orbit. Its maiden flight was to carry the European Lunar Explorer spacecraft, ARCA's entry into the Google Lunar X-Prize, following a series of engine tests which began in 2009. It was abandoned when ARCA decided to stop using solar and helium balloons for their space program.  Haas 2  Haas 2 rocket with IAR 111 supersonic plane Haas 2 was an orbital two-stage launcher design intended to be carried under the fuselage of the IAR 111 supersonic plane.

It was an intended single-stage-to-orbit vehicle due to its lightweight fuel tanks and was originally planned for a 2018 launch.  2020 plans  ARCAspace changed the plans of future rockets over time. As of March 2020, the company plans to develop ground-launched single-stage-to-orbit rockets which can optionally increase their payload with a booster stage (called Launch assist system, LAS). It is planned to test two stages of a small orbital rocket (LAS 25R and Haas mini) in independent flights in 2020, before the two are combined for a first orbital flight in 2021. This two-stage rocket is planned to have a payload capacity of 40 kg to low Earth orbit. A larger first stage is expected for 2022, followed by a single-stage-to-orbit rocket Haas 3 in 2023, carrying up to 500 kg of payload. Combining both, ARCAspace expects to achieve a payload capacity of 3 tonnes in 2024. This sequence would repeat with even larger rocket stages, leading to a 60 tonne payload rocket in 2027.

The 1889 legislation created county councils, turned each civil county (with one exception) into a contiguous area (without separate fragments) and adjusted boundaries where civil parishes straddled county boundaries, or had fragments in more than one county.

An unusual design without a conventional landing gear, it used a wheeled trolley for take-off and three retractable skids to land. The Baroudeur did not enter production. Design and development The Baroudeur was a lightweight fighter, designed to operate from grass airfields, conceived and designed in the early stages of the Cold War. The Baroudeur (French Foreign Legion slang for brawling soldier) was the brainchild of Wsiewo≈Çod \\"John\\" Jakimiuk, a Polish engineer who had worked on similar concepts at PZL and Avro Canada. The rationale behind the design was to operate tactical jet interceptors from unprepared sites in case the air force bases were destroyed in a preemptive strike (drawing from the German experience in the last stages of World War II). It used a wheeled trolley that could be used for take off from grass, and three retractable skids (the third at the tail for landing) for take off from snow- or ice-covered surfaces. The skids incorporated a crude suspension/damping system made of rubber rings. The three-wheeled trolley had provision to use rockets (two or four according to terrain plus two back-up) if needed to assist. Apart from the landing gear the aircraft was a conventional shoulder-wing monoplane with a 38 degree swept wing and tail surfaces and powered by a SNECMA Atar 101C turbojet with wing- root intakes. The first of two prototypes flew on the 1 August 1953. Three pre-production aircraft designated the S.E.5003 were also built with Atar 101D turbojet engines but the type was not ordered into production. Operational testing Extensive testing was conducted by test pilot Jacques \\"Tito\\" Maulandi and though the underfunded prototypes proved troublesome, the design also showed some promising characteristics. It was later dubbed a \\"Jet dirt bike\\" for its off-road capabilities. It proved capable to fly with its take off trolley in place (so it could easily switch to another unprepared airstrip), to take off with the skids only on some suitable terrain (sometimes with RATO rockets for extra thrust), to land on beaches (it was test flown off the La Baule beach; on one occasion barely escaped the incoming tide), frozen lakes, motorways, even marshes. It managed a barely supersonic speeds reaching over Istres air base. Testing also included high speed runs with a mocked-up crude rocket propelled airplane (with straight wings and some working controls) on the real rocket-powered trolley, complete with final separation at over 160 km/h (100 mph). On one such occasion the test pilot suffered concussion and light injuries when the trolley cartwheeled at high speed and became unmanageable. The SE 5000 was entered, along with the promising Breguet Taon in the NATO test session for a lightweight fighter but lost out to the Fiat G91. The five prototype and preproduction Baroudeurs were disposed of as gunnery targets at Cazaux airforce base in south-west France but a non-profit concern organisation (Ailes Anciennes Le Bourget, with ties to Le Bourget Air Museum) managed to scavenge most of the remains of three or four wrecks to create one SE 5003 in display condition.\\"R√©flexions sur un avion fossile par son pilote en attente de fossilization\\" Jean Jacques \\"Tito\\" Maulandi Variants SNCASE Baroudeur at Paris Air Show, 19 June 1999. ;S.E.5000 Baroudeur :Prototype powered by a SNECMA Atar 101C turbojet, two built. ;S.E.5003 Baroudeur :Pre-production aircraft powered by a SNECMA Atar 101D turbojet, three built.

Peter Taltavull (1825 ‚Äì April 8, 1881) played a minor role in the events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. John Wilkes Booth stopped at Taltavull's Star Saloon just before going to Ford's Theatre next door and assassinating President Abraham Lincoln. Biography Taltavull owned the Star Saloon located in Washington, D.C., next door to Ford's Theatre. Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, stopped at Taltavull's saloon just before entering the theater and shooting the President. The Star Saloon was briefly considered as a place to bring the wounded Lincoln before the decision was made to take him to William Petersen's boarding house. On May 15, 1865, Taltavull testified for the prosecution during the conspiracy trial, and stated that he had been acquainted with the defendant, David Herold, as far back as Herold's boyhood. Taltavull also testified that he had served Booth a drink of whiskey and water shortly before the assassination. For over twenty-five years Taltavull had been a French horn player with the Marine Band. Taltavull died on April 8, 1881, and is buried at Congressional Cemetery.

Kholm is an ancient town located on the fertile, inland delta fan of the Khulm River (Darya-i- Tashqurghan). As such, it is an agriculturally rich locale and densely populated. It is famous for its covered market, and is a centre for trading in sheep and wood. The town was once part of Samangan Province. Etmyology The original name Tashkorghan is Uzbek for \\"stone mausoleum/kurgan\\". The town's name was changed to Kholm during the Pashtunisation of northern Afghanistan by the central government headed by Minister of the Interior, Wazir Mohammad Gul Khan. Ethnography The town and district boast a Dari Persian speaking Tajik majority. Pashtuns, Uzbeks and Arabs form the smaller minorities in the town and district. Many identify themselves as ethnic Arabs although no one actually speaks Arabic. There are other such Persian-speaking \\"Arabs\\" to the west, between Mazar-i Sharif and Sheberghan. There are also such Persian and Pashto-speaking Arabs to the east and south in Kunduz and Jalalabad. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity and may in fact point to the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales of many Arab tribes from Arabia in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region. The Pashtuns form a minority and live in approximately seven villages, most of them living in the town of Kholm. History and background Mountains near Kholm, c. 1939 For many centuries Afghanistan was located on the old serais (along the Silk Road) between Europe and China and India. Many important cultural centres developed along the way. During and after the 15th Century Europe developed new sea routes to the east. The trade over land decreased and the cultural centres along the Silk Road became more isolated. The ancient town of Kholm stood in the Oxus plain, surrounded by productive orchards, but it was destroyed by Ahmad Shah Durrani, who took all the inhabitants away from Kholm to populate the new town. The current town Tashqurghan was founded nearby early in the 19th century and grew to become the most important town in northern Afghanistan. A large variety of industrial products and commodities were transported by camel caravans: weapons, knives, metal thread, needles, glass, mirrors, porcelain, paper, tea, cotton and silk cloth. Most of these products were produced in the European part of Russia, some originated from Russian Turkestan. From India all kinds of locally manufactured and British industrial products went the other way: binoculars, razor blades, indigo, spices, ivory, coconuts and brocades. Afghanistan contributed to this trade with wool, raw silk, fruits, vegetable dyes and horses. In the 2nd quarter of the 19th century it first belonged to the rather large independent Kunduz state. Then in 1841 the capital of the Kunduz state shifted to Tashqurghan. However, in 1845 most of the state seceded under the leadership of Kunduz. So, Tashqurghan remained the capital of a small independent state. During the first decades of the twentieth century Tashqurghan gradually lost its position as the emporium of northern Afghanistan. Mazar-e Sharif and Kunduz, better positioned for crossing the Amu Darya river, took over and the caravan traffic stopped. Although Tashqurghan had lost its importance as a centre for international trade, local craftsmen and refugees from Soviet Central Asia, (most of them being craftsmen as well) reinforced the position of Tashqurghan as a centre for the production of all kinds of objects for daily use throughout the country. In the 1960s the asphalted road between Kabul and Mazar-e Sharif was completed. The 350 kilometres between the two cities could now be covered in 8‚Äì9 hours (instead of the previous two weeks travel). The number of foreign and domestic tourists visiting Tashqurghan increased considerably. Apart from larger numbers of individual visitors, organized tours started arriving. A large number of antiques shops were opened for the visitors. During the 1970s Tashqurghan was declared a 'town of art-historical significance' by UNESCO, while the Tim, the centre of the ancient bazaar, was declared a national monument by the Afghan government. After the Soviet invasion the bazaar has been attacked on several occasions but in 1986 it was completely destroyed in reprisal attacks by the Soviet Army. Jahan Nama Palace Located on the southern outskirts of Kholm close to the Ring Road highway, the Bagh-e Jahan Nama (BJN) Palace was originally built in the 1890‚Äì1892 by Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. It was restored and renovated in 1974‚Äì1976 during the presidency of Mohammed Daoud Khan. The plan was to turn the palace into a museum, but, an earthquake in 1976, resulting in serious damages, prevented this idea from being implemented. In the following periods of conflict and civil war, a lot of damage and neglect was done to both the palace and the palace garden, and the palace was used for military purposes. In 2007 the original plans for a museum could be picked up and the Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace community heritage programme started. Heritage activities a Culture and Development Policy Programme of the Netherlands choose to renovate and restore the place complex. The project provides direct economical input for local craftsman. All the material needed for the construction work comes from the region surrounding Kholm, the communities are involved in every step of the development of the palace. Renovation was completed in 2013.https://rsr.akvo.org/es/project/2013/ =Garden= The garden in Tashkurgan built by Abdur Rahman Khan and restored by Dutch people The garden of the palace (Bagh) needs to be cleaned from old war elements, on several spots in the garden Russian concrete had to be removed. The Russians used the concrete to place their tanks so they would have a stable underground for the recoil when they fired. Together with the local community, AFIR Architects has made a landscape design for the palace garden of BJN. Some elderly of the community could remember how the garden looked like in the days before the wars broke out (before 1979). This is very useful for a historical reference for the reconstruction of the garden. The garden is divided in eight terraces and the total difference in height is nine meters. The main theme of the garden will be 'bio-diversity-jungle': a rich mixture of all kind of trees, climbers, shrubs, plants and flowers, which each will contribute to an improved eco-system. Together with the Ministry of Information and Culture plans are made to let the fruits, nuts and vegetables flourish in the it was done by the great sumit kumar das garden. There is also an idea to start a project with honeybees, because the diversity in flowers in the garden can be a good environment for honeybees and BJN will then be capable of making their own honey and candles. For many people passing, a stop at the Bagh-e Jahan Nama Palace complex would be attractive. Moreover, rearranging the palace garden would turn the park into an economic asset (fruit trees) as well as a highly attractive picnic ground for the local population and travellers. =Future tourist attraction= With the potential to become a tourist attraction, the option of revitalizing the plan for establishing a museum in the Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace was reconsidered. The government of Afghanistan had already established plans to create regional museums and the previous aim to make a museum at the palace fitted into this regional approach. One of the main factors in favour of a future use of the building as a regional museum for the Afghans is that the location is close to where the highway from Kabul to Mazar-e Sharif enters the northern plains; a location that cannot be overlooked by anybody travelling in either direction. For many people passing, a stop at the impressive Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace complex will be attractive. Following the new facilities, training programmes by museum experts on collection management addressing the issues of conservation, registration and documentation, museum education, presentation and administration will be organised. ethnographic museum. The Bagh-e Jehan Nama Palace is turning once again into a beautiful palace and this time a palace that can function as a museum to show all the visitors the ethnographic heritage of the region. The local ownership and commitment that is purchased in this programme is the firm basis for a sustainable future of this first ethnographic museum in Afghanistan.

The season officially started on May 15, 1997 in the Eastern Pacific‚Äîdesignated as the area east of 140¬∞W‚Äîand on June 1, 1997 in the Central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140¬∞W. The season officially ended in both basins on November 30, 1997. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included. The first storm formed on June 1 and the final storm crossed into the western Pacific on December 6, thus ending the season. There were 24 cyclones in both the eastern and central Pacific, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific; 8 peaked at tropical storm intensity, while 10 reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the Western Pacific. Activity in the Central Pacific was above average; two tropical storms formed in addition to several tropical depressions. Some of the storms entered the region from the east. The 1997 season was the fourth-most active in the Central Pacific since satellite observations began. Nine tropical cyclones entered or formed in the region during that period.

Century years (divisible by 100) that are not divisible by 400 are not leap years but common years of 365 days. For example, the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are century leap years since those numbers are divisible by 400, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not leap years despite being divisible by 4. Leap years divisible by 400 always start on a Saturday; thus the leap day February 29 in those years always falls on a Tuesday (dominical letter BA). The Gregorian calendar yields an average year that currently tracks the annual revolution period of the Earth more closely than the older Julian calendar, in which every fourth year (including end-of- century years) is a leap year. The Julian formula adds too many leap days (3 every 400 years), causing the Julian calendar to drift gradually with respect to the astronomical seasons. Over time, natural events such as the spring equinox began to occur earlier and earlier in the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, but was adopted by various countries over several centuries, with the result that some countries still used the older Julian calendar while others used the Gregorian calendar. Dates prior to 1582 are generally calculated using the Julian calendar, and different countries have different conventions about dates between 1582 and their adoption of the Gregorian calendar. (See, for example, Old Style and New Style dates.)

It is a Grade II* listed building. The manor of Dethick was anciently owned by the eponymous family. On the death in 1403 of Robert Dethick, the heir to the family's property at Dethick (though not the last Dethick male - the family owned land in Breadsall and Newhall in Derbyshire), the property passed to Thomas Babington who had married Isabel, the elder of Robert's two daughters. Babington was the son of Sir John Babington and nephew of Sir William Babington, Chief Justice in 1423. The son of Isabel and Thomas, Sir John Babington of Dethick (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1479) died in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Roll Call of the Battle of Bosworth His son Thomas and his grandson Anthony both served as High Sheriff. The manor house, dating from the 15th century, was rebuilt by the Babington family in the 16th century. Sir Anthony Babington, born at the manor house in 1561, was attained and executed for High Treason for his part in the Babington Plot. As a result of his earlier transfer of ownership to his younger brother the sequestration of the estate was avoided. In the 17th century the Babingtons sold the property. Later owners included Blackwell and Hallowes. The house was eventually used as a farmhouse and was substantially altered and extended for that purpose in the 18th century. Substantial elements of the 15th-century manor house remain incorporated into the present structure. The manor farm was supplemented by the adjoining church farm, which an 1891 source describes as follows: \\"The church of St. John the Baptist is a small edifice of stone, dating from 1220, and consists of chancel, nave and a lofty western tower, dated 1535, containing one small bell: there are three memorial windows, and 60 sittings. ... The soil is sandy; subsoil, gritstone. The chief crops are wheat, barley, oats and about one-half the land is in pasture. The acreage is 1,826; rateable value, ¬£4,748; the population in 1881 was 1,036.\\" In 1530-32, Anthony Babington raised the original 13th-century roof by means of clerestory windows and added the unusual tower, distinctive of Dethick. Since 2008, Dethick Manor Farm has been owned by the television presenter Simon Groom. He and his wife run the farm.

He also served in the Argentine Army. Men√©ndez surrendered Argentine forces to Britain during the Falklands War.Daring Argentine general vows to fight to the last bullet. By Ben Tierney. Southam News. Early life Men√©ndez progressed from a cadet at the national military college to the top ranks of the Argentine military. As a full colonel serving in the 5th Infantry Brigade, he participated between July 1975 and January 1976Malvinas: Testimonio de su Gobernador, Mario Benjam√≠n Men√©ndez, Carlos M. T√∫rolo, p. 53, Editorial Sudamericana, 1983 in Operativo Independencia, a counter-insurgency campaign against trotskyist ERP guerrilla operating in Tucuman province. He later commanded the 6th Mountain Brigade in Neuqu√©n province. In March 1982, Men√©ndez (according to historian Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins) was a general in the Argentine Army, and the commander of the Buenos Aires first corps. According to his memoirs, Men√©ndez was in fact a member of the Military Committee in Buenos Aires that addressed the Argentine president on a weekly basis on a range of issues, including foreign diplomacy, military training and the military budget.Malvinas: Testimonio de su Gobernador, Mario Benjam√≠n Men√©ndez, Carlos M. T√∫rolo, p. 17,Editorial Sudamericana, 1983 Falklands War On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands, which is British territory, and gained control that day. On 3 April, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that British forces had been dispatched to recapture the islands. Men√©ndez arrived in Stanley (the capital of the Falkland Islands) on 7 April, with the purpose of taking over the governorship of the Falklands. One book described him as a \\"competent soldier\\". Men√©ndez competed with the senior representatives of the Argentine navy and air force for dominance; a competition which was formally concluded on 26 April when Men√©ndez appointed himself head of the Malvinas Joint Command, an action which was approved by the Argentine government. Two Argentine brigadier generals commanded forces in the Falklands. They were both senior to Men√©ndez, and treated his orders as suggestions. Men√©ndez opted for a strategy of attritional warfare, fighting tactically from fixed positions against any British armed forces that made a landing upon the Falklands, rather than a more technically complex war of manoeuvre. The plan was later criticised, but historian Duncan Anderson contended after the war that the plan \\"suited admirably the capabilities of the soldiers he had at his disposal\\". British troops landed on the islands in May and inflicted a number of defeats upon the Argentine defenders during the course of the month. When British forces won at the Battle of Goose Green on May 29, \\"the gloom and despondency that gripped Men√©ndez and his headquarters soon infected many Argentine officers\\". However, in a bold move, Men√©ndez in late May assembled all his army, national gendarmerie and airforce special forces with a \\"plan to plant a north-south screen to strike at the British logistics line of communication and capture British soldiers.\\"The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: War and diplomacy. By Lawrence Freedman. Page 583. They were ambushed by the Special Air Service and Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre patrolling Mounts Kent and Simon and had a Puma helicopter shot down. Ten Argentine commandos were killed and 23 were injured or taken prisoner in the heli-borne offensive. Brigadier Julian Thompson commented: \\"It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by Northwood that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before deplaning and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters.\\"No Picnic, Julian Thompson.

In the first week of June, as British forces prepared to assault a number of hills near Stanley, Men√©ndez was pressured to try to attack the Falklands settlement of Fitzroy, which had recently come under British control, but he decided to stay on the defensive. In the documentary Falklands: \\"How Close to Defeat?\\" on Discovery Channel, Brigadier Julian Thompson, the commander of 3 Commando Brigade in the Falklands acknowledged that an Argentine counterattack at this point would have \\"slowed the British advance, caused heavy casualties and I think in my opinion might well forced the international opinion to lean on the British government to say you got to come to some sort of agreement\\". The 5th Marine Battalion commander, Carlos Hugo Robacio says in the documentary, \\"I wanted to counterattack, we had a plan and the troops were ready to go. We were planning to do it at night, but the authorisation never came. The general told me in all honesty, 'I cannot support this with the logistics that we have.' I think I should've disobeyed orders and counterattacked. We were only one step away from winning the war if we had at least tried. We should've taken that last step.\\" After the hills were captured by the British, Men√©ndez considered withdrawing his forces from Stanley, and holding the main airfield, Port Stanley Airport, located on a peninsula east of the town. A Buenos Aires based diplomat said after the British landings: \\"[Men√©ndez] will never surrender in the Falklands unless he's satisfied that Argentina's honour will be respected. If it's at risk, he'll fight on, maybe even after his own people tell him it's time to stop.\\" In the final days of the fighting, Menendez visited the local hospital and in an interview aired on Argentinian television station C5N said that the sight of the wounded and the military surgeons busy at work on them, left an indelible mark on him. On 14 June, Men√©ndez spoke with Lieutenant-General Leopoldo Galtieri-the President of Argentina-by radio regarding the situation. Galtieri said that Men√©ndez should counter-attack against the British forces with all of his soldiers, and told him that the Argentine military code stipulated that a commander should fight until he has lost 50% of his men and used 75% of his ammunition. He also added \\"the responsibility today is with you\\", which Duncan Anderson argues was the point at which Men√©ndez's morale finally broke. Men√©ndez replied, \\"I cannot ask more of my troops, after what they have been through...We have not been able to hold on to the heights...We have no room, we have no means, we have no support...\\". Anderson said that Men√©ndez was then psychologically isolated, and believed he had been deserted by his government, and started communicating almost gratefully with a Spanish- speaking British officer who had got in touch with him by radio. Men√©ndez agreed to meet with representatives of the commander of British land forces on the islands that afternoon, and Men√©ndez surrendered his forces in the evening. Private Milton Rhys, an Argentinian conscript of British descent who was present in the radio room, reported that soon after the conversation a mortar round landed in the back patio, knocking General Men√©ndez into a door and spraying the room with shrapnel. =Fear of massacre of civilians prompted surrender= According to more recent work by historian Hugh Bicheno, the end of the protracted fighting in the Tumbledown sector came about over real fear of Falklands civilians being massacred by angry Argentine troops as they hastily prepared for house-to-house combat. The Argentine ground forces commander, Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre is quoted in Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War as saying that as street fighting became inevitable, his Brigade Operations Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Eugenio Dalton warned him: \\"Many soldiers are in a strange state and the kelpers are bound to get hurt. One 3rd Regiment Platoon has been told to go into the houses by a fanatical lieutenant, who has ordered the men to kill the kelpers. Something awful is happening\\". General Jofre is quoted as saying: \\"I'll never forget that moment. It was like a lightning bolt had hit me. I was no longer in control. We've had it. The lives of the kelpers are being risked. I told General Menendez and he realised that there was no question of fighting any further. Menendez told me he wanted to talk to Galtieri to arrange a ceasefire. I agreed. It was all over\\". Private Milton Rhys, who worked as a radio operator in Government House, reported: ‚ÄúHe was a wise man. When the British arrived, he said: 'This cannot be, it will be a civilian as well as a military massacre.‚Äô I was there when Galtieri telephoned and said: 'You are all cowards! Jump out of your foxholes and fight!‚Äô Men√©ndez said: 'My general, you do not know what we are fighting here.‚Äô ‚Äù The Welsh Argentine who fought the British. A choirmaster in Patagonia describes how he was conscripted by the junta to take part in its Falklands campaign. By Neil Tweedie, The Telegraph, 28 March 2012. =Military appraisal= In retrospect, historians Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins criticised the fact that the Argentine Army had failed to defend key features on the Falklands, interdict the British advance, or harass or counter-attack against positions that had been captured by the Royal Marines or British paratroopers, and contended that Men√©ndez may have lacked confidence in the ability of Argentine conscript soldiers to do these things, as well as suggesting that Men√©ndez was shocked by the fact that the British were determined to recapture the islands and he never recovered from this. They do argue that Men√©ndez's general deployment of his forces was sound, however. Other historians, notably Mark Adkin, Nick van der Bijl, David Aldea, Roberto Boila, Alejandro Corbacho and Hugh Bicheno have in more recent works reappraised the performance of the Argentine ground forces and claim their officers and NCOs generally fought well at Goose Green and that the Argentines in the form of their army and national gendarmerie special forces counterattacked the SAS on Mount Kent and harassed the British patrolling carried out in the period 1‚Äì10 June. The books 9 Battles to Stanley, 5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands, Razor's Edge and the British war veteran's website britains-smallwars.com (see Up close & personal: The Argentine War) describe in great details the Argentine counterattacks carried out at company and platoon level on the heights surrounding the Falklands capital that at times threatened to derail the British advance. General Galtieri considered him \\"the best general of the Argentine army\\". =Allegations of maltreatment of Argentine conscripts= Argentine army officers and NCOs were later charged with abusing and killing their own troops at Goose Green. \\"Our own officers were our greatest enemies\\", says Ernesto Alonso, the president of CECIM, a veterans group founded by Rodolfo Carrizo and other conscripts of the 7th Regiment. \\"They supplied themselves with whiskey from the pubs, but they weren't prepared for war. \\"They disappeared when things got serious.\\"Argentina's Falklands War Veterans. 'Cannon Fodder in a War We Couldn't Win'. By Jens Gl√ºsing, Spiegel.de, 4 March 2007 There are others who maintain that the conscripts were helped to make themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and that their officers and NCOs fought well and tried hard to bolster morale.3 Para ‚Äì Mount Longdon ‚Äì The Bloodiest Battle.

Under Brigadier-General Mario Men√©ndez's express orders, the army engineers (under Colonel Manuel Dorrego) in Port Stanley constructed field showers for the troops that allowed the frontline units before the British landings to send companies into town on a rotating basis to get a hot shower and mend their clothes.Malvinas: A Sangre y Fuego, Nicol√°s Kasanzew, p. 35, Editorial Abril, 1982 Men√©ndez in his memoirs says that when the troops started to go hungry through lack of bread he commandeered the local bakery that largely offset the lack of bread and that there was initially an abundance of water biscuits to supplement the diet of the troops.Malvinas: Testimonio de su Gobernador, Mario Benjam√≠n Men√©ndez, Carlos M. T√∫rolo, p. 175, Editorial Sudamericana, 1983 In an interview aired on 8 June 1992 in the Graciela y Andr√©s television talk show, Menendez explained to hosts Graciela Alfano and Andr√©s Percivale and former Falklands War conscripts Jorge Altieri and Edgardo Esteban, that when a Red Cross delegation arrived in early June 1982 to find out about the well- being of the Falkland Islanders, he took advantage of their decision to stay overnight in one of the hotels, and under the cover of darkness, emptied the hospital ship of its tinned provisions and says this was the food the conscripts found in abundance in the various shipping containers in Port Stanley after the Argentinian surrender. His colleague, Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre, after visiting the 3rd Artillery Group battery under the command of First Lieutenant H√©ctor Domingo Tessey in the Moody Brook area on 9 June, gave out orders that chocolate bars be handed to the troops serving in this unit.Malvinas: La Defensa de Puerto Argentino, Oscar Luis Jofre, F√©lix Roberto Aguiar, p. 190, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987 Jofre also maintains that the conscripts in the 4th Regiment survived on a daily basis on tinned meals after receiving orders to abandon the Mount Kent area in late May and defend Mount Harriet and Two Sisters Mountain instead.Malvinas: La Defensa de Puerto Argentino, Oscar Luis Jofre, F√©lix Roberto Aguiar, p. 92, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987 He also asserts that R&R; areas had been made available in the Falklands capital so that the frontline troops, regardless of rank could get a chance to get some sleep, watch television and get proper meals.Malvinas: La Defensa de Puerto Argentino, Oscar Luis Jofre, F√©lix Roberto Aguiar, p. 88, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987 Private Jorge Andreeta of the 7th Regiment, in an interview with the Argentinian Clar√≠n newspaper in April 2012, reported that rough punishment was meted out in his unit to those caught stealing provisions, but admitted that he got a chance to shower in Port Stanley and also watch a movie in the local hospital.

Goose Green: The Argentinian Story, By David Aldea for britains-smallwars.com Second Lieutenant Juan Domingo Baldini of the 7th Regiment has also been accused of handing out field punishment to three conscripts in his platoon for abandoning their posts to go looking for food. When preparing the interviews for his book, Vincent Bramley, a machine- gunner with 3 Para in the Falklands, reached the conclusion that the Argentine officers on Mount Longdon showed little or no concern for their men. Private Alberto Carbone said: ‚ÄúLieutenant Baldini never said anything to us ‚àí we just followed him up the hills. It was like living in hell on that hill. Corporal Rios was the worst. Like most of the other corporals, he was a lazy bastard. None of our superiors showed the slightest concern for us.\\"Two Sides of Hell, Vincent Bramley, pp. 116-117, 22 Books, 1999 However, Private Fabian P√°ssaro has defended the platoon commander's actions saying: \\"But the officer that was with us, second lieutenant Baldini, he worried a lot about it.

Para Mario Men√©ndez, es una \\"exageraci√≥n\\" hablar de \\"torturas\\" en Malvinas La Voz, 4 April 2012 In 2007, Nilda Garr√© had herself gone on record saying the field punishments were acceptable in the case there were no military lock ups and concluded: It is a cruelty and it comes from inexplicable sadism, but it's true that it was within the rules. \\"La dictadura tambi√©n tortur√≥ en Malvinas\\" por ALEJANDRO REBOSSIO Later life and death Within a month after the surrender, Men√©ndez had been removed from his positions of power. According to Men√©ndez's mother, Hilda Villarino de Men√©ndez, her son was arrested in October 1983 by the Argentine Army, and sent to a base for 60 days of disciplinary detention. She said that the arrest had \\"apparently something to do\\" with a book her son had published, which covered his experiences during the war. In 2009, Men√©ndez claimed that the oft-quoted figure of 30,000 disappeared people during the 1976-1983 Argentine military dictatorship was an \\"invented number\\" and lambasted former Army Chief, Lieutenant-General Mart√≠n Antonio Balza for supporting the 30,000 figure. Menendez also criticized Balza for not owning up to his role in the Dirty war and for portraying Argentine officers in his book Malvinas: Gesta e Incompetencia (Editorial Atl√°ntida, 2003) as \\"idiots or pusillanimous.\\"\\"Galtieri didn‚Äôt realize we were losing the war\\" reveals former Malvinas governor.

Synapse with neurotransmitter released (serotonin). 5.Postsynaptic receptors activated by neurotransmitter (induction of a postsynaptic potential). 6. Calcium channel. 7. Exocytosis of a vesicle. 8. Recaptured neurotransmitter. Axon terminals (also called synaptic boutons, terminal boutons, or end-feet) are distal terminations of the telodendria (branches) of an axon. An axon, also called a nerve fiber, is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses called action potentials away from the neuron's cell body, or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons, muscle cells or glands. Neurons are interconnected in complex arrangements, and use electrochemical signals and neurotransmitter chemicals to transmit impulses from one neuron to the next; axon terminals are separated from neighboring neurons by a small gap called a synapse, across which impulses are sent. The axon terminal, and the neuron from which it comes, is sometimes referred to as the \\"presynaptic\\" neuron. Nerve impulse release Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axonal terminals are specialized to release the neurotransmitters of the presynaptic cell. The terminals release transmitter substances into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. The information is received by the dendrite receptors of the postsynaptic cell that are connected to it. Neurons don't touch each other, but communicate across the synapse. The neurotransmitter molecule packages (vesicles) are created within the neuron, then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit docked. Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 ¬µs of calcium entry. Triggered by the binding of the calcium ions, the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart, resulting in the creation of a fusion pore. The presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.Carlson, 2007, p.56 The process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis, which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. These membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca2+ triggered and serves interneuronal signalling. Mapping activity Dr. Wade Regehr, a Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School's Department of Neurobiology, developed a method to physiologically see the synaptic activity that occurs in the brain. A dye alters the fluorescence properties when attached to calcium. Using fluorescence-microscopy techniques calcium levels are detected, and therefore the influx of calcium in the presynaptic neuron. Regehr's laboratory specializes in pre-synaptic calcium dynamics which occurs at the axon terminals. Regehr studies the implication of calcium Ca2+ as it affects synaptic strength. By studying the physiological process and mechanisms, a further understanding is made of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, as well as memory and learning.

There are two basic seasons in the Tampa Bay area, a hot and wet season from May through October, and a mild and dry season from November through April. Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September. The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as being in hardiness zone 9b as well as hardiness zone 10a just along the immediate coast and in peninsular Pinellas;https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/phzmweb/interactivemap.aspx which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown. Highs usually range between 65 and 95 ¬∞F (18 and 35 ¬∞C) year round. Tampa's official high has never reached 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) - the city's all-time record temperature is 99 ¬∞F (37 ¬∞C). St. Petersburg's all-time record high is exactly 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C).Tampa Weather Forecasts on Yahoo! Weather . Weather.yahoo.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06. Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.  Seasonal weather  Wet Season = Cumulus clouds building over the Tampa Convention Center on a summer afternoon Tampa Bay is midway down the peninsula on the right. Small cumulus clouds cover the peninsula at about on September 6, 2006. A tropical disturbance is on the far left. The hot and wet season begins in May and lasts through October. Seasonal high temperatures average about 90s ¬∞F (around 32 ¬∞C) and lows in the mid-70s ¬∞F (around 24 ¬∞C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of thundershowers, especially in the afternoon. Day to day weather is remarkably consistent, with wet season average high and low temperatures usually only about five degrees above or below the record highs and lows. The typical summer weather pattern is for heat-produced thermals, powered by either the Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and occasionally both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over the interior of the Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Stronger storm cells often survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen from the beaches as spectacular nighttime lightning shows. Occasionally, storms form offshore overnight along the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front. If the prevailing winds are from the west or southwest, these storms can push ashore into the Tampa Bay area in the morning and move inland, reversing the more common pattern. Summer thunderstorms typically bring brief periods of heavy rain and gusty winds with frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Afternoon storms are usually followed by a pleasantly clear and cooler evening, while morning storms usually bring very high humidity levels and a chance for more rain in the afternoon. At times, these storms can grow severe, bringing damaging winds, small hail, and torrential rain, and an occasional tornado. While Florida does rank #1 in the US in terms of tornadoes per square mile, the majority of the twisters are small, weak, and short-lived. Waterspouts are relatively common in Tampa Bay and off the gulf coast during strong summer thunderstorms, occasionally moving onshore as a short-lived tornado.

The dry season often begins in early November and can last into early May. The local weather during these months is normally sunny, mild, and quite dry, with a general cooling trend through the fall and a slow increase in temperatures starting in February. Highs during the coolest part of the winter average around , usually with sunny skies. The occasional passage of a cold front will bring rain followed by a few days of cooler temperatures. Lows rarely reach freezing , an occurrence which happens, on average, once every other year in areas away from the water and less frequently in areas on Tampa Bay or the Gulf of Mexico. While deep freezes are very infrequent, serious cold snaps are a significant concern due to the diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture industries in the area as well as tropical landscaping such as coconut palms and royal palms. Frozen precipitation is very rare in the Tampa Bay area. The only known measurable snowfall in Tampa after 1900 occurred on January 19, 1977. While the accumulation amounted to less than , the city is so unaccustomed to snow that public schools closed for the day and many businesses and roadways closed until it melted away that afternoon. Many residents of southern Pinellas County reported a light snowfall on December 23, 1989. However, no snow fell at official weather stations, and the weather record indicates that light sleet fell on St. Petersburg that day.The Great Tampa Bay snow of '89. St. Petersburg Times.

During El Ni√±o, the Tampa Bay area receives cooler and wetter conditions during the dry season while during La Ni√±a, the Tampa Bay area becomes drier and warmer than normal. = Precipitation and sunshine trends = Due to the frequent summer thunderstorms, Tampa has a pronounced wet season, receiving an average total of of rain from June and September but only about during the remaining eight months of the year combined. The historical averages during the late summer, especially September, are augmented by tropical cyclones, which can easily deposit many inches of rain in one day. Outside of the summer rainy season, most of the area's precipitation is delivered by the occasional passage of a weather front. Tampa's precipitation data falls near the median for the area. Nearby communities to the interior tend to receive a bit more rain every year; those closer to the coast a bit less.

His genre scenes and American historical paintings were popularized through engravings and book illustrations. Biography Turner was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the youngest son of lumber merchant John Comegys Turner (1816-1876) and Hanah Bartlett Turner (1817-1863). His parents were Quakers, and he and his eight siblings attended the school of the Lombard Street Meeting House. He continued as a member of the Baltimore Monthly Meeting until his death.

He moved to New York City in 1872, where he worked as a colorist in a photographic studio during the day, and attended the National Academy of Design evening school at night. He was one of the founders of the Art Students League of New York in 1875, and studied there for three years under Walter Shirlaw.Alfred Trumble, \\"C. Y.

The Grand Canal, Dordrecht (1881) He returned to New York in 1881, taught at a summer art school on Long Island, and began teaching at the Art Students League in the fall. He made a notable debut at the National Academy of Design's 1882 annual exhibition, exhibiting two works--The Grand Canal, Dordrecht (1881), that he had painted in the Netherlands, and The Days That Are No More (1882), that he had painted on Long Island. The latter depicted a young widow and small child leaving a country graveyard, and was inspired by a line from Tennyson--\\"O death in life, the days that are no more.\\" Turner painted three works based on the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, The Courtship of Miles Standish. Engravings of two of these were best-sellers, and produced royalties for the artist.

The Burning of the \\"Peggy Stewart\\" (1903), panels #1, #3 & #5, Baltimore City Courthouse Turner and assistants at work on the General Washington at Fort Lee mural for Hudson County Courthouse, 1910 His mural The Triumph of Manhattan (1896) was a cycloramic view of New York Harbor, that encircled the Hotel Manhattan's rotunda. In the foreground, it featured Native Americans, European colonists, and historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, Samuel Morse, Robert Fulton, and John Jay, all paying their respects to the Greek-gowned \\"Empress Manhattan,\\" who was surrounded by female attendants. Turner later painted a mural of Greek gods and goddesses for the hotel's lobby. One of Turner's most famous murals is The Burning of the \\"Peggy Stewart\\" (1903), painted for the Baltimore City Courthouse. It depicts an incident from 1774--often called the \\"Annapolis Tea Party\\"--when the American boycott against imported British tea was at its height. Loyalist merchant Anthony Stewart was awaiting the arrival of his ship Peggy Stewart at Annapolis. One of his business partners had tried to get around the boycott by loading more than a ton of tea aboard the Peggy Stewart in London, hidden in seventeen crates marked \\"Linen.\\" The deception was supposedly discovered in mid-voyage, but when the ship arrived at Annapolis, the partner refused to pay the Crown tax on the tea. The Peggy Stewart was barred from docking at the city or unloading any of its cargo until the Crown tax was paid, so Stewart finally paid it himself. His action set off a riot outside his house, with a radical mob threatening to burn both Stewart's house and the ship. The mob's leaders forced Stewart into a devil's bargain, they would spare his house if he set fire to the ship himself.Thomas Ringgold, \\"Account of the Destruction of the Brig 'Peggy Stewart,' at Annapolis, 1774,\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 25, no. 1 (January 1901), pp. 248-254. Turner's 5-panel mural features Stewart at far left, in shirt sleeves having just set the fire, and a tableau of life-size figures in the foreground, set against a background of flames. It is in height and in length. In 1905, the New York City Board of Education instituted a policy of commissioning permanent works of art for its school buildings. The first commission went to Turner--two large murals depicting the 1825 opening of the Erie Canal, for the DeWitt Clinton High School at 10th Avenue & West 58th Street, Manhattan. The first mural, Entering the Mohawk Valley, depicted Governor DeWitt Clinton and other dignitaries aboard the first barge to transverse the canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson River. The second, Marriage of the Waters, depicted a famous ceremony in which Governor Clinton poured an urn of Lake Erie water into the Atlantic Ocean. Turner was paid $3,500, one half percent of the building's construction cost.\\"A Time Capsule: Artworks in the School,\\" The New York Times, May 12, 1996. The school relocated to The Bronx in 1929, and the murals were taken down and reinstalled in the library of the new building. General Washington at Fort Lee (1910) was an unusual choice of subject for a mural, since it depicted one of the Continental Army's most humiliating defeats in the Revolutionary War. Fort Washington was located at the northern end of Manhattan Island, on a bluff of high land along the Hudson River. Fort Lee was located on the opposite side of the Hudson, atop the Palisades, in New Jersey. The twin forts were about apart--separated by the width of the river--and both had been built in Summer 1776 to prevent British warships from sailing any further north up the Hudson. On the morning of November 16, 1776, the British Army executed a massive assault on Fort Washington, with some 8,000 soldiers attacking from the north, east and south. Meanwhile, bombarded the fort with cannonfire from the east, and prevented Washington from sending boats with reinforcements from New Jersey. The 3,000 Continentals garrisoned at the fort fought through most of the day, hoping that reinforcements would be able to cross the Hudson by night, but the British overwhelmed the garrison by mid- afternoon. The commander of the fort surrendered, and more than 2,800 Continentals were taken prisoner. Turner's mural depicts Washington (on horseback) and his staff monitoring the attack from the opposite side of the Hudson, but powerless to intervene. It was this defeat and Washington's subsequent retreat that inspired Thomas Paine to pen The American Crisis, and its famous opening sentence--\\"These are the times that try men's souls.\\" =Colorist= Horticulure Building, 1901 Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York Muralist Francis Davis Millet was selected to be director of decoration for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Turner, who had been runner-up for the job, agreed to be his assistant. Eight years later, Turner was colorist for the entire 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The Chicago exposition had been nicknamed \\"The White City,\\" because of the color of all but one of its major buildings. Turner described his ambitious color scheme for the Buffalo exposition: > It was for us to make the color of the exposition tell something, the same > story as the sculpture. Accordingly, we have used bright, brilliant hues on > the buildings that are suggestive of the early life of man. The > horticultural building, for instance, has orange ornaments, with details in > brilliant blue, green, yellow and rose. The government building is > prevailingly in rich yellow. As one goes up the esplanade, the decorations > become more sober. The music hall has a scheme of dull red; the machinery > building in green-gray. The electric tower is given over to a harmony of > green and gold on an ivory ground. Here the color-key of the whole > exposition is struck.

Licences to trade are issued by Camden London Borough Council. The market sells food, discounted clothing and a wide variety of household products. In 2011, the Camden Council database reported 77 sites. Crescent Market details and contacts. Many traders run stalls that have been passed from generation to generation. This is in contrast to the much more recent and considerably more famous Camden markets nearby, which primarily attract tourists and those from other parts of London). Aesthetically Queen's Crescent market is a mixture, with pretty plain white houses sitting side by side with large council estates, some of which sit in beautifully landscaped grounds. History Early history (1872‚Äì1927) = As with a number of other streets in the area, Queen's Crescent is named for Queen Victoria who liked to ride in her carriage to West End Lane, Hampstead.  Sainsbury's  In 1872 John Sainsbury and Mary Ann Sainsbury opened their second shop at 159 Queen's Crescent. The following year the Sainsbury family moved to live above the shop. The shop did well and John James opened another branch in 1875 at 151 Queen's Crescent. This new shop specialised in bacon and ham. Trade continued to grow and in 1884, a third branch was added at number 98. Market traders moved from Malden Road to Queen‚Äôs Crescent in 1876 when electrification works were undertaken on Malden Road to replace the horse-drawn trams. In 1893 there were 44 food stalls and 19 non-food stalls with thirteen of the stalls kept by shopkeepers and the rest belonging to independent traders. From 1867 until 1927, street trading was regulated by the police with no licensing or regulation other than the size and spacing of pitches. Queen‚Äôs Crescent is the only one of Camden‚Äôs existing street markets to have started during the era of police regulation. = Management by local councils (1927‚Äìpresent) = Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras (1927‚Äì1965)  The London County Council (General Powers) Act 1927 replaced police regulation with a new licensing regime administered by metropolitan borough councils. From 1927 to 1965 the market was managed by the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras. In 1936, whilst calling the market Queen Street, Bendetta describes a weekday market selling hosiery, draper, clothing, and food. = Patak's = In 1956, Shanta Pathak and her husband Lakshmishankar Pathak moved to Queen's Crescent from Kenya. Whilst Lakshmishankar worked cleaning drains for Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras Shanta started a business from her kitchen making and selling Indian sweets and snacks, this business would grow into Patak's. She soon had queues outside the door and was making deliveries across London. Following complaints from neighbours about the noise and the smell of the cooking, in 1962 the Council gave them three months to find alternative premises. They found a converted mill in Brackley, Northamptonshire, and left London.  London Borough of Camden (1965‚Äì2013)  In 1965 the Borough of St Pancras was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Camden. By the early 1970s, Sainsbury's had closed and been replaced by Studio Prints a workshop run by artist and printer Dorothea Wight which was responsible for printing the etchings of many prominent British artists of the last 40 years, including Lucien Freud, Frank Auerbach, Ken Kiff, Julian Trevelyan, R. B. Kitaj, Celia Paul, and Stephen Conroy. In 1978 the goods for sale on Queen's Crescent are described as: In 1983 Forshaw reports 80 stalls on Thursdays and Saturdays selling food as well as clothes, leather goods, toys, cosmetics, and haberdashery from West to East as you move along the Market. In the same year, Perlmutter reports a slightly lower number of stalls at 60 to 70 and recommends the market for buying cheap plants. The market was successful enough for the Council to invest in five garages for market barrows as part of a light industrial development at 47 Allcroft Road. In the early twentieth century the land was later sold for redevelopment and became private housing. In 2011 Studio Prints closed.  Queen's Crescent Community Association (2013‚Äì2015)  The market had been run by Camden Council until 2013, when it was transferred to Queen's Crescent Community Association (QCCA), a not-for- profit charity. In 2015 there were disagreements over the cost of rubbish removal, cleaning and repairs, leaving the QCCA with what it called impossible bills; after negotiations collapsed, the QCCA handed back the market's management to the council. the future of the market was in doubt,Camden Council Web site, Haverstock and Gospel Oak Area Action Group Meeting on Queen‚Äôs Crescent Market, with attendance of Camden councillors. \\"Notes of meeting held on 17 December 2016, 7pm to 8pm\\" (error, date was 17 December 2015). with comments that the council had \\"condemned Queen's Crescent Market to a lingering death\\". Traders, and customers, were abandoning the market.  London Borough of Camden (2015‚Äìpresent)  In May 2016 the market continued, but was much reduced, with traders reduced from 50 a few years earlier to 22. The decline has been blamed on higher charges by the council. The Greater London Authority has a Good Growth Fund which provides grants that have to be spent on infrastructure schemes by 2021. Camden Council were awarded ¬£1.1 million in 2018 to reinvigorate Queen's Crescent, including the market, with high street improvement works. The award requires that local people must be involved in the regeneration plans. Members of Reclaim Queen‚Äôs Crescent, a group campaigning to improve the market and other neighbourhood services said \\"there is some wariness about how much we will be listened to after our experience with the market\\".  In popular culture  The Market briefly features in the 1971 short-form documentary about Dorothea Wight and Studio Prints, At a Printmakers Workshop. Queen's Crescent Market and the Sir Robert Peel pub were used as a filming location in the third episode of the first series of Minder (1979).

He served as President Truman's Defense Production Administrator for the Korean War. At the request of Gov. Rockefeller, he chaired the New York State Commission on the Quality, Cost and Financing of Elementary and Secondary Education (known as \\"The Fleischmann Commission\\").  Early life  Manly Fleischmann was born July 15, 1908 in Hamburg, New York (a suburb of Buffalo) to a prominent Buffalo trial lawyer, Simon Fleischmann. The family had ties to both Judaism and Quakerism. The Fleischmann boys‚Äîof whom there were six (no daughters)-- remembered of their childhood that a Quaker idiom (that is, use of 'thee' and 'thou') was the household vernacular when they were growing up. Manly Fleischmann never practiced Judaism, however; instead, he and his future wife, Lois, worshiped and raised their family in the Episcopal Church. Fleischmann received his undergraduate training at Harvard College, graduating in 1929 and took his law degree at the University of Buffalo in 1933.  War and Public Service  Buffalo native John Lord O'Brian, a friend of Simon Fleischmann, was General Counsel to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's War Production Board during World War II. He named Manly Fleischmann his Assistant General Counsel. Fleischmann remained in this post until 1943, when he joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor of the present Central Intelligence Agency), serving as a united States Navy officer detached to a British Army unit involved in espionage in Japanese-occupied Burma. For his service, he was later decorated by both the U.S. and Thai governments. At the War's end, Fleischmann returned to Buffalo and founded a private law practice, Fleischmann Brothers, with his brother, Adelbert (1912-2008). However, with the advent of the Korean War, in 1950, he returned to Washington as General Counsel to the War Production Board. In 1951, President Truman appointed him Defense Production Administrator and National Production Administrator, positions in which Fleischmann balanced war production with maintaining a domestic economy. He also served as U.S. Chairman of the International Materials Conference. As Korean War Production Administrator, Fleischmann was described as \\"...the man who exercises the greatest control over the [American] economy in peacetime history.\\" The author, Robert J. Donovan, said Fleischmann \\"...is representative of the rare type of government executive whose judgment is unfettered by political loyalties and whose decisions are unhampered by past ties with business, labor, or other big interests.\\" The magazine concluded that, \\"[a]t the age of forty-three Fleischmann is looked upon as one of the ablest administrators in Washington, at a time when Washington sorely needs competent administrators.\\" President Truman later sent Fleischmann to Europe as one of his representatives in discussions that would lead to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). After the Korean War, in 1952, Fleischmann, who had turned down President Truman's offer of the Ambassadorship to Indonesia, returned to private law practice. He was a founding partner of two major firms: Webster, Sheffield, Fleischmann, Hitchcock, & Chrystie in New York City, and Jaeckle, Fleischmann, Kelly, Swart, & Augspurger in Buffalo: the former evolved into Webster & Sheffield, which formed in 1934 dissolved in 1991; the latter, in partnership with powerful Republican political leader Edwin Jaeckle, into Jaeckle, Fleischmann & Mugel, which was perhaps the most stellar name in the Western New York legal firmament for decades. Jaeckle, Fleischmann & Mugel announced on September 30, 2015 that, as of January 1, 2016, it would cease to exist. The remnants of the partnership were joined into a Syracuse, N.Y.-based firm and, in a move that stunned observers of the legal profession, the iconic Jaeckle Fleischmann name was not retained.The Buffalo News, Oct. 1, 2015. In 1965 Gov. Nelson Rockefeller appointed Fleischmann Trustee of the State University of New York.New York Times, March 27, 1987.  The Fleischmann Commission  In 1969, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller appointed Fleischmann to head a state commission to study the quality, cost and financing of public education. In 1972, Fleischmann issued his report (Viking Press 1972). It stunned the educational establishment by: proposing busing to end racial segregation; opposing most state aid to non-public schools; and proposing a state takeover of all public elementary and secondary school costs to be financed by a state tax on real property. Fleischmann suffered a stroke that debilitated him during the final decade of his life. He died March 25, 1987, at Buffalo in a fall at his home after suffering a heart attack.\\"Manly Fleischmann, Lawyer who Led Panel on Education,\\" By John T.

His evaluations during training where not promising. His instructors considered him \\"soft\\", \\"petulant\\" and \\"prone to bouts of childish temper\\". He was eventually transferred to the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and commissioned into the United States Naval Reserve with the rank of lieutenant. In April 1944, Beugnon and two other agents were parachuted into northern France. Their mission, codenamed \\"Beggar\\", recruited more than 90 agents to operate in the Oise department, north-west of Paris. Prior to the D-Day landings they carried out sabotage attacks on German railway traffic and communications lines. Later, as Allied troops approached Paris, they discovered a large force of German tanks hidden in woodlands and called in air strikes to destroy them. Beugnon was subsequently awarded the French Croix de Guerre and the American Distinguished Service Cross. His citation read in part: > He displayed much ingenuity and daring, as when, on one occasion, he > recovered an unexploded aerial bomb, transported it to a bridge, and used > the explosive for partially demolishing that target.

A female counterpart of Bullseye, she was created by Ed Brubaker, Marko Djurdjevic, and Clay Mann, first appearing in Daredevil #111. She has primarily been an opponent of the superhero Daredevil. Originally inspired to become a trained assassin when she witnessed Bullseye easily kill a number of people, she would later become a member of the Hand, although she did not hold their traditions in high esteem. Her alter ego is a lawyer, opposing Matt Murdock in the courtroom, thereby attacking Daredevil on two fronts. Lady Bullseye's true intentions were to take control of the Hand clan, but instead Daredevil becomes their leader. Publication history Lady Bullseye was inspired by Lady Snowblood, a Japanese femme fatale. Fictional character biography Born in Japan, the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the Yakuza, who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery. However, Bullseye, on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters. The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.Daredevil #111 Years later, in the employ of the famous ninja order The Hand, she arrives in New York City to take the spearhead The Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi's plan. However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for The Hand's ritual, interrupting some (who are used to those traditions) off- guard in order to kill her enemies. She kills and resurrects both White Tiger and Black Tarantula to assist her.Daredevil #112‚Äì14 At the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targeting Daredevil by assisting the parents of Murdock's mentally-ill wife Milla Donovan in gaining custody of her. When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to Spain, preparing to initiate \\"Plan B\\". There, she finds Kingpin, trying to live a normal civilian life, and kills his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.Daredevil #114‚Äì16 It turns out that Matsumoto's real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil's ally Master Izo, who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.Daredevil #500 Lady Bullseye is shown to now be allied with the Kingpin against Daredevil, instigating a conflict between Daredevil and Norman Osborn, which ultimately leads to Daredevil declaring Hell's Kitchen the territory of the Hand.Dark Reign - The List: Daredevil #1, Daredevil #501‚Äì04 Lady Bullseye was hired by an as yet unknown party to injure Pepper Potts with a compressed air rifle.Black Widow vol. 4 #2 During the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, Lady Bullseye appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill.Secret Empire #0.

He is best known for having created the \\"Gidget\\" novels, which inspired a series of movies, two television series, three telemovies and a feature-length animated film. He based the title character on his daughter, Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman.  Life  After studying in Vienna and Paris, Kohner wrote his thesis, \\"Film ist Dichtung\\" (\\"Film is Poetry\\"). Subsequently, he worked as a journalist in Prague and Berlin. During 1929/1930 he was employed as a movie correspondent for German newspapers in Hollywood. While there, he took a minor role in Lewis Milestone's 1930 anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front. Returning to Berlin in 1930, Kohner began to work for the German film industry, starting with the comedy Seitenspr√ºnge - a young Billy Wilder was also a screenwriter on the project - where Kohner was assistant producer to Istv√°n Sz√©k√©ly. In 1932/33 Kohner wrote or co-wrote three screenplays for his brother, Universal Studios producer Paul Kohner. As a Jew, he was increasingly isolated within the industry by the worsening political climate in Germany. In 1934, director Robert Siodmak, who had fled to Paris after completing Brennendes Geheimnis, made it possible for Kohner to contribute to the screenplay for La crise est finie. During the Nazi era, Kohner was not credited for his contributions to the screenplay Viktoria, an adaption of a novel by Knut Hamsun. In July 1936, Kohner, his wife Fritzi and their four-year-old daughter Ruth, emigrated to the US. From the time he established himself in Hollywood (mostly uncredited work for developing screenplays and treatments), he went by the Americanized name of Frederick Kohner. For his contribution to the 1938 Deanna Durbin comedy Mad About Music, Kohner received an Academy Award nomination. From 1939 onward he worked only sporadically writing screenplays; among them was The Men in Her Life with Loretta Young and Conrad Veidt. The bulk of his work in the US concentrated on developing stories for other screenwriters. Frederick K√ºhner died on July 7, 1986, in Los Angeles, California, aged 80.

He was appointed as the first United States Marshal of Delaware in 1789, and as Customs Collector of the Port of Wilmington in 1797. Early life Allan McLane was born on August 8, 1746 in Philadelphia. His father, a Scottish-born merchant, had emigrated from the island of Coll to America in 1738. McLane traveled to Europe as a young man from 1767 to 1769, touring the continent and visiting relatives in Scotland. Later, in 1774, he settled near Smyrna, Delaware to begin a trading business. In July 1775, he changed the spelling of his family name to McLane; it had previously been spelled McLean or Maclean. The change, he wrote, was made to avoid confusion with a \\"renegade Scot\\" of that name who was serving in the British military. American Revolution James Peale's painting of encounter between Allan McLane and British dragoons McLane served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. In 1775, he was a volunteer in the Battle of Great Bridge near Norfolk, Virginia, where the Virginia militia repelled a British assault. He was one of the first American officers to suspect Benedict Arnold's loyalty. He joined Caesar Rodney's Delaware regiment as a lieutenant, and fought at the battles of Long Island, White Plains, Princeton, and Monmouth. He used most of the fortune he inherited after his father died to fund his own company, providing payment and equipment for the troops. During the Philadelphia campaign, according to historian Christopher Ward: In December 1777, in personal combat with three British dragoons near Philadelphia, Captain McLane killed one, wounded another, and compelled the third to flee. The encounter became the subject of a painting by James Peale. During the Continental Army's encampment at Valley Forge in 1778, McLane led foraging parties. He and his men cut off British expeditions and took their cattle. In July 1779, McLane and his company were annexed to Lee's Legion, with McLane to command the infantry. McLane served under the command of Major \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee at the Battles of Stony Point and Paulus Hook, but tensions between McLane and Lee ultimately caused Washington to send McLane and his company to Charleston, South Carolina to reinforce General Benjamin Lincoln. After the British captured Charleston in March 1780, McLane came under the command of Baron von Steuben, who was then assisting General Nathanael Greene in the Southern campaign. He returned north, and was breveted to the rank of major in 1781. Painting of American privateer Congress capturing HMS Savage In June 1781, McLane took ship on the American privateer Congress to carry dispatches from George Washington to Count Paul de Grasse, who was at Cap-Fran√ßois, Haiti, commanding a French fleet. After convincing de Grasse to bring his fleet to Chesapeake Bay, McLane returned to New Jersey in September 1781. Cook, 1959, p. 72 Along the way, he commanded the Congresss Marines during the capture of HMS Savage, a British sloop-of-war. McLane continued to serve through the Yorktown campaign, scouting the movement of British troops southward from New York City, and capturing British private naval signals. He left the army at the end of 1781. Post-war career McLane was a delegate at Delaware's convention that ratified the United States Constitution in December 1787. He also served a member of the Privy Council, and as a Judge of the Delaware Court of Common Pleas. He was appointed by George Washington as the first United States Marshal of Delaware on September 26, 1789, and served until his resignation in 1797. During this period, from October 1791 to January 1793, he also served as Speaker of the 16th Delaware General Assembly. In 1797, Washington appointed McLane as Collector of Customs for the Port of Wilmington, a lucrative position that provided income from the seizure of contraband. As a well-known and a fervently loyal Federalist, McLane received the strong backing of James A. Bayard, who enabled him to keep the position despite the accession of Thomas Jefferson to the presidency in 1801. McLane retained his appointment under presidents of both political parties, into the administration of Andrew Jackson, and served until his death on May 22, 1829, at the age of 83. Personal life and family Louis as Secretary of the Treasury McLane lived in Smyrna, Delaware after the Revolutionary War. He moved with his family to Wilmington after his appointment as Collector of Customs there in 1797. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and a long-time advocate of the Methodist Church. His son, Louis McLane, served as the Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State under President Andrew Jackson.

Without modifier, iodane is the systematic name for the parent hydride of iodine, HI. Thus, any organoiodine compound with general formula RI (e.g., CH3I or C6H5I) is a substituted iodane. However, as used in the context of organic synthesis, the term iodane more specifically refers to organoiodine compounds with nonstandard bond number (i.e., bond number greater than one), making this term a synonym for hypervalent iodine. These iodine compounds are hypervalent because the iodine atom formally contains more than the 8 electrons in the valence shell required for the octet rule. When iodine is ligated to an organic residue and electronegative ligands (e.g. halides or carboxylates), hypervalent iodine compounds occur with a +3 oxidation number as iodine(III) or Œª3-iodanes or as a +5 oxidation number as iodine(V) or Œª5-iodanes. (Here, lambda convention is used to give the nonstandard bond number.) Using neutral electron counting, iodine itself contains 7 valence electrons. In an normal- valent iodane such as iodobenzene, C6H5I, the ligand donates one additional electron to give a completed octet. In a Œª3-iodane, three electrons are donated by the X-type ligands, making it a decet structure. Similarly, Œª5-iodanes are dodecet molecules. As with other hypervalent compounds, N-X-L notation can be used to describe the formal electron count of iodanes, in which N stands for the number of electrons around the central atom X (in this case iodine), and L is the total number of ligands. Thus, Œª3-iodanes can be described as 10-I-3 compounds. As with other hypervalent compounds, these bonding in iodanes were formerly described using d-orbital participation, but 3-center-4-electron bonding is now believed to be the primary bonding mode. In terms of chemical behavior, Œª3\\\\- and Œª5-iodanes are generally oxidizing and/or electrophilic species. They have been widely applied as oxidants and as reagents for electrophilic functionalization in organic synthesis. Iodane compounds The concept of hypervalent iodine was developed by J.J. Musher in 1969. In order to accommodate the excess of electrons in hypervalent compounds the 3-center-4-electron bond was introduced in analogy with the 3-center-2-electron bond observed in electron deficient compounds. One such bond exists in iodine(III) compounds and two such bonds reside in iodine(V) compounds. As a formalism, oxidation state assignments in iodane chemistry follow the convention that carbon is considered more electronegative than iodine, even though the Pauling electronegativities of carbon and iodine are 2.54 and 2.66, respectively.However, iodanes usually feature bonds to carbon in its sp2\\\\- or sp-hybridized state. The hybridization-specific electronegativities of sp2 and sp carbon are estimated to be 3.0 and 3.3, respectively (Anslyn and Dougherty, Modern Physical Organic Chemistry, University Science Books, 2004). Under this convention, iodobenzene is an iodine(I) compound, while (dichloroiodo)benzene, discussed below, is an iodine(III) compound. The first hypervalent iodine compound, (dichloroiodo)benzene (C6H5ICl2) was prepared in 1886 by the German chemist Conrad Willgerodt C. Willgerodt, Tageblatt der 58. Vers. deutscher Naturforscher u. Aertzte, Strassburg 1885. by passing chlorine gas through iodobenzene in a cooled solution of chloroform. : \\\\overset{iodobenzene}{C6H5I} + \\\\overset{chlorine}{Cl2} -> \\\\overset{iodobenzene\\\\ dichloride}{C6H5ICl2} The Œª3-iodanes such as diarylchloroiodanes have a pseudotrigonal bipyramidal geometry displaying apicophilicity with a phenyl group and a chlorine group at the apical positions and other phenyl group with two lone pair electrons in the equatorial positions. The Œª5-iodanes such as the Dess-Martin periodinane have square pyramidal geometries with 4 heteroatoms in basal positions and one apical phenyl group. (Diacetoxyiodo)benzene, phenyliodine diacetate, iodosobenzene diacetate, or PIDA is an organic reagent used as an oxidizing agent. It is a versatile reagent that can be used for cleaving glycols and Œ±-hydroxy ketones and a variety of other reactions. Classical organic procedures exist for the preparation of (diacetoxyiodo)benzene from peracetic acid and acetic acid, which was also first prepared by Willgerodt. :C6H5I \\\\+ CH3CO3H \\\\+ CH3CO2H ‚Üí C6H5I(O2CCH3)2 \\\\+ H2O [Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene, phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate), or PIFA, is a related compound with stronger oxidizing power. (Diacetoxyiodo)benzene can be hydrolysed and disportionationated by hot water to give iodoxybenzene or iodylbenzene C6H5O2I. This compound was first prepared by Willgerodt by disproportionation of iodosylbenzene under steam distillation to iodylbenzene and iodobenzene: :2 PhIO -> PhIO2 \\\\+ PhI At lower temperatures in the presence of NaOH, (diacetoxyiodo)benzene can also be hydrolyzed to iodosylbenzene which is actually a polymer with the molecular formula (C6H5OI)n. Iodosylbenzene is used in organic oxidations. Dess-Martin periodinane (1983) is another powerful oxidant and an improvement of the IBX acid already in existence in 1983. The IBX acid is prepared from 2-iodobenzoic acid and potassium bromate and sulfuric acid and is insoluble in most solvents whereas the Dess-Martin reagent prepared from reaction of the IBX acid with acetic anhydride is very soluble. The oxidation mechanism ordinarily consists of a ligand exchange reaction followed by a reductive elimination. The synthesis of organyl periodyl derivatives (Œª7-iodanes) has been attempted since the early 20th century, but efforts have so far met with failure, although the aryl derivatives of Œª7-chloranes are known compounds. Organic diesters of iodine(VII) are presumed intermediates in the periodate cleavage of diols (Malaprade reaction), although no carbon-iodine(VII) bond is present in this process. Diaryliodonium salts Diaryliodonium salts are compounds of the type [Ar‚ÄìI+‚ÄìAr]X‚àí. They are formally composed of a diaryliodonium cationNote that in the diaryliodonium salt description, the compound is not hypervalent, and the bonding number is the standard one for iodine (Œª1). It is a 8-I-2 species. In the other common description of these compounds as covalent iodanes, they are formally 10-I-3 and Œª3. paired with a halide or similar anion, although crystal structures show that there is generally a long weak bond with partial covalent character between the iodine and the counteranion. This interaction is particular strong for the case of coordinating anions like the halides but exists even for \\"noncoordinating\\" counterions such as perchlorate, triflate, or tetrafluoroborate. As a result, some authors regard them as Œª3-iodanes, although others have more recently described such secondary bonding interactions as examples of halogen bonding. They are generally T-shaped, with the counteranion occupying an apical position. Diaryliodonium salts are not very soluble in many organic solvents when the counterion is a halide, possibly because halides are frequently found as bridging dimers. Solubility is improved with triflate and tetrafluoroborate counterions. Diaryliodonium salts can be prepared in a number of ways. In one method an aryl iodide is first oxidized to an aryliodine(III) compound (such as ArIO) followed by a ligand exchange with an arene in the presence of a Br√∏nsted or Lewis acid (an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction) or using an organometallic reagent such as an arylstannane or an arylsilane. In another method, diaryliodonium salts are prepared from preformed hypervalent iodine compounds such as iodic acid, iodosyl sulfate or iodosyl triflate. The first such compound was synthesised in 1894 by coupling of two oxidized aryl iodides catalyzed by silver hydroxide (the Meyer and Hartmann reaction). :400px Diaryliodonium salts react with nucleophiles at iodine replacing one ligand and then form the substituted arene ArNu and iodobenzene ArI by reductive elimination or by substitution by ligand. diaryliodonium salts also react with metals M through ArMX intermediates in cross-coupling reactions. Uses The predominant use of hypervalent iodine compounds is that of oxidizing reagent replacing many toxic reagents based on heavy metals.Hypervalent iodine(V) reagents in organic synthesis Uladzimir Ladziata and Viktor V. Zhdankin Arkivoc 05-1784CR pp 26-58 2006 Article Thus, a hypervalent iodine (III) reagent was used, as oxidant, together with ammonium acetate, as the nitrogen source, to provide 2-Furonitrile, a pharmaceutical intermediate and potential artificial sweetener, in aqueous acetonitrile at 80 ¬∞C in 90% yield. Current research focuses on their use in carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions. In one study such reaction, an intramolecular C-N coupling of an alkoxyhydroxylamine to its anisole group is accomplished with a catalytic amount of aryliodide in trifluoroethanol: hypervalent iodine(III)-catalyzed C‚ÄìN bond forming reaction In this reaction the iodane (depicted as intermediate A) is formed by oxidation of the aryliodide with the sacrificial catalyst mCPBA which in turn converts the hydroxylamine group to a nitrenium ion B.

Grimes (18 April 1927 - 12 September 1988) was an English production designer and art director. He won an Oscar and was nominated for two more in the category Best Art Direction. Overview Stephen B. Grimes started working in the British film industry after the war as a sketch-artist. From the mid-50s to the late 60s, Grimes worked almost exclusively with John Huston. Their longer term collaboration resulted in 14 films in over 30 years. Grimes also had a fruitful long-term working relationship with Sydney Pollack, making seven films with him. Grimes also worked with directors David Lean, Peter Yates, Mark Rydell and Ulu Grosbard. One of his great strengths as a production designer was his skill as an artist: in researching and preparing a film he would produce many beautiful, dramatic and atmospheric sketches. These would help the director, director of photography and other key personnel to create the visual style and look of a film. Grimes understood the importance of light, space and texture ‚Äì he put more into his sketches than most art directors ‚Äì and tended to make sketches as much as or more than take photographs. He was not lavish; he liked the challenge of getting a good visual look with essentials ‚Äì combining observation and imagination. Grimes was conscientious with high standards and poured himself into his work. Biography Stephen B. Grimes was the second of seven children of Leslie and Nancy Grimes. Leslie was an artist and cartoonist. Three of his brothers, Michael, Bruce and Colin, also worked in the British film and TV industry as art directors or assistant art directors. Colin Grimes sometimes assisted Stephen. Grimes grew up in Haslemere, Surrey; Peldon in Essex; and Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill Gate, London. He went to St Martins School of Art, where he met and then married Kathleen Grimes (n√©e Sanders). They had five children. Grimes was in the Army at the tail-end of the war.

The fight took place in Boston's TD Banknorth Garden on November 6, 2007 in front of 6,000 people and offered a prize fund for the winner of $750,000. Build-up Jaidon Codrington, a 23-year-old from Queens in New York, entered the tournament with a record of 16 wins with 13 of those wins coming by way of knockout. His only defeat against Allan Green was, however, a brutal one and saw him devastatingly knocked out within the first 18 seconds of the first round. Codrington had also once held the New York State Super Middleweight title. Sakio Bika was the more experienced of the two, 5 years older and originally from Cameroon, Bika had represented his country at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and now based himself in Australia. Bika became Australian super middleweight champion and eventually fought for the WBO, IBF and WBC versions of the World super middleweight title against the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Lucien Bute and Marcus Beyer. In October 2002 he challenged Sam Soliman for the IBF Pan Pacific title and lost a mixed decision over 10 rounds. Soliman (also an Australian) would later also become a contestant on season 3 of the Contender. Both boxers had fought twice previously in the tournament with Codrington scoring two knockouts on his way to the final stopping Brian Vera in the 2nd round and Wayne Johnson in the 1st. Bika went the distance with both his opponents beating Donny McCrary over 5 rounds and then beating his former victor Sam Soliman over 8. The tournament represented a chance for both athletes to gain recognition in the sport and to follow in the footsteps of previous Contender winners Sergio Mora and Grady Brewer. The fight The fight started in exciting fashion with both boxers going down in the first. Bika was the first to score the knockdown after assaulting Codrington with a 'big hitting early charge'. Jaidon managed to recover and later in the round scored a left hook which dropped the African to his knees and left him looking very unsteady for the rest of the round. Both boxers continued to take big shots throughout the fight with Bika in particular throwing huge hooks in wide sweeping arcs eventually wearing down the less experienced man by taking him into the trenches. ESPN's Joe Tessitore commentating on the fight called the action \\"truly great\\" and noted at the end of the 5th round \\"If you don't like this, you don't have a pulse\\". The fight, originally scheduled for 10 rounds, was stopped in 2 minutes and 18 seconds of round 8 with Codrington spent and Bika's experience and stamina being the deciding factors. Sugar Ray Leonard sitting at ringside praised the attitude and heart of both fighters saying \\"So much heart, so much determination, so much resiliency...Real fighters, real warriors, real contenders\\". Promoter Lou Dibella said the action was like \\"something out of a Rocky movie\\". Aftermath Following the contest Codrington took a year out of the ring only returning in November 2008 to defeat journeyman William Gill over 8 rounds. Bika returned to Australia to pick up the vacant IBF super middleweight version of the Pan Pacific title, the title he had failed to win against Soliman in 2002. In November 2008 on the same day Codrington made his comeback, Sakio defeated the runner up from season one of the contender, Peter Manfredo, stopping him in the 3rd round to pick up the IBO super middleweight title.

Between 1 July 1994 and 30 April 1996, he returned to the role of assistant manager, until he was made interim manager once more on 1 May 1996. This time he prevented the club's relegation from 2. Bundesliga. After again returning to his duties as assistant manager in the following season, Halata was once more given the task to save VfB Leipzig from relegation on 7 December 1997, but he could not prevent the club's relegation at the end of the season.

Etymology The name Elveden seems to come from Old English *√¶lfa-dene 'elves' valley': the name appears, translated into Latin, as vallis nympharum 'valley of nymphs' in the mid-12th-century Miracula sancte Wihtburge.Alaric Hall, \\"Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity\\", Anglo-Saxon Studies; 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007), pp. 64-65.

Tourism Elveden Hall is the centrepiece of the Elveden Estate, a vast country estate that is now the family seat of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family, Earls of Iveagh. Formerly, it was the family home of Maharaja Duleep Singh, who is buried in the churchyard of St Andrew and St Patrick Church; his grave is visited by the Sikh community who pay homage to the last ruler of the Sikh Empire. A Center Parcs holiday complex straddles the northern limit of the parish at Elveden Forest. Elveden War Memorial The Elveden War Memorial is a war memorial to the First World War dead. It is situated at the meeting of the three parishes of Eriswell, Icklingham and Elveden to which the monument honours. The names of the dead of each parish are listed separately on three of the sides of the column's base. To the original WWI listings there are also WWII additions. The fourth (NW) side has a locked door that is used to access the inside of the column and via a spiral staircase to get to the upper parts of the monument. Small slits in the column's sides are used to light its interior and can be easily seen from the outside. It is a Corinthian column tall, made of Weldon Stone and surmounted by an urn of Portland stone. Edward Cecil Guinness owner of Elvden commissioned the architect Clyde Francis Young to design and build the column which took 2 years to erect and was completed in 1921. It was listed in 1954 and is now a Grade 2* listed structure. War monuments of this type and height are rare and it is thought that the design was inspired by the Coke Column or Leicester Monument which is located at the relatively close Holkham estate in Norfolk. Perhaps in an act of one-up- manship, the Thetford monument is slightly taller than its close by companion but out of tact is shorter than Nelson's Column in London ( ) It is close to the A11, where there is a lay-by which can be used to visit the site.

He also led the largest expedition ever made in the Americas, covering over 10,000 kilometres (over 6,200 mi) around South America, unifying completely the two large South American river basins and the Andes in a single voyage. Raposo Tavares departed from S√£o Paulo towards the rivers of the R√≠o de la Plata Basin (mainly the Paraguay River) and the Andean slopes, and from there to Bel√©m, at the mouth of the Amazon. Raposo Tavares was partly of Jewish origin according to the Jewish historian Anita Novinsky. Biography Tavares was born in S√£o Miguel do Pinheiro, Alentejo, Portugal in 1598. He sailed for South America in 1618 with his father Fern√£o Vieira Tavares. In 1622, after his father died, he settled around S√£o Paulo; six years later, in 1628, he left the village with the first bandeira composed of 900 settlers and 2000 Tupi warriors. This voyage was started to hunt the heretics down and to capture more indigenous slaves (mostly Tupi, Tememinos and Carij√≥s). The bandeirantes first attacked some Guarani villages in the upper Parana valley, which were protected by the Spanish Jesuits and brutally killed many people, capturing 2500 Indians. This journey allowed the annexation of a portion of the land east of the Uruguay River (current states of Paran√° and Santa Catarina) to the Portuguese colony. Tavares went back to S√£o Paulo in 1633 and he became a judge. Three years later he left again on a new journey, this time to destroy the Spanish Jesuit settlements established southeast of the Uruguay River (current Rio Grande do Sul). From 1639 to 1642, Tavares fought along with the military which was engaged in war against the Dutch, who had conquered the settlements in the north-eastern coast (Bahia and Pernambuco). He embarked on his last journey with a bandeira in 1648, searching for gold, precious minerals and slaves in the unexplored mainland. He was joined by 200 white mercenaries from S√£o Paulo and over a thousand Indians. The bandeirantes travelled for over following the courses of the rivers, most notably the Paraguay River, the Grande River, the Mamor√© River, the Madeira River and the Amazon River. Only Tavares, 59 whites and some Indians reached Bel√©m at the mouth of the Amazon River. After that, the survivors returned to S√£o Paulo, where Raposo Tavares died in 1658.

Translation team The team developing The Voice numbered more than 120 scholars, authors and artists. The team included Greek and Hebrew scholars, Biblical scholars, poets, authors, musicians and pastors. Interesting features of this translation were the decisions the team made in rendering certain words. The team chose to render: * The Hebrew Tetragrammaton (e.g., Genesis 2:4) as The Eternal rather than a common title such as The LORD or a transliteration such as Yahweh or Jehovah. (Such a translation rendering is not unique to The Voice; there are other Bible translations such as the Moffatt, New Translation of 1922 that have rendered the Tetragrammaton in this manner.) * The Greek Logos (e.g., John 1:1) as The Voice rather than The Word which is used in most Bible translations, or the less common Logos as used in such translations as the Moffatt, New Translation of 1922 or the Emphatic Diaglott (a Greek-English Interlinear, first published in 1864 by Benjamin Wilson). * The Greek Christos (e.g., Matthew 1:1) as the Anointed One instead of Christ. (The Passion Translation also uses the Anointed One.) Criticism The Voice has been harshly received by some fundamentalist critics. For instance, Baptist pastor Randy White writes: \\"The Voice reads like a New Age book. The familiar 'I am the way, the truth, and the life' of John 14:6 is rendered, 'I am the path, the truth, and the energy of life.'

Reys' career began in Northern Queensland. He raced in North Queensland, Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne and Victoria and won his first ride in 1948 as a 16-year-old. In his career as a jockey he had 1,330 winning rides, made more impressive by the fact that there was only one metropolitan and one regional race meeting per week compared to today where one can race day, every day. His 1973 Melbourne Cup win was his last. In winning his last race at 45 years of age in 1976, he bookended his career with winners. Heritage Frank Reys' father was Filipino and his mother Aboriginal, a descendant of the Djiribul people of Northern Queensland. Yet, he was widely reported as Filipino only throughout his career. Many believed that it would have hindered his prospects had he discussed his Aboriginal heritage openly in a time of racial discrimination and legislative limitations. Frank's daughter Shelley Reys once said: \\"...My father was one of the fourteen children. It was a different time in those days, a time where Indigenous heritage was not valued as it is today. The reconciliation movement was yet to be realised and people were marginalised simply on the basis of race and colour. Many years on, we are a different nation where fellow Australians not only acknowledge Indigenous people and culture, but appreciate that it is an intrinsic part of being Australian and in doing so, celebrate it\\". And later, \\"Dad was proud of their Aboriginal and Filipino heritage. Both parents made their mark in shaping who he was, as too his many brothers and sisters\\". Frank Rey's place in history, as the first Aboriginal jockey to win the Melbourne Cup, has been contested by some on the basis that he was preceded by John Cutts on Archer in the first Melbourne Cup in 1861, and by Peter St. Albans on Briseis in the Melbourne Cup of 1876. Neither of these jockeys, however, was Aboriginal, despite the legends that have risen up around them. Early years Frank Reys was born in about 1931, one of 14 children, 8 boys and 6 girls. His father, who had immigrated to North Queensland before Frank was born, was a Filipino labourer and cook who worked on farms in North Queensland ‚Äì inland from Cairns. He was born of his father's second relationship, and Frank was the first child of 9 to his Aboriginal mother. Frank and his brothers would round up brumbies (wild horses), and break them in, then race in contests between themselves. Frank was the standout and won most of the races, although one of his brothers did ride with success in amateur events. Frank loved to ride, and progressed to riding at Cairns in gymkhanas and pony races before becoming a jockey. Teenage Frank was first indentured as an apprentice jockey in June 1949, to trainer Alfred Baker at Cairns. Later his apprenticeship was transferred to trainer Gordon Shelley. During his apprenticeship Reys rode about 45 winners. He began at Cannon Park Racecourse at Cairns, and at other district meetings. At a meeting at Gordonvale Reys won his first race riding a horse named Cruedon. In the autumn of 1950, Baysure gave him his first win in Brisbane. At the end of his apprenticeship he travelled widely and became one of a few who have ridden over 1000 winners. One notable performance was in Queensland when he rode four winners in one afternoon at Cunnamulla. He won the Cunnamulla Cup on three occasions. In his early riding years Reys worked hard to establish himself as a fully fledged jockey without the assistance of anyone but his \\"boss\\", Mr. Shelley. Career In 1955 Reys moved to Sydney. He won the Warwick Farm Autumn Handicap on Beaupa and rode three winners in an afternoon at the provincial racecourse Kembla Grange, Wollongong. Around 1961 Reys moved from Sydney to Melbourne and had considerable success in both the metropolitan area and at Victorian provincial meetings. Among the highlights of his time in Victoria were: * 25 November 1961 - Reys' best day's riding in Victoria in his racing career. He rode five winners in one afternoon at Moe. * 1962 Reys won the Oaks Stakes at Flemington on Arctic Star - she was in Ray Hutchins' stable, for whom Reys was the stable rider. * 15 June 1963 - At Moonee Valley Reys rode four winners. * 13 April 1968 - Reys rode four winners at Caulfield Racecourse. * November 1968 - Reys won the important Bendigo and Ballarat Cups. * 22 November Reys rode four winners at Ballarat. * January 1969 - Reys won the William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley on Crewman. Injuries In January 1969, Reys was badly injured a few days after the William Reid Stakes. A four horse fall at Geelong resulted in a smashed pelvis and he was hospitalised for three months. After his return to riding,\\"Turf Monthly\\" magazine noted in July 1969 that he rode \\"with considerable success at the Victorian mid-week provincial meetings\\". His family struggled financially due to all the racing he had missed due to injuries. Dual Choice, the flying filly ‚Äì and later mare ‚Äì won a great many races in the years 1970 to 1972. Although Reys did not ride her in all her victories, the two nevertheless developed a great affinity. In August 1973, attempting to have his first ride back in the saddle following time off from injury, Reys was involved in a car accident on the way to the course but climbed out of the wrecked car and rode Tauto to victory at Moonee Valley later that afternoon. Trainer Trainer Ray Hutchins stood by Frank Reys. Ray Hutchins stood by Frank Reys after a horrible two years in which he had suffered a broken shoulder, two pelvis fractures, a broken cheek bone and an ankle, and earned himself the nickname \\"Autumn Leaves\\". Despite these injuries Hutchins entrusted Reys with the ride on the four-year-old gelding Gala Supreme in the 1973 Caulfield Cup, in which Gala Supreme ran second. Hutchins had long before mapped out the Melbourne Cup as his mission, and after the Caulfield Cup second fielded Gala Supreme for the Cup. 1973 Melbourne Cup On Tuesday 6 November 1973 Reys became the first Aboriginal jockey to ride a winner in the Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme carrying and Frank Reys won the Melbourne Cup at 9-1 in a time of 3.19.15. Reys and Gala Supreme then cemented their Melbourne Cup victory by winning the Herbert Power Handicap. At 41 years of age, Frank Reys was the oldest jockey with a ride in the 1973 Melbourne Cup. Gala Supreme had drawn the extreme outside barrier 24 and that clearly was the only stumbling block in Rey‚Äôs mind. Trainer Hutchins would later tell how he and Reys had numerous phone conversations after the barrier draw and discussed various riding tactics. Hutchins recalled he eventually left it up to Reys to ride the horse as he saw fit and Reys told him he‚Äôd \\"have Gala Supreme one off the fence in 5th or 6th position going out of the straight\\". Coming from the outside barrier Reys rode just as he had planned. He had Gala Supreme one off the fence, not far behind the leaders, before passing the winning post on the first lap. As the horses turned for home, Reys became buried in the pack, just behind the leaders. Two hundred metres from the winning post Reys squeezed Gala Supreme through a gap, left by the favourite, who had drifted off a straight course. It was only a narrow win, but Gala Supreme had surged home to victory. In his recollections Hutchins continued \\"and he went and did it ‚Äì it was the perfect ride ‚Äì he rode the race of his life for me.\\" His victory speech said, in part, \\"I thank my God, my prayers and my family for their encouragement. This is such a wonderful day. I kept picking myself off the ground and hoping I would win a Melbourne Cup. It‚Äôs something every Australian jockey dreams about. I still can‚Äôt believe it.\\" Reys had three of his brothers in the crowd ‚Äì Fred, Tony and Eric ‚Äì to witness what was later called \\"one of the most stunning comebacks from adversity in Australian sporting history.\\" In 1976, three years after his career highlight aboard Gala Supreme, and after winning a Flemington race for his Melbourne Cup trainer Ray Hutchins, Reys announced his immediate retirement from the saddle. Death Frank Reys died from cancer in 1984 ‚Äì aged 53. Shelley Reys Frank Reys is the father of Shelley Reys, who became a director of Reconciliation Australia, a forceful advocate for Aboriginal rights, and a prominent voice on Aboriginal affairs. In 2004 Shelley was invited to address the board of the National Australia Day Council to propose an Indigenous-inclusive way of marking the anniversary of the First Fleet's arrival. As a result of her recommendations, Australia Day 2005 was officially launched during a sunrise ceremony at Uluru. On 11 June 2012, Shelley Reys was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for \\"distinguished service to the Indigenous community, to reconciliation and social inclusion, and as an advocate for improved educational, health and employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\\" In October 2013, Shelley Reys was named by The Australian Financial Review as \\"100 Women of Influence\\".

Most were a long way from home and had attended school in the Salesian colleges Pallaskenry, Limerick, Warranstown in Meath and Ballinakill in County Laois. The application was made to the Leinster Branch, who had to be satisfied that the club had a home pitch, complete with dressing rooms and showers. After a bit of searching a pitch of sorts was found in Maynooth and the application was approved Salesians played their first season at J3 level in the '73 to '74 season with moderate success and were soon fielding two teams. The first team colours were red jerseys with black collars and cuffs and black shorts. The club strip was changed in 1978 to reflect the school colours of the new salesian college recently opened in Celbridge. Despite being over 35 years old, Stillorgan is still one of the youngest clubs in Dublin. Stillorgan suffered in the early eighties when many of its founding members retired and the club was forced to move its homeground to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. In the 1986/1987 season the club moved to CUS Sports Grounds Bird Avenue and this has ensured the clubs growth and existence and today it fields 3 teams in the various leagues and cups.

The foundation's creation was inspired by his charitable single of the same name. Through his foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo, instituted drug and alcohol abuse education and donated millions of dollars to disadvantaged children, including the full payment of a Hungarian child's liver transplant. Failure to file yearly accounting statements saw the charity lose its tax exempt status in 2002. A different organization, with no relationship to Michael Jackson's foundation, incorporated in the state of California under the same name and applied for new tax exempt status in 2008. The Jackson estate took legal action against this organisation for unfair competition and trademark infringement in 2009.  Background  Prior to the creation of the Heal the World Foundation, Jackson had expressed great interest in humanitarianism, equality and world peace. Songs such as \\"Can You Feel It\\", \\"We Are the World\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" convey this. Jackson also donated millions of dollars to charity, including his $5 million share from the Victory Tour.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 320 In 1984, while filming a Pepsi Cola commercial, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 279‚Äì287 PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the \\"Michael Jackson Burn Center\\" which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns. Shortly afterward, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award presented by American President Ronald Reagan. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 304‚Äì307 In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity single \\"We Are the World\\" with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. He was one of 39 music celebrities who performed on the record. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was recognized for his humanitarian efforts.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 340‚Äì344  Mission  Jackson founded the charity in 1992, naming it after his hit song, \\"Heal the World\\". The purpose of the charity was to provide medicine to children and fight world hunger, homelessness, child exploitation and abuse. Jackson stated that he wanted \\"to improve the conditions for children throughout the world\\". The foundation also brought underprivileged children to Jackson's Neverland Ranch, located outside Santa Ynez, California, to go on theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property after he purchased it in 1988.  Fundraising  The Dangerous World Tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5 million people in 69 concerts. All profits from the concerts went to the \\"Heal the World Foundation\\", raising millions of dollars in relief. Through the foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo and paid for a Hungarian child's liver transplant. One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at the National Football League's Super Bowl XXVII. At the show, Jackson performed his anthem \\"Heal the World\\", to help promote the organization with the assistance of a choir of 750 people and a flash card display involving 98,000 volunteers. Jackson donated his entire fees to the foundation, with the NFL also donating $100,000 and a 30-second TV spot to push for contributions.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 454 Following the Super Bowl, Jackson ran a full-page advertisement in the newspaper USA Today, providing a toll-free number. A coupon was provided that could be clipped and mailed in along with a contribution. Those donating $35 or more were given a \\"Heal the World\\" T-shirt. The environmental themed music video for \\"Earth Song\\" closed with a request for donations to Jackson's foundation.Michael Jackson HIStory on Film volume II VHS/DVD In 1997, Jackson earned money from photographs of his son, Prince Michael. The photographs were sold to \\"OK!\\" magazine and the National Enquirer, raising $3 million for the foundation.\\"Jackson baby photo money to go to charity\\", MTV.com.  Heal the Kids  In February 2001, Jackson launched Heal the Kids, an initiative of HTWF and part of the foundation's attempt to boost children's welfare.\\"Fans worship Michael Jackson at NY appearance\\", MTV.com. Jackson launched the charity initiative, stating, \\"Heal the Kids will help adults and parents realize it's in our power to change the world our children live in\\". Jackson gave a speech at Oxford University about raising children, as part of the launch of his \\"Heal the Kids\\" initiative. In the speech, Jackson spoke rhetorically of his children, \\"What if they grow older and resent me, and how my choices impacted their youth?...Why weren't we given a normal childhood like all the other children? And at that moment I pray that my children will give me the benefit of the doubt. That they will say to themselves: Our daddy did the best he could, given the unique circumstances he faced. I hope that they will focus on the positive things, on the sacrifices I willingly made for them...\\". Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli concluded that Jackson's performance during the speech was \\"absorbing\\" and well received.Taraborrelli, Michael Jackson ‚Äì The Magic and the Madness, p. 626‚Äì627  Disbandment  In 2002, the Heal the World Foundation was suspended, after failing to file yearly accounting statements, required for tax-exempt organizations. Records showed that the foundation had net assets of $3,542 and reported $2,585 in expenses. The foundation did not have a director, president or other top manager besides Jackson, who was listed as chairman.  Name confusion  A separate charity named 'Heal the World Foundation was set up in 2008. On August 11, 2009, CBS News reported that: \\"... representatives of the Jackson estate say the foundation is not linked, \\"The Michael Jackson estate has no connection whatsoever to the \\"Heal the World Foundation\\" run by Melissa Johnson,\\" said Terry Fahn, a spokesperson for John Branca, the special administrator of the Jackson estate.\\" On September 30, the Jackson Foundation started law action against the charity claiming that the \\"Defendants' acts of infringement and unfair competition have been committed with the intent to cause confusion, mistake and to deceive\\".

A monotypic genus, it contains the single species Mythicomyces corneipes, first described by Elias Fries in 1861. The fungus produces fruit bodies with shiny yellowish- orange to tawny caps that are in diameter. These are supported by stems measuring long and 1‚Äì2 mm thick. A rare to uncommon species, it is found in northern temperate regions of North America and Europe, where it typically fruits in groups, in wet areas of coniferous forests. There are several species with which M. corneipes might be confused due to a comparable appearance or similar range and habitat, but microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish between them. Taxonomy The genus Mythicomyces was circumscribed in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and Alexander H. Smith to contain the species originally named Agaricus corneipes by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near Alsike, Sweden; it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907, and several times by Smith. When listing the synonyms of the species, Redhead and Smith cited the publication year of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their new combination invalid according to the rules of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, although the generic name was valid. The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011. In its taxonomic history, the species has also been placed in Geophila by Lucien Qu√©let in 1886, and Psilocybe by Petter Karsten in 1879. Psilocybe specialist Gast√≥n Guzm√°n excluded the taxon from the latter genus in his 1983 monograph, based on its roughened spores that lacked a germ pore, pale spore print, stem texture, and the tawny basal mycelium. Guzm√°n, who examined Smith's US collections, suggested that the material might be more appropriately considered a Galerina, but Redhead and Smith noted that several features of Mythicomyces corneipes are inconsistent with placement in Galerina, including spore print color, presence of metuloids, stem texture, and tawny basal mycelium. Redhead and Smith placed the genus in the Strophariaceae, as the biology of the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert K√ºhner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more restricted concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis showed it to be most closely allied to this family where Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister to the rest of the family. In 2019 the family Mythicomycetaceae was recognized for the two genera, Mythicomyces and Stagnicola. Description Washington, USA The cap is initially somewhat conical with margins rolled inward, and expands to become bell-shaped or broadly convex in maturity, reaching a diameter of . The cap sometimes has an umbo, which is rounded to conical. The color of the cap ranges from dull to bright orange when young, to yellowish-brown (tawny) in maturity. It is hygrophanous, and the color fades to yellowish-buff. The cap surface is smooth and polished, and somewhat translucent, such that the radial gill lines can be seen on the margin. The gills are closely spaced, and have two tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills). Gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stem, although the gills tend to secede (separate from the stem) in maturity. They are initially pallid to whitish in color before turning brownish when the spores mature. The smooth stem measures long by 1‚Äì2 mm thick. Yellowish to pale orange near the top and dark reddish brown below, it has tawny mycelium at the base. In maturity the stem turns black from the base upward. In 1907, Morgan noted the stipe to be remarkably similar to that of Marasmius cohaerens. The mushroom flesh has an odor that ranges from indistinct to somewhat of geraniums, while its taste is indistinct to faintly bitter. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Spores The spore print is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to somewhat ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6‚Äì8.5 by 4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, and have a small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24‚Äì26 by 6‚Äì8.5 ¬µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle- shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43‚Äì86 by 10‚Äì24 ¬µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3 ¬µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1‚Äì4 ¬µm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. =Similar species= Stagnicola perplexa is similar in appearance and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to Mythicomyces corneipes. S. perplexa generally has a more faded coloration, and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones. The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics, as Stagnicola has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls. Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses, Phaeocollybia attenuata might be confused with M. corneipes. Phaeocollybia attenuata can readily be differentiated in the field by the long wirelike pseudorhiza extending below the substrate, and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented limoniform-globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia. Other morphologically similar species include Hypholoma udum and H. elongatum, but unlike M. corneipes, both of these agarics have smooth spores, yellow chrysocystidia, and lack metuloids. The lookalike Galerina sideroides is found in Washington, Michigan, and Sweden, where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs. It has distinct microscopic characteristics, such as a wider range of basidial widths (20‚Äì40 ¬µm), and a lack of pleurocystidia. Habitat and distribution Mythicomyces corneipes is a saprobic fungus, and uses plant debris‚Äîusually bits of wood‚Äîas a substrate. Fruit bodies appear in autumn, and grow in groups among mosses in moist habitats, such as near the edges of bogs, or under conifers or birch in soil wet from spring flooding. It has been recorded from North America, where it is most common in the Pacific Northwest region, and Europe, where it is rare, but widespread across the northern part of the continent. In 1938, Smith called the species \\"extremely rare\\".

In 2005 it had a population of 240. The village is located within Thetford Forest on a meander of the River Little Ouse on the Norfolk-Suffolk border. Thetford is southeast and the nearest railway station is in Brandon west. History East of England Forestry Commission offices The village was the administrative centre for HM Forestry Commission for many years following the planting of tens of thousands of trees in the Breckland area to form the Thetford Forest. The District office and staff were housed in 1960s office building close to the site of the now demolished Santon Downham Hall. The Hall garden formed the base for the nursery department of the district. The HM Forestry Commission Repair depot was built close by in an award-winning design building, next to which stood the HMFC fire station. A Bedford 'green goddess fire tender and a water tanker were kept in the fire station due to the high fire risk in the area. The bridge over the River Little Ouse appeared in an episode of BBC's Dad's Army when Captain Mainwaring and his troops attempted to demolish it. Downham Hall Downham Hall was a seven-bay brick house, with a projecting porch and a higher, three-floor, three-bay centre It had a shallow bow to the rear garden. The Wrights family at the hall for more than 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries. Thomas Wright brought Santon Downham to public notice in 1668 with his dramatic account of a sand flood and how his house became ‚Äúalmost buryed in the Sand‚Äù. In Thomas Wright‚Äôs day, in 1647, a substantial house of 12 hearths was recorded. In about 1800 the hall was bought by the Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan. The Ipswich Journal described the estate: \\"Mansion sashed, fronting South, with all conveniences, gardens, meadows &c;‚Ä¶ [with] rights of fishing and swanning\\". In 1829 the house was described as being \\"a modern house of apparently the former part of the last century\\", suggesting that the Cadogans, who used the estate as a shooting lodge, had refurbished it. It has been suggested that Capability Brown may have advised on the landscaping, as he was deputy to the Earl, who was Surveyor of the King's Gardens. Lord William Paulett, later the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, took ownership in 1830 and architect Lewis Vulliamy was brought in, in 1836, to perform alterations, probably as a result of a fire. It is believed that the Duchess established the avenue of limes. In 1871 the hall, described as a \\"noble mansion built of white Suffolk brick, situated in a well-timbered park\\", was bought by Edward Mackenzie. During the First World War the British Pioneer Corps and Canadian troops, who were lumberjacks, were stationed at Downham. In 1918 the estate was sold for ¬£75,310 and was then owned by a succession of land speculators and companies. It was eventually acquired by the Forestry Commission. It was demolished in the 1920s, but some parts of the hall still remain: the billiard room and the ice house, which is a listed building,to the south. the coach house lies to the west and the tack room to the north. Some elements of the park and gardens also still survive.

History  The church was constructed in 1844 and was designed by Benjamin Ferrey in the Neo-Norman architectural style. The church was originally established under the ecclesiastic oversight of the Diocese of Winchester. In 1846, the Church of England's Church Commissioners petitioned the Supreme Governor of the Church of England Queen Victoria to merge the nearby parishes of Droxford and Bishops Waltham into St Barnabas's in Swanmore as they had agreed with the Bishop of Winchester, which the Queen granted. This was due to Swanmore village becoming independent from Droxford. The vestry and chancel were extended in 1863 with a tower and new windows being installed in 1876. In 1927, St Barnabas' was transferred from the Diocese of Winchester to the Diocese of Portsmouth following the creation of the new independent Diocese of Portsmouth. The church was renovated in 2011 with a new boiler being installed as well as the tower's roof being re-tiled. The church has a graveyard attached to it, however it is full and no longer open to future burials though it does retain an area for interment of cremated ashes. It is also used for concerts.

Tom√°s Braulio Platero IV (1857 - 1925) was one of the founders of the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), Argentina's oldest existing political party, and among the most prominent Afro Argentine public figures of his time. Platero was born in Buenos Aires in 1857 and, though slavery had been abolished in Argentina in 1812, Platero suffered from prevailing local discrimination against people of color. He joined the original Civic Union in 1890, and became a loyal supporter of the party's first leader, Leandro Alem, becoming a prominent member of the Committee of La Plata after an 1891 split in the Civic Union led to the establishment of the UCR (which advocated greater activism towards the goal of universal male suffrage). He was also the founder of the Professional Association of the Province of Buenos Aires, and President of the Electric Cooperative Society. Appointed Chief Civil Registry Director for the 3rd and 5th districts in Buenos Aires, he inherited a bookkeeping system whereby black births, marriages and deaths were recorded on separate ledgers, and eventually helped end the practice. He was later the founder and President of The Protector National Mutual Association. He was also a person of strong religious convictions, and a brother of the Franciscan Order. Following Alem's 1896 suicide, Platero became a supporter of Dr. Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, whose activism led to the passage of the S√°enz Pe√±a Law in 1912, and to Argentina's first democratic presidential elections, in 1916. A steadfast supporter of President Yrigoyen's, Platero was a vocal opponent of the Antipersonalistas (a more conservative wing of the UCR). Platero died in La Plata on February 17, 1925, and his funeral was attended by the highest authorities of the UCR, including the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Jos√© Luis Cantilo, Federico Zelarray√°n (carrying condolences from Yrigoyen), and numerous other UCR figures.PLATERO, TOM√ÅS BRAULIO, compilado por Enrique Pereira References Category:Argentine male writers Category:Radical Civic Union politicians Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:1857 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Burials at La Plata Cemetery ","title":"Tom√°s Platero IV"},{"id":"20840680","title":"Generation of Love"},{"id":"20840700","text":"The White Lotus Foundation trains and certifies instructors of Yoga.

Sting wrote a foreword to White's book, titled Yoga Beyond Belief, in 2007. The Foundation holds four two-week teacher training sessions each year with up to thirty attendees each, as well as retreats for yoga therapy, Thai yoga therapy, meditation and advanced training lasting from three to seven days. White and wife Tracey Rich have produced numerous best-selling videos, including Total Yoga, one of the top selling Yoga videos in the United States http://totalyoga.com/original.asp with total sales of more than 1.8 million copies. Its mountain retreat headquarters and instruction center is located a few miles outside Santa Barbara, California within the Los Padres National Forest. The campus overlooks Santa Barbara, the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands of California. The foundation was housed in various locations in Los Angeles for about fifteen years, and then moved to its present site in 1983. The Foundation has made its facilities available to public service groups, for example teens at risk programs in cooperation with The Art of Yoga Project and self-esteem programs through the Academy of Healing Arts. It has donated books to libraries and correctional facilities. It has offered teacher training scholarships for teachers committed to giving free service by way of yoga to women‚Äôs shelters and homes for abused women. White Lotus has been active in environmental rain forest preservation work. Facilities include a large Yoga- meeting room, a kitchen and dining room serving vegetarian meals, an underground Hopi style Kiva temple and a Library-Media center designed and crafted by Santa Barbara artists. Accommodations include indoor housing, Yurts and campsites on plateaus overlooking the ocean. Legislation The United States House of Representatives voted on January 27, 2014 to pass the bill To provide for the conveyance of a small parcel of National Forest System land in Los Padres National Forest in California (H.R. 3008; 113th Congress). If the bill became law, it would authorize the exchange of 5 acres of land in the Los Padres National Forest for unspecified lands owned by the White Lotus Foundation.

In his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach performed 18 cantatas composed by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach, a court musician in Meiningen. He then set some of the texts himself, including this cantata, written probably by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe- Meiningen. They follow a pattern: seven movements are divided in two parts, both beginning with biblical quotations, Part I from the Old Testament, Part II from the New Testament. The text is based on the prescribed gospel reading telling of Jesus cleansing ten lepers. It is opened by a verse from Psalm 50, quotes a key sentence from the gospel and is closed by a [stanza from Johann Gramann's hymn \\"\\". The cantata, structured in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon, is modestly scored for four vocal soloists and choir (SATB), and a Baroque orchestra of two oboes, strings and continuo.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1726, his fourth year in Leipzig, for the 14th Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's teaching on \\"works of the flesh\\" and \\"fruit of the Spirit\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, Cleansing ten lepers. (). That year, Bach presented 18 cantatas by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach who was court musician in Meiningen. Bach seems to have been impressed also by the texts of those cantatas and follows similar structures: seven movements, divided in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon, both parts opened by Bible words, Part I by a quotation from the Old Testament, Part II by one from the New Testament. Bach composes some texts that his relative set before, including this cantata, which was written by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, according to Christoph Wolff. The cantata is regarded as part of Bach's third annual cycle. The poet derived from the gospel idea that thanks to God for his goodness are man's obligation. A profound scholar of the Bible, he quotes for the opening chorus a verse from Psalm 50 () and for the first recitative in Part II verses 15 and 16 from the gospel. He alludes to the Bible several times, for example telling about God's creation by in movement 2 and in movement 3, to in movement 6, \\"\\" (Love, peace, righteousness and joy in Your spirit). The closing chorale is the third stanza of the hymn \\"\\" (1525) by Johann Gramann (Poliander). Bach first performed the cantata on 22 September 1726. He later used the opening movement for the movement Cum sancto Spritu in the Gloria of his Missa in G major, BWV 236.  Music  Structure and scoring  The cantata is structured in two parts, Part I of three movements to be performed before the sermon, Part II of four movements after the sermon. Bach scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc). The title of the autograph score reads: \\"Domin. 14 post Trin. / Wer Dank opfert, der preiset mich / a / 4 Voci / 2 Hautb. / 2 Viol. / Viola / e Contin. / di / J.S.Bach\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). = Movements = 1  The opening chorus presents the verse from the psalm, \\"\\" (He who offers thanks praises Me), in two choral sections, preceded by a long instrumental section.  2  The first recitative is secco, as the two others: \\"\\" (The entire world must be a silent witness).  3  In the first aria, \\"\\" (Lord, your goodness reaches as wide as Heaven),soprano and two obbligato violins illustrate in raising lines the text \\"\\" (as far as the clouds soar), adding extended coloraturas on \\"\\" (praise) and \\"\\" (indicate [the way]).  4  The recitative beginning Part II, \\"\\" (One, however, among them, when he saw that he was cured), is of narrative character and therefore given to the tenor voice, similar to the Evangelist in Bach's Passions.  5  The second aria, \\"\\" (What an abundance of goodness), is accompanied by the strings. Both arias share a structure of three vocal sections, avoiding a vocal da capo, but combining the last section with the ritornello, thus achieving a unity of the movement.  6  The last recitative, \\"\\" (Look on my will), is sung by the bass. It is accompanied by the continuo alone and expands on the theme of giving thanks to God.  7  John Eliot Gardiner admires particularly the closing chorale, \\"\\" (As a father has mercy), for its \\"wonderful word-painting for the 'flower and fallen leaves' and 'the wind [which] only has to pass over. He compares it to the central movement of the motet .  Recordings  The sortable table follows the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website.

His family Cossins was the elder of the two sons and three daughters of William Cossins of Brompton, who (1707-1725) was steward of the Hackness estate, then consisting of the townships of Hackness, Suffield, Everley, Silpho, Broxa, Langdale End, much of Harwood Dale and some of Burniston. It was as map-maker of this lordship that John first learned the practice and skills of land surveying and drawing. His Notebooks In 1993 Sothebys offered Cossins' notebook for sale. It was bought by York City Archives. It contained notes on his maps of Scarborough, York and Leeds and also a list of the subscribers. Originally 138 people subscribed to 192 copies of the Leeds plan; only one copy is now accessible, in Leeds City Museum. It has been suggested that Thoresby was instrumental in hiring Cossins, and a copy of the map is kept at the Thoresby Society. JOHN COSSINS of BRISTOL The son of a London grocer, John Cossins was born on February 20, 1682 in London. The family grocery business was situated in St Paul's Churchyard. In 1714 he married Martha Innys,the daughter of a Bristol merchant and they lived in London until his retirement from his grocery business in 1732. He, like his father, Roger Cossins, was an active member of the Worshipful Company of Bowyers in the City of London. On retirement he bought the old Elizabethan manor at Redland in Bristol and an estate attached of approximately 42 acres. Between 1732 and 1735 a new house was built to his design. He replaced the old manor house with Redland Court, a house of Classical design in a prominent position and with beautiful gardens. The architect Cossins employed was John Strahan. From 1732 onwards Cossins enlarged his estate (by the time of his death in 1759 it was estimated to be 169 acres) and was also responsible for the building of Redland Chapel (now Redland church) in 1740, which was originally the Court's private chapel and designed by Strahan and William Halfpenny. It was built in the same style as Redland Court to a very simple, yet elegant design. John Cossins and his wife Martha were buried in Redland Chapel on their deaths in 1759 and 1762 respectively. They had no children and on Martha's death the house and estate were inherited by her brothers, Jeremy and John Innys. Much of Cossins' estate was sold off by subsequent owners of Redland Court and housing development occurred on the land in the 19th century. Cossins name is commemorated in Cossins Road, a residential street which was once on his land. Redland Court still stands and was the site of Redland High School for Girls from 1882-2017. The site is currently being renovated and developed as private housing (2020). John Cossins of Redland Court, BristolReferences *Murray, Hugh ed.

Some scholars prefer to utilize a middle category, or stage in theological development, that provides further differentiation between Nicene theologies and pro-Nicene theologies: Barnes labels this middle category ‚Äúneo-Nicene‚Äù theology. ‚Äò‚ÄôE.g.‚Äô‚Äô, M.R. Barnes, The Power of God: Dunamis in Gregory of Nyssa‚Äôs Trinitarian Theology (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 2001), 169-70. Nevertheless, all the scholars who utilize the pro-Nicene category stress the logical compatibility that exists within different theologies of the period, rather than one particular theology. The feature of these like-minded theological accounts that has garnered the most attention is the understanding that in sharing the one power of God, the Father and Son must share the same nature. Barnes, Power of God, 170; Ayres, Nicaea and its Legacy, 344-63 on Gregory of Nyssa. This new approach contrasts itself with narratives that describe the orthodox Trinitarian theologies of this period as utilizing different arguments of logic. For instance, this new approach would disagree with the contention that some orthodox accounts start from the affirmation of distinction within the Godhead and argue toward unity, while other orthodox accounts start from the affirmation of unity within the Godhead and argue toward distinction.

It later acquired sites at Desford and Braunstone in Leicestershire. Initially it developed and manufactured aircraft instrumentation and pilot selection aids but later diversified into flying training and aircraft design. During World War II the company was part of the Civilian Repair Organisation repairing, rebuilding and converting warplanes at the Desford site. Post-war it continued to manufacture aviation instruments and guidance systems but also diversified further to produce cameras and optical instruments. In 1954 the company was purchased and taken-over by the Decca Record Company. History Reid and Sigrist Ltd was formed in February 1928 as a private company with ¬£4000 capital. The company was set up by Squadron-Leader (ret.) George Hancock Reid DFC and Frederick Sigrist, a joint managing director of H.G. Hawker Engineering Ltd, that would later become Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Ltd. The new company acquired the rights to the designs of Reid's previous company, Reid Manufacturing & Construction Company Ltd, which had designed and made precision aircraft instrumentation, most notably an aircraft turn and slip indicator, that Reid had invented and developed, and a pilot testing apparatus. The company was initially located at The Athanaeum Works, The Vale in Hampstead, North London before moving to Canbury Park Road, Kingston-upon- Thames, Surrey and finally, in 1935, relocating to a new, purpose-built factory at Shannon Corner, Kingston-by-Pass, New Malden, Surrey. As the company expanded and diversified further sites were acquired at Desford Aerodrome and Braunstone in Leicestershire. The company ceased to exist as a separate entity when it was bought by the Decca Record Company at the end of 1954. Aircraft instruments Initially the main business focus for the company was the development and manufacture of aircraft instrumentation. An important product was a type of gyroscopic turn and slip indicator invented and developed by George Reid. A later version of this device was incorporated into the standard blind-flying panel adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1937. A further development was the Gyorizon which combined the functions of a turn indicator and artificial horizon in one instrument. The design and manufacture of gyroscopic instrumentation and guidance systems continued after World War II and Reid and Sigrist 3-axis gyroscopes were used in the, RAE designed, guidance system for the Black Knight rocket. As well as flying instrumentation the company also developed a pilot selection tool. The Reid Reaction Apparatus was a device which recorded the reaction times of trainee pilots when centralizing the a set of controls in a mock-up cockpit. Depending upon the results trainees were then graded as good, average or inferior. This device was in use during the 1930s at some RAF flying schools. Flying training In 1935, Reid and Sigrist successfully applied to run one of the new Civilian Flying Training Schools, being created as part of the RAF Expansion Scheme to train new service pilots. At time the company did not possess an airfield and so a rapid countrywide search for a suitable site was undertaken, which identified Desford Aerodrome as a potential location. Rapid negotiations enabled the company to purchase the airfield and also some surrounding farmland. Development of the aerodrome was carried out by En-Tout- Cas Ltd, of Syston, whilst new building work was undertaken by Fairby Construction Company Ltd. A mere three months later, on 13 December 1935, the new Flying Training School was officially opened by the Minister of State for Air, Viscount Swinton of Masham. The aircraft chosen for use at the school was the De Havilland D.H. 82A Tiger Moth of which there were initially 17, later increased to 21. In 1937 the school was expanded to accommodate training of RAF Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) pilots and was renamed No. 7 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School (E&RFTS;). A year later activities increased even further with the establishment of No. 3 Civilian Air Navigation School (CANS) at Desford. With the declaration of war in September 1939 these training unit were placed on a war footing under RAF control, and all reserves were mobilised. This was reflected in a change of titles to No.7 Elementary Training Flying School (EFTS) and No. 3 Air Observation Navigation School (AONS) respectively. In 1938 Reid and Sigrist was awarded a further contract to operate No.21 EFTS at Stapleford Aerodrome in Essex and No. 28 E&RFTS; at Meir Aerodrome (Stoke-on-Trent). No.21 E&RFTS; was formed on 1 January 1938 and No. 28 E&RFTS; on 1 August 1938. Both schools were disbanded on 3 September 1939. Aircraft design R.S.3 Desford In 1937 the company formed an aviation division at the New Malden, Surrey factory site.Gunston 1993, p. 250. The first design was for a twin-engined advanced training aircraft, the R.S.1 \\"Snargasher\\", which first flew from Desford in 1939. However no production orders were forthcoming and the R.S.1 was eventually relegated to communication duties for the company, based at Desford. The only other company design to fly was the R.S.3 'Desford'. A similar, but more refined design to the R.S.1, it first flew in July 1945 at Desford. Like its predecessor the R.S.3 did not attract a production order. However, the sole prototype did receive a new lease of life in 1949 when it was purchased by the Air Council for experiments investigating the prone position pilot concept. After conversion for the experimental work it was given the company designation R.S.4 and named 'Bobsleigh'. * R.S.1 Snargasher * R.S.3 Desford Aircraft repair During World War II Reid and Sigrist was one of the companies incorporated into the Civilian Repair Organisation set up by the British Air Ministry to co-ordinate the repair of damaged RAF aircraft. This work was carried out at the Desford site. The initial contract covered the repair of Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat turret fighter, with the first airframe being delivered to Desford in January 1940. This was later followed by an additional contract to convert the obsolete Defiants into the TT target towing version of the aircraft. Reid and Sigrist also undertook repairs of RAF Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters and also signed contracts to repair and convert North American B-25 Mitchell bombers. Work on Defiant airframes finished in June 1945 and the last Mitchells left Desford in November the same year. Cameras After the Second World War, the company was requested by the British government to produce the Reid camera based on the Leica patents and drawings which had been seized by the Allies. The first camera went on general sale in 1951 and the company produced cameras until 1964. * Reid III ‚Äì based on the Leica III series with production of about 1,600 cameras from 1951. * Reid I ‚Äì a simplified version and similar to the Leica E on sale from 1958, with a production run of about 500 mainly to the British military. * Reid II ‚Äì a proposed model announced in 1959, a Reid III without the slower speeds.

FIM integrates with Active Directory and Exchange Server to provide identity synchronization, certificate management, user password resets and user provisioning from a single interface. Part of the Microsoft Identity and Access Management platform product line, FIM superseded Microsoft Identity Lifecycle Manager (ILM), and was known as ILM 2 during development. ILM 2007 was created by merging Microsoft Identity Integration Server 2003 (MIIS) and Certificate Lifecycle Manager (CLM). FIM 2010 utilizes Windows Workflow Foundation concepts, using transactional workflows to manage and propagate changes to a user's state-based identity. This is in contrast to most of the transaction-based competing products that do not have a state- based element. Administrators not only can create workflows with the web-based GUI of ILM 2 portal but also include more complex workflows designed outside of the portal by importing XAML files FIM 2010 R2 (Release 2) was released in June 2012 and has extra capabilities: * Improved Self-service Password Reset which supports all current web browsers * Role Based Access Control (RBAC) via the acquisition of BHOLD Software * Improvement to the Reporting engine via the System Center Service Manager and MS SQL Server reporting Services (SSRS) * A WebServices Connector to connect to SAP ECC 5/6, Oracle PeopleSoft, and Oracle eBusiness * Improvements in the areas of performance, simplified deployment and troubleshooting, better documentation, and more language support.

Its Turkish side is also known as Mount Kel ('). Rising from a narrow coastal plain, Jebel Aqra is a mariners' landmark which gathers thunderstorms. The cult site is still represented by a huge mound of ashes and debris, wide and deep, of which only the first have been excavated. The researchers only reached as far as the Hellenistic strata before the site was closed, as it lies in a Turkish military zone on its border with Syria. History Jebel Aqra has a long history as a sacred mountain. The Hurrians called it and considered it the home of their storm god Teshub. The Hittites continued his worship, celebrating Teshub's victory over the sea in the Song of Kumarbi found in their capital Hattusa. They also celebrated the mountain in its own right, naming it as a divine guarantor on their treaties and observing rites in its honor. The ancient port of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra) lies to its south. Texts discovered there in the 1920s, including the Baal Cycle, showed its residents considered the peak of (Akkadian, Ugaritic, & Phoenician: ·π¢apƒÅnu) to house the lapis and silver palace of their storm god Ba øal ( \\"The Lord\\") and his sister  øAnat. Ba øal is now often identified with Hadad and his variations understood as local cults. The form Ba øal Zephon was worshipped widely: his temple at Ugarit held a sandstone relief dedicated to him by a royal scribe in Egypt and the king of Tyre called on him as a divine witness on a treaty with the emperor of Assyria in 677 . It appears in the Hebrew Scriptures as (). In ancient Canaanite religion, Mount Sapan was sometimes accounted as the home of all the gods, not only Ba øal and his sister. As Mount Zaphon, it appears in that role in the Hebrew Scriptures' Book of Isaiah, along with the Mount of the Congregation.. From its importance and its position at the northern end of Canaan, it also became a metonym... and then the word for the direction \\"north\\" in the Hebrew language. Under various forms, worship continued through antiquity, when it was called (, Kasios; ; , Gassios Ler) and lay north of Posideium (modern Ras al-Bassit). Even closer, the earliest Hellenic foothold in the Levant lies at the beach on its northern flank at Al Mina. Here Euboeans and Cypriotes experienced some of their earliest on-site experience of northwest Semitic cultures, from the early eighth century BCE onwards. \\"The Hittite name persisted in neo-Hittite culture into the ninth century BC and so when Greeks settled on the north side of Mount Hazzi they continued to call its main peak 'Mount Kasios'\\", Lane Fox points out, observing that it was the Mount Olympus of the Near East.Lane Fox 2009:246; these cultural connections are the theme of Lane Fox's book. The cult of the god of the mountain was transferred, by interpretatio graeca, to Zeus Kasios, the \\"Zeus of Mount Kasios\\", similar to Ras Kouroun in the Sinai. Tiles from the Greco-Roman sanctuary at the site, stamped with the god's name, were reused in the Christian monastery that came to occupy the eastern, landward slopes of Kazios.Lane Fox 2009:246, noting H. Seyrig in W. Djobadze, Archaeological Investigations in the Region West of Antioch and the Orontes, 1986. Turkish side The slopes of Jebel Aqra along the Syria-Turkey borderline on the Mediterranean Sea When kings and emperors climbed Mount Kasios to sacrifice at its peak sanctuary, it was a notable cultural occasion. Seleucus I Nicator sought there the advice of Zeus in locating his foundation, a Seleuceia (one of many) on the coast. Coins struck there as late as the first century BCE still show the city's emblem, the thunderbolt, sometimes placed upon the cushion of a throne. In the winter of 114/15 CE Trajan was spared in a major earthquake that struck Antioch; commemorative coins were struck featuring the shrine of Zeus Kasios, with its pointed roof on pillars, and a representation of its rounded sacred stone, or betyl.Lane Fox 2009:248f. Trajan's adoptive son Hadrian accompanied him; he returned in 130 CE to scale the mountain at night, no doubt, Lane Fox remarks, to witness the rising of the sun, visible for several minutes from the peak, while the land below lay still in darkness; it was said later that a thunderbolt at the peak struck the animal he was about to sacrifice. In spring 363 the last pagan emperor, Julian, scaled the mountain, where he had an epiphanic vision of Zeus Kasios, according to his friend and correspondent Libanius. Greek theophoric names Kassiodora and Kassiodorus,See Cassiodorus, born in Magna Graecia, who bears the name in its Romanized form. equally a \\"gift of Kasios\\", recall a vow of one or both parents made to ensure fertile conception.Lane Fox 2009:248, notes also Kassi-opeia, whose daughter Andromeda was exposed to a sea-monster further along the coast, at Joppa. Christian hermits were drawn to the mountain; Barlaam challenged its demons by founding a monastery near the treeline on its eastern slopes, and Simeon Stylites the Younger stood for forty years on a pillar near its northern flanks until his death in 592.

In its modern usage, it refers to Catalans with recent heritage from other Spanish-speaking parts of Spain. The word is used solely in the context of internal migration. As of 1999 it was estimated that over 60% of Catalans descended from 20th century migrations from other parts of Spain.https://elpais.com/diario/1999/10/02/catalunya/938826452_850215.html and over 1.1 million Catalans are of Andalusian origin alone.https://elpais.com/diario/1999/10/02/catalunya/938826452_850215.html Historical context Between 1950 and 1975 a second wave of a million and half immigrants arrived from other less developed parts of Spain, particularly Andalusia and Extremadura, where hunger and economic hardship was prevalent. These new immigrants represented 44% of the total growth of the Catalan population during this period.Ajeno i Cosp, 1993 This immigration resulted from the high demand for cheap labour resulting from the new economic policy of \\"desarrollismo\\" of Francoist Spain, which involved huge investments in sectors such as transport and infrastructure primarily aiming to stimulate the tourism, heavy industry and new industries such as the car industry with the creation of the SEAT car company and the building of its factory in the free- zone of Barcelona in 1953. Such industries, the availability of jobs and higher salaries in the Barcelona region would stimulate two decades of immigration from rural areas throughout Spain - a phenomenon comparable to other large scale international migrations throughout history due to the volume of people and geographic distances involved. Usage of term and discrimination during the 20th century This wave of immigration led to a new rise in xenophobia in Catalonia, with the generalization of the derogatory term \\"xarnego\\" (Charnego, in Spanish), to refer to these new Catalans. The term, originally meaning \\"mongrel\\", was historically used in southern France to refer to French people mixed with Spanish/Catalan heritage. Upon its introduction in Catalonia, it referred to immigrants from non-Catalan speaking regions of Spain - in other words, a foreigner to Catalonia. Eventually it also took on a linguistic sense referring to those Catalans who do not speak Catalan, without losing its ethnic, and classist connotations. The Catalan language thus became an important criterion to distinguish between \\"them\\" (the immigrants) and \\"us\\" (the Catalans). Franciscos Candel describes the situation in \\"Los otros catalanes (1964) and later defines himself as a Charnego in the senate (1979).

History The main industries are tourism and fishing. Weligama is a popular tourist destination and hosts several boutique hotels including an off shore islet known as Taprobane, which houses a villa constructed by the French Count de Mauny, and is currently owned by Geoffrey Dobbs. It was the birthplace of the scholar monk Weligama Sri Sumangala. Weligama was significantly affected by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, with 15% of the area destroyed, with over 2,200 houses damaged or washed away, and 469 reported deaths. There are a number of sites of historical importance within Weligama and its vicinity, including a high bas-relief statue of Bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara, carved into the surrounding rock, between the 6th-9th century AD. It is known locally as Kusta Raja Gala or Rock of the Leper King and is thought to represent a king smitten with a skin disease (prossibly leprosy \\"kusta\\"), who was prompted in a vision to take coconut pulp and water for three months as a cure. When he fulfilled the vision his health was restored, he then commissioned his figure to be carved on the rock commemorating this miraculous cure. This sculpture is believed to be all that is left of the old Agrabodhi Vihara that was located there. Weligama is recognised for its beeralu lace-making. First introduced by the Portuguese in the 16th century lace-making has remained a traditional handicraft along the coastal area of Weligama, with a number of households producing crochet and tatting lace. The area is also famous for its distinct stilt fishermen, who erect a single pole in the chest-deep water on the beach, just few meters off-shore, where they perch on a cross bar and using bamboo fishing rods cast their lines out beyond the surf break to catch small fish.

This now-illegal pitch consisted of scarring the ball to be able to achieve unnatural movement.\\"Emery ball - BR Bullpen\\". baseball- reference.com. He learned this trick while playing in the minors. Kahler had a relatively large stature for a pitcher; he was listed as about 6 feet tall and weighed approximately 183 pounds. This was sometimes a disadvantage for him. His large stature delayed his pitching delivery, making base stealing much easier for base runners. Kahler joined the majors during a period known as the dead-ball era, a time when pitching dominated and batting was more strategic. In 1911 he was awarded a $600 bonus for finishing the season with an even or above pitching record. Kahler had a confrontation with Detroit Tigers outfielder Ty Cobb in the 1912 season. Kahler hit Cobb with a pitch early in the season, infuriating Cobb and causing him to plan his retaliation. On April 22, 1912, Cobb and Kahler faced off again. This time Cobb hit a grounder to first base. As Kahler ran to cover the first base bag, Cobb tried to injure him with his cleats but missed in his attempt and fell to ground. Kahler, knowing Cobb's intention, stood over him and threatened to \\"put him out for the rest of the season\\" if he did it again. Kahler was known for his toughness on the mound. He played through a slipped tendon in his throwing arm for 14 innings against Toledo. In one game, he knocked down a line drive with his bare hand and was also hit in the ankle and shoulder by hard hit balls yet still pitched 11 innings against Minneapolis. Hall of Fame player and manager Connie Mack described Kahler as \\"a man who can win against odds; one who will live through a lot of hits and come out with a victory.\\" From Cleveland, he was sold to Portland of the Pacific Coast League where he immediately became the highest paid player in the league. He bounced around several minor league teams, going 13-7, until he was released by the Columbus Senators on June 11, 1917. Post-baseball career When his baseball career ended, Kahler enrolled in the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri. While pursuing his degree, Kahler also managed the school's baseball team and assisted in coaching the basketball and football teams. He also was the president of the Student Athletic Association, president of the Study Body of the National Osteopathic Organization, business manager of the annual student publication and class valedictorian. He graduated in 1921. He also enrolled in the School of Osteopathy in Detroit where he met his wife. He practiced osteopathy for the remainder of his life. One of his most famous practices was his treatment of fellow baseball player Marvin Goodwin. Though strong and athletic, Kahler still suffered from chronic nephritis and diabetes, leading to his death on February 7, 1924 in Battle Creek, Virginia at the age of 34.\\"Too Young To Die\\". thedeadballera.com.

Crimidine was originally known by its product name, Castrix. It was originally produced in the 1940s by the conglomerate, IG Farben. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. It is also no longer used in the United States as a rodenticide, but is still used to this day in other countries. Mechanism of action Crimidine is a highly reactive compound. The main mechanism of toxicity with crimidine is that it inhibits vitamin B6, which is used in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids. This is due to the pyrimidine ring that both compounds contain. Although, the exact mechanism of how crimidine antagonizes vitamin B6 is unknown. Another mechanism of toxicity with crimidine is due to its deactivating effect on acetylcholinesterase 500px The serine residue, which is part of the acetylcholinesterase, acts a nucleophile and eventually replaces the C-Cl bond that is present in crimidine. Unlike with acetylcholine, the resulting serine-crimidine bond does not hydrolyze, permanently deactivating the enzyme Toxicity Crimidine is a fast acting convulsant, with an LD50 of 5 mg/kg. Earliest symptoms can develop within 20‚Äì40 minutes. These symptoms can include burning, irritation, and itching at the site of exposure or intake. Following these initial symptoms, convulsions follow and can be fatal. Low dose, long-term exposure can lead to damage in the central nervous system, resulting in muscle stiffness, restlessness, and sensitivity to light and noise. Although crimidine is fast acting, it is also quickly secreted and can pass through the system in less than 24 hours.. intravenous vitamin B6 should be given as soon as poisoning is suspected  References  Category:Convulsants Category:Pesticides Category:Pyrimidines Category:Chloroarenes Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Chloropyrimidines Category:Vitamin B6 antagonists Category:Neurotoxins Category:Dimethylamino compounds ","title":"Crimidine"},{"id":"20841164","text":"Paul Otto Kardow (September 19, 1915 ‚Äì April 27, 1968), nicknamed \\"Tex\\", was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for one season.

It is located near the head of Weisdale Voe on the west of the island, a twenty-minute drive from the main town of Lerwick. History Weisdale Mill was built in 1855 and was Shetland's largest corn mill. The Weisdale Mill was a busy working mill for many years until the early 1930s. Crofters and farmers came from some considerable distance to get their oats and corn ground into meal and flour. With very little in the way of transport people walked long distances with their crops which then had to be left at the mill and collected at a later date. Some crofters came up the Weidale Voe by boat as far as they could and then walked the short distance to the mill. In 1936 it was bought by a local farmer (Tony Anderson) and was converted into a slaughter house and butcher shop. The slaughter house was in the basement(where the cafe is now). The ground floor was used for the butcher shop. The top floor was used for storage and was often used to salt sheepskins before they were sold. The butcher shop and slaughter house were very busy particularly during the war years when large numbers of men from the forces were stationed at Scatsta. They also ran a large walk-in butcher van which visited many areas of Shetland daily selling beef and lamb. During the war the mill was actually hit by enemy fire and some bullets came in the back door which was open at the time. Fortunately no one was hurt. In 1982 it ceased to function as a butcher shop and slaughter house. It stood empty for some time but after extensive renovations, completed in 1994, the site is now managed by Shetland Arts and contains the Bonhoga Gallery (an art gallery whose name means \\"my spiritual home\\"), the Mill Cafe and a gift shop.

Resulting from a suggestion by Norman Dello Joio, the Young Composers Project (YCP) was founded in 1959. Funded by the Ford Foundation and administered by the National Music Council, the project placed young composers (age 35 and under) in public school systems as composers-in- residence. From 1959 to 1962, 31 composers participated in the project. They discovered that many music educators were not prepared to deal with contemporary music. In 1962 the YCP was elevated from a pilot program to one of the ten major projects of the Ford Foundation. The Music Educators National Conference (MENC) submitted a proposal to the Ford Foundation that the project be expanded to include seminars and workshops on contemporary music in the schools, and that pilot programs be established in public schools. In 1963 the Ford Foundation awarded MENC a grant of $1,380,000 to organize the Contemporary Music Project for Creativity in Music Education. YCP continued under the title Composers in Public Schools. By 1968, 46 more composers had been matched with public school systems. One of the first activities of the Contemporary Music Project was the establishment of 16 workshops and seminars held at various colleges throughout the country to help teachers better understand contemporary music. Six pilot projects were established in schools, including the Baltimore, San Diego, and Farmingdale, New York systems. In 1965 the Seminar on Comprehensive Musicianship was held at Northwestern University. Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Arlie House in Warrenton, Virginia to discuss means of evaluating Comprehensive Musicianship. The resultant document, Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education, offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies. In 1968 the Ford Foundation gave MENC a grant of $1,340,000 to administer the Contemporary Music Project for an additional five years. MENC contributed $50,000 per year. From 1968 to 1973 the Contemporary Music Project consisted of three programs: Professionals-in-Residence to Communities, the Teaching of Comprehensive Musicianship, and Complementary Activities.

It has several mechanisms of action, acting as a vasoconstrictor and calcium channel blocker, but is selectively toxic to rats and has relatively low toxicity to other species, due to a species specific action of opening the permeability transition pores in rat mitochondria. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.  History  In the early 1960s norbormide was developed to serve as a non-anticoagulant rat poison. During the 1970s, however, the utilization of this rodenticide decreased, since anticoagulant toxins seemed to be more effective against a wider range of rodents. NRB only kills rodents of the genus Rattus (R. norvegicus, R. exulans and R. rattus) and happens to be moderately innocent to other rodents and mammals. Although many view its selective feature as a disadvantage, scientists of Landcare Research in New Zealand search for ways to improve this rodenticide and develop several analogues.  Structure and reactivity  Norbormide is an organic compound with the following systematic name: 5-(Œ±-hydroxy-Œ±-2-pyridylbenzyl)-7-(Œ±-2-pyridylbenzylidene)-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide. The structure consists of a norbornene ring, that is merged with an imide ring opposite to the double bond. One of the carbon atoms of this double bond is connected to another carbon atom, that is bound to a hydroxyl, a pyridyl and a phenyl group. The bridging carbon of the norbornene ring is double bonded to a carbon atom to which a pyridyl and a phenyl group are attached.Nilsson, B., Steroxhemistry of an Inactive Racemate of Norbormide - A Selective Rat Toxicant. Acta Chemica Scandinavica, 1968. 22(2). There are eight possible stereoisomers of norbormide. On the exocyclic double bond there is cis/trans- isomerism. The imide ring can have an endo or an exo orientation and for the hydroxyl group erythro and threo isomers are possible. The vasoconstrictor properties of norbormide turn out to be very dependent on stereochemistry. Only the endo isomers are toxic in rats and the threo isomers are ten times as potent as the erythro isomers. The cis-endo-threo isomer has been found to be the isomer with the most potent vasoconstrictor properties.Brimble M.A. , e.a., 2004. In this structure there is a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the adjacent pyridine ring. Studies reveal that norbormide toxicity is sensitive to structural changes, in almost all cases the toxicity decreases due to structural changes. Only substitution of the NH proton of the imide with certain groups could give toxic activity comparable to norbormide itself.  Synthesis  Since NRB causes bait shyness in rats and rats therefore often only take sub lethal doses, studies have been performed in search of NRB derivatives that are more toxic than NRB itself. In this case, substitutions have taken only place at the imide-group of NRB. The common structure for each of this derivatives is shown in figure 4.1, where R is a changeable group. At position R, different hydrocarbon groups were placed. None of them were more toxic than NRB, so a different strategy was tried. In a second study there has been looked at different ring analogues of NRB. None of these different ring analogues were proven more toxic than NRB. Another type of reaction that has been studied, is the making of prodrugs. These prodrugs were synthesized in order to overcome bait shyness. The goal of the study was creating a prodrug that tasted better than NRB and was, once it had entered the body, metabolized to NRB. Three different starting structures were used, seen in figures 4.2;4.3 and 4.4. In figures 4.5 and 4.6 it is shown how the starting structures were synthesized out of NRB. Only compound 19 (figure 4.7) was promising, because it delayed to onset of symptoms and it is more palatable to rats (shown in figure 4.8), but there has to be some more research on this compound before it can be used.  Available forms  Different stereoisomers = During the synthesis of norbormide, five of the eight possible stereoisomers are formed in a significant amount, namely all the endo stereoisomers and the cis-exo- stereoisomer. Most of the potency of norbormide is due to the trans-endo-threo (LD50 = 0.50 mg/kg (rat)) and the cis-endo-threo isomers (LD50 = 0.15 mg/kg (rat)). These two isomers form approximately half of the commercial mixture. = Derivatives = Studies have been done in which was searched for derivative compounds of norbormide that are more toxic. Addition or substitution of miscellaneous groups never turned out to give considerably more toxic compounds. In most cases compounds were obtained, being significantly less toxic. A problem of using norbormide as a rodenticide is bait shyness, this means that after the rat eats a little bit of it, the rat gets ill and avoids the toxin then, also the taste is supposed to be bad. Recent studies have been looking for prodrugs of norbormide that release the toxicant slowly and thereby delay the toxic effects. Prodrugs have been found that appear to have these properties. Subsequent studies need to be done for refinement before usage eventually might be possible.  Mechanism of action  The mechanism for the vasoconstrictor effect is predicted to be mediated by the modulation of calcium influx. This influx of calcium can leads to contraction in the myocytes. Probably the influx of calcium is mediated by the phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors, in rat peripheral artery myocytes. Other research of Sergio Bova et all. has shown that in respiratory, urinary and gastrointestinal smooth muscle there was no contraction by norbormide. The symptoms of norbormide were very similar to the better known Ca2+ entry blocker agents. Therefore, norbormide is not only species specific but in addition tissue specific. Norbormide has a strong effect on the mitochondria in the cell. Therefore, norbormide transfer through the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial space. At this location or at the matrix it induce the permeability transition pore (PTP). This PTP is an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) channel, whose opening leads to an increasing permeability for ions with an exclusion size of about 1500 Da. The transport of norborimide comes from a translocation protein (TSPO) also known as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. The TSPO is selective for the norbormide transport in rats. In figure 6.1 shows the crucial alignment of rat, mouse and guinea pig LPSO. There are a few differences in amino acids, but the position of 113 is very similar in between the species and other species like dogs, humans and chickens. Where the rat have at position 113 a methionine (M) others species have a leucine amino acid. This results probably for the different amount of transport between rat and other species.  Metabolism  A compound's toxicological property has been linked to metabolic pathways, which often differ in various species. For that reason the correlation between toxicity and metabolism has been observed to obtain a clear insight into cellular metabolism, both in vitro and in vivo conditions. = In vitro experiment = In vitro studies on liver preparations from rats and other rodents revealed that hydroxylation is the major process during the metabolism of NRB. Furthermore, the metabolites between the sexes of the rat seemed to deviate from one another. First and foremost when NRB had been incubated with the liver S9 fraction, a few metabolic products were observed. The S9 fraction has been defined as \\"Supernatant fraction obtained from an organ (usually liver) homogenate by centrifuging at 9000 g for 20 minutes in a suitable medium; this fraction contains cytosol and microsomes.\\" The S9 fraction consists of two components: the microsomes component which incorporates cytochrome P450 isoforms (phase I metabolism) and the cytosolic component which contains transferases (phase II metabolism). A mixture of four active endo-isomers of NRB (U, V, W en Y) formed four major metabolites in rat liver S9 and cytosolic preparations after incubation. The isomers are separately not pure compounds, but research with pure V isomer and a mixture of U and V isomers pointed out that each isomer undergoes metabolism to be formed into a single product in rat. Mass spectrometry confirmed that all metabolites had a mass consistent with a hydroxylated metabolite of NRB. Because female rats are more sensitive to NRB than the male species, the level of metabolites are higher in females than in males. The same metabolites were found in guinea pigs, although the levels of metabolism in these rodents are considerately lower compared to those in rats. In mice two metabolites were detected: one metabolite of the V isomer (V1) which was also found in the rat preparations and another, new metabolite of the V isomer (V2). (Figure 7.1) These data acknowledge the link between the susceptibility to NRB and the production of different types and different levels of metabolites. = In vivo experiment = After collecting blood from rats 10 and 30 minutes after oral administration, plasma and red blood cell fractions were analyzed in search for either parent compounds or hydroxylated metabolites. However, neither were found, which either means that the absorption did not take place or the compounds underwent a quick clearance from the body. Whole blood samples certainly showed traces of the parent compound and a metabolite (M3) with molecular mass of 226, in samples from both female and male rats. The level in which this metabolite occurred, appeared to be once again higher in the female rats than in the male species. M3 was not found in any other rat or mouse tissue. This suggests that M3 may be formed by gut microflora in rats. After NRB had orally been administered, an examination of both rat and mouse liver revealed traces of the parent compound. Comparing the metabolite levels in both sexes and species, a significantly higher amount was discovered in the female rats than in the male rats or the mice. HPLC chromatograms liver preparations from female of and male rats, display the detection of four metabolites (U1, V1, M1, M2). (Figure 7.2) Mass spectrometry had been used to identify these and easily so, because the hydroxylated metabolites were +16 amu higher than NRB. These studies confirmed that the metabolites were identical to those found in the in vitro preparations. The metabolites were not found in mouse liver preparations. Moreover, neither NRB parent compound nor its metabolites were discovered in the heart after oral administration in rats as well as mice. This lack of detectable metabolites implies that NRB is able to induce a lethal effect at extremely low levels.  Adverse effects & effects on animals  Adverse effects = The effects of norbormide are caused by the endo-isomers, but the exo-isomers R, T and X showed no contractile effects on the rat arterio smooth muscle. There was only a relaxing effect on the muscle. In animal studies of Rozkowksi, he showed that the effects that are caused by NRB are irreversible. Another study has shown that there were respiratory depressions after the cardiovascular effects in the rats which were treated with norbormide in vivo. = Effects on animals = NRB is specifically toxic to rats, but it's relatively harmless to other rodents and mammals. In all animals tested and also in the rat aorta and extravascular smooth muscle tissue, NRB exhibits vasorelaxant properties in the arteries. Another effect of NRB is stimulation of corticosterone and aldosterone production in both rat and mice adrenal gland by enhancing late steps of steroid-hormone synthesis. Toxicity The unique toxicity of NRB has been determined by performing animal experiments by using several species of rodents. The toxic dose was orally administered. In the table the defined LD50 data illustrate the compound‚Äôs specific toxicity. Rats, particularly the female species, experience even after administration of a small amount of NRB the effects of the toxin. NRB is toxic to guinea pigs and mouse either, but to a lesser extent. There is no reliable information available about LD50 values in humans. Although NRB is a rodenticide, and especially toxic for brown rats, human beings could be exposed to NRB through inhalation and dermal contact. Exposure Acute toxic level Oral LD50 (mg/kg) * Rat (male) 15 * Rat (female) 5 * Guinea pig 620 * Mouse 2250 = Acute toxicity studies in rats = A lethal dose of NRB to rats causes behavioural changes which look a lot like the signs associated to cyanide toxicity. The first indications of the NRB toxicity present themselves about ten minutes after administration. At first the rats start showing signs of increased motor activity and incoordination. Subsequently, the rats' hind extremities weaken and become ashen. Their breathing begins to be laboured and within a short period of time the rats suffer from series of convulsive movements. The spasm is followed by death, which occurs within 30 minutes in albino laboratory rats and with two hours in wild animals. After examining isolated rat hearts in Langendorff preparations, a frequent in vitro technique, NRB also turned out to cause severe species- selective toxic effects on rat heart. 2-10 ¬µg NRB had been injected into the coronary vessel which resulted in a reduction of blood flow, attended with decreased cardiac contraction and a decreased heart rate. The rat hearts started beating quite irregularly. These irreversible effects weren't marked in the heart muscle (myocardium) as perhaps expected, but straight in the coronary arteries. Additionally, it was confirmed that rats which were subjected to NRB treatment suffered from hyperventilation followed by cardiovascular effects. Recent studies present NRB's ability to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in isolated rat preparations. Cell apoptosis and necrosis are (amongst other things) regulated by MPT pores. It is understandable that such an abnormity in the mitochondrial membranes bring about issues in the cellular metabolism of the poisoned animal. =Toxicity studies in mammals and birds= The members of the genus Rattus are highly sensitive to NRB, but other animals experience no toxic effects. Upon closer examination a 1000 mg/kg dose of norbormide didn‚Äôt bring forth any toxic signs when orally administered to cats, chickens, dogs, monkeys, mice, swine or birds. This has been confirmed in the table below. So it is safe to say that NRB is relatively harmless to nonrat species.

On 6 August 2005, the Tuninter ATR 72 ditched into the Mediterranean Sea about 18 miles (29 km) from the city of Palermo. Sixteen of the 39 people on board died. The accident resulted from fuel exhaustion due to the installation of fuel quantity indicators designed for the ATR 42, in the larger ATR 72. It was also Tuninter's first fatal accident in the 14-year history of the company. History The flight was under the command of 45-year-old Captain Chafik Al Gharbi (), a skilled and experienced pilot with a total of 7,182 flight hours. The co-pilot, 28-year-old Ali Kebaier Al-Aswad (), had logged 2,431 flight hours. Both the captain and co-pilot were well- acquainted with the ATR 72, having accrued 5,582 hours and 2,130 hours in it, respectively. The aircraft, an ATR 72‚Äì202, had its fuel quantity indicator (FQI) replaced the night before the flight, but technicians inadvertently installed a FQI designed for the ATR 42, a similar but smaller airplane with smaller fuel tanks. Ground crews and the flight engineer, relying on the incorrect readings from the newly installed FQI, loaded the aircraft with an inadequate amount of fuel for the flight. On the flight from Bari to Djerba, both engines cut out in mid-flight. The aircraft's right engine failed at 23,000 feet (7,000 metres). The aircraft began to descend to 17,000 feet, but 100 seconds after the right engine failure, the left engine also failed at 21,900 feet (6,700 metres). The flight crew did not detect the fuel exhaustion because the incorrectly installed ATR 42 gauge indicated an adequate amount of fuel in the tanks, even after all of the usable fuel had been consumed. After the engine failure, the Captain requested an emergency landing in Palermo, Sicily. The crew tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to restart the engines as they navigated to Palermo. The ATR glided for 16 minutes, but was unable to reach the runway and the plane was forced to ditch into the sea, northeast of Palermo International Airport at the speed of . The aircraft broke into three sections upon impact. The entire aircraft floated for some time after the crash, but only the central fuselage and the wings remained floating. Patrol boats from Palermo arrived 46 minutes after the ditching and began the rescue and recovery. Passengers Green icons indicate survivors, red marks fatalities. The flightdeck casualty was an engineer who was flying as a passenger but who was called to the flight deck by the Captain. One of the four crew members died‚Äîa flight attendant‚Äîand 15 out of the 35 passengers died. The engineer who died was not a part of the flight crew, but had been called to the flight deck by the pilot and copilot after both engines failed; because he was not officially part of the crew, his death was accounted for as a passenger death. The flight's other flight attendant survived. All of the paying passengers were Italian, while the crew and the engineer were Tunisian. Autopsies indicated that many of the dead succumbed to the impact. Autopsies established that eight passengers who received injuries during the impact were unable to escape from the aircraft due to their injuries and ultimately drowned. Most of the survivors were seated in the rear of the ATR 72, while most of the passengers who died were in the front.\\"Ditch the Plane.\\" (\\"Falling Fast\\") Mayday. Three dead passengers, including the engineer who tried to help the plane's crew, were found on the seabed. The ANSV stated that the cause of death of these passengers was difficult to determine. Investigation The investigation revealed several factors leading to the crash. * First, the investigation examined how the incorrect fuel quantity indicator (FQI) came to be installed on the plane. The final report on the crash notes that during a flight the day prior to the incident, the Captain (who was also flying during the incident) became aware that the FQI on the aircraft dashboard was not working correctly and reported the problem. That evening, the FQI was replaced, but with an FQI that was intended for the ATR 42, a different model of aircraft. The correct FQI was not found because its part number had been entered into the database in a different format than was searched for, and the inventory database mistakenly indicated that the ATR 42 part could be used on both models of aircraft. The FQI for the two aircraft models have different marking on the faceplate, though the difference was evidently not noticed. * Second, the investigation examined the fueling of the plane. The day of the incident, the aircraft was fueled for the flights from Tunis to Bari and Bari to Djerba based on calculations based on incorrect readings from the FQI. Because of differences in the shape of the fuel tanks, the incorrect FQI indicated a larger volume of fuel than the tanks actually held. When fueling the aircraft in Tunis, neither the refueling operator nor the flight engineer noticed the difference between the amount of fuel loaded and the change in reading on the FQI. The investigation also found that when departing from Tunis on the Tunis-Bari route taken before Flight 1153, the captain noticed by reading his cockpit displays that the aircraft's fuel level seemed to have increased overnight, but did not find a corresponding refueling slip. However, he accepted the explanation that the slip had been kept by a previous crew, though in fact the aircraft had not been flown nor refueled since the day before. Because the aircraft had been fueled for two flights, the flight from Tunis to Bari was uneventful. In Bari, the plane took additional fuel to a level where the incorrect indicator showed 2,700 kilograms. The correct indicator would have shown that there were just 540 kilograms in the tanks when departing for the Bari-Djerba route, insufficient to reach the destination. * Finally, the investigation examined the flight after the engines had failed. During an engine flame out crews must feather the propellers to reduce the drag on the blades so the plane can glide a further distance. While the propellers of the aircraft were found fully feathered after the crash, the crew did not feather them, because they were attempting to restart the engines. Furthermore, as a result of their efforts to restart the engines, the crew did not glide the aircraft at the optimum speed to extend gliding distance. Simulation results suggest that handled optimally, the ATR could have reached Palermo with the tail wind of that day. Two crews flew a simulator at ATR's facility in France from the same starting conditions. By feathering the propellers and reducing the speed to the optimal gliding speed, one made a landing at Palermo and one ditched one mile short of the runway. The fundamental difference was that the simulator pilots knew what was happening and responded accordingly. In contrast, the Captain of the Tuninter ATR focused initially on trying to restart the engines in the hope they would respond, not knowing that this was impossible as the aircraft was out of fuel. When the engines could not be restarted, the Captain focused on selecting a place to ditch the aircraft. Unlike the simulator pilots, Gharbi had a lack of instruments and experienced radio interruptions. The final investigative report suggested that airlines train their pilots to deal with unusual situations. Aftermath Tuninter compensated each family of a victim or survivor with ‚Ç¨20,000. On 7 September 2005 the Italian government banned Tuninter from flying into Italian airspace.\\"Human Error Is Common Thread in Spate of Air Crashes.\\" Air Safety Week. 19 September 2005. 1. Tuninter rebranded itself as Sevenair and had scheduled flights into Italy again as of 2007. =Criminal conviction= In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, Chafik Garbi, to 10 years in prison for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane's engines stopped functioning, Garbi succumbed to panic, started praying, and failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Falcone‚ÄìBorsellino Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Six others, including the co-pilot as well as the chief operating officer of Tuninter Airlines, were sentenced to between eight and 10 years. As of 2009 they had not started serving time, pending the appeals process. The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations protested the flight crews' criminal sentences, calling the investigation \\"injustice\\" and the sentences \\"flawed\\". The criminal investigation and subsequent sentencing caused considerable controversy in Tunisia and, to a lesser extent, in the civil aviation world. The official investigation was accused of being one-sided and of ignoring mistakes made by Italian air traffic controllers. Unedited cockpit recordings leaked to the public demonstrated the Palermo air traffic controller as having a poor grasp of English, failing to assign the distressed flight its own radio frequency on which to communicate, and giving the pilots incomplete and/or useless information about their position. These cockpit recordings were omitted from the official investigation report.Otelli, Jean-Pierre: Erreurs de pilotage, Tome 4, pg.9‚Äì40 Dramatization The crash was featured in Season 7 of the Canadian made, internationally distributed documentary series Mayday, in the episode \\"Falling Fast\\".

Early life Beatty was born in 1881. In 1915, he graduated from the University of Toronto with a PhD and a dissertation entitled Extensions of Results Concerning the Derivatives of an Algebraic Function of a Complex Variable, with the help of his adviser, John Charles Fields. He was the first person to receive a PhD in mathematics from a Canadian university. In 1925 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1926, he published a problem in the American Mathematical Monthly, which formed the genesis for the Beatty sequence. University of Toronto Beatty was dean of the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Toronto, taking the position in 1934. The famous mathematician Richard Brauer was recruited by Beatty in 1935. He invited Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter to the University of Toronto with a position as an assistant professor, which Coxeter took; he remained in Toronto for the rest of his life. In June 1939, he was one of the founding members of the Committee of Teaching Staff. Beatty was appointed the 21st Chancellor of the University of Toronto in 1953, holding the position until 1959. He was associated with the university from 1911 to 1952, and a scholarship was established in his honor. He died in 1970. In an era when extremely few women received PhDs in mathematics, Beatty supervised the mathematical PhDs of Mary Fisher and Muriel Kennett Wales. Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Walter Kohn, a student at the university while Beatty was a dean, expressed his appreciation in 1998 to the dean when accepting the prize for his development of the density functional theory. In 1942, when Kohn could not access the university's chemistry buildings during World War II because of his German nationality, Beatty had helped him to enroll in the Mathematics Department at the University. Canadian Mathematical Society Beatty was one of the founders of the Canadian Mathematical Congress and was elected to serve as the first president of the congress in 1945. Under his presidency, the Canadian Mathematical Congress began to promote mathematical development in Canada. Beatty served as the president of the Canadian Mathematical Congress until 1978 at which point the congress was renamed the Canadian Mathematical Society to avoid further confusion with the quadrennial mathematical congresses.

It is located near the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern Great Barrier Reef, 93 km due north east of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, and 460 km north of the state capital Brisbane. The island is part of the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands, and is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of island and forms part of the Capricornia Cays National Park. It is also part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area.  General  Wreck Island is mainly formed from beach rock which is well developed along the southern beach. The island is situated on the south west end of a coral reef platform which is about 3.5 km by 1.5 km in size. The vegetation is similar to that on Tryon Island except that the Pisonia grandis forest is less well developed. Geomorphology and landscape The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.Hopley, D. (1982) The Geomorphology of the Great Barrier Reef ‚Äì Quaternary Development of Coral Reefs. Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., New York The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day. Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period; they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plain on which today's reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays. Wreck Island is a shingle cay and part of a platform reef.Fairbridge, R. W. 1950b. Recent and Pleistocene coral reefs of Australia. J. Geol. 58: 330‚Äì401  History Discovery= In 1803, Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship Albion was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group. Wreck Island itself was discovered at a similar date by Mathew Flinders when the ship he was in and one other sailed into it and were both wrecked. A third ship sailed on making no rescue attempt. Flinders, several officers and 12 sailors then rowed a small ship's boat down to Fraser Island and then down the coast to Sydney to summon help. During a second whaling voyage from England in Albion, he discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010163b.htm The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King RN initially in the Mermaid and later in the Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Price Blackwood in which was accompanied by the Bramble. The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. =Other uses= Wreck Island has been used for oil exploration and has a capped drill-hole dating from oil exploration activities which occurred over 30 years ago There is also a derelict hut at Wreck Island from when the island was used as a private residence. Current usesEcologyNatural= Green turtle rookeries are located at Wreck Island, West Fairfax Island, and West Hoskyn Islands; these are maintained in a natural condition, free from human disturbance.

In 1841, Blackwood was appointed to command the corvette HMS Fly in the first hydrographic survey commissioned by the Admiralty for exploring and charting the north-east Australian coast. The Fly, fitted with costly instruments, and carrying two scientists, Joseph Jukes, geologist, and John MacGillivray, zoologist, sailed from Falmouth in April 1842 with the cutter Bramble, under the charge of Lieutenant Charles Bampfield Yule. After a stop in Hobart Town from August to October, the two ships called at Sydney and began the survey in December 1842. In the next three years the Fly charted from Sandy Cape to Whitsunday Island, including Swain Reefs and Capricorn Islands and the broad passages between.

According to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism, a single point charge under acceleration will emit electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light. In some classical electron models a distribution of charges can however be accelerated so that no radiation is emitted. The modern derivation of these nonradiation conditions by Hermann A. Haus is based on the Fourier components of the current produced by a moving point charge. It states that a distribution of accelerated charges will radiate if and only if it has Fourier components synchronous with waves traveling at the speed of light.  History  Finding a nonradiating model for the electron on an atom dominated the early work on atomic models. In a planetary model of the atom, the orbiting point electron would constantly accelerate towards the nucleus, and thus according to the Larmor formula emit electromagnetic waves. In 1910 Paul Ehrenfest published a short paper on \\"Irregular electrical movements without magnetic and radiation fields\\" demonstrating that Maxwell's equations allow for the existence of accelerating charge distributions which emit no radiation. The need for a nonradiating classical electron was however abandoned in 1913 by the Bohr model of the atom, which postulated that electrons orbiting the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed angular momentum and energy would not radiate. Modern atomic theory explains these stable quantum states with the help of Schr√∂dinger's equation. In the meantime, our understanding of classical nonradiation has been considerably advanced since 1925. Beginning as early as 1933, George Adolphus Schott published a surprising discovery that a charged sphere in accelerated motion (such as the electron orbiting the nucleus) may have radiationless orbits. Admitting that such speculation was out of fashion, he suggests that his solution may apply to the structure of the neutron. In 1948, Bohm and Weinstein also found that charge distributions may oscillate without radiation; they suggest that a solution which may apply to mesons. Then in 1964, Goedecke derived, for the first time, the general condition of nonradiation for an extended charge-current distribution, and produced many examples, some of which contained spin and could conceivably be used to describe fundamental particles. Goedecke was led by his discovery to speculate: The nonradiation condition went largely ignored for many years. Philip Pearle reviews the subject in his 1982 article Classical Electron Models. A Reed College undergraduate thesis on nonradiation in infinite planes and solenoids appears in 1984. An important advance occurred in 1986, when Hermann Haus derived Goedecke's condition in a new way. Haus finds that all radiation is caused by Fourier components of the charge/current distribution that are lightlike (i.e. components that are synchronous with light speed). When a distribution has no lightlike Fourier components, such as a point charge in uniform motion, then there is no radiation. Haus uses his formulation to explain Cherenkov radiation in which the speed of light of the surrounding medium is less than c.

In 1839, the Ottoman Empire moved to reoccupy lands lost to Muhammad Ali in the First Turko-Egyptian War. The Ottoman Empire invaded Syria, but after suffering a defeat at the Battle of Nezib appeared on the verge of collapse. On 1 July, the Ottoman fleet sailed to Alexandria and surrendered to Muhammad Ali. Britain, Austria and other European nations, rushed to intervene and force Egypt into accepting a peace treaty. From September to November 1840, a combined naval fleet, made up of British and Austrian vessels, cut off Ibrahim's sea communications with Egypt, followed by the occupation of Beirut and Acre by the British. On 27 November 1840, the Convention of Alexandria took place. British Admiral Charles Napier reached an agreement with the Egyptian government, where the latter abandoned its claims to Syria and returned the Ottoman fleet. Origins The war was the climax of the long power-struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Pasha of Egypt, Mehmet Ali, which had reached a point of crisis that threatened to destabilize the whole of the Levant. On June 29, 1839 an invading Ottoman army (accompanied by Moltke the Elder) was destroyed in Syria by Mohamed Ali's general Ibrahim Pasha at the Battle of Nezib, putting him in possession of the whole of Syria. This threatened to place Constantinople itself and the rule of the entire Eastern Mediterranean within his grasp. A few days after the battle the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, died, leaving his Empire in the hands of his 16-year-old heir Abd√ºlmecid. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fleet had defected to Mohamed Ali. Britain, Russia and Austria were all pledged to support the tottering Ottoman Empire and to force Mehmet Ali (who had the support of France and Spain) to withdraw from Syria. Although the new Sultan's ministers moved to resolve the crisis by offering to cede the rule of Syria to Mehmet, the British, Austrian and Russian ambassadors forced them to rescind this offer and stand firm against him. There was even a possibility of war with France, who looked to Mehmet's success to increase its sphere of influence in the Near East. The English Historical Review No. 69 from January, 1903, has a letter Palmerston wrote to defend not notifying France about the date of the intervention.https://archive.org/details/englishhistoric08edwagoog WarNaval intervention in Syria= Powerful and Princess Charlotte at the English Camp at Djouni, near Sidon in 1840. During the Syrian operations, the Princess Charlotte was the flagship of Admiral, Sir Robert Stopford In June 1840 Admiral Sir Robert Stopford, commanding the British Mediterranean Fleet, sent Commodore Charles Napier with a small squadron to the Syrian (now the Lebanese) coast. He was then ordered to proceed to Beirut to compel the Egyptians to withdraw. The situation on the ground was extremely volatile, and called for quick and decisive action; this Napier provided, acting as if his was an entirely independent command. On August 11, 1840, Napier's ships appeared off Beirut and he called upon Suleiman Pasha, Mehmet's governor, to abandon the town and leave Syria, whose population shortly revolted against Mehmet's occupying army. With such a small force, there was little that Napier could do against fifteen-thousand Egyptian troops until September, when Stopford's ships joined up with him. Open war broke out on September 11, when Napier bombarded Beirut and effected a landing at Jounieh with 1,500 Turks and Marines to operate against Ibrahim, who was prevented by the revolt from doing more than trying to hold the coastal cities. =Sidon, Nahr-el-Kelb and Boharsef= Due to the illness of the Brigadier-General of the army, Sir Charles Smith, Napier was instructed to command the land force and made a successful sortie against a force of Albanians at Nahr-el-Kelb (Kelbson). He then, with a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on September 26 and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days. While preparing to attack the Egyptian positions on the heights of Boharsef, Napier received an order to retire from the command of the land forces to make way for Brigadier-General Smith, who had recovered from his illness, and also had received command of the Turkish force in the allied army. To do this, Napier would need to retreat from his position; he decided to disobey the order and continued with the attack against Ibrahim's army. The fighting, on October 9 was furious but victory was secured. Napier then left the land forces to Smith. Meanwhile, the Egyptians had abandoned Beirut on October 3. =Bombardment of Acre= The fleet was then instructed to retake Acre, which was the only coastal position left in Egyptian hands. The Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Stopford, and supported by small Austrian and Turkish squadrons, moved into position against the western and southern sides of Acre on November 3 and opened fire at 14:00. The ships anchored closer to the shore than expected, at 450‚Äì800 metres, and the Egyptian guns were aimed too high. The fire of the ships was devastatingly accurate thanks to the training associated with the Royal Navy's new gunnery school, HMS Excellent. The Egyptians had no opportunity to correct their error; their guns were disabled by direct hits and by the walls of the fortifications falling on their crews. The sailing ships of the line were in two lines with steamers manoeuvring in between. At 16:20 a shell penetrated the main magazine in the south of the city, which exploded killing 1,100 men. The guns ashore fell silent and that night the city was occupied. British losses were light: 18 men killed and 41 wounded. The ships had fired 48,000 rounds. Aftermath The rapid collapse of Mehmet Ali's power, with the prospect of bloody chaos in Egypt, was not part of the Allies' plan, and Stopford sent Napier to command the squadron at Alexandria and to observe the situation. Here, acting independently again, he appeared before the city with part of his squadron on November 25 and enforced a blockade. Then without reference to his Admiral or the British government he personally negotiated a peace with Mehmet Ali, guaranteeing him and his heirs the sovereignty of Egypt, and pledging to evacuate Ibrahim's beleaguered army back to Alexandria, if Mehmet in turn renounced all claims to Syria, submitted to the Sultan and returned the Ottoman fleet. Stopford and the British ambassador were furious with this outcome. Stopford repudiated it immediately when he had heard the news and several of the Allied powers declared it void. Despite Napier‚Äôs long-standing personal friendship with Lord Palmerston, the arrangement was at first denounced by the British government; but the formal treaty later concluded and confirmed by the Sultan used Napier‚Äôs original as the basis for negotiations and differed from it only in minor ways.

Written in 1943, it was not published until 1945, in New Saxon Pamphlet. Orwell had by then left the BBC. Notable for including Orwell‚Äôs sentence: \\"Poetry on the air sounds like the Muses in striped trousers\\", the article mentions some of the material used in the broadcasts, mainly by contemporary or near-contemporary English writers such as T. S. Eliot, Herbert Read, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece, Alex Comfort, Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, and D. H. Lawrence. Whenever possible, the authors themselves were invited to read their poems on the air. Orwell refers to the fact that placing the poet in front of a microphone and having to read his poem out loud has an effect not only on the audience but also on the poet. He states that over the past two hundred years poetry has come to have less connection with music and the spoken word, with lyrical and rhetorical poetry having almost ceased to exist. The key to broadcasting poetry was to engage the audience ‚Äì of one ‚Äì in order to avoid the \\"atmosphere of frigid embarrassment\\" of the ‚Äúgrisly‚Äù poetry readings which always contained some people who were bored or ‚Äúall but frankly hostile and who couldn‚Äôt remove themselves by the simple act of turning a knob.‚Äù He points out that the unpopularity of poetry contrasts with the \\"good-bad\\" poetry, \\"generally of a patriotic or sentimental kind\\" and with \\"folk poetry\\", as in nursery rhymes, etc. One number of the programme was on the subject of war and included two poems by Edmund Blunden, Auden‚Äôs \\"September 1941\\",Orwell gives the title as \\"September 1941\\"; however there is no poem by Auden of that title. Almost certainly the reference is to Auden's poem \\"September 1, 1939\\". An anthology Poetry in Wartime edited by M.J. Tambimuttu, published in 1942 included the poem \\"September 1, 1939\\" but misprinted the title as \\"September 1, 1941\\"; this may have been the source of Orwell's error. extracts from \\"A Letter from Anne Ridler‚Äù by G. S. Fraser, Byron‚Äôs \\"Isles of Greece\\", and an extract from T. E. Lawrence‚Äôs Revolt in the Desert. The essay goes on to refer to the fact that broadcasting is \\"under the control of governments or great monopoly companies which are actively interested in maintaining the status quo and therefore preventing the common man from becoming too intelligent.\\" He gives the example of the British Government which, at the beginning of World War II had declared its \\"intention of keeping the literary intelligentsia \\"out of it; yet after three years of war almost every writer, however undesirable his political history or opinions, has been sucked into the various Ministries or the BBC\\" or, if already in the armed forces, into public relations \\"or some other essentially literary job\\". He points out a small consolation in that \\"the bigger the machine of government becomes, the more loose ends and forgotten corners there are in it\\" and that as long as they are \\"forced to maintain an intelligentsia\\", there will also be a minimum of freedom. Finally, he urges those \\"who care for literature to turn their minds to this much- despised medium\\" which has \\"powers for good\\". The Indian Section of the BBC published a collection of the broadcasts, Talking to India (1943), which was edited by Orwell.

Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Airlie House (a conference center) in Warrenton, Virginia to discuss means of evaluating comprehensive musicianship. The resultant document, Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education, offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies. There are two curricula that are examples of the Comprehensive Musicianship methodology: The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program and the Hawaii Music Curriculum Program. Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program (MMCP) was funded by a grant from the U.S. Dept. of Education and was named for Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York. Its objectives were to develop a music curriculum and related materials for a sequential music learning program for the primary grades through high school. The project produced the Synthesis, a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12, Interaction, an early childhood curriculum, and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Laboratory, the Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program. MMCP began in 1965 with an exploratory of 92 innovative and experimental music programs. Phase One (1966) dealt with perspectives of student learning potentials, problems of curriculum reform, and classroom procedures. Phase Two (1967) dealt with the refinement and synthesis of information gained in the first exploratory period and the organization of information into a feasible curriculum. Phase Three (1968) consisted of the refinement and field testing of all curriculum items, the initial investigation of a separate curriculum for early childhood, the preparation and testing of plans for teacher retraining, and the development of an assessment instrument that reflected the program objectives. Hawaii Music Curriculum Program The Hawaii Music Curriculum Program began in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Hawaii Curriculum Center in Honolulu. Its purpose was to create a logical, continuous educational program ensuring the competent guidance of the music education of all children in the state's public schools and to test and assemble the materials needed by schools to realize this program. Students are to be involved with music in school in the same ways that people are involved with music in the outside world. The curriculum is based on seven basic concepts: tone, rhythm, melody, harmony, form, tonality, and texture, that are presented in the form of a spiral curriculum. The taxonomy of concepts was translated into a curriculum by means of division into five \\"zones.\\" Further reading *Contemporary Music Education, by Michael L. Mark.

He has recorded eight full-length albums.  Early life  Vidar Vang grew up in Bjerkvik, in Northern Norway. He started to write songs in his teens.  Musical career  In 1998 Vidar Vang released his unofficial debut album Blue, recorded in his hometown Bjerkvik. The album was sold at concerts throughout northern Norway. In the fall of 1999, Vidar Vang recorded his first demo with a band, at H√∏nsehuset Studio in Bod√∏. This demo gave him and his band the opportunity to play by:Larm in Bergen in 2000, and the Norwegian Wood festival in Oslo the following summer. In August 2000 Vidar Vang moved to Oslo. In 2001, after playing by:Larm in Troms√∏, the Quart Festival and the main stage at Norwegian Wood, he got signed to EMI. Vidar Vang and his band went on their first Norwegian tour in the fall of 2001, before they entered Juke Joint Studio at Notodden, together with producers Seasick Steve and Cato ‚ÄúSalsa‚Äù Thomassen to record his official debut album. In September 2002 Vidar Vang made his official recording debut releasing the album Rodeo. Rodeo received a Norwegian Grammy nomination the year after. The single \\"Under Six Strings\\" has become one of Vidar Vang‚Äôs signature songs. In 2004 Vidar Vang released the follow-up to Rodeo, Stand Up Straight. Vidar Vang‚Äôs band, childhood friends from Bjerkvik and Bod√∏, now had become The Northern Men. \\"Here It Is\\" was released as a single and received extensive radio play in the fall of 2004. The album songs \\"Happy\\", and the duet with Ingrid Olava \\"Highways of My Mind\\", were also released as singles. On the eponymous Vidar Vang (2006), Vidar Vang recorded his songs with a more acoustic sound than on previous albums. Vidar and The Northern Men went separate ways in 2005 and Vang subsequently recorded with other musicians. The single \\"Stand Up\\" is one of Vidar Vang‚Äôs most known and played songs. Before and after the release of Vidar Vang, Vidar Vang toured Norway and Sweden, and also supported The Waterboys and Madrugada on their European tours. In 2010, Vidar Vang released his fifth album, Sleepless Songs, produced by Frode Jacobsen and Alexander Kloster-Jensen. Album singles were \\"10 Below\\" and the duet \\"Love, Love, Love\\" with Tift Merritt. On Sidewalk Silhouettes (2012), Vidar Vang recorded 18 songs alone with his guitar, before him and his producer, Cato ‚ÄúSalsa‚Äù Thomassen, overdubbed them lightly with old, analog synthesizers, sparse drum machines and electric guitars. Starting with the 2015 album V√•rres egen lille krig, he dropped English as the primary language and switched to his native Norwegian.

Merrie Melodie cartoon short starring Jack Benny and the regular cast of The Jack Benny Program as mice. The short, released on April 4, 1959, was written by Tedd Pierce and directed by Robert McKimson. Plot Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny (a sign out front proclaims, \\"Star of Stage * Screen * Radio * Television...also cartoons\\"), a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin‚Äîoff-key‚Äîand saying to himself, \\"Who is this guy Isaac Stern?\\" (In real life Benny and Stern were good friends.) Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester (portrayed as a dark brown mouse) to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up (a week for $5.00, equal to $ today) and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming \\"We're in the Money\\". When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks \\"Halt! Who goes there?\\", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks \\"We win the war yet?\\" When Benny assures Ed that the war has been won, thinking that Benny was referring to World War I, Ed says: \\"Good. What do you think they'll do with the Kaiser?\\" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his best gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program, Don storming off in a huff when Jack refuses to let him do a scene. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign ($) and \\"no sale\\", they discuss other options (she sarcastically suggests the Monkey House at the Griffith Park Zoo). As they discuss their options, the cat writes a message extolling the \\"Kit Kat Club\\" (\\"entertainers admitted free\\") and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While en route, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good \\"mousecatel\\". Unbeknownst to them, the \\"club\\" is actually the maw of the cat, and as Jack and Mary enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: \\"Help! Help!\\" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: \\"Gee, what a crazy dream! Imagine, Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat! And I was playing the violin!\\" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant \\"Rock-a-Bye Baby\\" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation (where the rodent Jack and Mary return to their mousehole), the real Jack Benny does one of his famous \\"takes\\" as the cartoon fades out. Voice cast The cartoon is noticeable to credit all of the voice actors rather than only crediting Mel Blanc. The list of actors includes: * Jack Benny as Jack * Don Wilson as Chubby Don * Mary Livingstone as Mary * Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson as Rochester * Mel Blanc as the Maxwell / Ed, the vault guard Production The cartoon was released on April 4, 1959. Written by Tedd Pierce, it is a parody of The Jack Benny Program starring the voices of Jack Benny, Mary Livingstone (in her final public performance), Don Wilson and Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson as rodent caricatures of their respective radio and television characters, with Mel Blanc reprising his imitation of Benny's Maxwell automobile (also assuming the voice of \\"Ed\\", Jack's underground vault guard, usually portrayed on radio and TV by Joseph Kearns). The title is a play on the nursery rhyme \\"This is the House that Jack Built\\". As revealed on the audio commentary for this short, Benny only supplied his voice, but not his violin playing, as evidenced by the \\"pre- score\\" music of the violin soloist attempting to play as badly as Benny did on the radio show.

The office is intended to be held for life. Their principal duty is to confer degrees upon those presented to them by the Senate, although this role is usually carried out by the Vice- Chancellor, the appointment of whom is the Chancellor's second-most important duty. The current Chancellor is Dame Katherine Grainger, the first woman to hold the office. History From the University's establishment in 1451, the office was held by the Archbishop of Glasgow, except in the case of Lord Blantyre, who held all the powers of the Archbishop as 'Lord of Glasgow'. This trend ceased with the appointment of the Duke of Hamilton as Chancellor in 1642, although resumed from 1661 to 1692 for a subsequent run of seven archbishops, from Andrew Fairfoul to John Paterson. Five of the eight Chancellors in the past hundred years have been alumni of the University. The Earl of Roseberry, a former Prime Minister, was educated at Oxford; Sir Daniel Macauley Stevenson did not attend university but was a generous benefactor of the University; and Sir Donald MacAlister, who studied at the University of Cambridge served as Principal between 1909 and 1929.

History During the 1860s, two small railway companies were formed to promote suburban railways in Bradford, the Bradford, Eccleshill and Idle Railway and the Idle and Shipley Railway. Their schemes - and the companies themselves - were taken up by the Great Northern Railway, which built a line looping through the villages to the north-east of Bradford: from , through , and Thackley to Shipley. The line was open to goods traffic on 4 May 1874, and to passengers on 18 January 1875. Thackley railway station was rebuilt in 1890-1894. Passenger service on the line ceased on 2 February 1931 and the passenger station closed, though goods traffic continued on the whole line until October 1964 and between Shipley and until 1968. The line is now a public footpath, with only ruined buildings and partially demolished platforms at track level to show that this was a railway station.

Numbered ticks are 122 ¬µm apart. The Orbiliaceae are a family of saprobic sac fungi in the order Orbiliales. The family, first described by John Axel Nannfeldt in 1932, contains 288 species in 12 genera. Members of this family have a widespread distribution, but are more prevalent in temperate regions. Some species in the Orbiliaceae are carnivorous fungi, and have evolved a number of specialized mechanisms to trap nematodes.  Description  Orbiliaceae do not have stromata, dense structural tissue that produces fruit bodies. They have small disc-shaped apothecia, that are typically convex, brightly colored or translucent. Their ascospores are small (typically less than 10 x 1 Œºm), hyaline, and have an oval or ellipsoidal shape. Species are usually found in wood on both wet and dry habitats. Anamorph species are hyphomycetous. Nematophagy This family is well known for its many nematophagous species.Pfister DH. (1997). Castor, pollux and life histories of fungi. Mycologia 89(1): 1-23. Shortly after coming into contact with its prey, fungal mycelia penetrate the nematode and spontaneously differentiate into functional structures, known as traps, which will ultimately digest the nematode's internal contents. There are 5 types of trap mechanisms recognized in this family:Drechsler C. (1937). Mycologia 29: 447‚Äì552. *Adhesive network: the most common trap, formed by hyphal outgrowths that recurve into themselves to form nematode-trapping loops. *Adhesive knob: a roughly spherical cell, attached to the hyphae either directly or on an erect stalk. Adhesive knobs are typically closely spaced along a section of hyphae. *Nonconstricting rings: always found with the adhesive network traps, and formed from thickening hyphae that curve and fuse to the supporting stalk. *Adhesive column: a layer of cells on a hyphae with an adhesive surface. *Constricting rings: these are rings of hyphae that swell rapidly inwards upon contact with the nematode, quickly (in 1‚Äì2 seconds) \\"lassoing\\" the victim. Genera According to the most recent classification of Ascomycota, the Orbiliaceae contain only two (teleomorph) genera, the Hyalorbilia and the Orbilia. Hyalorbilia is distinguished from Orbilia by having asci without a stalk that arise from croziers, a hemispherical to broadly conical, thin- walled apex, asci and paraphyses in a gelatinous matrix, and an ectal excipulum (the outer surface of a cup-like apothecium) of horizontal textura prismatica.Baral HO.

Nicholson is known for having co-founded three animal rights campaigns in the UK in the 1990s with her husband at the time, Greg Avery. In 1997 the first campaign, Consort beagles, closed Consort Kennels, which bred beagles for animal-testing labs. In 1999 Save the Hill Grove Cats closed Hill Grove Farm, which bred cats for laboratories, after a two-year campaign led by Nicholson and Avery. That year Nicholson, Avery and Natasha Dellemagne set up Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) to close Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract animal-testing company. That campaign was unsuccessful and closed in 2014. In 2009 Nicholson was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for conspiracy to blackmail in connection with the SHAC campaign. Six other senior SHAC activists, including Avery and Dellemagne, were jailed for the same offences. All were alleged by police to be key figures within the Animal Liberation Front.Laville, Sandra (24 December 2008). \\"Animal rights extremists still targeting lab\\", The Guardian.

She joined Avery to found Consort beagles, a campaign against Consort, a company in Ross-on-Wye that bred beagles for laboratories, which closed 10 months later. Nicholson and Avery co-founded a subsequent campaign, Save the Hill Grove Cats, which saw the closure two years later of Hill Grove Farm near Oxford, which bred laboratory cats.Yeoman, Fran (23 December 2008). \\"Businessman received bomb threats and paedophile claims from animal rights extremists\\", The Times. =SHAC= Nicholson and Avery set up SHAC in 1999, along with Natasha Dellemagne, to close Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). The company was saved when the British government provided it with banking facilities, after the UK's major banks severed ties with it as a result of the campaign. HLS is Europe's largest contract animal-testing company, testing everything from pesticides to drugs, on behalf of commercial clients, on around 75,000 animals a year, including rats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, and primates.Southern Poverty Law Group (Fall 2002). \\"From push to shove\\", Intelligence Report.Townsend, Mark (20 April 2003). \\"Exposed: secrets of the animal organ lab\\" , The Observer.

The SHAC campaign targeted anyone who worked for or did business with HLS. This could entail protesters standing outside homes, blowing whistles and letting off fireworks throughout the night, spraying graffiti on property, breaking windows, spreading rumours to neighbours that the target was a paedophile, and sending hoax bombs and obscene mail.

At close of escrow, all participants, lenders, sellers, buyers and brokers are informed of all parties involved and all monies that change hands. For example, a double escrow might be arranged in which Alpha sells Greenacre to Beta, the sale to close at 10:00 am this morning; and Beta then immediately sells Greenacre to Gamma at 2:00 pm this afternoon. Because the two escrows are arranged to close back-to-back on the same day, they are regarded as one \\"double escrow.\\" If the underlying purpose of the double escrow is legal, the double escrow will be legal. If the double escrow is undertaken for a criminal purpose, it will not be legal. Otherwise, whether legal or not, a double escrow may not be physically possible. By definition, both escrows must close on the same day, or it is not \\"double\\" escrow but two single escrows. The second sale cannot close until the deed from the first sale is recorded, which means the deed must be recorded on the same day that both closings happen. If a county clerk or recorder's office has a 10:00 am deadline for same-day recording, and if the first sale does not close until after that deadline; then the deed will not be recorded until the next day, and the second escrow cannot close on the same day as the first. This is one situation in which double escrow is impossible. Another, possible more common reason for double escrow to be impossible is that the county clerk's office might not do same-day recording of deeds, especially if the county is understaffed. Many counties have a time lag of several days to several weeks (even a month or more) between accepting a deed for recording and actual recording (as of the date it was received). In these jurisdictions, double escrow will be completely impossible because the back-to-back sales may not even close during the same week or month, let alone on the same day.

The National Science Foundation had sponsored science curriculum development in the late 1950s. President John F. Kennedy appointed the Panel on Educational Research and Development, which recommended that the K-12 music curriculum of previous decades be examined to discover why school music programs had not produced a musically literate and active public. The U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program awarded a grant to Yale University, and Claude V. Palisca was appointed director of the Yale Seminar. Two areas of concern were identified: music materials and music performance. Recommendations of the Yale Seminar * The basic goal of the K-12 music curriculum should be the development of musicality. * The school music repertory should be broadened. * The music curriculum should be expanded to include listening to worthwhile music literature. * Performance activities should include ensembles for which a varied and authentic repertory has been developed. * Advanced theory and literature courses should be available. * Musicians, scholars, and composers should be brought into schools. * Programs should take advantage of community resources. * Opportunities for advanced study in metropolitan areas should be made available to talented students throughout the country. * Greater use can be made of audiovisual aids. * There should be a related plan for teacher training and retraining. Juilliard Repertory Project After the conclusion of the Yale Seminar, Dean Gideon Waldrop of Juilliard applied for a grant from the U.S. Office of Education to develop a large body of authentic and meaningful music materials to augment and enrich the repertory available to music teachers in the early grades. The grant was approved and the Project was established in July, 1964 with Vittorio Giannini as director. The Music Educators National Conference (MENC) indicated its support in the Music Educators Journal. The purpose of the Project was to collect music of high quality to be used for teaching grades K-6. The repertory was compiled by three groups: musicologists, music educators, and public elementary school music teachers. 230 vocal and instrumental works were included in the Juilliard Repertory Library.

It was previously known as the East Ghor Main Canal and renamed in 1987 after Abdullah I of Jordan. Water sources and technical features The main water source for the King Abdullah Canal (KAC) is the Yarmouk River and the Al-Mukhaibeh wells within the Yarmouk valley: farther south, additional water flows from Wadi el-Arab and from the Zarqa River, and its reservoir behind King Talal Dam. As a result of the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, some Yarmouk River water is also stored seasonally in Lake Tiberias, being conveyed through a pipe.INBO:Article on the Water Management System for the Jordan Valley , accessed on October 09, 2009 The canal‚Äôs design capacity is 20 m3/second at the northern entrance of the Canal and 2.3 m3/second at its southern end. Water flows by gravity along its 110 km length, ranging in elevation from about 230 meters below sea level to almost 400 meters below. The Canal supplies water for irrigation and 90 million cubic meters/year of drinking water for Greater Amman through the Deir Allah-Amman carrier, which has been constructed in two phases in the mid-80s and in the early 2000s. The Zarqa River contains a mixture of treated wastewater and natural water flow, which influences the water quality downstream of the Zarqa River intake into the KAC. History The canal was designed in 1957 and was built in phases. Construction began in 1959, and the first section was completed in 1961. By 1966, the upstream portion to Wadi Zarqa was completed. The canal was then 70 km in length, and was subsequently extended three times between 1969 and 1987. The United States, through United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided financing for the initial phase of project, after obtaining explicit assurances from the Jordanian government that Jordan would not withdraw more water from the Yarmouk than the amount allocated to it according to the Johnston Plan.Water Resources in Jordan, Munther J. Haddadin, editor, RFF Press, 2006FAO:Aquastat:Jordan, accessed on April 19, 2009 It was also involved in later phases. The original canal was part of a larger project - the Greater Yarmouk project - which envisioned two storage dams on the Yarmouk, and a future West Ghor Canal, on the West Bank of the Jordan. This other canal was never built, because Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War. After the Six-Day War, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operated from bases within Jordan, and launched several attacks on Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley, including attacks on water facilities. Israel responded with raids in Jordan, in an attempt to force king Hussein to rein in the PLO. The canal was the target of at least four of these raids, and was virtually knocked out of commission. The United States intervened to resolve the conflict, and the canal was repaired after Hussein undertook to stop PLO activity in the area.The Law of International Watercourses, Stephen C.

The island is a protected area and forms part of Capricornia Cays National Park. It is part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. The cay covers an area of and is surrounded by a coral reef that is partially exposed at low-tide. Geomorphology and landscape On Tryon Island, there is beach rock along the north western and south eastern beaches. The cay has in the past been covered with dense vegetation. The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.Hopley, D. (1982) The Geomorphology of the Great Barrier Reef - Quaternary Development of Coral Reefs. Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., New York The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day. Geologically, the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plain on which today's reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago), the sea level began to rise until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays. Tryon Island is a vegetated sand cayFairbridge, R. W. 1950b. Recent and Pleistocene coral reefs of Australia. J. Geol. 58: 330‚Äì401 placed atop of a platform reef.William Graham Henderson Maxwell - Atlas of the Great Barrier Reef Elsevier, 1968 HistoryDiscovery= In 1799, the new ship Albion, owned by Messrs Champion, spent the two winters whaling, first off the Australian and then the New Zealand coasts. In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship Albion was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group. During a second whaling voyage from England in Albion, he discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast. The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King RN initially in the Mermaid and later in the Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Blackwood in HMS Fly, which was accompanied by the Bramble. The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. =Guano Mining 1890‚Äì1900s= Tryon Island was probably mined for guano from 1898 to 1900, but it has been suggested that those operations must have been small, since few indications of mining remain in the landscape compared with some of the other islands within the group Fairfax Islands, Lady Elliot Island and North West Island.Heatwole, ‚ÄòCays of the Capricornia Section‚Äô, p. 28 =Shell and coral collecting during the 1960s= In the 1963‚Äì1969, the eastern portion of the reef surrounding Tryon Island was used for coral collecting on a lease by Joyce Burnett & Sirian Hamilton Harlow. In 1968 Harold Frederick Manning was also given a lease for the below low water mark on the northwestern corner of Tryon reef.'Loved to Death': Coral Collecting in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, 1770‚Äì1970 Environment and History, Volume 14, Number 1, February 2008 , pp. 89‚Äì119(31) =Tryon Island anti-influenza drugs 1969= At the end of 1969, Graeme Laver, Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Australian National University in Canberra, organised a trip to Tryon Island and discovered that seabirds on the Great Barrier Reef are riddled with influenza viruses. He collected sera from 201 shearwaters, tested them on the spot, and to his surprise, he discovered some birds had antibodies against antigens of Influenzavirus A and some of these avian antibodies are inhibitory to specific viral neuraminidases. Live viruses were also harvested from these birds on Tryon Island and a novel N9 neuraminidase was identified. Crystals of this neuraminidase were later prepared for X-ray diffraction analysis to elucidate the enzyme's three-dimensional structure, yielding information useful to many pharmaceuticals, such as Gilead Sciences, Hoffmann La Roche, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoWellcome, Eli Lilly and Company, Abbott Labs., ZymeTx Corporation and Pfizer Ltd. in the design and synthesis of novel neuraminidase inhibitors which these companies hoped to market as anti-influenza drugs. In particular, Gilead Sciences in the United States developed a carbocyclic, orally bioavailable neuraminidase inhibitor currently marketed under the name Tamiflu. =Scale insect outbreak 1993= In August 1993, shortly before Tryon Island was incorporated into the Capricornia Cays National Park in 1994, an outbreak of the scale insect Pulvinaria urbicola was detected on the island's pisonia forest. At this time, Tryon's pisonia covered nearly half the island. This was the first known scale outbreak in a pisonia forest of the Capricornia Cays, and one of the world's earliest records. Expectations were that natural predators, such as ladybirds and parasitic wasps, would bring the outbreak under control. At various points the forests appeared to be recovering, with previously affected trees showing new growth. Ultimately the repeated scale infestations killed many pisonia, taking 7‚Äì8 years before scale numbers subsided. Even after the outbreak had ended, the forest did not regenerate as might have been expected. Today, 90 percent of Tryon Island's original pisonia forest has gone. Once it became clear that the forest could not recover naturally, Queensland Parks & Wildlife Service began a revegetation program, with trial plantings in 2004 and 2005 and then a more comprehensive trial in July 2006. A successful ant-baiting program has also significantly reduced Tryon Island's introduced ant population, with no visible effects on native species. The main lesson was that like a wildfire, once underway, outbreaks of this kind apparently will not subside before most, if not all, of the island's pisonia is gone. Current uses Much of this area comes under the Capricornia Cays National Park with current usages including camping, permitted on four cays up to the following limits: * North West Island 150 campers * Lady Musgrave Island 50 campers * Masthead Island 60 campers (30 from October to March) *Tryon Island 30 campers. (currently closed) The area also has many visits by both passing vessels cruising the Queensland cost and day trippers in fast jet catamarans (typically Lady Musgrave Island). The area is also of significances as a fishery particularly for king prawns. EcologyFlora= The centre of the island is dominated by a dense forest of Pisonia (both birdcatcher pisonia and Pisonia grandis) vegetation while screwpine tree, velvet soldierbush and she-oaks are found around the island fringes. =Fauna= The Capricorn silvereye, a small bird endemic to the southern Great Barrier Reef, is found on the island. Introduced ants Introduced ants have been found at Tryon Island and the site of other scale outbreaks in Australia and elsewhere. Their role in farming scale and interfering with natural parasites and predators may be central to maintaining an outbreak. In the Capricornia Cays, the African big-head ant Pheidole megacephala is associated with all outbreaks, whereas in the Coral Sea it is the guinea ant Tetramorium bicarinatum.

Solar thermal energy is used in three main ways: solar hot water heating, production of steam for electricity generation and space heating through building design. Environmental importance 85% of electricity in Australia is generated by coal-fired power stations. They produce 42% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC has recommended that developed nations such as Australia cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40% by 2020 and 80 to 95% by 2050.http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter13.pdf at p 776 The Garnaut Climate Change Review found that Australia is highly vulnerable to global warming caused by climate change because of the effects of global warming on Australia. The Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu and Murray Darling Basin are all threatened by climate change. Sea level rise threatens much of the highly populated Australian coast line, including the Gold Coast. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and Mandatory Renewable Energy Target are intended to reduce Australia's emissions and the further development of techniques to harness solar thermal energy are critical to that effort. Solar resources of Australia Of all the continents, Australia has the highest average amount of solar radiation per square metre per annum. The amount is from 1500 to 1900 kWh/m2/yr, mainly depending on location. Australia‚Äôs total current primary energy consumption of approximately 5500 PJ/a could be met by an area of 4000 km2 of solar collectors with an average of 20% conversion efficiency.

(1919). The Rev. Mr. Bowie married Jean Laverack on September 29, 1909. His aunt was the suffragist and educationist Mary-Cooke Branch Munford, and novelist James Branch Cabell was kin as well. Ministry Bowie was ordained a priest in 1909. His initial service was at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Albemarle County, Virginia. Rev. Bowie was then called to St. Paul's Church in Richmond, Virginia where he had been baptised. He served as its rector from 1911 until called by Grace Church in New York City in 1923, although that service was actually interrupted by World War I (during which Bowie served as a Red Cross chaplain at Base Hospital 45 in France). While in Richmond, Bowie was editor of the Southern Churchman. Bowie became known as a preacher as well as author and hymnist.

Directed by Kevin Connor and written by Roger Schroeder, it aired November 27, 2004 on the Hallmark Channel. Plot After helping a boy take his little sister to see Santa, 13-year-old Holly Grant tells a shopping mall Santa Claus that she would like to have a boyfriend for Christmas. Twenty years later, Holly is a romantic skeptic and is more focused on her career as a social worker. At the time, she is in court helping a mother get her children back from foster care. When the mother's lawyer, Ryan Hughes, does not show up in court, Holly is extremely angry and sends Hughes a letter via her secretary. On Christmas Day, she opens her door to a man carrying a Christmas tree and a bow on his chest. He hands her a note that says, \\"As promised, one boyfriend for Christmas,\\" and introduces himself as \\"Douglas Firwood\\".The name is a pun on Douglas fir, a species of evergreen tree that is commonly used as a Christmas tree. She assumes he is a gag present from her friend Diane, and invites him into her home. Later that day she takes him with her to her parents' house for Christmas dinner. Hoping to keep her matchmaking family, especially her manipulative sister-in-law Carol, off her back, she tells everyone that Douglas is her long-term boyfriend, and Douglas plays along. On New Year's Eve, Holly learns from her scheming ex-boyfriend Ted that Douglas is really Ryan Hughes, who was sent to her by Santa Claus. She accuses him of lying to her and tells him to leave. After persuasion by Santa Claus and refusing Ted's marriage proposal, she follows Ryan. They meet up at a park, where they finally remember where they first met - at age 13 when she helped him take his little sister to see Santa - and they watch the New Year's fireworks together.

Early life Yongle era of the Ming dynasty. Yishiha's route is in blue, along with those of Zheng He (in black) and Chen Cheng (in green). It is believed that Yishiha was a Haixi Jurchen by origin, and was captured by the Ming forces in the late 14th century. He worked under two important eunuchs, Wang Zhen and Cao Jixiang. It is speculated by modern historians that he rose to prominence by participating in imperial court politics and serving the Yongle Emperor's concubines of Manchu (Jurchen) origin.  Amur expeditions  Yishiha's Amur expeditions belong to the same period of the Yongle Emperor's reign (1402‚Äì1424) which saw another eunuch admiral, Zheng He, sail across the Indian Ocean, and Chinese ambassadors reach the Timurid Empire's capital Herat (in today's Afghanistan) overland. By 1409, the Yongle Emperor's government, which had already established relations with the Haixi and Jianzhou Jurchens in southern Manchuria, ordered Yishiha to start preparations for an expedition to the lower Amur River region, to demonstrate the power of the Ming Empire to the Nurgan Jurchen populating the area and induce them to enter into relations with the empire, and to ensure that they would not create trouble for the Ming state when the latter went to war with the Eastern Mongols. In 1411, after two years of preparations, Yishiha's fleet of 25 ships with 1000 men aboard sailed from Jilin City down the Sungari and into the Amur. The \\"Nurgan Jurchens\\" offered little oppositions to Yishiha's expedition. He gave generous gifts to their tribal leaders, and established a Nurgan Regional Military Commission, at the place the Chinese called Telin (), near the present-day village of Tyr in Russia's Khabarovsk Krai. This was the same place where in 1260‚Äì1320 the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty had the headquarters of their Marshal of the Eastern Campaigns.–í–∞–∂–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–µ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –õ–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≥–æ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ (Principal research results of the Laboratory of the Late Mediaeval Archaeology of the [Russian] Far East) The commission's authority covered much of the Amur basin, including the shores of the Sungari, Ussuri, Urmi, Muling, and Nen Rivers. Yishiha then returned to the Ming Empire, taking with him a tribute- bearing mission of 178 \\"Nurgan Jurchens\\". A pillar on top of the Tyr Cliff, remaining from, apparently, Yishiha's second temple, as seen ca. 1860 In 1413‚Äì1414, during his second expeditions to the lower Amur, Yishiha stayed almost a year at Tyr. He built a Buddhist temple (sometimes described as a \\"monastery\\") named Yongning Si (Ê∞∏ÂÆÅÂØ∫, the Temple of Eternal Peace) dedicated to Guanyin on the Tyr Cliff, and erected a stele describing his expedition, with the text in Chinese, Mongol, and Jurchen languages. The stele, presently kept in the Arseniev Museum in Vladivostok, described the locals as good archers and fishermen, and their clothes as made of fishskin.Telin Stele (from: \\"–ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –≤ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —á–∂—É—Ä—á–∂–µ–Ω–µ–π (1402‚Äì1413 –≥–≥.)\\" (The Jurchen policy of the Ming Empire), in \\"–ö–∏—Ç–∞–π –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥–∏ –≤ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤—å–µ\\" (China and its neighbors in antiquity and the Middle Ages), Moscow, 1970. According to some evidence (a seal issued by the empire's Ministry of Rites, found in Yilan County, Heilongjiang), in 1413 Yishiha also visited the nearby coast of the Sakhalin Island, and granted Ming titles to a local chieftain. While no detailed ethnographic data about the \\"Nurgan Jurchens\\" has been found in Chinese records, it was, apparently, a collective name for the Tungusic peoples and possibly other groups (e.g. Nivkh–ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞—á–µ–≤ –í.–¶.

As of the mid-19th century, Tyr was a Nivkh settlement, as attested by a contemporary encyclopedia–¢—ã—Ä (Tyr in Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary) and the book by E.G. Ravenstein, based on the accounts of the Russian explorers of the 1850s.E.G.Ravenstein \\"The Russians on the Amur\\". Full text can be found on Google Books. Another ethnic group native to the Ulchsky District (where Tyr is located) are the Ulch people, a Tungusic people, but their home villages are all located upstream from Tyr. (Ulchi data, at the site of the Associations of the Indigenous Peoples of Siberia; most of the villages can be found on Wikimapia.org) During the rest of the Yongle Emperor's reign, Yishiha carried out three more expeditions to Nurgan, while the Nurgan natives sent some more tribute and trade missions to the Ming court. The Yongle Emperor's successor (the short-lived Hongxi Emperor (r. 1424‚Äì25), or, more likely, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1425‚Äì35)) continued the Yongle era's policy toward the \\"Wild Jurchens\\". In 1425, the Liaodong regional commissioner, Liu Qing, was ordered to build ships for another expedition down the river, and in 1426 Yishiha sailed again. Yishiha's last mission was connected to the retirement of the Nurgan chief and the \\"inauguration\\" of his son as his successor. Yishiha attended at that event in 1432, presenting the new chief a seal of authority and giving gifts to subordinate chieftains.Tsai (1996) describes the person being retired as \\"the commissioner in chief Kang Wang\\"; one has to assume that it was a Chinese title, and Chinese name, bestowed to a local (probably, Nivkh) chief. This time Yishiha's fleet included 50 big ships with 2,000 soldiers, and they actually brought the new chief (who had been living in Beijing) to Tyr. As Yishiha's first (1413) Yongning Si temple had been destroyed by that time, Yishiha had a second temple of the same name built. According to the modern archaeologists, his second temple was not built at the site of his first temple (as it had been commonly believed), but rather at the site of its ancient predecessor ‚Äì the Yuan Dynasty Yongning Si temple. As the archaeological research has revealed, the 1413 temple was located some 90 meters to the west of the top of the Tyr Cliff, where Yishiha's 1430s temple (and its Yuan predecessor) were located. A second stele was put next to the second temple. The stele has also survived, and has been moved south by the Russians for keeping at the Arsenyev Primorye Museum in Vladivostok.A. R. Artemyev.

Later career In the 1430s, the Xuande government stopped sending sea and river expeditions, and the naval (or, rather, riverine) career of Yishiha came to an end, as did that of his more famous colleague Zheng He. In the ninth year of the Ming Xuande emperor the Jurchens in Manchuria under Ming rule suffered from famine forcing them to sell their daughters into slavery and moving to Liaodong to beg for help amd relief from the Ming dynasty government.https://www.itsfun.com.tw/%E4%BA%A6%E5%A4%B1%E5%93%88/wiki-3774856-0311736 ‰∫¶Â§±Âìà ÂÆ£Âæ∑‰πùÂπ¥ÔºåÂ•≥ÁúüÂú∞Âå∫ÁÅæËçíÔºåÂ•≥Áúü‰∫∫Ë¢´Ëø´ÂçñÂÑøÈ¨ªÂ•≥ÔºåÂõõÂ§ÑÊµÅ‰∫°ÔºåÈÄÉÂêëËæΩ‰∏úÁöÑÂ•≥ÁúüÈöæÊ∞ëÔºåÂ∏åÊúõÂæóÂà∞ÂÆòÂ∫úÁöÑËµàÊµé„ÄÇhttp://hlj.ifeng.com/culture/history/detail_2014_07/08/2559681_0.shtml ‰∫¶Â§±Âìàhttps://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BA%A6%E5%A4%B1%E5%93%88 ‰∫¶Â§±Âìà In 1435 Yishiha was put in charge of the defense of the Liaodong region; he remained at this post for over 15 years. Apparently, his performance during the raids of the Oirad Mongol chief Esen Tayisi was considered unsatisfactory, and some time between 1449 and 1451 his was relieved of his duties.

It was sponsored by the Music Educators National Conference (MENC) in cooperation with the Berkshire Music Center, the Theodore Presser Foundation, and the School of Fine and Applied Arts of Boston University. The purpose was to discuss and define the role of music education in contemporary American society and to make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of music instruction. Participants included sociologists, scientists, labor leaders, educators, representatives of corporations, musicians, and people involved with other aspects of music. The Symposium Position papers had been published in the March and April 1967 issues of the Music Educators Journal. The papers served as the bases for discussion at the 1967 MENC divisional conferences and for the Tanglewood Symposium. The sessions were moderated by Max Kaplan, Wiley Lee Housewright (1913‚Äì2003), Allen P. Britton, David P. McAllester, and Karl D. Ernst. Three broad questions were considered: * What are the characteristics and desirable ideologies for an emerging and postindustrial society? * What are the values and unique functions of music and other arts for individuals and communities in such a society? * How may these potentials be attained? The Tanglewood Declaration The Tanglewood Symposium is summarized in the statement entitled \\"The Tanglewood Declaration,\\" which provided a philosophical basis for future developments in music education. Of particular importance, the Declaration called for music to be placed in the core of the school curriculum. *a. Music serves best when its integrity as an art is maintained. *b. Music of all periods, styles, forms, and cultures belongs in the curriculum. The musical repertory should be expanded to involve music of our time in its rich variety, including currently popular teenage music and avant-garde music, American folk music, and the music of other cultures. *c. Schools and colleges should provide adequate time for music programs ranging from pre-school through adult or continuing education. *d. Instruction in the arts should be a general and important part of education in the senior high school. *e. Developments in educational technology, educational television, programmed instruction, and computer-assisted instruction should be applied to music study and research. *f. Greater emphasis should be placed on helping the individual student to fulfill his needs, goals, and potentials. *g. The music education profession must contribute its skills, proficiencies, and insights toward assisting in the solution of urgent social problems as in the \\"inner city\\" or other areas with culturally deprived individuals. *h. Programs of teacher education must be expanded and improved to provide music teachers who are specially equipped to teach high school courses in the history and literature of music, courses in the humanities and related arts, as well as teachers equipped to work with the very young, with adults, with the disadvantaged, and with the emotionally disturbed.Introduction to Music Education, 3rd Edition, Hoffer, Charles R.

Early life McKechnie was born in Brockville, Ontario on April 25, 1861. After completing his secondary school education in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, he began his studies at McGill University in 1886. After receiving his medical degree from McGill in 1890, he moved to British Columbia the following year, and practiced medicine in the Nanaimo area for 10 years. He was later elected to the Council of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia in 1896, and served as its president in 1897, 1906, and 1910. McKechnie also held the positions of senior surgeon, member of the Board of Directors, and Life Governor at Vancouver General Hospital. He was elected the first president of the British Columbia Medical Association in 1899. He later moved to Vancouver in 1904, where he remained for the rest of his career. He helped found the American College of Surgeons and the North Pacific Surgical Society, and was president of the Canadian Medical Association in both 1914 and 1920. In addition to his medical career, McKechnie also ventured into politics. He was elected the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Nanaimo in 1898, and served as a Minister without portfolio in the provincial government of Premier Charles Augustus Semlin. University of British Columbia He lectured in medical history at the University of British Columbia before being elected to its senate in 1912 and becoming its second chancellor in 1918, holding the latter position until his death in 1944.

The band was formed in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2006 following the dissolution of Thee Shams, of which the trio were members. Buffalo Killers were quickly signed by Alive Records and their self-titled debut album was released in October 2006; Buffalo Killers drew the attention of Chris Robinson, who invited the band to open a string of dates for The Black Crowes in 2007. Buffalo Killers' second album, Let It Ride, was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys and released in July 2008. HistoryEarly years and formation= Andrew and Zachary Gabbard grew up in a musical household with a guitar-playing father, who taught them to play the instrument at an early age. Zach recalls growing up \\"listening to Neil Young, The Grateful Dead, CSNY and New Riders of the Purple Sage from as long back as I can remember.\\" With access to their father's record collection and musical instruments, Zach says he and his brother were \\"groomed\\" to make a career of playing music. Zach formed the garage rock band Thee Shams in 1999; the five- piece band included the other two future members of Buffalo Killers. Thee Shams released four albums on four record labels before the Gabbard brothers broke up the band in late 2005. \\"In the end it was broke and the road only made it worse\\", said Zach, adding, \\"It was best to move on, take a break and re-evaluate the situation\\". In early 2006, the Gabbard brothers recruited Sebaali to play drums (he had played keyboards in Thee Shams) and formed Buffalo Killers. The new band's sound was a \\"more polished version\\" of Thee Shams' minimalist garage rock, but \\"still rooted in that great sweaty and swampy blues-rock inspired by '60s garage rock psychedelia\\", wrote Rick Bird of The Cincinnati Post. Other reviewers compared the band to Blue Cheer, Mountain and The Rolling Stones. =Buffalo Killers‚Äìpresent= Shortly after the band's formation, Buffalo Killers began gigging throughout Ohio and recorded a five-song demo with producer John Curley. Though the band intended to release the demo independently, Zach sent copies to record labels on a lark. Less than a week later the band received a call from Alive Records; the label \\"liked the recordings so much that they wanted to release them as they were\\", according to Zach. Alive Records subsequently signed Buffalo Killers, who scrambled to write and record five more songs to flesh out an LP. The album, Buffalo Killers, was released on October 10, 2006. Chris Robinson heard the album and invited the band to open a string of dates for The Black Crowes in 2007. Buffalo Killers had just finished booking their own tour, but then their booking agent \\"started calling me back frantically\\" recalled Zach. \\"He said that The Crowes had called and invited us on the whole fall tour. I was like, 'Well, cancel all that other shit.'\\" While on tour with The Black Crowes, Buffalo Killers wrote half of what would become Let It Ride. The band entered the studio, with Black Keys guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach serving as producer, immediately following the tour. The recording session took \\"only a few days\\", according to Auerbach, who downplayed his role in making the album. \\"These are the kind of guys that don't need a lot of help when it comes to making records or sparking their imagination.\\" Auerbach felt his most important contribution was in capturing \\"the raw live sound of this band\\". A concert tour, on which Buffalo Killers opened for The Black Keys, preceded the July 22, 2008, release of Let It Ride. A bonus live CD, sourced from a fan's bootleg, was included in a limited edition vinyl pressing of the album. The inclusion was made (even though the bootleg \\"sounds like shit\\", said Zach) to show that the band can play live and is not studio-enhanced. Another tour opening for The Black Crowes followed in November. Dig. Sow. Love. Grow. was released in August 2012. In 2014, Buffalo Killers added a fourth member, Sven Kahns, on guitar and lap steel. In August 2019, it was announced that Zachary and Andrew Gabbard had joined The Black Keys on bass and guitar, respectively. The announcement was made after Rolling Stone published an exclusive rehearsal video showing the Gabbard brothers performing the song \\"Go\\" from the Keys' ninth studio album, Let's Rock. The band's first show featuring this new lineup was on September 19, 2019 at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Discography * Buffalo Killers (2006) * Let It Ride (2008) * 3 (2011) * Dig. Sow. Love.

Reanalysis data obtained online from Penn State University shows 700 mb temperatures across the area dropped to -10¬∞C to -12¬∞C across southern Nevada by 06Z on December 14th and remained there through 12Z on December 17th. An upper-level low moved southward along the West Coast of the United States, reaching the coast of southern California by 06Z on December 17th. The low moved southeastward through the base of the upper-level trough axis and by the morning of December 17th was located along the coast of southern California. By 12Z on December 17th, the low was accompanied by a 120+ knot jet stream that was located across the Mojave Desert (Figure 1). As the low approached southern California, the Mojave Desert was located under the left front quadrant of the jet, an area of typically favorable for lift. An area of diffluence, associated with this jet, was noted over southern California and western Arizona ahead of the upper low around 00Z on December 18th, which also helped to further enhance lift across the area. As a southwesterly flow aloft pushed moist air over the Mojave Desert, surface analysis indicated a north to northeast pressure gradient was also present in this area due to high pressure centered over eastern Utah. The 12Z sounding from Desert Rock (KDRA) indicated low-level northeasterly flow was present up through 850 mb with primarily southwesterly flow above that level (Figure 2). Between 12Z on December 17th and 00Z on December 18th, a plume of subtropical moisture accompanied by precipitable water values of 0.30 to 0.50 of an inch was streaming northeastward toward the Mojave Desert. By 18Z on December 17th, the jet stream had strengthened to 140 knots over Arizona, which placed southern Nevada near the left rear quadrant of the jet. Typically, the left rear quadrant of the jet corresponds to an area of subsidence, but in this case the curvature effects of the jet resulted in additional vertical motion in this quadrant. The upper low by then had moved towards the coast of southern California, with a distinct area of maximum Positive Vorticity Advection (PVA) at 500 mb having moved inland across the Mojave Desert (Figure 3). Snow and a mix of snow and rain began to fall in the Las Vegas Valley shortly before 20Z on December 17th. Radiosonde data from Desert Rock depicted warm advection took place between 12Z on December 17th and 00Z on December 18th with temperatures at 700 mb rising from -12¬∞C to -8¬∞C during that period. By around 02Z on December 18th, precipitation generally became more intermittent as the area of maximum PVA had moved away from the area. Rain or a mixture of rain and snow tapered off between 05Z and 08Z on December 18th as warmer air finally infiltrated the lower levels and the upper low moved northeast over the Mojave dessert. Snow levels and amounts varied tremendously across the Las Vegas Valley with the greatest amounts located in the southeastern portion of the valley (Figures 4 and 5). Officially 3.6 inches of snow fell at the National Weather Service Office, which is located 2 miles southwest of McCarran International Airport. Generally 3 to 6 inches fell across the southern half of the valley. A maximum of 10 inches of snow was measured at the residence of a National Weather Service employee in southeast Henderson, near Railroad Pass, at an elevation of just under 2400 feet. The Henderson Executive Airport, located at an elevation of 2464 feet, in the southwestern part of Henderson received 8 inches. Snow amounts were highly variable along the famous Las Vegas Strip with the heaviest amounts on the southern end. At the ‚ÄúWelcome to Fabulous Las Vegas‚Äù sign on the far south end 1.7 inches of snow was measured while central and northern parts of The Strip saw snow barely coat some grassy surfaces and a few rooftops and metal objects at best. This corresponded well to a sharp-cut off noted overall across the center of the valley, where snow amounts decreased markedly. Across the northern half of the valley, snow levels were about 500 feet higher thus resulting in little to no snow accumulating here. https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/online_publications/talite/talite1001.pdf See also *Global storm activity of 2008 *Hanukkah Eve windstorm of 2006 *Great Coastal Gale of 2007 *Snowstorm References Category:2008 meteorology Category:Natural disasters in Oregon Category:Natural disasters in Washington (state) Category:Natural disasters in British Columbia Category:2008 natural disasters in the United States Category:2008 in British Columbia Category:Pacific Northwest storms Category:December 2008 events in North America Category:2008 in Oregon Category:2008 in Washington (state) Category:2008 disasters in Canada ","title":"December 2008 North American snowstorms"},{"id":"20842407","text":"Minuscule 44 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), Œµ 239 (von Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment leaves.

England  Bill Crooks was born in Mutford, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England as the son of James and Jane Elizabeth Crooks (n√©e Hale). He had six brothers and sisters. His father was a fisherman on a smack.Clapperton 1996, p. 17 During World War I his father was appointed to the Trawling Reserve of Britain's seagoing defences. He won a Distinguished Service Medal for sinking a German submarine by ramming it with his ship and his name was honoured in Lowestoft as \\"one of the bravest fishermen of the fleet\\". He died shortly after the war, on 27 December 1919 from a pneumonia, that was aggravated by wartime injuries.Berry 1997, p. 18  Flock House  In New Zealand, Edward Newman, Member of Parliament, encouraged the establishment of the \\"New Zealand Sheep Owners Acknowledgement of Debt to British Seamen Fund\\", to support relatives of British seamen that died during the war. The Crooks family was among the dependants of the Fund. The Fund bought Flock House, with the intention to bring sons of seamen to New Zealand, offer them the opportunity to learn farming skills, and place them on farms around New Zealand. Bill Crooks, then 16 years old, was among the first to apply. With his 15-year-old sister Gertrude, he sailed aboard the SS Remuera to New Zealand. Their mother's parting instruction to Bill was \\"look after your sister!\\".

They had the most frightful rows, but unlike Cook's own family, Bill Crooks stayed for nearly 50 years\\".Mortimer 1997, p. 48  Marriage and children  Bill Crooks married Josephine Inez Richardson (Gisborne, 17 December 1910) who was the youngest daughter of a pioneer farmer at Wharekopae, not far from Ngatapa. Her father was Eric U'Ren Richardson and her mother Florence Adelaide Richardson (n√©e Davies). Douglas Cook organised Christmas and Guy Fawkes parties at Eastwoodhill, to which the locals were invited. Bill and Jo met here. They married in March 1940 at the Cook Street Anglican Church in Gisborne. When Crooks had plucked up enough courage to tell his employer about his marriage, Douglas Cook was furious at first, but after a while he wrote to Jo and said \\"he would welcome her to Eastwoodhill, that Bill was like a son to him. The flowery words were probably the only onse of such a kind promising nature that Jo received from Douglas Cook and did not portend the nature of the life she was about to lead\\".Clapperton 1996, p. 18 Bill and Jo had four sons and a daughter. They lived in a small, two-bedroom cottage at \\"Pear Park\\", with little comfort. A poor water supply, never more than an outside toilet, and no laundry facilities, apart from a copper.Berry 1997, p. 18/9 \\"The wages paid to Bill were meagre and did not go anywhere to meeting the needs of the family. Jo's two sisters Phyll and Helen used to pay for the children's clothes. Over the years Bill was promised much by Douglas Cook, a home for Bill was supposed to have been built opposite McLean's, in amongst the trees that had been planted there. Later Douglas Cook said that he was going to buy the hills that are now Eivers' and Sherratt's as a farm for Bill. None of this eventuated. Douglas Cook had money to spend on furniture, antiques, trees, rugs, crystal, silver, paintings, book etc. but Bill had to wait. On Douglas Cook's death he received the contents of the house. That though was hardly compensation to either Bill or to Jo and the children for the years of frugal living\\".Clapperton 1996, p. 19/20  Establishing an arboretum  The impact of Bill Crook's arrival on the development of Eastwoodhill can hardly be overestimated. While Bill attended to much of the farm work, Douglas Cook had more time for such things as planning the arboretum, writing out orders to nurseries, and labeling. Bill assisted with planting as well. Immediately after his arrival in 1927 the first plantings of \\"Corner Park\\" were made. From 1934 \\"Cabin Park\\" was planted, and at the end of World War II \\"Douglas Park\\" was included in the plantings. In 1952, at age 71, Douglas Cook sold of his property. The money was used for making ponds throughout the arboretum and for the development of \\"Pear Park\\", \\"The Circus\\", \\"Orchard Hill\\" and \\"Glen Douglas\\".Gundry, Sheridan ‚Äì The colourful story of Eastwoodhill, in: An 2007, p. 10  H. B. (Bill) Williams  In the 1960s, when Douglas Cook was aging and desperately seeking ways to secure the future of Eastwoodhill, Bill Crooks still worked for him. He first tried to offer the arboretum to the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. But after long negotiations, this did not became reality. One of the other things Douglas Cook considered was selling to Bill Crooks, knowing the difficulties implied in this solution. Finally, in 1965, H. B. (Bill) Williams bought Eastwoodhill to preserve it for the future. With the money, Douglas Cook wanted to upgrade and paint his house and Bill Crooks', and put in an \\"inside lav\\" for Bill. But soon after selling Eastwoodhill, William Douglas Cook had two heart attacks. Arrangements were made for the Crooks to move into his home so that they could be constantly on hand. In 1966 his health got worse. He spent some time in a hospital. Bill and Jo Crooks paid him almost constant attention. Douglas later wrote that his doctor wanted him to engage someone to look after him \\"but I said NO. Bill will look after me. HE and his wife do all I need... Bill is like a most attentive son to me.\\".Berry 1997, p. 61 Douglas Cook died in 1967 in Gisborne, New Zealand. Crooks would remain the manager of the arboretum until 1974. He helped Bob Berry to create the first catalogue of Eastwoodhill in the early 1970s.  Footnotes  Literature  * An. (2007) ‚Äì Eastwoodhill, the colours of an arboretum.

After the recommendations had been considered, the Music Educators National Conference (MENC) appointed two commissions: The MENC National Commission on Organizational Development and the MENC National Commission on Instruction. The Commission on Organizational Development was to prepare the way for recommended changes in organization, structure, and function of the Conference, including all of its federated and affiliated units. The National Commission on Instruction was created to monitor the way music was being taught in the schools. Its first study resulted in the publication of The School Music Program: Description and Standards (1974, revised in 1986). The School Music Program: Description and Standards The two editions of The School Music Program are considered to be the precursors of the National Standards for Arts Education, published in 1994 in line with Goals 2000. The document includes ten rationales for music, ten outcomes of the successful music program (which closely resemble the nine National Standards of 1994), and a description of the guidelines for curriculum and implementation. Throughout the publication, two levels of standards are provided: basic and quality. The body of the publication is devoted to the following areas: * music in early childhood * elementary school * middle school and junior high * high school There are a few paragraphs devoted to beyond high school, conceding the difficulty in provided explicit standards for musical learning beyond high school. The four main sections include the following: * a list of skills that students should have by the completion of each grade level.

Henriette developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 15. After crossing the Atlantic and moving into the eastern Pacific on August 29, it developed a low-level circulation that was designated a tropical depression on September 1. The next day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henriette, and it was further upgraded to a hurricane on September 3. The storm peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. On land, wind gusts of 100 mph (160 km/h) were reported, knocking out power and water supplies. Heavy rainfall and strong storm surge contributed to flooding that damaged many roads; throughout the region, 800 people were forced from their homes. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170 miles (270 km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. The depression initially moved west-northwestward, and shortly after forming it turned to the north-northwest. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220 miles (350 km) west of Manzanillo. By later that day, the convection wrapped around the center of circulation. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135 miles (235 km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Upon reaching hurricane status, one computer model predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California, though most forecast a turn to the northwest. Henriette making landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. Late on September 3, an eye began to form in the center of the deep convection as Henriette turned to the northwest. The eye became better defined the next day, and Henriette attained a peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) as the northern portion of the eyewall moved over southern Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane quickly crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula and emerged into the Pacific Ocean again as a weakened 85 mph (135 km/h) cyclone with disrupted convection near the center. Convection gradually waned as the hurricane moved over progressively colder waters, and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression. The storm turned to the west, and gradually weakened until dissipating on September 8. Preparations and impact Rainfall from Henriette On September 2, a few hours after Henriette became a tropical storm, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Peninsula from La Paz southward. Early the next day it was changed to a hurricane watch, and 18 hours before Henriette made landfall the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Early on September 4, the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25¬∞N. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route. Originally planned to tour Mexican ports, the captain turned the ship to tour the southern California coastline. Many upset passengers demanded refunds, to which the cruise line offered discounts for future cruises and a $40 credit card during their cruise. Winds of up to in southern Baja California Sur left much of Cabo San Lucas without water or power. Overall, 2,000 people were directly affected by the hurricane. A strong storm surge produced flooding and heavy road damage in the state. Approximately 800 people were forced from their homes, and crop damage was reported. Generally up to 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell on land, though peak precipitation exceeded . No damage estimates are available, and no deaths were reported.

The case is notable as the foremost police detective of the era, Chief Inspector Robert Fabian, led the investigation into Walton's death. The chief suspect for the murder was the manager of The Firs, Alfred John Potter, for whom Walton was working on the day he died. However, there was insufficient evidence to convict Potter and the case is currently the oldest unsolved murder in the Warwickshire Constabulary records. The case has earned some notoriety in popular culture due to its supposed connection with the local belief in witchcraft. Background Charles Walton was born 12 May 18701939 England and Wales Register to Charles and Emma Walton.Warwickshire, England, Church of England Baptisms, 1813-19101871 England Census An agricultural worker, he had lived in Lower Quinton all his life. He was a widower who shared a small cottage, 15 Lower Quinton, with his 33-year-old niece, Edith Isabel Walton, whom he had adopted thirty years previously upon the death of her mother.Metropolitan Police File MEPO 3/2290 Walton was described as something of a loner who had earned a reputation as a trainer of horses in his youth. It is said that he did not socialise with his neighbours but that he was not disliked. Walton walked with a stick because of his rheumatic joints. However, he sought casual farm work wherever he could find it and, for the previous nine months, had been working for a local farmer, Alfred Potter, whose farm was known as The Firs. Edith Walton had lived with Charles Walton since she was three years old, although her father was still alive and lived at 30 Henley Street, Stratford. Walton had occupied his cottage since World War I and his wife had died on 9 December 1927. Walton had given Edith ¬£1 per week housekeeping, but also paid the 3s. per week rent on the cottage, as well as buying their coal and meat. In addition to his casual earnings, Walton received 10s. a week old age pension. Day of the murder On 14 February 1945 Walton left home with a pitchfork and a slash hook ‚Äì a double-edged pruning implement with a sharpened straight edge on one side and concave cutting edge on the other. Edith stated that Walton had left his purse at home on 14 February. He was witnessed to have passed through the churchyard between 9 am and 9.30 am. On this particular day, he was slashing hedges in a field known as Hillground on the slopes of Meon Hill.Murder Casebook Issue 71 ‚Äì Ritual Killings That day Edith Walton was working as a Printer's Assembler at the Royal Society of Arts which had relocated to Lower Quinton for the duration of the War. Walton was expected to be home by 4 pm. Edith returned home around 6 pm and found that Walton was not there. His solitary nature and regular habits gave her no solace that he might be in the local pub or visiting a friend. Edith went to see her neighbour, an agricultural worker by the name of Harry Beasley who lived at 16 Lower Quinton. Together they made their way to The Firs to alert Alfred Potter. Potter claimed to have last seen Charles earlier in the day, slashing hedges in Hillground. The three of them set out in the direction of the spot where Charles had last been seen and eventually found his body near a hedgerow. The murderer had beaten Walton over the head with his own stick, had cut his neck open with the slash hook, and driven the prongs of the pitchfork into either side of his neck, pinning him to the ground. The handle of the pitchfork had then been wedged under a cross member of the hedge and the slash hook had been buried in his neck. Edith was overcome with grief and began to scream loudly: Beasley tried to pacify her and to make sure that she did not venture too close to the scene. At that moment Harry Peachey was walking along the other side of the hedge. Potter called to him, directed his attention to the body and told Peachey to go and alert the police. Potter stood guard over the murder scene until the police arrived, while Beasley took Edith back down the hill. The first policeman on the scene was PC Michael James Lomasney who arrived at 7.05 pm. Members of Stratford-upon-Avon CID arrived later in the evening, while Professor James M. Webster, of the West Midlands Forensic Laboratory, arrived at 11.30 pm. The body was removed at 1.30 am. Initial investigation At 11 pm on 14 February, Detective Inspector Tombs took a statement from Alfred Potter. Potter stated that he had been at the farm for about five years and had known Walton for all that time. He had employed Walton casually for the last nine months and that Walton had worked when the weather permitted. Walton had been engaged on hedging for the previous few months and Hillground was the last field needing attention. Potter stated that he had been in the College Arms with Joseph Stanley, a farmer of White Cross Farm, until noon that day. He had gone straight across to a small field adjoining Hillground and saw Walton working about 500‚Äì600 yards away. He said he noticed that Walton had about 6‚Äì10 yards of hedge left to cut and that, when he found his body later that day, about four additional yards of hedge had been cut, which would be about half-an-hour's work. Potter stated that he knew that it was Walton's habit to stop for lunch at around 11 am and that he would then work continuously until about 4 pm. He described Walton as an \\"inoffensive type of man but one who would speak his mind if necessary\\". The decision to request assistance from the Metropolitan Police (colloquially, \\"Scotland Yard\\") was made at an early stage. The Deputy Chief Constable of Warwickshire sent a message on 15 February which stated: > The Chief Constable has asked me to get the assistance of Scotland Yard to > assist in a brutal case of murder that took place yesterday. The deceased is > a man named CHARLES WALTON, age 75, and he was killed with an instrument > known as a slash hook. The murder was either committed by a madman or one of > the Italian prisoners who are in a camp nearby. The assistance of an Italian > interpreter would be necessary, I think. Dr Webster states deceased was > killed between 1 and 2 pm yesterday. A metal watch is missing from the body. > It is being circulated. The details of the watch that were passed to pawnbrokers and jewellers described it as: > Gents plain white metal pocket watch, snap case at back, white enamel face, > with \\"Edgar Jones, Stratford on Avon\\" thereon. Second hand. English > numerals. Valued at 25/- about ten years ago. On 16 February Chief Inspector Robert Fabian and his partner, Detective Sergeant Albert Webb arrived to assist the investigation. Later that day, Detective Sergeant Saunders of Special Branch, who was a fluent Italian speaker, also arrived. Alfred Potter quickly came under suspicion. PC Lomasney, the local policeman who knew Alfred and his wife, Lillian Elizabeth Potter, was asked to stay close to them to see what they might unwittingly reveal. Detective Sergeant Saunders began interviewing the Italian World War II prisoners of war held at Long Marston. Prisoners were apparently able to roam the area at will and although there was a schedule for work days and free days no record was kept of these movements. On the afternoon of the day of the murder some prisoners had gone into Stratford to see a play, while others had visited the cinema. However, it does not appear that any of the Italians was ever seriously considered to have killed Walton. =Post-mortem= Professor Webster's post-mortem on Walton found that Walton's trachea had been cut and that he had bruising to his chest and several broken ribs. Walton also had defensive wounds: a cut on his left hand and bruises on the back of his right hand and forearm. Webster concluded that Walton's wounds had been caused by two weapons; a stabbing weapon and a cutting weapon, presumably the pitchfork and the slash hook. Walton had also been hit over the head with his own walking stick which was found three-and-a-half yards from his body with blood and hair adhering to it. It was determined that Walton died between 1 and 2 pm. Walton's shirt had been opened, his trousers had been unfastened at the top and his fly was unbuttoned. Webster's report makes no specific mention of the cross supposedly carved on Walton's chest mentioned in some later accounts. =Alfred Potter's account of events= On 17 February, Potter was interviewed for a second time, on this occasion by Detective Sergeant Webb. Potter stated that Walton had usually worked about four days each week, but never in wet weather. Potter stated that he paid him eighteen pence per hour and usually at the end of each fortnight, although sometimes by the week. He said that he left it to Walton to say how many hours he had completed and implied that Walton was sometimes paid for hours he had not actually worked. He had last paid Walton for the fortnight ending 10 February when he had given him ¬£2.15s.0. Potter stated that on the day of the murder he had left the College Arms and gone across to a field known as Cacks Leys to see to some sheep and to feed some calves. When he reached the field it was 12.20 pm and he then saw Walton, working in his shirtsleeves. He was sure of this because it was the first time he had seen him so dressed and had said to himself, 'He's getting on with it today'. Potter added that he would have gone over to see Walton were it not for the fact that he had a heifer in a ditch nearby that needed attention. He went straight home and arrived there at about 12.40 pm. He then went to attend to the heifer. On 20 February, PC Lomasney was at The Firs and mentioned the fact that the police were still hoping to take fingerprints from the murder weapons. At this, Alfred Potter said that he had touched the handle of the slash hook, and possibly the pitchfork, when he first came across the body, although he claimed he had already mentioned this to the police. He said he had handled the weapons in response to a comment from Harry Beasley that \\"You'd better have a look to make sure he is gone\\". Mrs Potter had displayed considerable annoyance at this revelation, stating that the police were bound to suspect him if his prints were on the murder weapon. Potter, meanwhile, told Lomasney that the murder was \\"the work of a fascist from the camp\\". A short time later, a serviceman came to the door and asked for Potter who was in the yard. Lomasney recorded that, when Potter came in he said, \\"That soldier has just told me that the Military Police at the Camp have caught an Italian coming out with a suit of clothes and detained him and sent for the Civil Police who came dashing out. They have taken him away with them.\\" At this, \\"Potter affected great glee and his wife became almost hysterical with delight\\". According to Fabian's initial report Potter stated on 23 February that after his visit to Cacks Ley he had come home, read the paper for five minutes, and had then gone to help one of his workers, Charles Henry \\"Happy\\" Batchelor, to pulp some mangolds for a few minutes. Subsequently, both men had gone to look at the church clock and saw that it was 1 pm. This account was confirmed by Mrs Potter who stated that Alfred Potter had arrived home soon after 12.30 pm and had read the paper for a few minutes. He had then asked how long dinner would be and she had replied \\"Not long\\". On hearing this, Potter had gone to help Batchelor at about 12.40 pm and returned at 1.05 pm. Batchelor also confirmed that Potter had come to help him at around 12.40 pm. On 27 February, Fabian asked that enquiries be made of Stubbs & Bradstreet about any debts recorded against Alfred Potter or L. L. Potter & Co., Farmers of Campden, Gloucestershire. (Alfred Potter's father, Levi Potter, was the licensee of the Lygon Arms in Chipping Campden.) Subsequently, it was confirmed that there were no such debts. Fabian also asked for enquiries to be made at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries about the result of a \\"test wages investigation made on 12 January 1945 at Firs Farm by Inspector R. G. Elliott\\" who was apparently reluctant to reveal the information to Fabian without authority from his Headquarters. Again, in his initial crime report, Fabian recorded that, at the inquest on Charles Walton on 20 March, Potter had told the Coroner that he had seen someone in shirtsleeves in his field at 12.30 pm and that they were stationary. =Other enquiries= Edith claimed that Potter stated the following as they made their way to Hillground with Harry Beasley on the day of the murder; 'I have to do the milking on a Wednesday. I came to the field to cut some hay at 12 o'clock and saw your uncle at his work'. Edith stated that she had never heard Walton say he had ever lent anyone any money and she had not seen any IOUs. Subsequent enquiries of the Midland Bank revealed that Walton had deposited ¬£227.10s.0 in June 1930 but that by 1939 this had dwindled to ¬£11.11s.9d. Walton had made numerous withdrawals during the intervening years, but never more than ¬£10 or so at a time. Fabian's investigations also revealed that Walton's best friend was seventy-two-year-old George Higgins of Fairview, Lower Quinton, although the pair had not seen each other since the previous Christmas. Higgins was employed by Mr Valender of Upper Quinton and at the time of the murder had been working in a barn just 300 yards from Walton. Fabian speculated that Higgins could have made his way across the fields unseen and killed Walton. However, he doubted that the old man would have had the strength to mount such an attack or sufficient motive. When Harry Beasley was interviewed he told the police that he was employed by Harry Ball of Henney's Farm in the village. He said that \\"Potter had a reputation as a decent man to work for\\". On the night of 14 February he recalled Potter saying of Walton, \\"I saw him at work at 12.15\\". Beasley also confirmed that Edith Walton had been going out with one Edgar Goode for some years, although Goode was later eliminated from the police enquiries. Beasley said he was confident that Potter realised Walton was dead from the moment he saw Walton's body. The police took statements from two former employees of Potter's ‚Äì William George Dyde and George Purnell. Both confirmed that, from time to time, Potter had experienced difficulties in paying their wages. Joseph Stanley confirmed that Potter had assisted him with the castration of two calves on the morning of 14 February and that they had subsequently visited the College Arms where Potter had drunk two glasses of Guinness between 11.45 am and noon. Statements were taken from over 500 residents of Lower Quinton, some as young as eleven years old, as well as other individuals who were in and around the area on 14 February. A detailed search of the entire area surrounding the murder scene was undertaken, with the help of the Royal Engineers using mine detectors, in an attempt to find Walton's pocket watch or some other clue, but to no avail. Eventually Fabian and Webb returned to London while Detective Superintendent Alec Spooner continued to search for the murderer. The murder so fascinated Spooner that it is claimed he continued to return to the village long after the rest of the world had concluded that the perpetrator would never be found. There were reports that Walton's pocket watch was found in the outhouse of his cottage in 1960, despite an extensive search by the police at the time of the murder. Alfred Potter Alfred Potter was forty years old at the time of the murder and managed The Firs for L. L. Potter & Co. which was a company owned by his father. Robert Fabian concluded that Alfred Potter was the likely killer of Charles Walton. * Potter's behaviour on the night of the murder did not appear to be that of an innocent man. When Constable Lomasney arrived at 7.05 pm he noted that \\"Potter seemed very upset. He was shivering and complained of being cold. Looking back I think that Potter appeared more worried than one would have expected him to be.\\" After all, Lomasney reasoned, Potter was used to slaughtering animals and might have been less moved by the murder scene than other men. Lomasney was also surprised when Potter said he was going home before the Stratford police turned up. He said, \\"His complaint of feeling cold I considered a strange excuse from one who was used to attending to animals at all hours and in all kinds of weather, especially as the murdered man was his own employee and had been murdered on his own land.\\" In fact, the Stratford police turned up just as Potter was leaving. * On 17 February, Potter said he would have gone over to see Walton at Hillground on 14 February were it not for the fact that he had a heifer in a ditch nearby that he needed to attend to. He claimed he had gone straight home, arriving there at about 12.40 pm, and then went to attend to the heifer. However, the heifer was found to have drowned in Doomsday Ditch on 13 February and was not removed from The Firs until 3.30 pm on 14 February ‚Äì almost three hours after Potter claimed to have gone to attend to it. * Potter's statement about the heifer was contradicted by his statement on 23 February that he had gone home, read the paper and then helped Charles Batchelor to pulp mangolds. Fabian's comment was that \\"Potter is undoubtedly lying about his actions at this critical time but the reason for these lies can, for the present, only be a matter for conjecture\\". * Fabian's cynicism about Potter's activities between noon and 12.40 pm was increased by the fact that he variously stated he had seen Walton working in the distance at 12.10 pm, 12.15 pm and 12.20 pm, ultimately telling the inquest that he had seen 'someone' stationary at 12.30 pm. Fabian commented that \\"Thus we have Potter's story gradually changing from seeing Charles Walton working at hedgecutting at 12.10 pm to seeing a man standing stationary in the field at 12.30 pm\\". * Potter's statements about seeing Walton at work invariably said that he was in his shirtsleeves. However, when his body was found, he was wearing a jacket. Underneath this jacket he was wearing a shirt, but the sleeves were cut off above the elbow. Thus Potter could not have seen Walton in his shirtsleeves. In Fabian's view, even if Potter had merely seen Walton with his jacket off, \\"it seems improbable he would have worked in shirt sleeves at 12.20 and then put his jacket on, unless he had decided to go home\\". * On 20 February, Potter said he had previously mentioned to the police that he had touched the murder weapons and that this had been at Harry Beasley's instigation. However, this was the first time he had made such a claim to the police, and Beasley strongly refuted any question that he had asked Potter to make sure Walton was dead: Beasley said it was patently obvious that he was dead and that Potter did not touch the weapons in his presence. Fabian's comment was that Potter produced this explanation only when Lomasney broached the question of fingerprints on 20 February; he considered that Potter had \\"gone to great pains to explain away any of his fingerprints which might be found upon the weapons ...\\". In the event, no prints were found. * Potter's suggestion that he might occasionally pay Walton for hours he had not worked was disproved by an examination of the sums he had indented for wages from L. L. Potter & Co. and those he had paid to Walton. What Potter was in reality doing was claiming more than he needed to pay his employee, and pocketing the difference. Fabian's comment was that \\"Potter, by his own admission, is guilty of claiming more wages than were due and there is no doubt that he was making a good thing out of Walton's employment by him\\". * After Fabian and Webb had returned to London, the police constable who had relieved Lomasney and stood guard over the murder scene reported that Potter had returned to Hillground soon after first light on 15 February. The policeman had warned Potter away from the actual site of the murder. Potter had exchanged a few pleasantries about the coldness of the weather, given the constable a Player's cigarette and then left. This revelation brought Fabian and Webb back for another interview with Potter and some searching questions about why he had not told them earlier about visiting the scene. However, this interview does not seem to have advanced the case any further, although it was noted that \\"Happy\\" Batchelor and another employee of Potter's had both resigned since the murder. Fabian believed both had possibly realised the nature of the man for whom they were working. He also wondered if Batchelor had compromised himself by stating that he had seen Potter at 12.40 pm. * The trousers that Potter had worn on 14 February were described as being made from Bedford cord. There were two marks on the front that Professor Webster believed were blood stains; however, he reported that they had been cleaned too thoroughly for a positive analysis. The key for the police was establishing Potter's movements between 12 noon, when he parted company from Joseph Stanley at the College Arms, and 12.40 pm when Charles Batchelor said he saw him at The Firs. Despite Potter changing his story in various ways, Fabian concluded that there was \\"no real evidence to connect him with the murder itself, and no reasonable motive can be found for his committing it\\". Fabian found that there was no evidence that Potter was violent or that he and Walton had ever quarrelled. He described Potter as morose and sullen at his interviews although, even when \\"closely interrogated\\", he \\"never lost his temper\\" and was civil. He wrote that Potter was \\"unkempt\\" and \\"on the surface dull witted\\" although \\"I am convinced he is far from that\\". Indeed, Fabian believed Potter to be a \\"man of considerable strength\\" and an \\"extremely cunning individual\\". Although a number of writers have suggested that Walton had lent Potter money and its repayment was overdue, there is no proof that this was the case.The Who‚Äôs Who of Unsolved Murders by James Morton Ann Tennant Ann Tennant was a resident of Long Compton, fifteen miles from Lower Quinton, and was murdered at the age of eighty. On 15 September 1875, at about 8 o'clock in the evening, Ann Tennant left her house to buy a loaf of bread. On her way back, she met some farm workers returning home from harvesting in the fields. One of the group was a local man, James Heywood, who had known Ann's family for many years. Heywood was simple-minded and was seen as something akin to a village idiot. It is known that he had also been drinking cider. Without warning he attacked Ann Tennant with a pitchfork, stabbing her in the legs and head. A local farmer named Taylor heard the commotion and ran to Ann's aid. He restrained Heywood until a constable arrived. Ann was taken to her daughter's house but died of her injuries at around 11.15 that night. Heywood claimed that Ann was a witch and that there were other witches in the village whom he intended to deal with in the same way. Although committed to trial for murder, he was found not guilty on the grounds of insanity and spent the rest of his life in Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. He is recorded as dying there, at the age of 59, in the first half of 1890.Stratford upon Avon Herald ‚Äì 17 December 1875 On 13 February 1954, the eve of the ninth anniversary of Walton's murder, the Daily Mirror revisited the killing of Ann Tennant and alleged similarity between that event and Walton's murder. The report stated: \\"The police have found one other link between the killings, but I am pledged not to reveal it.\\"Daily Mirror ‚Äì 13 February 1954 One possible explanation was that the police had discovered that Charles Walton and Ann Tennant were related. Charles Walton had a first cousin, twice removed, named John Haynes. In December 1867, John Haynes married Sarah Cook whose first cousin, once removed, was Elizabeth Clifton, the wife of Joseph Tennant, Ann Tennant's eldest son. Alternatively, the police may have believed there was a closer connection: Charles Walton's great-grandparents were Thomas Walton and Ann Smith. Ann Smith was Ann Tennant's maiden name and she was born in 1794. It is feasible that it was she who married Thomas Walton on 2 January 1812 in Ebrington, Gloucestershire, when she would have been 17 or 18. She could then have given birth to William Walton, the victim's grandfather, in 1814 and, assuming that her husband subsequently died, could have married John Tennant in April 1819 in Long Compton. If this tenuous possibility were to be proved true, Ann Tennant was Charles Walton's great-grandmother. Claims of witchcraft The two reports that Fabian wrote on the case in 1945 and which are preserved on the police file make no mention of witchcraft, ritualistic killing, black dogs, natterjack toads or blood sacrifices. However, twenty-five years later he wrote the following: > I advise anybody who is tempted at any time to venture into Black Magic, > witchcraft, Shamanism ‚Äì call it what you will ‚Äì to remember Charles Walton > and to think of his death, which was clearly the ghastly climax of a pagan > rite. There is no stronger argument for keeping as far away as possible from > the villains with their swords, incense and mumbo-jumbo. It is prudence on > which your future peace of mind and even your life could depend.The Anatomy > of Crime by Robert Fabian It has been claimed that Fabian was acquainted with two pieces of local history. The first related to the murder of Ann Tennant by James Heywood, on the grounds that she was a witch. In many accounts it has been erroneously claimed that Ann was pinned to the ground with a pitchfork and slashed with a bill-hook. Additionally, Detective Superintendent Alec Spooner, Head of Warwickshire C.I.D., is said to have drawn Fabian's attention to a 1929 book entitled Folklore, Old Customs and Superstitions in Shakespeare Land, written by the Rev. James Harvey Bloom, Rector of Whitchurch, and father of author Ursula Bloom. This included the story of how, in 1885, a young plough boy named Charles Walton had met a phantom black dog on his way home from work on several nights in succession. On the last occasion the dog had been accompanied by a headless woman. That night Walton heard that his sister had died. Amongst the theories and rumours that surrounded this case in subsequent years are the following: * It was claimed that locals believed that Walton was a witch whose powers were feared by some villagers. It was claimed he could cast the evil eye and kept natterjack toads as pets and used them to \\"blast\\"(blight) the crops and livestock of local farmers. Two examples cited were the failure of the 1944 harvest and the death of Potter's heifer on 13 February. It was claimed that this alleged witchcraft led him to be murdered in a ritualistic manner which involved his blood soaking into the ground to ‚Äòreplenish the soil's fertility‚Äô. * Local folklore held that phantom black dogs roamed the area and were a harbinger of death. It was claimed that, soon after Walton's murder, a black dog was found hanging from a tree close to the murder scene. Fabian wrote that he encountered a black dog while walking at dusk on Meon Hill. The story he related was that dog ran past him and shortly afterwards he met a local boy walking in the same direction. He asked the boy if he was looking for his dog, but when Fabian mentioned the animal's colour, the boy turned a deathly pale and fled in the opposite direction. MythsAnn Tennant was murdered in the same way as Walton= The claims that Ann was pinned to the ground with a pitchfork or slashed with a bill-hook are pure invention. She was attacked in the view of several witnesses and the only similarity with Walton's murder was the fact that a pitchfork was used in both instances. =Walton was the boy in the story of the black dog= There is no evidence that the Charles Walton mentioned in Bloom's book was one and the same as the murdered Charles Walton. The latter had three older sisters and two younger brothers. If the Charles Walton in the story was subsequently the murder victim, he would need to have had a sister who died during 1885. However, his sisters Mary Ann and Martha Walton both married in 1891 and lived for some years thereafter, while Harriett ‚Äì in reality Charles's half-sister ‚Äì was still alive in 1901. Consequently, the story must have related to another Charles Walton unless Emma, his mother, gave birth to a fourth daughter between the April 1881 Census and the end of 1885. The 1841 Census, taken on 7 June 1841, conveniently records Charles's mother as being just 9 months old, implying that she was born around August or September 1840. In April 1881 she would have been almost 41 years old, without having given birth ‚Äì at least to a living child ‚Äì for some five or six years. It is highly unlikely that she did so during the next five years, especially since a detailed study of the birth, marriage and death records held by the Office for National Statistics has failed to produce any likely Walton births or deaths being registered in the Shipston or Stratford-upon-Avon areas during that period. =Walton was murdered close to a Druid stone circle in a Druidical ceremony= Fabian stated in Fabian of the Yard that: > One of my most memorable murder cases was at the village of Lower Quinton, > near the stone Druid circle of the Whispering Knights. There a man had been > killed by a reproduction of a Druidical ceremony on St Valentine's > Eve.Fabian of the Yard by Robert Fabian Gerald B. Gardner stated in his book, The Meaning of Witchcraft: > ... the Whispering Knights are not a circle; they are not Druidical, and > they are about twelve miles away, as the crow flies, from Lower Quinton. Nor > was Charles Walton killed on St Valentine's Eve; and as no one knows for > certain just what the Druid's ceremonies were, it is impossible to say that > his death was a reproduction of one. Apart from these details, the > description is accurate.The Meaning of Witchcraft by Gerald B. Gardner =Fabian met a wall of silence over the crime= The police took numerous statements from individuals and while Fabian was happy in later years to suggest that he had met 'a wall of silence', the most he would say in 1945 was that \\"The natives of Upper and Lower Quinton and the surrounding district are of a secretive disposition and they do not take easily to strangers\\". However, the truth may be that no one had seen anything and therefore had nothing to tell.

Paul G√∂sch (30 August 1885 - 22 August 1940), also Goesch or G√∂schen, was a German artist, architect, lithographer, and designer of the early twentieth century; he was associated with the main elements of German Expressionism.Anonymous, Paul G√∂sch, 1885-1940: Aquarelle und Zeichnungen, Berlin, Berlinische Galerie, 1976 (exhibition catalogue).Wolfgang Pehnt, Expressionist Architecture, Wetsport, CT, Praeger, 1973.Peter Selz, German Expressionist Painting, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1957. Beginnings G√∂sch was born in Schwerin. He suffered from \\"physical and emotional frailty\\" throughout his life, but nonetheless maintained \\"a robust determination to create prolifically and to further the utopian causes of the avant-garde of his time.\\"Virginia Haddad, \\"Paul G√∂sch,\\" in: Timothy O. Benson et al., Expressionist Utopias: Paradise, Metropolis, Architectural Fantasy, Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001; p. 205. Born in Schwerin, the son of a lawyer and judge, G√∂sch grew up in Berlin, where his father held a teaching position at the University of Berlin. G√∂sch matriculated in the technical college at Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1903 to study architecture. As a student, he reportedly met both Sigmund Freud and Rudolf Steiner. He developed an interest in Anthroposophy, Steiner's version of Theosophy, and later helped construct the Goetheanum in 1913-14\\\\. He also suffered his earliest psychiatric hospitalization (1909), but still attained his academic degree. He studied painting in San Remo for six months, and traveled through Italy, France, and Germany, meeting other artists. In 1911 he accepted a post at Kulm (now Che≈Çmno in Poland), and served as city architect there from 1915 to 1917. Creator G√∂sch began a series of \\"fantasy architecture\\" plans and sketches in 1914.Benson et al., pp. 33, 117, 131. He suffered a psychotic episode in 1917, and was hospitalized until 1919. After his release he became associated with the November Group and the Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst and showed works in their exhibitions. He also was a member of the Glass Chain group. G√∂sch worked with Bruno Taut in Magdeburg on a 1920 restoration project; Taut published artwork and essays by G√∂sch in his Expressionist journal Fr√ºhlicht (\\"Daybreak\\" or \\"First Light\\"). Artistically, G√∂sch was a \\"Specialist in water color\\"Ulrich Conrads and Hans-G√ºnther Sperlich, The Architecture of Fantasy: Utopian Building and Planning in Modern Times, Westport, CT, Praeger, 1962; p. 159. who executed hundreds of images, often of mythological and religious subjects (especially the Virgin Mary). He also wrote and illustrated fairy tales and composed poetry (in the latter, he was strongly influenced by the poet Stefan George). Mental patient From 1921 on, G√∂sch increasingly suffered from psychological difficulties; he became a patient at G√∂ttingen where his brother-in-law was the head of the psychiatric institution. G√∂sch's murals on the walls of his room still exist there. (At the time he was diagnosed with \\"dementia praecox,\\" what modern psychiatry would likely diagnose as schizophrenia.) In 1934, under the Nazi regime, G√∂sch was transferred to the Psychiatric Hospital of Brandenburg at Teupitz, where he was not allowed to paint and forced into manual labor. In 1940, personnel from the SS removed G√∂sch from Teupitz and murdered him; he was one of the thousands of victims of Action T4, the Nazi euthanasia campaign. The date and place of his execution have been disputed; the most reliable data indicate 22 August 1940, probably at the old prison in Brandenburg. The combination of artwork and psychiatric problems in G√∂sch's biography has brought him some attention in the context of the outsider art or \\"art brut\\" movement.Eberhard Roters, \\"Paul Goesch,\\" in: Rough Art, No. 21, Lausanne, Collection of Rough Art, 2001.

It was the fifth tropical cyclone of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. The depression developed out of a weak tropical wave which formed off the coast of Africa on June 23. The wave remained poorly organized throughout its journey through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The wave entered the Eastern Pacific on July 2 after passing through Central America. The wave developed into an area of low pressure that afternoon. The low moved towards the northwest, paralleling the coastline. Continued development led to the eventual upgrade of the low to Tropical Depression Five-E on July 5. It was initially thought that the depression would become a tropical storm before landfall but the winds failed to increase above 35 mph (55 km/h). The depression made a turn towards the north-northwest and made landfall on July 7. It dissipated shortly after landfall due to the mountainous terrain. The depression produced heavy rainfall in parts of southwestern Mexico, peaking at . These rains triggered flooding that killed two people and left roughly MXN 30 million ($2.2 million) in damages. Meteorological history Tropical Depression Five-E formed out of a weak tropical wave, associated with scattered convection, which formed off the coast of Africa on June 23. The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23 mph (37 km/h), due to an area of high pressure located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow. Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was on either side of the axis-- the center of the storm--but was mainly in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The wave remained very close to the intertropical convergence zone for the next several days without any further development. On June 26, a small burst of moisture in the system was noted in the area of the wave, but no other notable development occurred. On July 2, the wave moved over Central America and produced scattered areas of strong convection off the coast of Honduras. Later in the day, the center of the wave became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT satellite pass. By the afternoon, the wave developed into an area of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present. Not long after the alert was issued, deep convection disappeared from the low while located 400 mi (645 km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the next morning. The low was moving slowly towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11 mph (18 km/h). The low remained disorganized for the next two days as it steadily moved towards the northwest. During the morning of July 5, deep convection rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear. The convection persisted into the afternoon and the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five-E accordingly. Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4 mph (6 km/h) to 5 mph (8 km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur as the system tracked steadily towards the north- northwest. Early on July 7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated several hours later over the mountains of Mexico. Preparations and impact The graphic from the National Hurricane Center's final advisory on Tropical Depression Five-E As Tropical Depression Five-E approached Mexico, the country's government released tropical storm watches and warnings for certain parts of the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked to keep an eye on the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution. The tropical depression produced of rain in Manzanillo, with other locations also experiencing isolated rainfall. Cerro de Ortega, Colima reported of rain in a 24-hour period. The community of Ometepec reported . Other locations reported moderate rainfall, ranging around . One person was swept away by flood waters, reaching in depth. Heavy rains from the depression resulted in a traffic accident that killed one person and injured two others. In all, damages from the storm amounted to MXN 30 million ($2.2 million).

Alexander Salton played football for Richmond Football Club in the 1880s and 1890s, long prior to their admission to the VFL. When he enlisted in the AIF on 6 August 1915 he was 45 years old. The following day he umpired his only Richmond match and a fortnight later his last VFL match before entering camp at Broadmeadows. Originally allocated to the 12th reinforcements of the 6th Battalion he left Australia aboard the HMAT Ceramic on 23 November 1915. On arrival in Egypt he suffered from varicose veins leading to a month in hospital. This period coincided with the reorganisation of the AIF and when Salton was returned to duty he was transferred to the newly formed 60th Battalion. Another minor bout of varicose veins preceded his embarkation to France. As a result, rather than joining the full battalion, he was placed in the 15th Training Battalion and then at the 5th Divisional Base Depot after he arrived at Marseilles on 30 June 1916. This transfer meant that Salton was not present at the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July. That action resulted in the virtual destruction of the 60th Battalion. They suffered 757 casualties from a pre-action strength of 887. On 29 August Salton eventually joined the battalion as reinforcement for the massive battle losses. Straightaway he was in the front line in the Fromelles area. The hazards of trench warfare were ever present. Shrapnel and high-explosive shells, snipers and trench raids all occurred in the short time Salton survived. Five days after arriving Salton was mortally wounded. Shot in the stomach, he was evacuated through the 14th Field Ambulance to the 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station where he clung to life for six days before dying of his wounds on 10 September.Salton 's service record,, NAA item 8074702 accessed on 30 April 2009 Salton was buried at Estaires Communal Cemetery in France.

At least, that was, until many years later when Richmond Football Club historian, Rhett Bartlett, came across a gold locket inscribed 'For Services Rendered. A. Salton. 1887' in a Hawthorn antique shop. It had been presented at the club Annual General Meeting and remains a link to the only VFL umpire to have died in military service of his nation.

Listed at and , he threw right-handed and batted left-handed. Biography Kuhn was born in 1899 in Vicksburg, Michigan, and attended Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) where he played college baseball. In his senior season of 1923, he was the team captain. Detail of Kuhn's minor league baseball career is lacking. He was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization in February 1924, at which time it was noted that he had been playing semi-pro baseball during the prior two years. He attended spring training with the Indians in Hot Springs, Arkansas, prior to the 1924 season. He played much of that season with the Utica Utes of the early New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League, compiling a 5‚Äì10 win‚Äìloss record in 19 games. He then pitched in five games for the Terre Haute Tots in August, registering a 1‚Äì3 record. He was transferred to the major league Indians on August 26. Line score from Kuhn's only major league appearance On September 1, 1924, Kuhn made his only major league appearance, pitching for Cleveland against the St. Louis Browns in an away game played at Sportsman's Park. Kuhn entered the first game of a doubleheader in the bottom of the eighth inning, with the score tied, 8‚Äì8. Cleveland's prior pitcher, reliever Paul Fitzke, had allowed two runs in four innings of work, in what was also Fitzke's only major league appearance. The first batter that Kuhn faced, future hall of famer George Sisler, reached base on an infield single, and the next batter, left fielder Ken Williams, hit a home run. This was followed by a single, sacrifice bunt, single (scoring another run), fly out, and then a ground out to end the inning. Overall, in his one inning of work, Kuhn had faced seven batters and allowed three runs on four hits. As the Indians were unable to score in the top of the ninth inning, Kuhn was the losing pitcher for Cleveland. It does not appear that Kuhn continued his professional baseball career beyond 1924, as in March 1925 he was back at Michigan Agricultural College, where he would be helping to mentor the team's pitchers. In 1926, he was pitching in a local Michigan league, against opponents such as a team from the Fisher Body company. In 1928, he took a job as a farms crop specialist in Marquette, Michigan; at that time, it was noted that he had been teaching agriculture for three years at the high school in St. Johns, Michigan. Kuhn died in 1956 in Detroit, a week after undergoing surgery; he was interred in Lansing, Michigan. He had worked in agriculture since graduating from college, and had been a member of Michigan State's agricultural extension office since 1928. He had also spent two years doing research at the University of the Ryukyus in Japan. Kuhn was married and had one daughter.

The injection and extraction is often done by means of a well. In areas where the rainwater cannot percolate the soil or where it is not capable of percolating it fast enough (i.e. urban areas) and where the rainwater is thus diverted to rivers, rainwater ASR could help to keep the rainwater within an area. ASR is used for municipal, industrial and agricultural purposes. ASR use in the United States Colorado = The first ASR well with a downhole control valve was installed in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, in 1992 for Centennial Water and Sanitation District. Since then, over 40 ASR wells have been installed for many different municipalities. These wells range in depths from to below ground surface, with injection rates commonly between and per minute (gpm) per well. =Florida= The use of ASR in Florida has been examined to determine potential benefits for the Everglades and other Floridian water systems under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). An estimate of 333 ASR wells would be implemented as part of CERP and used to store, treat and supply excess surface water to the Everglades and other systems of water during dry periods. Controversy Doubts remain about the benefit of introducing ASR in such large capacity to Florida due to a predominantly karst geography. Current or potential problems include: (1) poor recovery due to mixing of the injected fresh water with the existing brackish to saline water in the aquifer; (2) pre-existing quality of water introduced to ASR; and (3) potential risk of resulting water quality due to mixing of injected freshwater and existing aquifer. =Oregon= The first agriculture ASR wells were put into service in Oregon in the autumn of 2006 and have injected well over of water during the winter and spring flood flow times using artificial recharge (AR) of flood water as their water source. This shallow recharged water is then recovered as potable water and injected into the deep basalt aquifer. During the injection process, electrical energy can be generated by the head pressure of the water flowing back into the aquifer. This stored water is recovered during late summer and early autumn for irrigation needs. Both of these well types use a down-hole control valve. ASR can also be used to re- inject water used by HVAC systems to maintain the ground water levels and store the thermal differences from summertime cooling for winter time heating. Industry can also capture cold winter waters and store it for summertime use and avoid the need for cooling water in the summer for industrial processes. This may also free up short supplies of summer time water for other beneficial uses. This reinjection process may also avoid the cost of surface disposal and avoid the increased thermal load to the rivers and streams during the summer air conditioning season. =Texas= The Texan cities of El Paso, Kerrville and San Antonio use ASR, providing water resources to these water-vulnerable communities.Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14. A University of Florida report ranked daily per-capita water availability for 225 large urban areas across the U.S.Water availability ranking for 225 urban areas in the United States. Environmental Hydrology Laboratory at the University of Florida. Retrieved 2/11/14. The study weighed fresh water available to cities from naturally occurring and constructed sources such as reservoirs, aquifers and imports. Of the cities reviewed, San Antonio ranked last, or most vulnerable, and El Paso ranked as 10th-worst, though other Texas cities made the list. San Antonio stores drinking water in its Carrizo ASR facility, which contains more than 91,000 acre-feet of water and has a maximum capacity of 120,000 acre- feet. A 2010 Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) survey of Texas water utilities found four primary objections to ASR in other parts of Texas: legal and physical limitations, the quality of the recovered water, cost- effectiveness and the potential for other pumpers to capture the utility's stored water. ASR use in Australia Newly constructed wetland for final stage treatment of urban stormwater runoff for an ASR scheme in western Adelaide, South AustraliaCity of Charles Sturt > Major Projects > Water Proofing the West Accessed 23 March 2014. In South Australia, the City of Salisbury in northern Adelaide has since 1994 played a pioneering role in establishing the viability of the capture and treatment of urban stormwater runoff within artificial wetlands, and injecting the treated water into Tertiary aquifers in winter, for later use by industry, and for irrigation of city parks and school playing fields in summer.City of Salisbury > Environment > Wetlands and Water Accessed 22 March 2014.

The issue is frequently described as an invisible problem,\\"The invisible problem\\". despite its prevalence.\\"HUMAN RIGHTS: More Than 100 Million Homeless Worldwide\\" . Writers and other artists play a role in bringing the issue to public attention. Homelessness is the central theme of many works; in other works homelessness is secondary, added to advance the story or contribute to dramatic effect. Homelessness is the central subject in most of the works of art listed here. Depictions of homelessness The homeless are frequently divided as either protagonists or antagonists. Characters, like Chaplin's Little Tramp, provide light-hearted humor through lovable personalities. Fred Glass writes the social type of Chaplin's character represented was familiar and emotionally appealing. One account given is that Chaplin based his character on a man whom he had met in San Francisco in 1914. Other popular culture depicts the homeless as mentally ill, or even psychotic.

Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B. McKusick \\"Fluorine Compounds, Organic\\" in \\"Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\\" 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. The general approach represents an application of electrosynthesis. The fluorinated chemical compounds produced by ECF are useful because of their distinctive solvation properties and the relative inertness of carbon‚Äìfluorine bonds. Two ECF synthesis routes are commercialized and commonly applied: the Simons process and the Phillips Petroleum process. It is also possible to electrofluorinate in various organic media.Fred G. Drakesmith \\"Electrofluorination of Organic Compounds\\" Topics in Current Chemistry,Vol. 193, Springer, Berlin-Heidelberg, 1997. Prior to the development of these methods, fluorination with fluorine, a dangerous oxidant, was a dangerous and wasteful process. Also, ECF can be cost-effective but it may also result in low yields. Simons process The Simons process, named after Joseph H. Simons entails electrolysis of a solution of an organic compound in a solution of hydrogen fluoride. An individual reaction can be described as: :R3C-H + HF ‚Üí R3C-F + H2 In the course of a typical synthesis, this reaction occurs once for each C-H bond in the precursor. The cell potential is maintained near 5-6 V. The anode is nickel-plated. Simons discovered the process in the 1930s at Pennsylvania State College (U.S.), under the sponsorship of the 3M Corporation. The results were not published until after World War II because the work was classified due to its relevance to the manufacture of uranium hexafluoride. In 1949 Simons and his coworkers published a long paper in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. The Simons process is used for the production of perfluorinated amines, ethers, carboxylic acids, and sulfonic acids. For carboxylic and sulfonic acids, the products are the corresponding acyl and sulfonyl fluorides. The method has been adapted to laboratory-scale preparations. Two noteworthy considerations are (i) the hazards associated with hydrogen fluoride (the solvent and fluorine source) and (ii) the requirement for anhydrous conditions. Phillips Petroleum process This method is similar to the Simons Process but is typically applied to the preparation from volatile hydrocarbons and chlorohydrocarbons. In this process, electrofluorination is conducted at porous graphite anodes in molten potassium fluoride in hydrogen fluoride. The species KHF2 is relatively low melting, a good electrolyte, and an effective source of fluorine. The technology is sometimes called ‚ÄúCAVE‚Äù for Carbon Anode Vapor Phase Electrochemical Fluorination and was widely used at manufacturing sites of the 3M Corporation. The organic compound is fed through a porous anode leading to exchange of fluorine for hydrogen but not chlorine. Other methods ECF has also been conducted in organic media, using for example organic salts of fluoride and acetonitrile as the solvent. A typical fluoride source is (C2H5)3N:3HF. In some cases, acetonitrile is omitted, and the solvent and electrolyte are the triethylamine-HF mixture. Representative products of this method are fluorobenzene (from benzene) and 1,2-difluoroalkanes (from alkenes).

Overview In this book, he explores the Earth's supply of potential replacement fuels for oil. Beyond Oil evaluates a range of primary energy sources (\\"fuels from the earth\\"), from petroleum to heavy oil, oil shale, tar sands, natural gas, coal, uranium, and hydrogen (which, as he notes, is actually an energy carrier and not a source), and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of each. Finally making scientific based policy decisions is a task for all citizens. The book begins with brief explanations of the supply problem of liquid hydrocarbons used mostly as transportation fuel. Then he explains a simpler math version of Hubbert's differential calculus to estimate what is available in the ground, see Hubbert linearization. The middle part covers the different energy resources which are available in the ground. Additionally the hydrogen path is discussed including conversion options and efficiencies from different energy forms (coal to electricity) into this gaseous energy carrier.

He studied at Sale Agricultural High School; and was transferred to Melbourne High School in 1914, where he was a popular and successful Manual arts teacher. At the time of his enlistment (19 June 1915) he was still working there as a school teacher. He is the great uncle of Gary Ablett Sr., and the great, great uncle of Gary Ablett Jr.. Footballer Recruited from the Melbourne Teachers Training College, he played his first senior VFL match for Carlton on 18 May 1912, on the half-forward flank, against Collingwood, at Princes Park.The players left the field believing the match was drawn; however, it was immediately discovered that the scoreboard did not match the goal umpires' scorecards, and that an extra behind had been displayed for Carlton. The match was awarded to Collingwood, by one point (Collingwood's Success: A One-Point Win, The Argus, (Monday, 20 May 1912), p.5.) He played two senior games for Carlton in his first year (1912), eight in his second (1913), and one in his third (1914). He transferred to Melbourne, playing his first senior match on 6 June 1914 against University (he scored three goals). He was suspended for three weeks, when playing for Carlton, in June 1913 for elbowing Allan Belcher in a spiteful match against Essendon on 21 June 1913 (Belcher was suspended for four weeks for elbowing Williamson).Football: Charges Investigated: Two Players Disqualified, The Argus, (Thursday, 26 June 1913), p.7. On his transfer to Melbourne, he was suspended for three weeks for \\"rough conduct\\" during the 11 July 1914 match against St Kilda, and for 15 weeks for \\"elbowing and general roughness\\" during the match against Richmond on 22 August 1914 (his first match on return from the earlier suspension). Soldier He enlisted on 19 June 1915; and, according to his service record, he held the rank of sergeant whilst training, was promoted to second lieutenant on 1 February 1916, to lieutenant on 10 March 1916, and to captain on 4 July 1916. He served with distinction at Gallipoli, Egypt, and in France. One of the statements gathered by the Red Cross investigating the circumstances of Williamson's wounding.Red Cross Wounded and Missing Records: Alfred Williamson, p.3.

Mah. It is a coming of middle age film as four high school friends reuniting after 25 years, each facing a crossroads in their life as they ask themselves, \\"Is that all there is?\\" The film won Best Canadian Film at the 2010 Buffalo Niagara Film Festival, and lead Maria del Mar received a Canadian Comedy Award for her performance.  Plot  Barb (40s) takes a break from the stresses of work and home. With hopes of recapturing the optimism and enthusiasm she once had, Barb rents out a hotel suite to reunite with her former high school friends ‚Äî Patti, Karen and Liz. A knock on the door, and Patti and Karen arrive. Patti, a perky, but not so bright wife and mother, is excited to escape her domineering husband for a weekend. Karen, whose life seems in much better shape, is just happy to be with old friends. After initial pleasantries and lies, it seems everything is going well with each other's lives. In an attempt to break from the ties to the lives they have left at home, Patti and Barb hide each other's cell phones- freeing themselves for one night. The women head out to a local bar, but end up dragging back Patti. They tie her to a chair for aggressively hitting on a 20-year-old. The interrogations from Barb and Karen are interrupted by the arrival of LIZ, a newly divorced, single mother and career woman. Patti confesses that as of late, she finds herself uncontrollably attracted to younger men. Unexpected at this time in her life, she is having a sexual awakening. With increasingly more wine on board, Barb admits that she is unhappy with her life- having built a life for herself for all these years and realizing she hates what she has built. She seriously considers to leave her husband and family- to be set free. No more burden or responsibilities. Karen, always sensible, tries to reassure Barb to stay in the life she is in- to fix the problems without running away. Liz strongly disagrees, arguing that she should free herself from the suffocating life. Liz and Karen get into a heated argument, each justifying the choices Barb should make. To discredit Karen, Liz reveals that Karen's husband is having an affair. Barb and Patti are shocked to learn that Karen has no intention of leaving her marriage despite her husband's continuing adultery. It is difficult for the friends to support Karen and her decision. Patti decides she is no longer taking advice from Karen and storms out to return to the bar in search of her 20-year-old. As the hours pass, Barb, Liz, and Karen settle their differences over the contents of the hotel mini-bar. Liz confesses to Barb that being a single mother, middle-aged divorcee is not as fun and glamorous as it seems. it becomes apparent that each of their lives is a mess. Once Patti returns, the girls retire for the night-all relieved that Patti is safe and unharmed from the evening. Patti's life, however, has been shattered. Having gone back to seduce the 20-year-old, she finds that her looks and charms don't work anymore. She is rejected by the 20-year-old. A devastating discovery for her. For the first time in her life, Patti realizes she is old. Not knowing how to handle the truth, she has sex with a stranger in the alley. Patti begs Barb to help her keep this secret from Karen and Liz. To cover up Patti's tears before the other women see them, Barb impulsively shoves a lemon in Patti's eye. The next morning, Karen, Liz and Patti get ready to go back to their lives. Liz sees that Barb is at a crossroads and advises her that she must choose a road- any road. After the friends leave, Barb gets a phone call from her husband. Barb makes her decision. She prepares a list of food that is needed for dinner that evening. Barb returns home, but it's not to the same place.

Illustration by F. H. Townsend in the second edition of Charlotte Bront√´'s 1847 novel Jane Eyre.Cross-dressing as a literary motif is well attested in older literature but is becoming increasingly popular in modern literature as well. It is often associated with character nonconformity and sexuality rather than gender identity.  Analysis and function of the motif  Female characters who cross-dress as men are also frequently portrayed as having done so to attain a higher social or economic position, a phenomenon known as the social progress narrative. Assuming a male identity allows them to travel safely, pursue jobs traditionally only available to men, and find heterosexual romance by breaking away from the all-female social world of the private sphere during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These characters are generally described as heroic, courageous, and virtuous. Craft-Fairchild (1998) argues that the motif of female-to-male cross-dressing symbolizes women‚Äôs discontent with their relegation to the domestic sphere of society. However, the discovery of the characters‚Äô assigned sex is often met with disapproval, indicating the endurance of traditional expectations of femininity. Male-to-female cross-dressing is much less common in literature, and it is often used for comedic value or as a form of punishment for a male character. When it does appear, characters are often negatively feminized or portrayed as villains, in contrast to the heroism among female-to-male cross- dressers. The most well known example of this concept is the wolf from Little Red Riding Hood.Jones, Christine A. (2016). \\"Cross-Dressing.\\" In Haase, Donald and Anne E. Duggan. Folktales and Fairy Tales: Traditions and Texts from around the World. Greenwood Publishing. pp. 241-243. . Male-to-female cross- dressing is also almost always more closely linked to a character‚Äôs sexuality and that of their partners than in female-to-male cross-dressing. The following is a partial list of literary works that address the motif of cross- dressing:  Ancient and medieval literature  *Achilles on Skyros (Achilleid, 1st century) *Roman de Silence (13th century) *√ûrymskvi√∞a from the Poetic Edda - Thor dresses as a bride and Loki as the bridesmaid to retrieve Thor's hammer Mj√∂lnir. In the myth of the Trojan War, Achilles' mother Thetis wanted to keep him from joining the Greek forces (and thus dying in battle as was prophesied), so she dresses him in women's clothes and hides him among a cloister of women. When the Greek envoy arrives to fetch him for battle, Odysseus is suspicious of Achilles' absence and concocts a scheme to reveal the deception: he offers gifts to all the women, including among them a sword and shield. Then he has an alarm sounded, and when Achilles instinctively grabs the weapons to defend himself, the ruse is revealed and he must join the Greek army and fight at Troy. In Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, Bradamante, being a knight, wears full-plate armor; similarly, Britomart wears full-plate armor in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. Intentionally or not, this disguises them as men, and they are taken as such by other characters. In Orlando Furioso, Fiordespina falls in love with Bradamante; her brother Ricciardetto disguises himself as his sister, dressing as a woman, persuades Fiordespina that he is Bradamante, magically changed into a man to make their love possible, and in his female attire is able to conduct a love affair with her. Early modern literature *Several of William Shakespeare's works include cross-dressing. William Shakespeare made substantial use of cross- dressing for female characters who took on masculine clothing to carry out actions difficult for women. In The Merchant of Venice, Portia and her maid dress as men to plead in court on the merchant's behalf, and are quite successful in their ruse; in the same play, Shylock's daughter Jessica dresses as a man to elope with her Christian lover. Twelfth Night, or What You Will deals extensively with cross-dressing through the female protagonist Viola. She disguises herself as Cesario and immediately finds herself caught up in a love triangle: she loves Duke Orsino who loves Countess Olivia who loves Cesario. Luckily, all is resolved when Viola's presumed dead twin brother Sebastian comes along. We only see Viola as Viola in one scene; for the rest of the play she is dressed as Cesario. When Rosalind and Celia flee court in As You Like It, Rosalind dresses, for their protection, as a man. However, as a way to further complicate the situation for comedic effect, Shakespeare has Rosalind's male character \\"Ganymede\\" dress as a woman to help a male friend, Orlando de Boys, practice wooing Rosalind, with whom he is smitten, while at the same time fending off the affections Phoebe has for \\"Ganymede\\". In other words, it is a man, (the actor), dressing as a woman, dressing as a man, dressing as a woman. **The Merchant of Venice (c1657) a play by William Shakespeare in which Portia dresses as a man in order to defend Antonio against Shylock's suit for the 'pound of flesh' he is owed as forfeiture for failing to repay a debt in time. **Cymbeline (c1611) in which Cymbeline's daughter Imogen dresses as a page and calls herself \\"Fidele\\". *Belle-Belle ou Le Chevalier Fortun√© (1698) - a fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy in which the female protagonist, Belle-Belle, disguises herself as a male knight to help the ruler of her kingdom defeat an emperor. *Edmund Spenser's \\"The Faerie Queene\\" includes a long section about Britomart, who dons male armor, falls in love with a woman, and has many adventures as a man. *Mademoiselle de Maupin by Theophile Gautier (1834) in which the eponymous heroine dresses as a man to discover what men are like when not in the company of women before she gets married. In Arcadia, Sir Philip Sidney has one of the heroes, Pyrocles, disguise himself as an Amazon called Zelmane in order to approach his beloved Philoclea. Lord Byron in his Don Juan, had Don Juan disguised as a woman in a harem. Modern literature In Giannina Braschi's mock diary, \\"Intimate Diary of Solitude/el diario intimo de la soledad\\" (the finale of the Latin American trilogy \\"Empire of Dreams/el imperio de los suenos\\") the heroine Mariquita Samper is a cross-dressing Macy's makeup artist who plots a literary revolution to kill the narrator. Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn disguises himself as a girl at one point in the novel, not very successfully. In Anthony Powell's From a View to a Death, Major Fosdick's penchant for going to his room and donning a black sequin evening dress and a large picture-hat ultimately leads to his unraveling. In Terry Pratchett's novel Monstrous Regiment, he has an entire regiment of females (of assorted species) dressing as males to join the army, satirizing the phenomenon of crossdressing during wartime. In Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, √âowyn disguises herself as man under the name Dernhelm to fight in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields outside the city Minas Tirith. In Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness series, the main character, Alanna, disguises herself as a boy for eight years in order to become a knight. =As a theme= *The Masqueraders, by Georgette Heyer (1928); historical novel. Two siblings impersonate the opposite gender to escape persecution after the 1745 Jacobite Rising. *These Old Shades by Georgette Heyer; historical novel. During the reign of Louis XV, a girl disguises herself as a boy. *The Famous Five book series (1942) - Georgina wears boy's clothes, prefers to be called \\"George\\" and is pleased to be mistaken for a boy. *The Rose of Versailles (1972) - The female protagonist, Oscar Fran√ßois de Jarjayes, dresses as a man, but privately acknowledges her feminine side. *Johnny, My Friend (a translation of the Swedish novel Janne, min v√§n from 1985) - Johnny is a girl disguising as a boy. *Song of the Lioness - The main character, Alanna, disguises herself as a boy to become a knight. *Soldier's Secret - A fictional retelling of Deborah Sampson's life, who disguises herself as a soldier during the Revolutionary War. *Hana Kimi - A Japanese Manga, where the female protagonist, Ashiya Mizuki disguises herself as a boy to attend an all-boys school where her idol Sano Izumi attends. *Boy2Girl by Terence Blacker - Sam, the main character Matthew's male American cousin, is dared to go to school disguised as a girl as a challenge to prove himself to Matthew and his friends.

The 40-minute show (which is performed five or six times daily) started holding previews on November 5, 2006, officially opening on January 24, 2007. The music, composed by Robert Lopez and his wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the same couple that composed the music of Frozen and Frozen II, uses direct lines from the film, bringing the film characters to life on stage. History The stage musical Tarzan Rocks! occupied the Theater in the Wild at DinoLand USA in Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida from 1999 to 2006. When the musical closed in January 2006, it was rumored that a musical adaptation of Finding Nemo would replace it. This was confirmed in April 2006, when Disney announced that the musical adaptation of Finding Nemo, with new songs written by Tony Award-winning Avenue Q composer Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, would \\"combine puppets, dancers, acrobats and animated backdrops\\" and open in late 2006.Hernandez, Ernio. \\"Avenue Q Composer Lopez Co-Pens Musical Finding Nemo for Disney,\\"Playbill.com (April 10, 2006). Years later, Anderson-Lopez explained that she had written a compact 15-minute a cappella version of the story of Oedipus; someone at Disney read it and recognized her talent for condensing material, and offered her the opportunity to make a pitch for the Finding Nemo project. Tony Award-winning director Peter Brosius signed on to direct the show, with Michael Curry, who designed puppets for Disney's successful stage version of The Lion King, serving as leading puppet and production designer. Anderson-Lopez said that the couple agreed to write the adaptation of \\"one of their favorite movies of all time\\" after considering \\"the idea of people coming in [to see the musical] at 4, 5 or 6 and saying, 'I want to do that'....So we want to take it as seriously as we would a Broadway show\\". To condense the feature-length film to 30 minutes, she and Lopez focused on a single theme from the movie, the idea that \\"the world's dangerous and beautiful\\". The show started holding previews on November 5, 2006, officially opening on January 24, 2007. January 2007, a New York studio recording of the show was released on iTunes, with Lopez and Anderson-Lopez providing the voices for Marlin and Dory, respectively. Avenue Q star Stephanie D'Abruzzo also appeared on the recording, as Sheldon/Deb. Finding Nemo was the first non-musical animated film to which Disney added songs to produce a stage musical. In 2009, Finding Nemo ‚Äì The Musical was honored with a Thea Award for Best Live Show from the Themed Entertainment Association. When Walt Disney World reopened in July 2020 following the COVID-19 shutdown, all stage shows such as Finding Nemo ‚Äì The Musical, Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage, Festival of the Lion King, and the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! remained closed due to a dispute between the Actors‚Äô Equity Association and Walt Disney World over allowing performers to wear face masks and providing regular testing.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Shetland Islands Council, is a Category A listed building. History For much of the 19th century meetings of the local council were held in the Parish Kirk in Queens Lane. After a period of rapid population expansion in Lerwick associated with the growth in the herring industry, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built town hall: a site on the north Hillhead was selected. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh on a visit to the isles on 24 January 1882. That same evening Lerwick saw the first ever Up Helly Aa torchlight procession. The new building was designed by architect, Alexander Ross from Inverness, in the Scottish Baronial style and builder John M. Aitken of Lerwick won the tender competition with a price of ¬£3,240. The building was officially opened by George Thoms, Sheriff of Caithness, Orkney and Shetland, on 30 July 1883. The design involved a symmetrical frontage with five bays facing on Hillhead; the central section featured an arched doorway on the ground floor; there was an oriel window on the first floor with a pediment bearing a coat of arms above and there were bartizans at the corners of the building. There was a battlemented tower on the east side and a rose window on the north side. Internally, the principal rooms were a council chamber and a courtroom; there were also police cells in the building. Stained glass windows, designed by James Ballantine & Son, were subsequently installed in the building: these included a depiction of the marriage between Margaret of Denmark and James III of Scotland in 1469. There were also windows presented by the Corporation of Amsterdam and the Corporation of Hamburg. Panels with the coats of arms of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Leith, which had been presented by the respective corporations, were installed in a corridor. A clock, designed and manufactured by Potts of Leeds, was installed in the tower in 1887. The town hall was the headquarters of Lerwick Town Council until 1975 and has been the home of the Shetland Islands Council since then. The front steps, which had badly decayed, were replaced in spring 2008. Works of art in the town hall include a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Leonard Boden and a portrait of Charles Rampini, Sheriff of Dumfries and Galloway, by John Henry Lorimer. Services The town hall is used for functions such as marriages, wedding receptions, concerts, coffee mornings and evening events.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 8 April 2009. Sunny was created by executive producer Susan Bower in response to criticism that Neighbours was \\"too white\\". Lee came to the attention of Neighbours producers after she entered a competition run by Dolly Magazine to win a three-month contract with the show. Despite not winning, she was cast as Sunny soon afterwards. In August 2009, it was announced that Lee and Sunny would be departing Neighbours and Sunny made her final appearance on 19 November 2009. Sunny was an exchange student from South Korea who is taken in by Karl (Alan Fletcher) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Sunny was described as having \\"typical teenage insecurities\\", which made her appear abrasive, unfriendly and \\"snobby\\". Her storylines focused on her starting a relationship with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister), having her first kiss stolen by Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) and being the subject of a crush by Robin Hester (Benjamin Jay). During her time on Neighbours, Sunny was poorly received by television critics. Creation and casting In July 2008, Neighbours was branded \\"too white\\" by black and Asian viewers in Britain. A report found that many ethnic viewers felt they were under-represented in some of Britain's most popular television shows. In Australia there was talk of a 'White Australia policy' when it came to casting actors for top-rated soaps. In response to the criticism, executive producer Susan Bower made the decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts. She also decided to introduce 15-year-old Korean actor Hany Lee into the cast as exchange student, Sunny Lee. Bower said \\"I know we're going to get flak about this gorgeous little Korean girl who's going to be coming in next year, because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't\\". Hany Lee was chosen to play the role of Sunny after she was spotted at Dolly Magazine's \\"Neighbours' Next Big Stars\\" contest. Lee made it to the final ten, but ultimately lost out on the six-week contract to Mauricio Merino, Jr. (Simon Freedman) and Chelsea Jones (Tegan Freedman). A few months later, Lee was cast as regular character Sunny after producers saw her audition tape for the competition. In August 2009, it was announced that Lee was to leave the show. Producers confirmed that Lee would film her last scenes the following month and they would air in Australia that November. Following the news, Lee said that she would miss the friendships that she had formed with the actors and crew. DevelopmentCharacterisation= Sunny clashed with her culture's patriarchal society after being influenced by life in western countries and was considered to be something of a rebel by her peers. On her arrival into the show, Sunny was described as being aloof by television channel, Five's Holy Soap website. They also described her as being bright, confident, having an outspoken nature and being \\"full of contradictions\\". Holy Soap also described Sunny as having \\"typical teenage insecurities\\", which included being self-conscious about her braces and her lack of experience with boys. This results in Sunny having an abrasive attitude. British television magazine, What's on TV described Sunny as being initially \\"disappointed by the lack of excitement in Erinsborough\\", they also added \\"Sunny appears snobby and unfriendly. But Sunny's front is a cover for a whole host of insecurities\\". On her character, Lee said \\"She's come from an Asian lifestyle and culture so she's out there, she's got the fashion going on, the hair and make up going on and the attitude\\". Lee also said that she shares some similarities with Sunny, with them both having strict parents. On her departure, Lee said that Sunny took a \\"sacrifice\\" in leaving as she did not want her parents turning up and ruining everyone's lives, especially after Susan had recently suffered health issues. =Relationships= Sunny found it difficult to express herself to the other female teens on her first day in Ramsay Street and instead she chose to talk to 'Lost Boy' from the radio station, Pirate Net about her past and her hurtful relationship with her sister. Sunny and her housemate, Zeke Kinski, clashed on a number of occasions, which led What's On TV to ask \\"is their playful animosity fuelled by romantic chemistry?\\" Viewers saw Sunny finding herself unable to deal with her feelings for Zeke and their friends trying to encourage the two to begin a relationship. Zeke managed to get Sunny to open up to him about her insecurities and she started to trust him. They later began a relationship. Holy Soap described their relationship saying \\"After much to-ing and fro-ing, she eventually got together with Zeke\\". Network Ten describe Sunny and Zeke's relationship as being a \\"blessing in Zeke's life, and a great help to him\\". Sunny is also credited with helping Zeke to heal from his past and putting him on the straight and narrow again. Bower called Zeke and Sunny the show's \\"Romeo and Juliet couple\\". Of their relationship she said \\"They come from different cultures and she's got a year as an exchange student, so we play out the Romeo and Juliet thing. How far do they go for their love? Do they love each other? They keep clashing because of their cultural differences\\". Robin Hester played by Benjamin Jay, was a teenager who formed a crush on Sunny and tried to ruin her relationship with Zeke. Digital Spy said Robin \\"goes to drastic lengths to keep Zeke and Sunny apart\\" and Holy Soap and Jay labelled him as \\"creepy\\". Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so he could spend time with her. Lee named the storyline with Robin as her favourite from her time in the show. She said \\"That was probably the best storyline ever because it gave me a chance to show who Sunny Lee was\\". =Same-sex kiss= One of Sunny's most high-profile storylines was a kiss between herself and female character, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said \\"For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is what it would be like to kiss Zeke. Now Donna's gone and stolen the moment ‚Äì and Sunny's not happy, to say the least...\\" Previously a kiss between Lana Crawford (Bridget Neval) and Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) in 2004 received complaints from conservative groups. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna \\"impulsive\\" and Robbie agreed, saying \\"It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck\\". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance. The storyline received attention from the Australian Family Association, with spokesman John Morrissey saying that he was concerned about TV \\"normalising\\" same-sex relationships. Psychologist Dr Janet Hall praised the storyline, saying it allows families to discuss the topic. Susan Bower defended the kiss, which was shot before the Home and Away controversy, saying \\"Ours is a lovely tale about friendship. It's very innocent.\\" She added \\"If we were going to do a lesbian story ‚Äì and \\"Neighbours\\" is not against lesbian stories ‚Äì we would do it properly. This is a teenage romance story. There's nothing sexual\\". Storylines Susan and Karl Kennedy decide to take in exchange student, Sunny, following their step daughter's departure. On her first night with the Kennedys, Sunny calls into the Pirate Net radio station and speaks to 'Lost Boy' about her past and her relationship with her sister. Sunny believes that she has humiliated herself by talking too much about her life. She then decides to find out who 'Lost Boy' is, so she can confront him. She is unaware that he is really her housemate, Zeke Kinski. During auditions for the school play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and they are asked to play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are interrupted by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when the door is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship. Sunny offers to help out Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) with his love letters to Donna. When Donna works out that Ringo did not write the letters, Sunny has to tell her that she wrote them for him. In a spur-of-the-moment act, Donna kisses Sunny, grateful for her honesty. Sunny is upset that her first kiss was stolen by Donna. Sunny and Zeke's first kiss occurs during the play. Sunny struggles with public displays of affection with Zeke and she lies that she told her parents about their relationship. When Sunny finds that her grades have slipped, she decides to end the relationship and admits to Zeke that she did not tell her parents about him. At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) interrupt a kiss between her and Zeke. She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she is placed on the next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father about the nature of the conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine. After hearing Sunny on the radio, Robin Hester turns up in Ramsay Street to try to get close to her. Sunny believes he is just being friendly. Robin climbs through Sunny's bedroom window and takes a photo of her. He locks Zeke in Pirate Net's storeroom, so he can spend some time with Sunny alone. Sunny and Robin go to Pirate Net to see if Zeke is there and Robin pretends to find the storeroom key and unlocks the door. Zeke tells Sunny that Robin locked him in the storeroom, but she refuses to believe him. Zeke violently attacks Robin in front of Sunny, scaring her. Zeke apologises and Sunny eventually realises that Zeke had been right about Robin. Sunny meets Robin at Charlie's and tells him that she and Zeke have broken up. Robin confesses to locking Zeke in the storeroom and tries to kiss Sunny, but Zeke appears and tells Robin to stay away them. Libby accuses Zeke of writing Kyle Canning's (Christopher Milligan) essay for him, but Sunny reveals that she wrote it. Kyle was blackmailing her after he overheard Sunny telling Donna that her parents did not know about Zeke moving home. Karl and Susan make Sunny call her parents and tell them about Zeke. Sunny tells them that her parents want her to come home. Zeke tells Sunny that he will go to South Korea with her. However, when Sunny realises how much Susan and Karl need him, she tells him to stay. On her last day, Zeke organises a picnic and a performance at Charlie's from The Black Skirts. A few days after her departure, Sunny texts Zeke and tells him not to contact her again. Reception Sunny was negatively received during her time on Neighbours. Upon her arrival, the a Western Mail reporter quipped that viewers were going to tire of Sunny \\"quite quickly\\" and that she was \\"downright irritating.\\" Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture called the character \\"annoying\\" and thought that she had \\"no other layers to her personality\\". She added \\"As for expecting us to believe that perma-mardy emo kid Zeke would fall for her? Don't be daft ‚Äì he's the character most likely to push her from a tower. Let's hope her stay in Ramsay Street is short-lived.\\" In November, Deller called the storyline between Sunny, Zeke and Robin \\"ludicrous\\" and she was placed at number one of the \\"soap characters we love to hate\\" list. Deller cited her \\"continued presence in general\\" as another reason for her being there. During a feature on the best and worst soap characters of the decade, Sunny was placed at number eight on the worst soap characters list. Deller stated \\"Neighbours doesn't have a great reputation for ethnic diversity, and when they finally decide to introduce a non-white main character for the first time in years, they have to make her the most wooden, annoying, drippy character since Ned. Let's hope Sunny's failure isn't an excuse for avoiding ethnic minority casting in the future‚Ä¶\\" References Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional Korean people Category:Fictional radio personalities Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Sunny Lee"},{"id":"20843076","text":"Location within the island chain This article summarizes the history of the island of Maui. Its relatively central location gave it a pivotal role in the history of the Hawaiian Islands. Legend According to legends, the hero, MƒÅui, lived at Kauiki, across the bay from Hana. He caught the islands of Hawaii on a fishing trip with his magical fishing hook, but failed to pull them all together when his brothers quit paddling the canoe in which they were voyaging, so the islands were left spread apart from each other. MƒÅui was later persuaded by his grandmother to slow the sun down, so she could grow more food and dry her tapa cloth. MƒÅui agreed to help, so he stood on the summit of Mount Haleakala and lassoed the sun's ray legs and broke them off one by one, threatening to kill him if he didn't slow down. The sun obliged. Maui legends include the magical deeds of the Menehune. Scholars disagree as to the origin of Menehune stories. One theory is that the stories were borrowed from European brownie and pixie stories told by sailors or settlers. Another theory is that the Menehune actually were the descendants of Hawaii's earliest settlers from the Marquesas who were pushed into the forest by Tahitian newcomers. The Tahitian word 'manahune' refers to low-class workers who did the most menial tasks which, the theory goes, the second-class original settlers were forced to perform. In time the Menehune became legendary and were given magical powers to help the helpless and to punish evil actions. A third possible explanation is that the Menehune were later, non-Tahitian immigrants who were not permitted to live with or intermarry with descendants of Tahitians. Early settlement Polynesians settled the island of Maui in at least three gradual waves; the earliest possibly from the Marquesas sometime before 450 AD., then others from the Marquesas about 450 AD., and lastly settlers from Tahiti from 700 AD. The Tahitian arrivals introduced the core pieces of Hawaiian traditional culture: language, economic activities, the hereditary class system, land tenure, religion, and customs such as the strict kapu system that affected all aspects of life. Hawaiian oral tradition lists an unbroken chain of twenty-five rulers (the Mo ªi of Maui) beginning with Paumakua the first Ali'i Nui of Maui. Maui's oldest known temple enclosures (heiaus) are at Halekii and Pihana from about 1200. The structures were, according to legend, built by the Menehune in a single night from stones on Paukukalo Beach. More likely they began as small structures and were expanded as the prestige of the Wailuku grew. The last additions were thought to have been made by King Kahekili. Pihana, also called Pihanakilani and Piihana, was a luakini where human sacrifice was carried out. According to accounts written by outsiders, victims were most often kapu breakers or war captives. =Chiefdoms= Until the 15th century Maui comprised three chiefdoms: Wailuku, Lele (Lahaina), and Hana. Eventually all of West Maui was consolidated at Wailuku, with Hana remaining an independent chieftaincy. West Maui and East Maui permanently merged about 1550 when King Pi'ilani married the daughter of Hoolae, the 6th Alii Nui of Hana. From that time until conquest Maui was ruled by a single joint royal family (Hawaiian: alii). Piilani and his successors were known for the peace and prosperity that followed. They constructed a highway that circled the island along its coast; remnants of which still exist. They also built the island's and Hawaii's largest temple enclosure. Today it is called Pi'ilanihale, built on an older temple site from about 1294. It is about high and long. Other heiau were constructed at Olowalu and Waianapanapa. =Heiau and other structures= Many ancient structures on Maui are named in story but no longer survive. There was a fort at Ka'uiki Head at Hana which was the scene of several battles between chiefdoms on Maui or invasions from Hawaii. The last battle occurred when King Kahekili fought off a Hawaiian raid in the 1780s. On a small island at the tip of Kauiki Head a huge statue of Kawalakii was erected by King Umi of Hana to frighten off would-be invaders. The Hauola Stone in Lahaina Harbor was believed to have healing qualities; it is still there. Extensive archaeological research has been undertaken at Kahikinui on Maui's southeast coast. Several heiau have been located, as well as villages, and fields. Heiau in the Wailuku area include: Keahuku, Olokua, Olopia, Malena, Pohakuokahi, Lelemako, Kawelowelo, Kaulupala, Palamnaihiki, and Oloolokalani. There were at least three additional heiau between Kahului Harbor and Wailuku. There is a partially collapsed heiau at Keoneoio (La Perouse Bay.) In several parts of the island small shrines were set up, usually a single or cluster of standing stones where fishermen could pray and give offerings. Rarely walled canoe 'sheds' are still preserved. The Ke'anae Peninsula's taro field system is a prehistoric field system still in use. Olowalu Petroglyphs Maui has several petroglyph sites that have been variously interpreted as ancestral voyages, historic events, and religious stories. One of the best remaining sites is in the cliffs above Olowalu. Nearby Maalea had an extensive panel which was destroyed by a developer. Kaupo has little 'footprints' across a lava flow said to be the prints of Menehune. The Kula area has several sites on private land. There are some at Nuu as well. Unfortunately, vandalism to these sites has led to their closure or limited access to permit holders. =Land tenure= The twelve traditional mokus of Maui. Hawaiians developed a complex and effective land tenure system. The island of Maui was divided into twelve districts (Hawaiian: moku). with Lanai, Molokai, Kahoolawe constituted their own districts or were subdivided into many other districts. Each district was ruled from earliest times by a family and later by a chief's family. Each moku was divided into many community units (Hawaiian: ahupuaa) which ran from the top of the mountain to the ocean in a roughly triangular shape ruled by subchiefs. Boundaries were natural features such as streams, rock outcrops, or forest. Each community unit was subdivided into extended family units (Hawaiian: ili) that also ran from the mountains to the ocean, so each family had access to mountain forests, uplands, coast plains for farming, and ocean. Each district had a sanctuary (Hawaiian: puuhonua) to escape vengeance or penalty. Maui's sanctuary was located at Kukuipuka on Maui's west side near Waihee. After fleeing there, making restitution and waiting a period of time, the offender could return home. During warfare, women, children, and elders could go there and not be harmed. =Kapu society= The social system was called the kapu system. According to legend the system was brought to the islands from Tahiti by the priest Paao perhaps as early as 1300. The kapu system was rooted in the class system and religious practice. People were born into one of four ranks. At the top were the alii. Next were the kahuna, those of priestly rank who conducted religious ritual ceremonies, served as spiritual advisers, and healers. The third rank were makaaina, the commoners who worked the farms, built canoes, gathered wood, fished and performed labor. The fourth rank, kauwa or outcasts, were outside the system and lived outside the community much like 'untouchables' in traditional Hindu society. There were three main kapu (rule) types: fixed kapu, flexible kapu, and temporary kapu. Examples of fixed kapu were the complete separation of men and women at meals and that menstruating women had to live outside the household. Other fixed kapu related to the alii which set them apart from commoners and maintained their status in a society with few material possessions. Flexible kapu could be altered by the local chief. For example, certain kinds of fish could not be caught at certain times of the year. Temporary kapus were invoked for a period of days. For example, following a funeral, no one could fish for a period of time. The effect was to maintain order in the community. Kapu also conserved the environment by protecting plants and wildlife from overuse. The end result of the kapu system was to preserve the mana or sacredness of the totality of the environment which would bring about peace, harmony and stability. Kapu breakers disrupted the mana and jeopardized the entire community. Unification of the islands Kamehameha I (Hawaiian pronunciation: [k…ômeh…ôÀàm…õh…ô]; ca. 1758 ‚Äì May 8, 1819), also known as Kamehameha the Great, conquered the Hawaiian Islands and formally established the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. By developing alliances with the major Pacific colonial powers, Kamehameha preserved Hawaii's independence under his rule. Kamehameha is remembered for many reasons and one is the Kanawai Mamalahoe, the \\"Law of the Splintered Paddle\\", which protects human rights of non- combatants in times of battle. Kamehameha's full Hawaiian name is Kalani Pai ªea Wohi o Kaleikini Keali ªikui Kamehameha o  ªIolani i Kaiwikapu kaui Ka Liholiho K≈´nuiƒÅkea. Early European encountersCastaways= Oral tradition indicates that castaways, most likely Spanish, shipwrecked on the islands sometime between 1521 and 1530. Versions of this story are found on Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. In the Maui version several white men and a woman were shipwrecked during the reign of King Kakaalaneo at Kiwi near Waihee. The captain's Hawaiian name was Kukanaloa. The men married, had families, and became ancestors of some of the chiefs. Spanish ships sailed between Asia and Mexico or South America regularly. Analysis of documents purporting to record a 'discovery' of Hawaii by Manuel Gaetan in 1555 show that whatever islands he noted in his log were too far east to have been any of Hawaii's main islands. =Captain Cook= On November 26, 1778, Captain James Cook became the first European explorer to see Maui. Cook never set foot on the island because he was unable to find a suitable landing. The first European to visit Maui was the French admiral Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse, who landed on the shores of what is now known as La Perouse Bay on May 29, 1786. =Simon and Thomas Metcalfe= In 1790 an American maritime fur trader, Simon Metcalfe, anchored his ship, the Eleanora south of Lahaina. During the night, a Hawaiian named Kaopuiki and several accomplices killed a guard and cut the ships's cutter loose and ran it ashore. The next morning when the incident was discovered, Captain Metcalfe fired his cannon into the closest village and kidnapped several Hawaiians who told him that people from the village of Olowalu were responsible. Metcalfe moved his ship to Olowalu only to discover the village under a kapu for three days while the local chief celebrated a family occasion. As soon as the three days were over canoes from Olowalu flocked toward Metcalfe's ship to trade. Metcalfe, feigning peaceful intentions, waved the canoes around to his ship's landward side and then ordered broadsides of ball and shot fired at point-blank range, which blasted the vessels to pieces. About one hundred Hawaiians were killed and several hundred wounded. Metcalfe then sailed to Hawaii and, at Kealakekua Bay, began what seemed to be friendly intercourse with the natives. Around the same time Metcalfe's son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, at Kawaihae Bay, in command of the , a small schooner owned by his father. His voyage to the Hawaiian Islands had been delayed because the Fair American and its crew had been seized by the Spanish Navy during the Nootka Crisis. The younger Metcalfe's vessel was captured by Chief Kame ªeiamoku, who had been insulted and flogged by Simon Metcalfe earlier that year. Kameeiamoku had vowed to exact revenge on whatever ship next came his way, and by chance that ship turned out to be the Fair American. Thomas Metcalfe and the entire crew were killed except for Isaac Davis, who Kameeiamoku sent as a captive to Kamehameha along with guns and cannons taken from the Fair American. Another American from Simon Metcalfe's ship, John Young, was also captured to prevent Metcalfe from hearing about his son's murder. The two Americans, Young and Davis, commanded the cannons at the bloody battle of Kepaniwai. ƒ™ao Valley Trade with Europe and ChinaSandalwood= The first trading encounters with Europeans were independent businessmen on ships trading goods with China. Hawaiians had little with which to purchase goods except for foods and livestock, until the traders found Hawaiian sandalwood trees, that were valuable in China for incense. King Kamehameha tightly controlled contact with foreigners and centralized the sandalwood trade under his personal oversight in 1805. The resource was limited, however, and by the 1830s sandalwood became so scarce that logging stopped. =Whaling= Whaling ships plied the Pacific along the coast of Peru and Japan as early as 1818. Hawaii sat directly between the two. Lahaina and Honolulu became the main Pacific ports for the north Pacific whaling fleet. Since Lahaina had no real harbor, ships anchored in the Lahaina Roads off Maui's southwest coast for shore leave. By 1824 more than 100 ships visited Lahaina a year. As Hawaii's capital, it quickly drew enterprising immigrants who opened taverns, brothels, inns, and shops. Hawaiians paddled out to the ships to trade fresh fruit and produce for trinket trade goods such a beads, mirrors, metal implements, and cloth. At its height in the 1850s more than 400 whaling ships a year visited Lahaina. Whaling ships tended to stay several weeks rather than days which explains complaints about the drinking and prostitution in the town at that time. Whaling declined steeply at the end of the 19th century as kerosene and electricity replaced whale oil for lighting. Hawaiians also began to plant many types of crops which were introduced to the islands: coffee, potatoes, sugarcane from which rum could be distilled, pineapples and rice. Sailors were introduced to the art of tattoos. =Destruction of traditional life= The introduction of outsiders began the erosion of the class, kapu and religious systems. Even before Christian missionaries arrived in force, the system was weakened by decades of civil war among the island chiefs, foreign residents who did not fit into the system, and the introduction of new ideas about society, religion and government. The kapu system, human sacrifice and caste system in the islands appalled European visitors who condemned the entire culture. The rulers of Maui were influenced by visitors and the religious and social system was further weakened. Ultimately, the alii themselves ended the kapu and traditional religion. They could not foresee that by doing so they had weakened the foundations of their own power. Hawaiians were exposed to the Europeans' communicable diseases, including enteric, viral, and venereal infections. A series of epidemics, killed up to 95% of the residents, destroying the social and cultural fabric of traditional Hawaiian life. The new religion When Kamehameha I died in 1819, Queen Kaahumanu declared herself a co-ruler with his son Kamehameha II. She challenged many of the conventions of Hawaiian society, ending the kapu system. Heiau were destroyed, images burned or broken, and priests chased away. This threw the religious life of Hawaiians into confusion. Within two years the first Christian missionaries appeared, just as Hawaiians lost confidence in their traditional religion and social system. =Early missionaries= The first Christian missionary arrived on Maui from New England in 1821 when a Dr. Holman built a house in Lahaina and taught with some success, later moving to Honolulu. The missionaries developed a written version of the Hawaiian Language. Among others, Hiram Bingham I employed Latin letters that approximated Hawaiian sounds in English. The only exception was the okina, a glottal stop, which precedes some vowels in many Hawaiian words. The result was a twelve letter alphabet with additional vowel combinations. The first literature in Hawaiian was printed in 1822. By 1826 the final version had evolved by simplifying interchangeable letters b/p, k/t, l/r, v/w and eliminating several letter used only in writing foreign words. Hawaiians learned to read rapidly in their own language. In late May 1823 Reverends William Richards and Charles Stewart and their wives from the Congregational and Presbyterian American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) opened a mission at LƒÅhainƒÅ at the invitation of Queen Kaahumanu. Richards was permitted to build a stone house on the present site of Campbell Park in downtown Lahaina. He gradually left missionary service and became a legal advisor, diplomatic envoy and Hawaiian Minister of Education. He drew up Hawaii's first constitution. Stewart remained in the islands for two and a half years, but when his wife became ill, he returned to New England. He kept a journal of his experiences which has become an important source for the time period. Betsy Stockton, an emancipated slave, came with the Stewarts and began to teach ordinary Hawaiians. Her efforts resulted in the first classes for commoners on Maui and by the time she left in 1825 with the Stewarts, she had taught 8,000 Hawaiians. The missionaries set up a printing shop and began printing bibles and educational materials which supplied schools throughout the islands. The first stone church was built in 1828 at Lahaina called Waiola Church. The churchyard there contains the remains of many early foreigners and Hawaiians, among them, Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, the first royalty converted to Christianity, and Queen Kaahumanu. In 1831 the Lahainaluna Mission School, later Lahainaluna Seminary was established, publishing Hawaiian language bibles, and educational materials. The early missionaries came into direct conflict with whalers when they attempted to keep sailors out of the bawdy houses and to stop Hawaiian women from visiting the ships. In 1825 a crew attempted to demolish Richards' house for his efforts to keep Hawaiians and Americans apart. A small fort was built at Lahaina after a whaling ship, John Palmer fired its cannon after an altercation with missionaries about women visiting ships. Reconstructed remains of the fort can still be seen. The missionaries both altered and preserved the native culture. The new religious teachings and strict Victorian ideas altered many aspects of Maui's culture while their literacy efforts preserved native history and language for posterity. =Spread of Christianity= In the early 1830s a second wave of missionaries arrived and established churches in other parts of Maui. A congregation was established at Wailuku sometime before 1831 by Pastors Jonathan Green and Reuben Tinker. The minutes of the ABCFM gives an insight into the swift conversion of Hawaiians: \\"Until recently the chiefs have been regarded as something more than mortal. So when the chiefs are motivated by the Holy Ghost to embrace Christianity, their advice to join it has the force of law. So if told to attend or study, they did so.\\" Pastors reported attendance at Wailuku on Sundays of 3,000 by 1832. By 1870 Hawaiian churches had been established in 13 locations throughout Maui and all of them with Hawaiian pastors trained at the Lahainaluna Seminary. The missionaries taught Hawaiians and began writing the islands' history, which until then existed only as oral accounts. \\"Hale Pa'i\\" Article by Rita Goldman, May 2008 Missionaries believed they were \\"civilizing\\" Hawaiians. They tried to help Hawaiians become literate in their own language and English, and decrease drunkenness, sexual promiscuity, infanticide (exposing disabled children), gambling, theft, and murder. They attempted to replace Hawaiians' own religion with basic Protestant Christianity. They also introduced American notions about customs involving clothing, food, language, entertainment, education, hygiene and economy. 18th century In 1750 the last eruption on Mount Haleakala may have occurred from two vents on the south flank at Keoneoio above La Perouse Bay. It caused the abandonment of several villages at Keoneoio. After insulting Kamehameha I, Princess Kaukooluaole was ordered to be sacrificed at Pihana after the defeat of Kalanikupule in 1790. Poloahilani, a foster-sister of the princess, was sent to be sacrificed in the princess' place; the last time the heiau was used for that purpose. (Pihana was ordered destroyed in 1819 as part of a campaign against the old religion upon the death of Kamehameha I.) Near Pihana was a warrior training camp at Kauahea. Also in 1790 Kamehameha I set about to wrest control of the islands from Kahekili. With about 1,200 warriors and cannons and guns taken from Metcalf, Kamehameha invaded. He defeated Prince Kalanikupule in the Iao Valley west of Wailuku. The name of the battle denotes the \\"damming of the stream\\" by the bodies of the warriors killed. Kalanikupule and his chiefs escaped by climbing the pali and escaping to Oahu. Kamehameha gained ultimate control of Maui in 1794 when he defeated King Kalanikupule's army at the battle of Nu'uanu on Oahu. Kalanikupule was sacrificed to Kamehameha's war god at Papaenena heiau, built by Kahekili at the base of Diamond Head above Waikiki. With his death the Kingdom of Maui ended. In 1798 Kamehameha began a brick palace in European fashion as his capitol, but Queen Kaahumnu refused to live in it when it was completed in 1802. Successive rulers lived there until the 1840s when the king and his advisors began to spend more time in Honolulu. 19th century When the people of Maui came into contact with diseases for which they had no immunity and no effective treatment, they began to die in vast numbers. Smallpox, measles, influenza, tuberculosis, cholera, typhus, typhoid fever and sexually transmitted diseases decimated the population. Estimates range from 30% to 50% of the population died within a generation. The effect was catastrophic on the culture of Maui. The Hawaiian social system fell apart and outsiders filled the power vacuum. =Catholicism= Father Aubert of the Congregation of Mary and Jesus arrived in Lahaina in 1846 to establish the first Catholic parish on Maui. He and his early congregants faced opposition from the Protestant missionaries, but the welcoming attitude of Hawaiians son replaced initial hostility. Father Aubert's first meeting places were open air and under thatched roofs. An adobe church, Maria Lanikula (Victorious Saint Mary) was built in downtown Lahaina. In 1882 Father Beissel arrived at Makawao. In 1894 he completed the Holy Ghost Mission Catholic Church at Kula, serving a growing Portuguese population of cane workers. =Leprosy= In 1860 and 1861 church leaders on Maui noticed a significant increase in leprosy (Hansen's Disease) cases. Citizens became alarmed at what they thought might be an epidemic. A doctor in Hana told the Board of Health that in Canada and the patients were isolated from the general population, provided with food and clothing until they recovered or died. In 1864 Dr. William Hillebrand suggested a place such as a box canyon be found where lepers could be quarantined. A hospital at Kalihi on Oahu was used as a gathering place where those infected presented themselves for inspection. Those with leprosy were quarantined. Kalihi was only a temporary solution. Property was purchased on the isolated north coast of Molokai at Kalaupapa where lepers would have no outside contact. By December 1865 the \\"Leper Colony\\" was ready. Once the colony was established, those determined to have leprosy were forced to move there. Kalihi initially sent 104 people to the island. This was complicated because ships could not get close to the beach. Patients were initially shuttled to shore by whaleboats, which was dangerous and terrifying to infectees who had already suffered separation by force from friends and families. Eventually, they were forced over the side at gunpoint to swim through the surf. Patients were marched across the peninsula to Kalawao where they found huts and tiny cottages purchased for them in near ruin. Father Joseph Damien became the pastor of the leper colony, working from St. Philomena Catholic Church, until his death in 1893. Father Damien saw the difficulty of those afflicted by leprosy and was called to help them even though he was aware of the diseases communicability. He traveled regularly back to other island to report his work at Kalaupapa to the Catholic Diocese of Hawaii and miraculously did not catch leprosy for decades. Eventually, however, the signs of leprosy were spotted by the Diocese during one of his reports and he returned to Kalaupapa permanently. He provided the colony with support of all kinds until his death of leprosy a year later. His kindness and love will be remembered by the people of Hawaii for all time. His acts have recently been recognized by the Catholic Church and he has become canonized Saint Damien. The courage and service of his life and work among those suffering from Hansen's disease have inspired Hawaiians and others for generations. =Great Mahele land redistribution= By 1848 land rights had become so hopelessly confused that a land redistribution scheme, known as the Great Mahele, was established. Most Hawaiians lost their hereditary land rights. Sugar interests bought land and changed the economy of the island completely. Many native Hawaiians went to work in the cane fields instead of their own family small holdings. =Agriculture=Sugar cane By the 1840s sugarcane production had gained a foothold via what became known as the plantation system. Descendants of the old missionary families went into various businesses and used their close connections to Hawaiian royalty to arrange special concessions, including land ownership. Early planters tried to make a profit with small holdings; larger companies consolidated plantations. Alexander and Baldwin (A&B;) at PƒÅia was an early success. The Alexander and Baldwin plantation at PƒÅia stretched as far west as the ancient landing site where Kamehameha's war fleet landed in 1790. The plantation needed a port facility so a dock was built. Kuau was a seaport one mile northeast of Paia. Kuau Bay and Kuau Cove lie offshore. Immigrant workers Since there weren't enough native workers to cultivated the acreage, planters began importing Asian contract workers. The plan was for workers to stay for a period of time and then return home. The first workers came from China, arriving in 1852. To counter the tightly organized Chinese workers, thousands of Japanese laborers came to Maui starting in 1868. Koreans followed in 1903, and Filipinos in 1909. Between 1878 and 1911, nearly 16,000 Portuguese people immigrated to Maui. They came mostly from the Madeira and Azores Islands of Portugal, and included many entire families. Conditions on the plantations were terrible and the system ensured that workers always owed more than they had earned at the end of the season. Workers were more like indentured servants than contract laborers. About half the contract laborers returned to their homelands; the rest stayed to live on the islands. These immigrants forever altered the food, language, customs, and population of Maui. The imposition of the plantation system effectively disenfranchised the remaining native population of Maui. Foreign corporations and local bosses became the power behind the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Water In 1876 A&B; Sugar Company decided to bring water from the north side of Maui to the arid south central plain. They had a lease from the government of Hawaii on the condition that the ditch be built within two years. The East Maui Irrigation System still controls water from the slopes of Haleakala. This stimulated a competitor, Claus Spreckels owner of the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company (HC&S;). Spreckels received a second lease to any water not captured by A&B.; A third competitor, Maui Agricultural Company (MA) expanded alongside the others. A sugar mill at Hamakuapoko (near Paia) was built in 1879 to process Maui's increasing amounts of cane. In 1878 the need for improved transportation from sugarcane plantations to the port at Kahului caused Thomas Hobron to build Maui's first narrow gauge railroad. Operation commenced in July 1879 between the tiny landing at Kahului and Wailuku; it was formally named the Kahului Railroad in 1881. K.R.R. added passenger service and was extended to PƒÅia in 1884 where a new mill was to be built. Hobron was named postmaster and obtained the government contract for carrying mail to the plantations and towns it serviced. Pineapple In 1889 David and Henry Perrine Baldwin purchased land in west Maui at Honolua and Honokohau adding to property they already owned at Haiku in east Maui. They planted pineapple as an experimental crop in 1890. Pineapples did very well as a plantation crop and additional acreages were planted resulting in the founding of Haiku Fruit and Packing Company in 1903. Henry Baldwin did so well that he formed the Maui Pineapple Company. The ranch at Honolua had tried a variety of crops and added pineapple at the suggestion of ranch manager David T. Fleming. The operations were so successful that by 1933 over of pineapple were under production. =Government= In 1845 Kamehameha III moved his capital from Lahaina to Honolulu. Honolulu was increasingly the hub of business and transport in the islands and it had a fine harbor, which Lahaina lacked. Once sailors in Honolulu began to be prosecuted for drunken or disorderly behavior, the whaling fleet and moored off Lahaina at times 100 ships at a time. Queen Liliuokalani ruled Maui and the other islands until the 1893 Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. One year later, the Republic of Hawaii was founded. In 1898 the United States annexed the Hawaiian islands naming them the Territory of Hawaii. 20th century Bubonic plague stopped Kahului's development as Maui's main port in 1900. The shanty-town was deliberately burned to the ground to destroy the rats which carried the disease. The port was quickly rebuilt and a rubble stone breakwater was constructed to improve the harbor in 1884. =Agriculture= Sugar cane was grown on Maui's west coast in the area between KƒÅanapali and Lahaina. A short line narrow-gauge railroad, the Lahaina KƒÅanapali and Pacific Railroad (L.K.&P.; R.R. brought cane to the Pioneer sugar mill at Lahaina. The railroad closed in the 1950s when trucks were introduced. HC&S; built one of the world's largest sugar mills in 1901 at Puunene. MA built its own sugar mill at Paia in 1906. The next decades brought explosive growth in the sugar industry. The key to cane's growth was water. Sugar companies purchased water rights. Maui Agricultural Company built the Waihee Ditch in cooperation with Wailuku Sugar. The new Wailoa Ditch brought additional east Maui water to the plantations. Companies also began to drill deep water wells. MA also began pineapple plantation farming as an experiment and it eventually became Maui Pineapple Company. In west Maui the Honolua Ditch was reconstructed to the Pioneer sugar mill in Lahaina, supervised by David T. Fleming. In 1913 K.R.R. built a railroad as far as Ha{okina after \\"a\\"}iku{kahako over final \\"u\\"} and Pa{okina after \\"a\\"}uwela over an enormous trestle across the Ma {kahako over the \\"a\\"}liko Gulch, which was the highest trestle ever constructed in the islands at . In 1948 Maui Agricultural Company and HC&S; merged under the name HC&S; forming the largest sugar production company in the islands. HC&S; began to make significant changes to its operations including the replacing of the narrow-gauge railway it had owned since 1899 with trucks. =Government= Maui County was established by the territorial legislature in 1905, including the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokini (uninhabited), Kahoolawe (uninhabited), and part of Molokai, with the county seat at Wailuku. In 1916 Prince Jonah Kuhio, Hawaii's territorial delegate in the U.S. Congress, achieved passage of an act establishing Hawaii National Park, which included the summit of Haleakala. The first permanent ranger was assigned in 1935. The next year improvements were made to the road to the summit. Civilian Conservation Corps and Work Project Authority funds and workers constructed the first visitor center. The Vibora Luviminda trade union conducted the last ethnically based labor strike in the Hawaiian Islands against four Maui sugarcane plantations in 1937. The union demanded higher wages and dismissal of five foremen. Manuel Fagel and nine other strike leaders were arrested and charged with kidnapping a worker. Fagel spent four months in jail while the strike continued. After 85 days on strike, the workers won a 15% increase in wages, but no contract was signed. In 1960 Haleakala National Park was separated from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and expanded in 1969. The entire mountain was declared a federal wilderness area thereby protecting its unique character in perpetuity. =Air transport= Maui's first airport was built at Maalaea in 1927 on land the legislature purchased from HC&S.; Regular air service began in November 1929 for amphibious planes. Dirt runways were completed with convict labor in 1930, but were useless in wet weather. By 1936 the location and condition of the runway at Maalaea had become inadequate for the larger planes which were introduced by Inter-Island Airlines. In 1938 the Maalaea airport was condemned by the Federal Bureau of Air Commerce for its close proximity to the mountains of west Maui. Maui's only airport continued operations, but only for small aircraft. WPA funds paid for a survey for a new airport in 1936 at Puunene, but lack of funds prevented its construction until 1938 when it opened with one paved runway and others unpaved. A small US Navy facility opened at the airport for military use. After the end of World War II the military decommissioned the naval air station at Kahului, so it could support commercial aviation. In 1952 Congress turned Puunene airport over to the Territory and transferred all civilian air functions to Kahului. =World War II= After Japan's attack on December 7, 1941, all airfields in the islands were militarized. The military determined that the airport at Puunene was unsatisfactory and condemned land to build a new Naval Air Station in 1942. Puunene was also expanded as the war continued. Maui was involved in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a staging center, training base, and for rest and relaxation. At 1943-44 peak, the number of troops stationed on Maui exceeded 100,000. The main base of the 4th Marine Division was in Haiku. Beaches (e.g., in Kƒ´hei) were used for practice landings and training in marine demolition and sabotage. MA converted its lime kiln facility to a cement plant for the duration of the war. Thousands of former G.I.'s settled on the islands. Those who did not settle returned as tourists, which became the foundation of Maui's modern economy. =Tourism= Maui's first resort hotel, Hotel Hana, opened in 1946. In 1961 Maui's first planned resort community opened at KƒÅanapali on what had been part of the old pineapple plantation belonging to the Maui Pineapple Company on Maui's west coast. =Pop culture= In 1969 the first hippies arrived and settled in south Maui at Oneloa Beach. They introduced marijuana culture and established Maui's reputation for the best marijuana. Other 'hippie' communities were established near PƒÅia and on the slopes of Haleakala. They were not well received, and confrontations with authorities resulted in arrests and protests. Property ostensibly owned by Elizabeth Taylor on the north shore of Kauai became a naked hippy beach tree-house settlement. (There is an independent documentary called Taylor Camp filmed during the era.) It was destroyed by the authorities in the mid-70's. See also *James \\"Kimo\\" Apana *Alan Arakawa *Elmer F.

The Wii version was released on March 31, 2009. The game has been brought to Steam since 2007. The game was originally created for Windows by Awem studio from Belarus as a casual game. It has been followed by a variety of Cradle/Jewel Master games including Cradle of Athena, Cradle of Egypt and Cradle of Persia. Gameplay The main screen of Cradle of Rome The gameplay is similar to that of Bejeweled; the player must flip jewels/resources on a playing field to create matches of at least three items of the same type. As matches are formed, reserves of resources such as grain and wood are built up, which are used towards building the Roman Empire. Between rounds, resources can be spent on farms, taverns and other buildings to cultivate the commonwealth. The goal of each round is to form matches on blue tiles to clear them from the screen. Obstacles increase the game's difficulty; they include locked gems/resources, which cannot be switched until a match is made to unlock them. Each round also has a time limit, which is represented by a slowly emptying vase of water on the top screen. To help the player, several power-ups can be acquired, such as a hammer that can destroy any tile on the field. The game progresses with new types of gems and resources being unlocked at every new building built in Rome. Some buildings provide an extra bonus citizen with in-game bonuses if the player plays skillfully with the particular resource unlocked from that building. Reception Cradle of Rome was given a mixed reception by video game critics, and it received an aggregated score of 63% at Metacritic. IGN was disappointed with the game, noting that the game's manual did not adequately explain how the game worked. They also found that its electronic soundtrack did not fit the game's Roman theme. Their review gave the game a score of 5.9 of 10 and suggested that players purchase better alternatives such as The Quest Trio, stating, \\"It's another match-three game.

It is one of a few organophosphate compounds that are used as an herbicide. Most of the others are used as insecticides. It is used on vegetable crops such as carrots, cucumbers, peppers, and melons and in cotton and turfgrass to control annual grasses such as bluegrass and crabgrass and broadleaf weeds. It is often applied before the weed seeds germinate (pre-emergence) in order to prevent them from germinating. It is available as granules or an emulsifiable concentrate. Estimates place the total use of bensulide in the United States at about 632,000 pounds annually. Application rates may be relatively heavy (up to 22.6 kg/ha) when it is used. The EPA classifies bensulide as a general use pesticide. Application Bensulide generally is applied to bare soil, before crops are planted. It is incorporated 1 to 2 inches deep in order for the control of grasses and broadleaf weeds in agricultural crops, residential grass lawns, and golf courses. Uses Proturk Goosegrass and Crabgrass Control and Anderson's Goose and Crabgrass Control both have bensulide as one of their active ingredients, along with oxadiazon at a concentration of 5.25% and 1.31% respectively. Bensulide products may be used outdoors by homeowners on lawns and ornamentals, and by professional lawn care operators. Bensulide may be used on turf (primarily golf course greens and tees), on ornamentals, and for greenhouse and outdoor uses in commercial nurseries. 550,000 pounds of active ingredient are used per year, a relatively low value. Risks There are a few minor risks that are involved with herbicides that include bensulide. Generally, indirect exposure to it is non-lethal. Dietary exposures from eating food crops treated with bensulide are below the level of concern for the entire U.S. population, including infants and children. Drinking water is not a significant source of exposure. Risks are of concern for homeowners who apply bensulide, and for children entering turf areas treated with bensulide if label directions are not followed properly. EPA also has risk concerns for workers who mix, load, and/or apply bensulide to agricultural sites, golf courses, and home lawns. Chronic risks are of concern for birds and mammals; risks are posed to some aquatic species.

The game puts the player into the role of Princess Elise, a young, spoiled princess on a quest to impress a handsome adventurer into being her boyfriend. Gameplay My World, My Way features two key game-play elements. One of which is Princess Elise's ability to pout, which prompts enemies and the game's landscape alike to change to her will through the usage of \\"pout points\\". By expending Pout Points the player can do a number of things to make tasks in the game easier, including forcing enemies to drop more money or experience points, completing quests automatically and altering the game's current environment to fulfill in-game requests due to certain items and enemies only being in certain areas. Princess Elise has the ability to make an environment area barren, a grassland, a forest, an island, a fire pit, a graveyard, a desert and more. As the player advances in the game, Elise's selfishness is refined and she gains a variety of different commands. The second element is Elise's pet \\"Mimic Slime\\", which the player controls in battle along with Elise herself. Instead of leveling up via experience points, the Mimic Slime's abilities increase via mimicking the game's enemies. An example being that if it mimics an enemy with a high number of hit points, its own hit points will increase, and if that enemy has the ability to equip a certain piece of equipment the Mimic Slime will gain that trait too. The player traverses the game's world via an unconventional world map. Players choose a town area for the princess to visit, and once she enters, there will be a grid representing the surrounding landscape. One square has a town, one will have a gate, and the rest will be environment squares she can change. In order to unlock the gate, the princess has to fulfill requests from the town's mayor. Once she is in an area, the player can press the 'A' button to search for items and monsters. After a period of time the area will run out of items or opponents; the player can then use the princess's Pout Points to refresh the area, drawing more enemies there. Plot Elise is a beautiful princess who has been given everything she has ever wanted. Upon turning 15, she realizes there is only one thing in the world she lacks ‚Äì a handsome boyfriend. Thus, Elise orders her father to hold a ball and to invite every prince in the land. Elise meets her dream boyfriend at the ball, but he turns out to be an adventurer rather than a prince. To Elise's dismay, the adventurer tells her that she must become an experienced adventurer herself if she ever hopes to be with him. To the kingdom's surprise, Elise sets out to do just that.

As of the 2010s, zoning ordinances are standard in almost all communities, and occasionally the ordinances produce exclusionary zones. Exclusionary zoning was introduced in the early 1900s, typically to prevent racial and ethnic minorities from moving into middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. Municipalities seek to use zoning to safeguard the health, property, and public welfare by controlling the design, location, use, or occupancy of all buildings and structures by the regulated and orderly development of land and land uses. That sometimes inadvertently limits the supply of available housing units, such as by prohibiting multi-family residential dwellings or setting minimum lot size requirements, which may deter racial and economic integration. History Zoning began gaining prominence in land-use regulations throughout the United States in the late 19th century. Zoning is now widely accepted in most municipalities throughout the United States, and occasionally the anticipated goals set by the enactment of these ordinances leads to disproportionate outcomes. When zoning first appeared the vast, land- rich country upheld the notion that state powers should not interfere with private property. Also, given the country's predominately rural and isolated composition, most citizens were unconcerned about who their neighbors were at the time. Thus, early Americans largely disapproved of any early attempts at exclusionary zoning.Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 25. However, around the turn of the 20th century, a rapid urbanization process and influx of immigrants transformed the country. Middle and upper-classes consequently encountered much greater diversity than they had before making the intrusion of unwanted people into their neighborhoods appear more conceivable. As a result, many cities began implementing the first exclusionary zoning policies. In 1908, Los Angeles adopted the first citywide zoning ordinance protecting residential areas from the entrance of these undesirable community elements. Many of these early regulations directly debarred racial and ethnic minorities from community residence until explicit racial zoning was declared unconstitutional in 1917. Despite the unconstitutionality of such explicit measures, exclusionary ordinances continued to gain popularity throughout the country. Given the increased utilization of exclusionary zoning, the United States federal government finally addressed the issue with the enactment of the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act of 1922. This legislation established the institutional framework for zoning ordinances. It delegated land-use power to local authorities for the conservation of community welfare and provided guidelines for appropriate regulation usage. In light of these developments, the Supreme Court considered zoning's constitutionality in the 1926 landmark case of Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.. The court ultimately condoned zoning as an acceptable means of community regulation. Following this verdict, the number of municipalities with zoning legislation multiplied from 368 in 1925 to over 1,000 in 1930.United States National Commission on Urban Problems, 1969. Following World War II's end and the country's subsequent suburbanization process, exclusionary zoning policies experienced an uptick in complexity, stringency and prevalence as suburbanites attempted to more effectively protect their new communities. Many people had severed ties with the city and its unwanted elements as they searched for their suburban utopia. They feared that these very city elements that they escaped would follow them into the suburbs if left unchecked. Thus, middle-class and affluent whites, who constituted the majority of suburban inhabitants, more frequently employed measures preventing immigrant and minority integration. As a result of resident's newly found protectionism, the number of jurisdictions with such ordinances increased to over 5,200 by 1968. While well-off whites mainly inhabited the suburbs, the remaining city residents, primarily impoverished minorities, faced substantial obstacles to wealth. Many attributed their impecunious state to their exclusion from the suburbs. In response, a flurry of exclusionary zoning cases were brought before the Supreme Court in the 1970s that would ultimately determine the tactic's fate. The Supreme Court sided with the proponents of exclusionary zoning in near unanimity which virtually halted any zoning reform movement. The ability of minorities and other excluded populations to challenge exclusionary zoning became essentially nonexistent, allowing the policy's unabated continuation today. Legal frameworkDescription= American courts have historically most greatly valued individual property rights. However, more recently, concern for the general community welfare has begun taking precedence thus exculpating most exclusionary zoning measures. Communities are granted freedom to enact policies in accordance with community welfare goals even in the case that they infringe upon a specific individual's property rights. Courts also have regularly ruled as if municipal regulatory power emanated from their role as agents for local families rather than for the government. Regulation was equated with some manner of 'market force' rather than 'state force' thereby allowing the policies to bypass many questions of justification required for state policy enactment. For example, they did not have to prove that their policies benefited the well-being of society at large. Rather, they could merely enact regulations on the sole basis that it was their prerogative as an agent of the market regardless of any adverse effects on others. Therefore, exclusionary mechanisms were allowed to endure as complaints about the negative effects on the excluded population ultimately became null and irrelevant. =Case history= Buchanan v. Warley 1917: A Louisville city ordinance prohibiting the sale of property to African Americans was brought to court. It was ultimately declared that such racial zoning was unconstitutional and a breach of individuals' freedom of contract.Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 6. As a result, ordinances were no longer able to explicitly reject certain types of people but rather were now forced to resort to subtler means of exclusion. Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co. 1926: The Ambler Realty company accused the Village of Euclid of depriving their liberty with its ban on industrial uses. The ban on industry reduced the company's land value from $10,000 down to $2,500 per acre and undermined the company's right to govern its own property. Court officials, however, sided with the village and upheld the ordinance on the basis that it was a just and reasonable delegation of the state's police power. Municipals, the court ruled, are entitled to regulate community property when it reflects the best interests of its constituents. This landmark decision would lay the constitutional foundation for all future exclusionary zoning policies. Belle Terre et al. v. Boras et al. 1974: A group of six unrelated college students living together challenged a neighborhood ordinance that restricted unit residence to no more than two unrelated individuals. The case differed from the Euclid one in that there was no residential land use or structural type at issue. It rather addressed the constitutionality of directly regulating occupancy. Eventually, the court sanctioned this variety of ordinances. A community's pursuit of homogeneity was self-justifying, the court logic went, so long as there is no explicit class or racial discrimination. Their decision hinged on the view that an area's definition of the family is acceptable as long as a rational basis exists for the determination. It is not a judge's domain to overrule such legislative decisions. Implicit within the case's ruling is permission for exclusionary zoning regulations to attempt preservation of identity in the context of family compositions. Thus, given the previous Village of Euclid decision, municipalities were now granted the right to legislate both external property and internal inhabitant characteristics. Warth v. Seldin 1975: Low- income individuals and a not-for-profit housing organization sued a New York State suburb contending that the community's exclusionary principles increased their housing costs. The court ultimately asserted that any harm is a generalized consequence of real estate economics rather than a specific result of the suburb's regulations. Therefore, since the elevated housing costs could not be directly attributed to a certain exclusionary policy, the court ruled in favor of the suburb's ordinance. Specific legislation would not be held accountable for any overarching effects that it may have advanced. Therefore, exclusionary mechanisms could expand without threat of lawsuits from refused populations.  Examples Restrictions on the supply of housing units= Municipalities will often impose density controls on developable land with the intention of limiting the number of individuals that will live in their particular area. This process denies neighborhood access to certain groups by limiting the supply of available housing units. Such concerns may manifest in measures prohibiting multi-family residential dwellings, limiting the number of people per unit of land and mandating lot size requirements. Most vacant land is particularly over-zoned in that it contains excess regulations impeding the construction of smaller, more affordable housing. In the New York City suburbs of Fairfield County, Connecticut, for instance, 89% of land is classified for residential zoning of over one acre. This type of regulation ensures that housing developments are of adequately low density. Such ordinances can collectively raise costs anywhere from 2 to 250% depending on their extensiveness. With such high costs, lower-income groups are effectively shut out of the community's housing market. =Direct cost increases= Another means by which exclusionary zoning and related ordinances contribute to the exclusion certain groups is through direct cost impositions on community residents. In the 1970s, municipalities established measures decreeing developers greater responsibility in the provision and maintenance of many basic neighborhood resources such as schools, parks, and other related services. Developers incur excess costs for these aforementioned obligations which are then passed on to consumers in the form of fees or a financial bond. For instance, many newer developments charge monthly recreational fees to fund community facilities. Also, restrictive zoning regulations have made the approval process for development more arduous and extensive. The increased bureaucracy and red tape has meant that developers now encounter a myriad of fees for variance (land use), a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, a filing (legal) cost, special permits and planned-unit development applications. Not only do the fees diminish builder profits, but they also lengthen the development process which further drains company resources. Just as with the community resource requirements, these extra costs are inevitably delivered to housing purchasers. All of these fees accumulate and escalate unit prices to levels inaccessible for lower income people. MotivationsFiscal= The exclusion of certain types of individuals safeguards the community's public finances and the individual's property value. Lower-income residents generally demand more public resources than they contribute in taxes. Moreover, given the discrepancy between public service intake and taxation output, wealthier residents will need to subsidize these inhabitants, which forces more affluent inhabitants to pay extra taxes without receiving any direct additional benefits for themselves. Also, the entrance of lower- income residents threatens the property values of a community. As the neighborhood's median income levels decline, others may perceive the area as deteriorating and less desirable. Hence, the valuation of the unit may also experience a decline causing monetary losses to the homeowner. Property owners have been found to receive a payoff for the exclusion of low-income and minority households in the form of both increased property values and tax proceeds. Therefore, in order to prevent this subsidization process and to augment their own monetary assets, upper-class individuals enact regulations prohibiting neighborhood accessibility for specific groups. =Density externalities= Exclusionary zoning's assurance of lower densities precludes some potential deleterious consequences associated with increased population density. More people in a community can result in more traffic congestion, which may interfere with the original inhabitants' quality of life. Greater populations may lead to strains on potentially limited or vulnerable environmental resources such as water or air, if the urban form is designed in an automobile-dependent way. =Exclusion= Some suburbanites also champion exclusionary zoning policies on the simple motivation of excluding unalike groups irrespective of any negative effects that they may impose. Some researchers partly attribute the policies to class or racial prejudice as individuals often prefer to live in homogeneous communities of people similar to themselves. Others assert that race is merely a proxy and that upper classes and whites stereotype overall neighborhoods containing certain groups rather than the individual group members specifically. Such areas are stigmatized for their perceived correlation with high crime, low-quality schooling and low property values. Additionally, the entrance of heterogenous residents could have severe political ramifications. If enough lower-income individuals, who typically differ in political ideology, move into the community, then they may garner enough political power to overshadow the traditional contingent. As such, the original constituency is politically subjugated in the very community in which they used to enjoy power. Thus, whites and upper classes divert those groups for their unsuitable characteristics, perceived link with negative neighborhood qualities and threat to community politics. EffectsRacial/economic stratification= Racial composition of Chicago area (2010 Census) Exclusionary zoning initiatives reduce the presence of both rental housing and ethnic minorities in an affected community. Despite federal court mandates prohibiting blatant racial and economic discrimination, many of these less fortunate groups have encountered systematic obstacles preventing access to higher-income areas. Studies have demonstrated that higher-income and predominately-white jurisdictions generally adopt more restrictive land-use regulations. As a result, minority and lower-income groups are essentially locked into rigidly segregated neighborhoods. Residential segregation has remained constant from the 1960s to 1990s in spite of civil rights progress, primarily because of hindering policies that relegate certain groups to less-regulated areas. Accordingly, the prevalence of exclusionary land-use policies exacerbates social segregation by deterring any racial and economic integration. Restrictive from the standpoint of economic efficiency, regulations that limit density also decrease the total housing supply of a region. With the lowered housing stock, market demand for the units is amplified thus raising prices. Along with reduced overall supply, the insistence on detached single-family homes also increases individual housing costs as homeowners must individually account for many land improvements (such as sidewalks, streets, water and sewer lines) that otherwise could be shared among more inhabitants as in denser communities. Studies in Maryland and the District of Columbia find that higher densities cut per capita water and sewer installation costs by 50% and road installation/maintenance by 67%.Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p 6. Moreover, residential developers and homeowners must implement expensive housing features to comply with jurisdictional zoning mandates. For instance, setback (land use) requirements that are commonly used throughout the United States increase total unit costs by 6.1 to 7.8%. All land-use factors contribute to mounting housing unit prices in comparison to less regulated communities. The communities specifically administering restrictive ordinances experience higher housing costs, like neighboring areas. Exclusionary zoning affects the overall regional housing market by reducing the total supply of units. As there are less available units, the demand for the units will rise causing more expensive housing across the area. Ultimately, the additional competition and resulting costs accumulate making regional markets with strictly regulated housing have 17% higher rents and 51% higher housing prices than do leniently governed areas. Therefore, housing regulations evidently have significant impacts on both the specific community and overall region's housing expenditure. =Education= Education has been proven to be vitally important to human welfare, as it can promote higher incomes, greater labor market performance, a higher social status, increased societal participation and improved health. Along with individual benefits, educational attainment in the United States also has the ability to foster greater regional and national economic prosperity as an educated populace can better adapt to global economic trends and conditions. Nevertheless, there is a stark education inequality between various groups as the average low-income student attends a school that scores on the 42nd percentile on state exams while the average middle and upper-income student attends a school that scores on the 61st percentile on state exams. The vast differences in attainment cannot be accounted for by assuming inheritable group differences, as empirical research has demonstrated that simple genetic contrasts are insufficient to explain education disparities. Rather, environmental factors involving school quality also contribute to educational achievement. Regions with much economic segregation, which, as noted earlier, partially stems from exclusionary zoning, also have the largest gaps in test scores between the low-income and other students. Low-income students are trapped in inadequate schooling since their economic conditions limit access of high-performing schools and education. Across the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, costs of housing is 2.4 times higher for units zoned to higher- performing public schools than to those zoned to lower-performing ones. Therefore, exclusionary zoning serves to channel lower income students into lower performing schools thereby prompting educational achievement differences.

The character was portrayed by model and actress Anne Wis from December 9, 2008 to November 10, 2009. She returned to the show with Claudia Hiersche as Carla von Lahnstein from January 28 to February 11, 2010. Character history Stella is the cousin of Gregor (Andreas Jancke) and Christian Mann (Thore Sch√∂lermann) and she came to D√ºsseldorf in late 2008, where she searched for a new challenge. Stella first stalked Christian and Gregor when she entered NoLimits, she even followed them to the old helicopter hangar. When they saw Stella in a ninja costume, they attack her, ending in Gregor yanking the mask off Stella's face. Stella then revealed herself to the two shocked brothers, saying \\"It's me Stella, your beautiful cousin!\\" Later on, she applied for a job as an administrator for a hospital, but with her tendency to be too dedicated to her work, it doesn't work out. When Leonard von Lahnstein (Lars Korten) and his wife Sarah (Sina-Valeska Jung) met her, they soon made her an offer to work as administrator in their castle K√∂nigsbrunn. When she is interviewed by Elisabeth von Lahnstein (Martina Servatius) everything seemed to be great until Elisabeth tells her that they need the approval of her stepdaughter Carla (Claudia Hiersche). Stella and Carla had already met, without knowing who the other was. Carla isn't pleased when she finds out that Stella wants the job, because she thinks from their first meeting that Stella is harsh and not the ideal candidate to work in the house of Lahnsteins. But Leonard, Elisabeth and Sarah try to convince Carla that she should give Stella another chance. When Stella went to pick up her application, Carla asks her to sit down and offers her the job after all. Some time later, Carla falls in love with Stella (after being told by Gregor that Carla and Stella \\"are of the same kind\\"), and tells Sarah and Nathalie about it. Tension arises between Carla and Stella, seeing as Carla is Stella's employer. When Charlie Schneider tells Stella that she once had a crush on another woman, Stella falls for her, who is taken aback, about it and seeks advice from Olli. Olli tells Charlie to give it a try and Charlie did - and kisses Stella on Stella's birthday party, which Carla was present to watch. Carla was sad because she's in love with Stella, so seeing her with Charlie hurts. When Carla's horse Mr. Ed suffers an illness and Carla was also suffering because of memories of her family and Mr. Ed, Stella comforts Carla, then realizes that she reciprocates Carla's feelings - as in feeling the same kind of love that Carla felt for Stella. After some encouragement from Charlie, Stella goes to the stables to meet up with Carla and be there for her while the vet takes care of Mr. Ed. When the horse recovers, Carla thanks Stella and then Stella walks away a few feet from Carla when Carla said, \\"Wait.\\" Stella turns around, Carla walks up to Stella, and the two end up kissing and having sex in the stable, thus becoming a couple. On November 10, Carla and Stella left D√ºsseldorf to start a world tour.

The Portuguese government passed the Colonial Act in May 1930, centralizing the empire's administration and limiting the power of governor-generals. The settler population in Angola grew from 30,000 in May 1930 to 59,000 in 1931, but declined to 44,000 by 1940. By 1961 however, when the war for independence began, the population had risen to 170,000. In 1930, Portugal's ambassador to Denmark wrote to his superiors, informing them that Angolan separatists had participated in the Sixth Comintern Congress in Moscow, Soviet Union from July‚ÄìAugust 1928. L'Ami du peuple, a French newspaper, reported that a \\"Negro from the Portuguese colony of Angola... announced with a cannibalistic smile that when the hour of their liberation sounded, the black proletariat would know how to exact an unforgettable vengeance [on] the white colonists.\\" Economy In the 1930s, the Salazar government instituted tariffs on Angola to limit investment from Portugal's colonial competitors while investing in Angola's infrastructure to increase exports to Portugal. Angolans completed the construction of the Benguela railway in 1929 and opened it to transportation in 1931. The railway facilitated the exportation of minerals mined in Belgian-ruled Katanga through Angola's western ports. The South African Oppenheimer Trust produced and exported Angolan diamonds, making the diamond industry a vital part of Angola's economy for the first time in the 1930s. Angolans exported 11,839 tons of coffee in 1930, exceeding the previous annual export record of 11,066 tons in 1895. Salazar selected one factory in Angola to produce industrial alcohol in 1932. The factory, competing only with a selected factory in colonial Mozambique, derived its alcohol from molasses and diluted the product with petroleum to maximize its utility. Unfortunately, drought and locusts in 1934 compounded the effects of the Great Depression. Natives, unable to pay the colonists' tax of US$3.80, faced forced conscription and enslavement. Many farmers, indebted to settlers, auctioned their daughters for sexual slavery. British Consul General Smallbones explicitly labeled and condemned Portugal's conscription policy as slavery in 1930. Portugal's Governor-General for Angola and the minister of colonies denied the charge and Salazar maintained the policy.

In the official investigations by his command hierarchy for the massacre he testified that his soldiers had to kill them all because guerrilla forces were hiding in the village, and was acquitted, while it was proven after the war that his testimony was false. * On 24 April his 7th unit committed the Pyrgoi massacre where 368 children were slaughtered. * Men from the same 7th unit, under the command of Hans Zampel and Fritz Lautenbach committed the Distomo massacre, on 10 June, where 228 civilians were brutally murdered for retaliation, one of the cruelest atrocities of WW II; no one was ever tried for this war crime. * On 17 June 1944 Karl Sch√ºmers commanded the execution of 28 civilians and total destruction of Ipati, and the next day, the burning down of Sperchiada and the killing of 35 civilians. * After he was assigned the command of the 4th Panzer Grenadier Division, on 22 July 1944, the 8th unit of his forces took part in the operation Kreuzotter (5-31 August 1944) in a failed attempt to eradicate ELAS bases from the mountains of central Greece, , that resulted, among others, in the killing of approximately 170 civilians and the partial or complete destruction of dozens of villages and cities.

Influences  The Avenues was primarily created under the influence of the climate and region Kuwait is located in. Basing the architecture on the natural forms of the desert sand dune, rock formation and the sky, the neutral colors of the interior, and the open window ceilings brings The Avenues Concept together. Among each respective district there is a particular influence behind it. = Grand Avenue = The influence behind the Grand Avenue was to make the mall feel like it's a grand shopping boulevard, gathering European and American influence to construct the district, for example the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, France, or Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles, California. = Electra = The influence from Hong Kong's Kowloon, the district is heavily influenced by the bright lights and overall technology found in Asia. This is where digital retail is found. The concept was to make the shoppers feel as if they were walking down Times Square in New York City, or Tokyo's Ginza district. There will always be something fresh on display in this district, making every visit special and unique. = The Souk (Marketplace) = Heavily influenced by the country the mall is located, this district mirrors the traditional marketplace the Kuwaitis of the past used. This district is an interpretation of this region's traditional retail architecture, including narrow streets and a color scheme to match that of the desert. Involving traditional cafes and classic Arabic cuisines, this area encompasses the former Kuwait. = The Forum = The completely white modern space is influenced by the major cities in the world: Los Angeles, Milan, London. Offering shoppers a contemporary metropolitan shopping experience. = SoKu = SoKu (an acronym for South of Kuwait) finds inspiration from New York's bohemian SoHo district, and is reminiscent of ‚Äúedgy‚Äù city architecture, as well as numerous cafes and bistros, all designed to capture the attention of Kuwait's younger, trendier consumers.  Restaurants and Stores  There are many international and national-based restaurants and stores found in the avenues. Since Kuwait is heavily influenced by the British lifestyle, there are shops that has branched from England, to Kuwait. Shops such as Charlotte Tilbury, Jack Wills, and Marks and Spencer. Along with British brands, many American brand names can also be found in the mall: Forever 21, Pottery Barn, Tiffany & Co. and borders stationery and Toys Shop opened on 2020 February.In the first floor Borders store you can find Toys,Paperchase Ukbrand , Stationery and exclusive artist materials and often they run back to school.even inside borders smiggle shop also there.

History Shawnee Smith and Missi Pyle met in 2007 while filming an ABC comedy pilot titled Traveling in Packs. After completing the show Smith invited Pyle to join her in attending the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. While stuck in traffic, Pyle repeatedly stated that one of her dreams was to be in a rock band. Smith had been in three bands, including her punk-metal group Fydolla Ho with whom she toured the USA and UK, and agreed to form a band with Pyle so that she could fulfill her dream. Within the next year they were in Joshua Tree, California with Chris Goss recording their first album, It's OK to be Happy, at Rancho de la Luna. The band was originally called Dirty Byrd, but due to the name already being taken, the actresses moved onto the name Polly Speaks. Smith & Pyle was decided on after producer Chris Goss suggested it. The band officially disbanded in 2011 before a second album was completed. Smith stated in a 2013 interview promoting her FX sitcom, Anger Management, that she reached a point where she felt like she didn't belong on stage anymore and wanted to focus on her children and her television work. Genre Smith and Pyle performing at Universal CityWalk in 2008 Although there are other musicians who perform with the band, Smith and Pyle play instruments (both play the guitar and Smith occasionally plays drums and tambourine during live performances) and collaboratively write the songs. Most songs are written together except for \\"I Wish You Were Dead,\\" written by Pyle after a bad break- up, and \\"Sugar,\\" written by Smith after her divorce from ex-husband Jason Reposar in 2003. Shortly after meeting they began collaborating. At the time of their collaboration Dauzat served as a guitarist for Kelly Osbourne. Most of the songs written by Smith and Dauzat appear on It's OK to be Happy. Smith and Pyle stated in October 2009 that they had been traveling to and from Joshua Tree to write and record new material. They are also writing and pitching ideas for either a TV show or movie centered around the band. Pyle revealed in a blog on April 12, 2010 that the band had made official plans to start recording their second album in the summer of 2010. Similar to the first album, It's OK to be Happy, it will be recorded at Rancho de la Luna and will be produced by Chris Goss.

It is manufactured under the name Di-Syston by Bayer CropScience. Disulfoton in its pure form is a colorless oil but the technical product used in vegetable fields is dark and yellowish with a sulfur odor. Disulfoton is processed as a liquid into carrier granules, these granules are mixed with fertilizer and clay to be made into a spike, designed to be driven into the ground. The pesticide is absorbed over time by the roots and translocated to all parts of the plant. The pesticide acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor and gives long lasting control. The use of the substance has been restricted by the US government. Bayer, the manufacturer, exited the US market December 31, 2009.  Synthesis  Disulfoton is synthesized by sulfide formation of 2-ethylthioethanol + O,O-diethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate with beta- chloroethyl thioethyl ether.  Metabolites  Oxidation of Disulfoton happens rapidly and metabolizes disulfoton into sulfones and sulfoxides, oxidation to oxygen analogs and/or hydrolysis to produce a corresponding phosphorothionate or phosphate. Microsomal enzymes are being inhibited during the metabolism.  Mechanism of action  Organophosphorus pesticides like Disulfoton inhibit esterase enzyme activity like choline esterase. These types of pesticides can also directly interact with the biochemical receptors of acetylcholine. Organophosphates in general poisons mammals and insects by phosphorylating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme at nerve endings resulting in loss of function of the enzyme. This allows the accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic neuroeffector junctions, skeletal myoneural junctions, and autonomic ganglia. This refers to the type of receptors of acetylcholine, the muscarinic and nicotinic effects respectively. Thus organophosphates also impairs nerve impulse transmission. Disulfoton can be absorbed via ingestion, inhalation or penetration of the skin as it can be rapidly absorbed via mucous membranes. When disulfoton is absorbed, it will be distributed via the blood circulation and undergo hydrolytic degradation. This mainly happens in the liver or kidneys but in other tissues as well. Disulfoton is excreted in different metabolites via the urine.  Toxicity  Disulfoton is classified as a super toxic substance. The estimated oral lethal dose in humans is less than 5 mg/kg, which is analog to seven drops for a 70 kg person. Not only oral intake, but also skin contact and inhalation are fatal because of acute toxicity. Disulfoton is also very toxic to aquatic life and forms an acute hazard with long lasting effects. = Symptoms = Signs of disulfoton toxicity includes headaches, cyanosis, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, blurred vision, mental confusion, loss of muscle coordination and sialorrhea. Death can occur when respiratory arrest ensues from failure of the respiratory muscles. Other symptoms found in a patient with an unknown quantity of disulfoton were intra-alveolar bleeding, blood in the bronchus, edema of the lungs and swelling of the glomerulus. = Treatment = The treatment of the granular form of disulfoton poisoning should be with repetitive or prolonged gastric and intestinal lavage (washing out of the body cavity). Also charcoal and a continuous intravenous infusion of pralidoxime iodide in addition to atropine sulfate.

He is the winner of numerous international awards and has been listed in the top 35 world filmmakers in the book \\"Cineaste Uit De Schaduw\\" (Filmmakers from the Shadow) by Belgian celebrity photographer Kris De Witte. Rosebiani was born in a small Kurdish town of Zumar on the banks of the Tigris and was raised and schooled in the town of Zakho. At the age of 14 he along with the entire family took off to the mountains to join the historical Kurdish uprising of 1974. During the time he spent on the snow-covered mountains while often hiding in caves or in camouflaged shelters under the omnipresent Iraqi aerial bombardment, he tried his hands at sketching portraits and script-writing, drawing from what little knowledge he had acquired from reading superhero comics (Tarzan, Superman, Batman) and from watching spaghetti Westerns back in Zakho. Two years later (1976) he received political asylum in the United States. Rosebiani acquired the knowledge of filmmaking at NOVA community college in the mid eighties while managing movie theaters and making experimental videos for a cable television in Northern Virginia. Rosebiani‚Äôs film debut, \\"Dance of the Pendulum\\" (1995) a parody to exploitation in Hollywood b-movies, was lensed entirely in the house of the late Liberace in Studio City, California, doubled as a mountain cabin. However, Rosebiani's true calling was to bring the stories of his oppressed people to the big screen at a time when Kurdish cinema was still to be born -the only Kurdish film that had captured the attention of the West was Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney's Palme d'Or prize winner, \\"Yol\\" (1982). In 2001 Rosebiani folded his Burbank-based production house and headed to the liberated Kurdish region of Iraq (South Kurdistan) where he made his first Kurdish film, \\"Jiyan\\" (life). Jiyan was the first film made in South Kurdistan. It's about the aftermath of the infamous chemical attack of 1987, thus often referred to as 'the Halabja movie'. It was nominated for the Tiger Award at International Film Festival Rotterdam, and became a festival favorite receiving numerous awards and high critical acclaim, including four-star ratings by BBC World and The Guardian. Rosebiani's follow up were two documentaries: \\"Saddam's Mass Graves\\" (2003) and \\"Chemical Ali\\" (2004) both depicting Saddam Husseins and his cousin's crimes against the Kurds. ‚ÄúSaddam's Mass Graves‚Äù toured the United States following its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2004. Rosebiani's television productions include a sitcom pilot (3 episodes) entitled \\"Radio Citadel\\" (2006), and a dramatic series pilot entitled \\"House of Hope\\" (2014) about gender-related violence and women's empowerment. Rosebiani's narrative features, \\"Chaplin of the Mountains\\" (2013) and \\"One Candle, Two Candles\\" (Kurdish title: √äk Momik, Du Momik) (2014) opened in NYC to mixed reviews. ‚ÄúChaplin...\\" was chosen as NYT critics' pick (Feb. 22, 2015) during its USA theatrical run. ‚ÄúChaplin...‚Äù is the first English language film made in the Kurdistan region with a mixed cast of locals, Americans, and Europeans. ‚ÄúCandles...‚Äù was selected as a candidate for the 2015 Golden Globes Award. ‚ÄúCandles...‚Äù tackles domestic violence in a patriarchal society while depicting a headlong confrontation between the old school and the new generation. Rosebiani's latest work is the documentary \\"The 100-Day Promise\\" about the war with ISIS in Iraq.

It includes single-gender elementary schools and high schools for boys and girls. The boys' high school has 309 students and the girls' high school has 120 students. The organization also operates a preschool program for 60 children. Teaching philosophy Shaare Torah is affiliated philosophically with the haredi branch of Orthodox Judaism. Its stated goal is \\"to promote and foster the development of a Ben Torah, a young [person] capable of actively and wholesomely interacting with his fellow Jews and citizens\\". Student demographics Shaare Torah primarily caters to the Sephardic Jewish community of Brooklyn, but also has students from around the Tri-State area. After high school graduation Graduates are encouraged to participate in year-long programs at yeshivot and seminaries in Israel. Afterwards, some continue their studies in similar institutions, while others enroll in university, or go straight into the workforce. Some of the most popular universities among Shaare alumni, such as Brooklyn College and Baruch College, grant up to one year's worth of credit to students who study in Israel, allowing them to apply these credits to their undergraduate degree. History In 2009, 34 students at the girl's elementary school were injured when a sidewalk grate collapsed during a graduation ceremony. The girl's elementary school has about 300 students. That same year, the school closed due to the swine flu epidemic. In 2015, the school hosted a political rally promoting tax credits for parents of children in private schools. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke at the event, as did City Council Member David G. Greenfield. Athletics The boy's high school has athletic teams competing in softball, basketball, and flag football. The school is a member of the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League. Leadership The rosh yeshiva of Shaare Torah is Hillel Haber, a Syrian Jew raised in Brooklyn. Haber, who had previously moved to Israel for 14 years to further his study of Torah at Yeshivat Kol Yaakov, returned to Brooklyn to found Shaare Torah.

In the United States they were used mainly for supplemental heat for the passenger compartments of automobiles and aircraft. Some aircraft continue to use gasoline heaters. Operation First, fuel is brought to the heater using piping from a fuel tank, or taps into the vehicle‚Äôs fuel system. A fan blows air into a combustion chamber, and a spark plug or ignition device lights the gasoline/air mixture. A built-in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working. Outside the combustion chamber, a second, larger diameter tube conducts air around the combustion tube's outer surface, and a second fan blows the warmed air into tubing to direct it towards the interior of the vehicle. Most gasoline heaters produce between 5,000 and 50,000 BTU per hour. Gasoline heaters require electricity to operate. Heaters were made compatible with 6-volt, 12-volt, and 24-volt automotive and aircraft electrical systems. The heater requires routine maintenance, such as regular inspection of the combustion tube, and replacement of the igniter at periodic intervals. Safety Because gasoline heaters are required to be vented, special care must be made to ensure the vents do not leak into the interior of the automobile or aircraft. Combustion byproducts include soot, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and some carbon monoxide. An improperly adjusted, fueled, or poorly maintained gasoline heater could be dangerous. In aircraft, several gasoline heaters have been the subject of safety directives. History Gasoline heaters were commercially available on automobiles starting in the 1930s with continued use until the 1960s, when they were almost entirely replaced with heating systems using engine coolant. =South Wind heaters= First advertised for automobiles in the 1930s, the South Wind Heater was invented by Canadian Harry J. McCollum. In 1934, McCollum demonstrated his invention to the Stewart-Warner company in Chicago, and Stewart-Warner began production a short time later. By 1948, Stewart-Warner had produced more than 3 million heaters for use in automobiles, aircraft, and military vehicles. Southwind (Stewart Warner) made the Model M978 heater for use in military vehicles in the 1950s and 1960s. Stewart Warner Southwind heaters could also be found on 1940s Fords, through early 1970s Volkswagens. =Other manufacturers= Other manufacturers over the years have included Janitrol. One manufacturer now marketing current technology gasoline and diesel fuelled heaters is the Espar corporation, of Ontario, Canada; a wholly owned subsidiary of the German company J.

The firm was founded in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1891 as a partnership between Charles A. Reed (1858‚Äì1911) and Allen H. Stem (1856‚Äì1931), the successful partnership captured a wide range of commissions. The firm was reformed as Wank Adams Slavin Associates in 1961, and adopted the name WASA Studio in 2004. History One early work was Medical Hall on the campus of the University of Minnesota. They were, however, most widely known for their work on railways over the course of two decades. Through Reed's relationship, by marriage, to the president of the New York Central Railroad, they gained a high-profile commission for the construction of New York's Grand Central Terminal with the architecture firm of Warren and Wetmore, and the newly hired Alfred T. Fellheimer as lead architect. In addition, Reed and Stem undertook many significant projects for the Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway. After Reed's death, Stem continued to practice with Fellheimer until his retirement in 1920. Michigan Central Station, Detroit, Michigan The firm moved from Minnesota to New York after being selected to design Grand Central Terminal.Katy Stech, Manhattan Architecture Firm WASA Studio Files for Bankruptcy, Wall Street Journal (July 28, 2015). The Reed and Stem papers held by the Northwest Architectural Archives, in the Elmer L. Andersen Library, at the University of Minnesota constitute only a small portion of their output. Eight unique commissions are listed, and represent a sample of the firm's experience in non-railroad related commission work, namely residences and commercial buildings. The firm was reformed as Wank Adams Slavin Associates in 1961, and adopted the name WASA Studio in 2004.Christopher DeSantis, New York Firm WASA Studio Files for Bankruptcy, Contract Magazine (July 31, 2015). The firm's office is located on Broadway. In 2015, the firm--which had millions of dollars in debt and was facing several lawsuits from previous former clients--filed for bankruptcy and was granted chapter 11 protection from creditors.

Many of these depots bear common architectural stamps, and are likely to be Reed and Stem designs. There is also the possibility the designs for smaller stations were drawn up by the Northern Pacific's Engineering Department, based on the design elements of Reed and Stem. In addition to the major works, such as the Tacoma Union Station and the former Montana Division Headquarters at Livingston, Montana, these lesser structures like Ellensburg, Washington, probably include: Northern Pacific Railway depot overview, Ellensburg, Washington Northern Pacific Railway depot overview, Helena, Montana, circa 1904 Northern Pacific Railway depot, Staples, Minnesota * Aitkin, Minnesota, 1916 * Beach, North Dakota * Belgrade, Montana * Billings, Montana, 1909 * Butte, Montana, 1906 * Centralia, Washington, 1912 * Chehalis, Washington, 1912 * Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, 1908 * Fergus Falls, Minnesota * Garrison, Montana, demolished 2000 * Helena, Montana, 1904 * Missoula, Montana, 1901, Renaissance Revival style * Ritzville, Washington, 1910 * Sandpoint, Idaho, 1916 * Staples, Minnesota, 1909 * Toppenish, Washington, 1911 The Northern Pacific's Toppenish depot is now the Northern Pacific Railway Museum -- http://www.nprymuseum.org * Trident, Montana, 1909, moved to Three Forks, Montana, July 27, 2011, for rehabilitation into a museum) * Wallace, Idaho, 1902 * Yakima, Washington, c. 1912: The Northern Pacific built at least three depots in Yakima. The first when they began construction across Stampede Pass c. 1884, the second, larger wood structure in 1901 was alleged to have a clock tower, and the final depot in a style similar to that in nearby Ellensburg, Washington, c. 1912. The last was likely the Reed and Stem design. Another noted architect -- Cass Gilbert, designed the 1901 depot. This structure was later relocated to another part of town, and converted into an apartment building. As of 2010, it was still standing in Yakima, minus the clock tower. Because the Northern Pacific never installed clocks in a tower, instead they used their large Monad trademark (the ying-yang), adopted by the road in 1896. In addition to the 1901 depot at Yakima, Gilbert also designed the Northern Pacific's depots at Little Falls, Minnesota, Bismarck, North Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota.

Setting The majority of the book is set in the Caribbean and nearby regions during the \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\". It takes place mostly if not entirely after Henry Morgan burned Panama City (1671)Pirate Freedom, p. 252 and before the earthquake that destroyed Port Royal, Jamaica (1692).Pirate Freedom, p. 226. The rest of the book appears to be set in the early 21st century. The hero is genetically engineered to be tall, and at the time of his birth, monorails are common in the United States, so his birth is in the near future of the time the book was published or in a parallel universe. Reprinted from the January, 2008 (?) Realms of Fantasy. Plot summary The hero is named Christopher (Chris, Cris√≥foro, Christophe). He recounts his childhood and career as a pirate, interspersed with digressions about events in his later life, including the time when he is writing the book (as in The Book of the Short Sun). The following summarizes his story in the order in which he experiences it. Chris is a Sicilian-American. When he is ten, Communism ends in Cuba, and his father (apparently a \\"wiseguy\\") moves there with him to run a casino. Chris goes to school at a monastery, where he becomes a novice and helps a Brother Ignacio with the farm work. At one point, he notices that many of the people he knew are gone, Mass is in Latin, and no one wears a watch. Somewhat later, he walks away from the monastery. A farmer in a horse-drawn wagon picks him up and takes him to Havana--but the roads are unpaved and Havana is much smaller than he remembers. Chris lives by theft until he signs on to a Spanish brig bound for Veracruz, Mexico. He is raped twice by shipmates, but thereafter manages to avoid them, and he enjoys learning military seamanship. In Veracruz he meets an English captain, Abraham Burt. Then Chris's ship sails to Spain, where he becomes infatuated with Estrellita, the maid of a wealthy young married woman. Her master puts a stop to the relationship. He returns to his ship, but on the way back to Mexico they are captured by English pirates under Captain Burt, who takes him on to the pirate ship. They capture a Spanish slave ship, and Burt puts Chris in charge of taking it to Port Royal. When he returns, having freed a few of the slaves, he refuses to join in piracy and Burt abandons him on Hispaniola. There a French buccaneer (a settler in the wilderness) helps him survive. They and other buccaneers capture a small Spanish warship sent against them, and Chris assumes command. A \\"boy\\" on the ship reveals herself as a woman who Chris knew in Spain; Chris takes her to be the maid Estrellita, but calls her \\"Novia\\", meaning \\"sweetheart\\". They become lovers. After fights against the Spanish, Chris and his crew meet with Burt. An allied ship has captured a Spanish galley and its owner. The passengers had included one Jaime Guzm√°n and his wife. Chris deduces Se√±ora Guzm√°n's hiding place and finds that she is Estrellita; Novia is Guzm√°n's real wife and Estrellita's former mistress. Guzm√°n had beaten Novia because--she says--she too was in love with Chris. Though Chris is angry with Novia for lying to him, she still loves him and they reconcile. Chris rejoins Burt, and their fleet engages in successful and unsuccessful piracy, sailing around South America. At R√≠o Hato, Panama, they rob a mule train of Peruvian gold. That night one crew massacres the rest of the pirates and takes the gold. Chris escapes and finds the dying Burt, who gives him his maps to the treasure he has buried on the Pearl Islands. Chris and Novia marry in Veracruz. Chris runs into Brother Ignacio and hires him to take care of Novia while Chris reclaims Burt's treasure. He sets out single-handed, but is wrecked and on the last page of the bookOther than a glossary. is rescued by Mexican fishermen who have a radio. He makes his way to the United States and enters a seminary,Pirate Freedom, p. 139. then becomes a priest. He resists the temptation to visit the home where his child self lives. The Cuban Communists fall, and Chris heads to Cuba. He has realized Brother Ignacio was his older self. Finishing his manuscript on a plane to Miami, he explains that he plans to enter his childhood monastery as a lay brother named Ignacio, follow young Chris out of the monastery into 17th-century Cuba, go to Veracruz to meet him and take care of Novia, and eventually take his place as her husband and recover Burt's treasure. Religious aspects The book includes religious symbols (including the name of the protagonist) and experiences. It begins with Chris's declaration that he often reads about the lives of people who have sought God and found him, but that he has \\". . . either never lost Him, or I have never sought Him.\\"Pirate Freedom, p. 17 At one point, in response to a prayer of repentance, Chris hears the voice of God as an audible sound.Pirate Freedom, p. 193 Chris believes that boys should know how to fight and be willing to so that older boys can, among other things, defend themselves from molestation by priests. When he is a priest in an urban parish, he knocks down teenagers who cause problems in the Youth Center. In another parish, he reinstitutes the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Style Chris tells his story in an informal style reminiscent of Wolfe's Wizard Knight (narrated by another young American man), but slangier and more irreverent. His narration includes elements not usually seen in formal narrative, such as colloquial Italian (\\"alla grande\\"Pirate Freedom, p. 66.), profanity in Italian and English (\\"merda\\"Pirate Freedom, pp. 24, 66, 191 and \\"shit\\"Pirate Freedom, pp. 22, 62.), a private joke that he then explains,Pirate Freedom, p. 270. and capitals for emphasis.Pirate Freedom, p. 312. He also uses \\"parlay\\" to mean \\"parley\\".Pirate Freedom, pp. 96, 200. One trusts this is not the copyeditor's error. Reception Paul Di Filippo described Pirate Freedom as \\"remarkably straightforward for Gene Wolfe\\" and \\"rip-snorting\\". He praised the minor characters and the accurate depiction of the period, adding that \\"Wolfe also makes sure to substitute hard reality in place of any clich√©\\". Paul Witcover called the book \\"deceptively breezy\\" and \\"surprisingly dark\\", and said it dealt with deep Christian questions. For him it was \\"distasteful in many ways\\" but \\"a small masterpiece\\". He too regarded the adventure as \\"rousing\\". Di Filippo saw Chris as charmingly naive, \\"no matter how bloody his hands get or how many skirts he lifts\\". However, Witcover saw Chris, the product of genetic engineering who may not have a mother, as \\"a half-human monster\\" (a phrase Chris uses about himselfPirate Freedom, p. 147), largely unrepentant and lacking empathy. For him, Chris's only redeeming (perhaps in the literal Christian sense) quality is his love for Novia. The book was a finalist for the Locus Award for best fantasy novel.

The name comes from the means of transport commonly used by these women to travel to Dublin for this purpose. Trinity opened its doors to female students in 1904. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge, where women had for some years been admitted to separate female colleges within the overall university, both men and women would be admitted to the University of Dublin's only college (Trinity) and it was felt there would be no rationale to restrict successful female students from graduating to become members of the university like their male counterparts. In accordance with the long-standing formula of ad eundem mutual recognition that existed between Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge, Anthony Traill, the then-Provost of Trinity College, proposed that eligible female Oxbridge course completers be granted Trinity degrees, as was the case for men. The policy lasted from June 1904 to December 1907, when requirements for ad eundem awards were revised. The Board of Trinity College thought that only small numbers of women would take up the offer to graduate and that they would be Irish women who had studied in Oxford or Cambridge colleges. In fact, by 1907 Trinity had granted degrees to some 720 \\"steamboat ladies\\".[3] All had passed examinations at Oxbridge that would have earned them a degree if they were male.[3] The women were predominately students of Girton and Newnham Colleges, Cambridge and Somerville College, Oxford.[2] Money deriving from the degree conferral fees that female graduates paid during this period were largely ringfenced and were used to fund the purchase of Trinity Hall, an extramural hall of residence for female students which opened in 1908.
